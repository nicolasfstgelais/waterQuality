Virus Transfer at the Skin-Liquid Interface	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Understanding virus transfer between liquid and skin is necessary to estimate transmission during water related activities. Here, we modeled virus transfer from liquid-to-skin and skin-to-liquid. We performed human subject studies using three bacteriophages as pathogenic virus surrogates: nonenveloped MS2 and Q beta and enveloped Phi 6. Our study shows that transfer from liquid-to-skin is describable by a single model based on (1) virus concentration and (2) volume of liquid remaining on skin. Contact times (0.1-30 min)) and virus species had little-to-no influence on virus transfer. Likewise, liquid conditions (pH 6-9, ionic strength 10-550 mM) had no influence on transfer as shown for MS2. The model: accounts for both, virus adsorbed onto the skin, and virus in the liquid retained on skin. In comparison, virus transfer from skin-to-liquid was influenced by the wetness of the skin and by liquid type (water, saliva). 90 +/- 19% of the virus inoculated on the skin are transferred to the water when the skin remains wet compared to 30 +/- 17% when the skin is dry. The transfer from skin-to-liquid was 41% higher when the recipient liquid was water as compared with saliva. This study quantifies virus transfer between liquid and skin and guides risk assessments of water-related activities.

Some studies showed that DES can be removed by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, However, no one has paid attention to the formation of oestrogenic disinfection by-products (DBPs) and the persistence of DES in surface water remains a mystery. In this study, UV was found to be very effective in removing oestrogenic activity regardless of water quality. Three oestrogenic DBPs were specifically isolated by oestrogen receptor-based affinity chromatography and identified as 9,10-diethylphenanthrene-3,6-diol, cis-DES and Z,Z-dienestrol. Among them, 9,10-diethylphenanthrene-3,6-diol was proved to have stronger oestrogenic activity than E2, but it can be further photodegraded. In addition, DES was also demonstrated to be a photochromic compound, whose UV-induced intermediates can be transformed back to DES under sunlight, which significantly slows down the photodegradation of DES. This study solves the question as to why UV-degradable DES is still detectable in the ambient water and provides a deep understanding of DES removal during UV disinfection.

Fluorescence and Quenching Assessment (EEM-PARAFAC) of de Facto Potable Reuse in the Neuse River, North Carolina, United States	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The Neuse River, North Carolina, U.S., exemplifies a typical de facto potable reuse scenario, where drinking water sources are located downstream of treated wastewater effluent discharges. The study results imply that planned potable water reuse, whether in an indirect or direct potable reuse scenario, might provide better control over water quality than the status quo conditions. Using fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) measurements, anthropo-genic influence of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) discharge was observed in samples near the location of drinking water treatment plant (WTP) intakes, eight or more miles downstream of the WWTP, implying that anthropogenic compounds were not fully removed or degraded by natural processes in this reach of the river. PARAllel FACtor (PARAFAC) analysis supported a two-component model of humic-like and nonhumic-like dissolved organic matter (DOM). A nonmodeled anthropogenic feature was also indicated. Significantly, the quenched fluorescence of humic-like DOM (static and/or dynamic quenching) by nonhumic-like DOM-previously demonstrated for probe molecules but first reported here in a natural/anthropogenic-influenced system-offers exciting insight into studies of humic/nonhumic interactions with important implications for pollutant fate and transport, sensing applications, and water treatment. A molecular spectroscopic explanation for dual fluorescing peaks in amino acids and humic substances is postulated.

Hence, it is important to develop an eco-friendly and cost effective technology to treat the tannery effluent wastewater. Our present investigation on integrated approach of electrochemical oxidation (EO) of tannery effluent (TE) using RuO2-IrO2-TiO2 anode and titanium mesh electrode as cathode and followed by the biodegradation process (BP) of the treated EO effluent. Various parameters viz., sodium chloride concentration (NaCl) (1-5 g/L) and current density (10-30 mA/cm(2) ) are optimized. The agro waste peanut hull (PH) and rice hull (RH) are utilized as carbon source for biodegradation of tannery effluent. A maximum of 87% decolorization is observed at 5 g/L of NaCl concentration and 30 mA/cm(2) of current density after 135 min of EO treatment. The EO treated TE is further treated by BP with Pseudomonas stutzeri MN1, Acinetobacter baumannii MN3 and mixed consortia of MN1 and MN3. The 97% of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 96% of Cr(VI) reduction was observed after 72 h of BP with mixed consortia and rice hull as carbon source. Thus, the integrated approach of EO with BP can be implied for complete a decolorization and degradation of tannery effluent.																	2214-7144					DEC	2017	20						22	28		10.1016/j.jwpe.2017.09.008								WOS:000431411700003

Groundwater contaminants passing through the biowall are treated within the biowall or immediately downgradient of the biowall. Biowalls designed and constructed for the treatment of chlorinated solvents typically contain either a solid and/or liquid source of organic carbon to promote contaminant degradation by enhanced anaerobic reductive dechlorination. Common solid organicmaterials in biowalls include wood mulch or similar waste plant material, and common liquid organic materials are vegetable oil (possibly emulsified) or other long-chain fatty acids. Such biowalls then develop anaerobic conditions in the constructed biowall volume, and potentially downgradient, as dissolved oxygen originally present in the aquifer is consumed. This groundwater condition can lead to the appearance of sulfide if groundwater influent to the biowall contains moderate to high sulfate concentrations. Other researchers have presented evidence for groundwater conditions downgradient of a biowall or a permeable reactive barrier (PRB) that are altered in relation to groundwater quality, besides the desired effect of contaminant degradation or removal by precipitation. The objective of this work was to investigate with modeling the changes in downgradient groundwater species chemistry as a result of a constructed biowall. This was accomplished with a chemical species model to predict levels of sulfate and sulfide present in groundwater in close downgradient proximity to the biowall. The results indicate that downgradient chemical changes could impact a surface water body to which groundwater discharges. The model described could be enhanced by incorporating additional design variables that should be considered in biowall feasibility assessments.																	1051-5658	1520-6831				WIN	2017	28	1					55	61		10.1002/rem.21542								WOS:000423925600006

Spatial and Temporal Variation of Water Quality in the Bertam Catchment, Cameron Highlands, Malaysia	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												The spatio-temporal variability of water quality associated with anthropogenic activities was studied for the Bertam River and its main tributaries within the Bertam Catchment, Cameron Highlands, Malaysia. A number of physico-chemical parameters of collected samples were analyzed to evaluate their spatio-temporal variability. Nonparametric statistical analysis showed significant temporal and spatial differences (p<0.05) in most of the parameters across the catchment. Parameters except dissolved oxygen and chemical oxygen demand displayed higher values in rainy season. The higher concentration of total suspended solids was caused by massive soil erosion and sedimentation. Seasonal variations in contaminant concentrations are largely affected by precipitation and anthropogenic influences. Untreated domestic wastewater discharge as well as agricultural runoff significantly influenced the water quality. Poor agricultural practices and development activities at slope areas also affected the water quality within the catchment. The analytical results provided a basis for protection of river environments and ecological restoration in mountainous Bertam Catchment.																	1061-4303	1554-7531				DEC 1	2017	89	12					2088	2102		10.2175/106143017X14839994522740								WOS:000418398800004	28087920

Decomposing the Bulk Electrical Conductivity of Streamflow To Recover Individual Solute Concentrations at High Frequency	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY LETTERS												The ability to evaluate stream hydrochemistry is often constrained by the capacity to sample streamwater at an adequate frequency. While technology is no longer a limiting factor, costs and sample management can still be a barrier to high-resolution water quality instrumentation. We propose a new framework for investigating the electrical conductivity (EC) of streamwater, which can be measured continuously through inexpensive sensors. We show that EC embeds information about individual ion content that can be isolated to retrieve solute concentrations at high resolution. The essence of the approach is the decomposition of the EC signal into its "harmonics", i.e., the specific contributions of the major ions that conduct current in water. The ion contribution is used to explore water quality patterns and to develop algorithms that reconstruct solute concentrations starting from EC during periods where solute measurements are not available. The approach is validated on a hydrochemical data set from Plynlimon, Wales, showing that improved estimates of high-frequency solute dynamics can easily be achieved. Our results support the installation of EC probes to complement water quality campaigns and suggest that the potential of EC measurements in rivers is currently far from being fully exploited.

J	Zhang, ZC				Zhang, Zhenchao			Treatment of oilfield wastewater by combined process of micro-electrolysis, Fenton oxidation and coagulation	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												In this study, a combined process was developed that included micro-electrolysis, Fenton oxidation and coagulation to treat oilfield fracturing wastewater. Micro-electrolysis and Fenton oxidation were applied to reduce chemical oxygen demand (COD) organic load and to enhance organic components gradability, respectively. Orthogonal experiment were employed to investigate the influence factors of micro-electrolysis and Fenton oxidation on COD removal efficiency. For micro-electrolysis, the optimum conditions were: pH, 3; iron-carbon dosage, 50 mg/L; mass ratio of iron-carbon, 2: 3; reaction time, 60 min. For Fenton oxidation, a total reaction time of 90 min, a H2O2 dosage of 12 mg/L, with a H2O2/Fe2+ mole ratio of 30, pH of 3 were selected to achieve optimum oxidation. The optimum conditions in coagulation process: pH, cationic polyacrylamide dosage, mixing speed and time is 4.3, 2 mg/L, 150 rpm and 30 s, respectively. In the continuous treatment process under optimized conditions, the COD of oily wastewater fell 56.95%, 46.23%, 30.67%, respectively, from last stage and the total COD removal efficiency reached 83.94% (from 4,314 to 693 mg/L). In the overall treatment process under optimized conditions, the COD of oily wastewater was reduced from 4,314 to 637 mg/L, and the COD removal efficiency reached 85.23%. The contribution of each stage is 68.45% (micro-electrolysis), 24.07% (Fenton oxidation), 7.48% (coagulation), respectively. Microelectrolysis is the uppermost influencing process on COD removal. Compared with the COD removal efficiency of three processes on raw wastewater under optimized conditions: the COD removal efficiency of single micro-electrolysis, single Fenton oxidation, single coagulation is 58.34%, 44.88% and 39.72%, respectively. Experiments proved the effect of combined process is marvelous and the overall water quality of the final effluent could meet the class III national wastewater discharge standard of petrochemical industry of China (GB8978-1996).																	0273-1223	1996-9732				DEC	2017	76	12					3278	3288		10.2166/wst.2017.486								WOS:000417838300012	29236007

Spatio-temporal variations of water quality in Nova Ponte Reservoir, Araguari River Basin, Brazil	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												Multivariate techniques, like cluster analysis (CA) and principal component analysis (PCA), were used to evaluate the spatial and temporal variability of surface water quality in a large neotropical hydroelectric reservoir (Nova Ponte Reservoir). The dataset, obtained during the period of 1995-2011 from the Energy Company of Minas Gerais State (CEMIG), contains 14 parameters surveyed quarterly in 14 sites, at different depths. The CA grouped the 14 sites in three main groups: lotic sites, half of the photic zone sites and bottom sites. Statistical tests showed that only three parameters (total dissolved solids, nitrate and chemical oxygen demand) have no significant difference between cluster groups. The PCA results showed temporal changes of the water quality in all groups, illustrating modifications to the importance of the parameters over time. PCA also revealed the major causes of water deterioration from 1995 to 2005 were related to agricultural and livestock activities. Currently, the water quality parameters related to organic pollution are also highlighted. Generally, this study shows that possible optimization of the monitoring network should consider temporal variation of water quality parameters.																	1606-9749					DEC	2017	17	6					1507	1514		10.2166/ws.2017.055								WOS:000417947000002						
J	Wu, SF; Zhang, X; She, DX				Wu, Shaofei; Zhang, Xiang; She, Dunxian			Joint occurrence of water quality indexes in relation to river streamflow in the heavily polluted Huai River Basin, China	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												Effective joint management of water quantity and quality of rivers requires a good understanding of the interrelationships between these variables. This study aims to quantitatively evaluate the impact of river streamflow on the joint occurrence of water quality variables in the heavily polluted Huai River Basin (HRB). Using data from three representative stations, joint distributions were set up for two key water quality indexes, CODMn and NH3-N, for three different streamflow scenarios: low, medium and high streamflows, and the joint probabilities of different water quality combinations were calculated. The results showed that there was a significant negative relationship between streamflow and the water quality index, while the water quality indexes were significantly positively correlated. In general, the higher the river streamflow, the lower the joint probability of water quality variables under the three scenarios in each station. It is concluded that, in both the main stream and the tributary, high streamflow scenarios do help to improve the joint probability of water quality combination under a higher water quality grade, compared with a decrease under a lower quality grade. This study is expected to provide scientific references for water quality management and implementation of water pollution prevention in the HRB.				she, dunxian/B-4667-2018	she, dunxian/0000-0003-4660-3301												1606-9749					DEC	2017	17	6					1602	1615		10.2166/ws.2017.046								WOS:000417947000011

Simulation of multiple water source ecological replenishment for Chagan Lake based on coupled hydrodynamic and water quality models	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												Chagan Lake serves as an irrigation storage reservoir for the Qianguo Irrigation Area and an important ecological barrier in western Jilin. The coupled TUFLOW-FV and Aquatic Ecodynamic (AED2) models were used to simulate the hydrodynamic and water quality of Chagan Lake, and propose the water diversion scheme that could improve the water quality to reach Grade III and maintain the ecological water level. The simulation results showed a satisfactory agreement with observations. The total carrying loads of NH3-N, total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) for Chagan Lake were 1,147.6, 3,686.2 and 100.8 t from May to October. The range of the minimum amounts of water diversion to keep the water quality as Grade III and maintain the maximum ecological water level of 131.5 m for TN, TP were separately [32.60, 49.84, 57.19, 63.70, 70.91], [117.25, 135.26, 168.17, 190.65, 218.32] million m(3) and the corresponding reduction amounts of farmland drainage for TN, TP were separately [4.03, 0, 0, 0, 0], [73.08, 61.88, 50.23, 40.94, 31.98] million m(3) under the rainfall guarantee rates of 10%, 20%, 50%, 75%, 90%, respectively.

Simulation of NOM events in pilot plant evaluation of DAF/Ozone/BAC for drinking water treatment	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												Pilot plant testing is invaluable for ascertaining the robustness of water treatment processes against raw water quality events such as turbidity and colour spikes, whether it be for stress testing of an existing process or designing of a new process. Unfortunately, the natural occurrence of such events (particularly colour) can be difficult to predict and commercial humic materials generally fail to closely match the indigenous natural organic matter (NOM) present in the raw water. Therefore, it is highly desirable to be able to simulate NOM event conditions. This paper describes a simple brewing method that we developed and used in our recent pilot plant evaluation of a proposed DAF/Ozone/BAC process for drinking water treatment. Using this method we successfully prepared, by using fallen leaves etc. collected from the local catchment area, large quantities of a concentrated NOM stock solution with its specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA), when diluted, very close to the median SUVA of historical NOM events. The brewed solution showed broadly similar NOM characteristics to those of the raw water encountered during the pilot investigation period in terms of molecular weight distribution and fractionation. The coagulation behaviour was also examined for the spiked and non-spiked raw water.																	1606-9749					DEC	2017	17	6					1793	1800		10.2166/ws.2017.086								WOS:000417947000029

Simulation of Daily Flow Pathways, Tile-Drain Nitrate Concentrations, and Soil-Nitrogen Dynamics Using SWAT	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Tile drainage significantly alters flow and nutrient pathways and reliable simulation at this scale is needed for effective planning of nutrient reduction strategies. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) has been widely utilized for prediction of flow and nutrient loads, but few applications have evaluated the model's ability to simulate pathway-specific flow components or nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) concentrations in tile-drained watersheds at the daily time step. The objectives of this study were to develop and calibrate SWAT models for small, tile-drained watersheds, evaluate model performance for simulation of flow components and NO3-N concentration at daily intervals, and evaluate simulated soil-nitrogen dynamics. Model evaluation revealed that it is possible to meet accepted performance criteria for simulation of monthly total flow, subsurface flow (SSF), and NO3-N loads while obtaining daily surface runoff (SURQ), SSF, and NO3-N concentrations that are not satisfactory. This limits model utility for simulating best management practices (BMPs) and compliance with water quality standards. Although SWAT simulates the soil N-cycle and most predicted fluxes were within ranges reported in agronomic studies, improvements to algorithms for soil-N processes are needed. Variability in N fluxes is extreme and better parameterization and constraint, through use of more detailed agronomic data, would also improve NO3-N simulation in SWAT.

Evaluation of Existing and Modified Wetland Equations in the SWAT Model	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												The ability to accurately simulate flow and nutrient removal in treatment wetlands within an agricultural, watershed-scale model is needed to develop effective plans for meeting nutrient reduction goals associated with protection of drinking water supplies and reduction of the Gulf of Mexico hypoxic zone. The objectives of this study were to incorporate new equations for wetland hydrology and nutrient removal in Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), compare model performance using original and improved equations, and evaluate the ramifications of errors in watershed and tile drain simulation on prediction of NO3-N dynamics in wetlands. The modified equations produced Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency values of 0.88 to 0.99 for daily NO3-N load predictions, and percent bias values generally less than 6%. However, statistical improvement over the original equations was marginal and both old and new equations provided accurate simulations. The new equations reduce the model's dependence on detailed monitoring data and hydrologic calibration. Additionally, the modified equations increase SWAT's versatility by incorporating a weir equationand an irreducible nutrient concentration and temperature coefficient. Model improvements enhance the utility of SWAT for simulating flow and nutrients in wetlands and other impoundments, although performance is limited by the accuracy of inflow and NO3-N predictions from the contributing watershed.

To explore this balance, we developed a multi-objective decision support system for allocating BMP type and placement by coupling the Soil and Water Assessment Tool with a nondominated sorted genetic algorithm that minimizes total phosphorus (TP) yields from agricultural hydrologic response units (HRUs) and costs, while using stakeholder BMP familiarity as a constraint; conventional tillage, no tillage, nutrient management, riparian buffers, and contour cropping were explored. Using constraints representing current conditions, the optimization resulted in 59.6 to 81.0% reduction in agricultural TP yield from HRUs at costs ranging between US $0.8 and US $5.3 million. The constrained optimization tended to select mostly single BMPs or at most two BMPs for a given HRU due to these BMPs having higher acceptability to stakeholders. In contrast, the unconstrained case, representing full familiarity, selected 2- and 3-BMP applications. There was little difference in costs between the constrained and unconstrained cases below an 80% TP yield reduction; however, significant differences were found at larger reductions, supporting the value of stakeholder education and extension efforts.

We used the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to investigate how natural gas development could impact streamflow and sediment, total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorous (TP) loadings in the upper Delaware River Basin (DRB), a relatively undeveloped watershed of 7,950km(2) that lies above the Marcellus Shale formation. If gas development was permitted, our projections show the DRB could experience development of over 600 well pads to extract natural gas at build out, which, with supporting infrastructure (roads, gathering pipelines), could convert over 5,000ha from existing land uses in the study area. In subbasins with development activity we found sediment, TN, and TP yields could increase by an average of 15, 0.08, and 0.03kg/ha/yr, respectively (an increase of 2, 3, and 15%, respectively) for each one percent of subbasin land area converted into natural gas infrastructure. At the study area outlet on the Delaware River at Port Jervis, New York, we found increases in the annual average streamflow and sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus loads of up to 0.01, 0.2, 0.2, and 1%, respectively, for a rapid development year, and 0.08, 1.3, 2.0, and 11%, respectively, for the full development scenario.

Specifically, the three accompanying studies describe the water quality implications of adopting the three biofuel-cropping systems via large-scale conversion of cropland or targeting to marginal lands for three smaller watersheds located in the western or eastern Corn Belt, or across the Upper Mississippi and Ohio-Tennessee River Basins. Other results such as climate change related impacts for two eastern Corn Belt watersheds are also discussed. These studies are supported by the CenUSA Bioenergy coordinated agricultural project funded by the USDA to develop a regional system for producing cellulosic biofuels. A description of the evolving federal policy related to cellulosic biofuel production and consumption is provided as are other potential drivers for encouraging the adoption of stover removal, switchgrass, and Miscanthus as perennial feedstocks. Findings from the SWAT studies and their implications for environmental and economic performance in their respective agroecosystems are discussed, and commonalities and divergences in results are identified. The potential for policy design to improve the performance of these systems based on the findings of these modeling studies, and continuing research needs and directions for improved policy design are discussed.

We quantify ecosystem services of bioenergy-based land use change and estimate the potential changes of ecosystem services due to climate change projections. We considered 17 bioenergy-based scenarios with Miscanthus, switchgrass, and corn stover as candidate bioenergy feedstock. Soil and Water Assessment Tool simulations of biomass/grain yield, hydrology, and water quality were used to quantify ecosystem services freshwater provision (FWPI), food (FPI) and fuel provision, erosion regulation (ERI), and flood regulation (FRI). Nine climate projections from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase-3 were used to quantify the potential climate change variability. Overall, ecosystem services of heavily row cropped Wildcat Creek watershed were lower than St. Joseph River watershed which had more forested and perennial pasture lands. The provision of ecosystem services for both study watersheds were improved with bioenergy production scenarios. Miscanthus in marginal lands of Wildcat Creek (9% of total area) increased FWPI by 27% and ERI by 14% and decreased FPI by 12% from the baseline. For St. Joseph watershed, Miscanthus in marginal lands (18% of total area) improved FWPI by 87% and ERI by 23% while decreasing FPI by 46%. The relative impacts of land use change were considerably larger than climate change impacts in this paper.

Assessment of Bioenergy Cropping Scenarios for the Boone River Watershed in North Central Iowa, United States	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Several biofuel cropping scenarios were evaluated with an improved version of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) as part of the CenUSA Bioenergy consortium for the Boone River Watershed (BRW), which drains about 2,370km(2) in north central Iowa. The adoption of corn stover removal, switchgrass, and/or Miscanthus biofuel cropping systems was simulated to assess the impact of cellulosic biofuel production on pollutant losses. The stover removal results indicate removal of 20 or 50% of corn stover in the BRW would have negligible effects on streamflow and relatively minor or negligible effects on sediment and nutrient losses, even on higher sloped cropland. Complete cropland conversion into switchgrass or Miscanthus, resulted in reductions of streamflow, sediment, nitrate, and other pollutants ranging between 23-99%. The predicted nitrate reductions due to Miscanthus adoption were over two times greater compared to switchgrass, with the largest impacts occurring for tile-drained cropland. Targeting of switchgrass or Miscanthus on cropland 2% slope or 7% slope revealed a disproportionate amount of sediment and sediment-bound nutrient reductions could be obtained by protecting these relatively small areas of higher sloped cropland. Overall, the results indicate that all biofuel cropping systems could be effectively implemented in the BRW, with the most robust approach being corn stover removal adopted on tile-drained cropland in combination with a perennial biofuel crop on higher sloped landscapes.

To address the water quality implications of increased biofuel production, biofuel scenarios were tested with a Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model revision featuring improved biofuel crop representation. Scenarios included corn stover removal and the inclusion of two perennial bioenergy crops, switchgrass and Miscanthus, grown on marginal lands (slopes >2% and erosion rates >2 t/ha) and nonmarginal lands. The SWAT model estimates show water quality is not very sensitive to stover removal. The perennial bioenergy crops reduce simulated sediment, nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) yields by up to 60%. Simulated sediment and P reductions in marginal lands were generally twice that occurring in the nonmarginal lands. The highest unit area reductions of N occurred in the less sloping tile-drained lands. Productivity showed corn grain yield was independent from stover removal, while yields of the two perennial bioenergy crops were similar in the marginal and nonmarginal lands. The results suggest planning for biofuel production in the Corn Belt could include the removal of stover in productive corn areas, and the planting of perennial bioenergy crops in marginal land and in low-sloped tile-drained areas characterized by high N pollution.

Assessing Parameter Uncertainty of a Semi-Distributed Hydrology Model for a Shallow Aquifer Dominated Environmental System	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												This paper examines the performance of a semi-distributed hydrology model (i.e., Soil and Water Assessment Tool [SWAT]) using Sequential Uncertainty FItting (SUFI-2), generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE), parameter solution (ParaSol), and particle swarm optimization (PSO). We applied SWAT to the Waccamaw watershed, a shallow aquifer dominated Coastal Plain watershed in the Southeastern United States (U.S.). The model was calibrated (2003-2005) and validated (2006-2007) at two U.S. Geological Survey gaging stations, using significant parameters related to surface hydrology, hydrogeology, hydraulics, and physical properties. SWAT performed best during intervals with wet and normal antecedent conditions with varying sensitivity to effluent channel shape and characteristics. In addition, the calibration of all algorithms depended mostly on Manning's n-value for the tributary channels as the surface friction resistance factor to generate runoff. SUFI-2 and PSO simulated the same relative probability distribution tails to those observed at an upstream outlet, while all methods (except ParaSol) exhibited longer tails at a downstream outlet. The ParaSol model exhibited large skewness suggesting a global search algorithm was less capable of characterizing parameter uncertainty. Our findings provide insights regarding parameter sensitivity and uncertainty as well as modeling diagnostic analysis that can improve hydrologic theory and prediction in complex watersheds.

J	Cording, A; Hurley, S; Whitney, D				Cording, Amanda; Hurley, Stephanie; Whitney, David			Monitoring Methods and Designs for Evaluating Bioretention Performance	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												Roadside bioretention systems, also known as green streets are becoming increasingly popular, and have widespread potential to reduce pollutant loads coming from road runoff. However, the installation of these systems is outpacing the research regarding the comparative effectiveness of specific design features. Monitoring is a required component of many stormwater regulatory programs, and can provide vital feedback to designers and engineers, lower costs, and determine long-term effectiveness and maintenance requirements, yet very few bioretention systems are monitored. For professionals that are interested in performance assessment, there are very few descriptions of monitoring infrastructure for small drainage areas that are detailed enough to replicate during new bioretention construction projects. This research describes the innovative infrastructure used at the University of Vermont (UVM) Bioretention Laboratory to accurately measure pollutant mass load reduction by roadside bioretention systems. The inflow and outflow monitoring infrastructure designs are provided in enough detail to be adapted and/or replicated in other field settings. The steps taken to integrate the infrastructure into new construction are also provided. Ninety degree v-notch and compound weirs were installed at the inflow and outflow of eight bioretention systems, respectively. Differential pressure transducers related water height to flow rate. A time-based discrete sampling methodology was tested and found to adequately sample multiple points throughout the inflow and outflow hydrographs. This allowed for the comparison of pollutant mass removal among different bioretention designs on an equal volume basis.

Effect of Artificial Circulation on the Removal Kinetics of Cyanobacteria in a Hypereutrophic Shallow Lake	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												This study consisted of two parts. First, pre-aeration tests were conducted to assess the space-time variability of water quality in a shallow lake. Chlorophyll-a concentration and cyanobacteria cell density varied from 40 to 80 mu g L-1 and 0.5-2.0 x 10(6) cells/mL, respectively. In the second and major part of the study, aeration tests were carried out to investigate the influence of artificial circulation on the flow hydrodynamics and water quality. Comparison of the measurements taken inside and outside the bubble plumes showed that artificial circulation promotes a faster decay of chlorophyll-a concentration over time. First-order kinetics fitted well the time-variation of depth-averaged chlorophyll-a, cyanobacteria, and pheophytin-a. The net reduction rate of chlorophyll-a and cyanobacteria could be described as a function of a dimensionless parameter beta that controls bubble plume hydrodynamics or, alternatively, as a function of the rate of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy epsilon. This net reduction rate of chlorophyll-a could also be linearly related to the net growth rate of pheophytin-a. This suggests that algal removal was caused mainly by cellular death. Finally, the relationships obtained in this study were used to predict the impact of artificial circulation on algal removal in water-supply reservoirs.

J	Wang, HQ; Zhang, LY				Wang, Hongqiang; Zhang, Lieyu			Effect of phosphorus on nitrogen migration and transformation in deep subsurface wastewater infiltration systems	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												This paper investigates the effect of phosphorus on nitrogen migration and transformation during the sewage purification processes in deep subsurface wastewater infiltration systems. Good performance was achieved with a hydraulic loading rate of 0.1 m(3)/m(2).d, indicating that the effluent water quality could meet the primary grade A values as put forth by the 'Cities Sewage Treatment Plant Pollutant Discharge Standard' (GB18918-2002). In addition, the results of three inflow total phosphorus (TP) concentrations (5 mg L-1, 15 mg L-1, and 30 mg L-1) indicated that high-levels of phosphorus were more advantageous in regards to improving the activity of denitrifying bacteria in soil and strengthening the effect of nitrogen removal, suggesting that the effluent total nitrogen (TN) concentration could meet the primary grade A standard (TN <= 15 mg L-1). It was further observed that soil depth was less crucial when inflow TP concentrations were higher. Therefore, the results indicated that inflow phosphorus concentrations could greatly influence nitrogen migration and transformation in deep subsurface wastewater infiltration systems.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				DEC	2017	76	11					3086	3093		10.2166/wst.2017.483								WOS:000417163700021	29210694

In search of an alternative organic fertilizer for fish culture, the nutrient potential of HU was evaluated. Fries of Indian carps and larvae of freshwater prawn were reared for 120 days under six conditions: (a) aerated and (b) non-aerated fresh HU (0.01%), (c) cattle manure (CM; 1.8 kg tank(-1)), mixed treatment with CM and HU under (d) iso-phosphorus and (e) iso-nitrogenous condition and (f) control. Monitoring of water quality and biological parameters revealed that total fish yield was the highest in CM (621.5 g tank(-1)) followed by mixed treatments under iso-nitrogenous (428 g tank(-1)) and iso-phosphorus (333 g tank(-1)) conditions, aerated HU (321 g tank(-1)) and HU (319 g tank(-1)). The gross primary productivity (GPP) in HU was satisfactory (601.8 mg C m(-2) h(-1)) and superior to all but CM treatment. The abundance of heterotrophic bacteria (HB) was highest in CM and lowest in HU. Both GPP and HB population were correlated positively with fish yield per tank. Although pH in all treatments remained high (pH 8.4-8.9), no ammonia toxicity was observed. No E. coli infestation in any fish muscle was encountered. The concentrations of cadmium and lead in fish muscle were within respective safe level. The study established that high fertilizer potential of HU could be exploited as an alternative organic fertilizer or as a candidate to be blended with cattle manure.

Aquatic eutrophication indicators in LCA: Methodological challenges illustrated using a case study in New Zealand	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Objective: The objective of this work was to determine the effects and implications of generic and site-specific aquatic eutrophication potential indicators in the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of livestock farm systems using a New Zealand (NZ) lake catchment case study.& para;& para;Method: Average dairy and sheep & beef farm systems in the Lake Taupo catchment were studied. Emissions of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) to waterways, and ammonia and nitrogen oxides to air from these farms were calculated using the site-specific OVERSEER (R) nutrient budget model. These emissions data were then used to calculate the increase in nutrients in water bodies and aquatic Eutrophication indicators with a range of Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) methods.& para;& para;Results: Eutrophication indicator results varied considerably depending on the environmental mechanisms modelled by the LCIA method for the fate of N and P, accentuated by different choices for the inventory modelling. Using default emission factors instead of site-specific ones overestimated eutrophication impact results. The most recent methods are not only spatially-explicit and applicable beyond Europe, but they also account for more environmental mechanisms for the fate of the nutrients, giving relatively lower calculated impact results. However, the appropriate scale and spatial resolution is still a crucial question to address for these methods since they greatly affect results. Regarding eutrophication damage assessment, when the actual background nutrient concentration is very low, the end-point assessment method for freshwater eutrophication is not applicable. In this case, LCA fails to account for a high standard of water quality that is in a near-pristine state, but deteriorating.& para;& para;Conclusions: The inventory of nutrient flows at a farm scale and fate factors modelled at a catchment scale should be site-specific. Freshwater eutrophication indicators should be based on a site-specific (and globally-valid) LCIA model rather than a generic one. Currently-accepted freshwater eutrophication indicators focus only on P, thus capturing only part of the problem for freshwater bodies that are co-limited by N and P (in terms of algal growth) such as Lake Taupo in NZ. Lake Taupo water quality concerns and regulations are not focused on P, but solely on N due to increasing N levels over time. Conclusions from this study are valid beyond NZ and beyond agricultural systems. Future work needs to investigate coupling N and P fate modelling based on the most recent globally-valid and spatially-explicit LCIA methods. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The evaluation was determined using chemical parameters representing typical contaminants of sugar industry wastewater (SIWW) and yeast industry wastewater (YIWW), and characterising the content of organic matter (BOD5), nutrients (NH4-N, NO3-N, TN and TP) and salts (Cl, SO4, Na and K). The studies reveal that food industry wastewater constitutes a valuable water-nutrient-rich medium that can be reused in agricultural applications as an alternative water resource for irrigation and nutrients for fertilisation. Furthermore, the reuse facilitates the sustainable discharge of wastewater through a soil-aquifer zone to the natural environment. This does not affect chemical quality of groundwater, which was comparable in areas irrigated and non-irrigated with SIWW and YIWW. Although some parameters (NO3-N, NH4-N, SO4, Cl and Na) displayed higher concentrations in groundwater from the fields irrigated with wastewater, these contents were within recommended health-based guideline limits defined in either the groundwater quality standards or the drinking water quality norms. Only the contents of K revealed an exclusive groundwater impact from wastewater irrigation. This was confirmed in statistical tests employing the Ward's hierarchical clustering method, which exposed excessive amounts of K introduced into groundwater through irrigation with both SIWW and YIWW. However, this parameter is not considered to pose any health risk to humans or the environment, and its content is not restricted by quality guideline values for either groundwater or drinking water.

The objective of this research is to discover useful knowledge amidst water monitoring data collected between 2005 and 2011, in a specific region of the state of So Paulo in Brazil. The research was performed in three steps: discovery of classification rules of ecotoxicity in water samples using predictive modelling; investigation of the presence of strong relationships between water quality parameters by associative analysis; and discovery of sampling sites, which are similar with respect to their quality parameters, by applying a clustering method. The knowledge discovery process employed in this work was divided into four phases: selection of study area and data, pre-processing of the selected data, mining of the pre-processed data, and interpretation and evaluation of the results. The data mining step was supported by different algorithms, each one focused on a particular issue of the research: sequential coverage algorithm for classification of ecotoxicity; Apriori algorithm for identifying associations between quality parameters, and Prim's algorithm and pruning algorithm for clustering of water sampling sites. We observed the association of certain quality parameters to water ecotoxicity, the existence of correlations between some of the quality parameters, and the presence of homogeneous groups amidst the sampling sites. These results may provide valuable input to the field of water quality monitoring, from the technical activities, such as the laboratorial analysis of water samples, to the decision makers responsible for defining the future public policies for water resources management.

Fuzzy Inference Systems: Selection of the most Appropriate Fuzzy Implication from Available Lake Water Quality Statistical Data	ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSES-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL												To this day, models such as empirical and dynamic, along with the multi-criteria analysis methods, have helped us towards the very understanding and estimation of all the functions (physical, chemical, biological) existing in freshwater ecosystems. The rich and variable system of the Greek lake Karla is a perfect candidate for our study and its purpose, which is to investigate the factors responsible for eutrophication (water temperature, nitrates, total phosphorus, secchi depth, chlorophyll-a) using fuzzy logic. In fuzzy logic, where the proposition can take any value in the close interval [0,1], there are infinite numbers of fuzzy implications which can be used; hence, a method of selecting the most appropriate implication is required. In this paper, we propose a method of evaluating fuzzy implications using available statistical data. The choice of the appropriate implication is based on the deviation of the true value of the fuzzy implication from the real values, as described by the statistical data.																	2198-7491	2198-7505				DEC	2017	4	4					923	935		10.1007/s40710-017-0266-3								WOS:000415318100009

A highly specific Escherichia coil qPCR and its comparison with existing methods for environmental waters	WATER RESEARCH												The presence of Escherichia coil in environmental waters is considered as evidence of faecal contamination and is therefore commonly used as an indicator in both water quality and food safety analysis. The long period of time between sample collection and obtaining results from existing culture based methods means that contamination events may already impact public health by the time they are detected. The adoption of molecular based methods for E. coil could significantly reduce the time to detection. A new quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay was developed to detect the ybbW gene sequence, which was found to be 100% exclusive and inclusive (specific and sensitive) for E. coil and directly compared for its ability to quantify E. coil in environmental waters against colony counts, quantitative real-time NASBA (qNASBA) targeting clpB and qPCR targeting uidA. Of the 87 E. coil strains tested, 100% were found to be ybbW positive, 94.2% were culture positive, 100% were clpB positive and 98.9% were uidA positive. The qPCR assays had a linear range of quantification over several orders of magnitude, and had high amplification efficiencies when using single isolates as a template. This compared favourably with qNASBA which showed poor linearity and amplification efficiency. When the assays were applied to environmental water samples, qNASBA was unable to reliably quantify E. coil while both qPCR assays were capable of predicting E. coli concentrations in environmental waters. This study highlights the inability of qNASBA targeting mRNA to quantify E. coli in environmental waters, and presents the first E. coli qPCR assay with 100% target exclusivity. The application of a highly exclusive and inclusive qPCR assay has the potential to allow water quality managers to reliably and rapidly detect and quantify E. coli and therefore take appropriate measures to reduce the risk to public health posed by faecal contamination.

In the present study, the toxicity removal during wastewater treatment at seven municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) was investigated using an effect-based approach. A battery of eight bioassays was applied comprising of cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, endocrine disruption and fish embryo toxicity assays. Human cell-based CALUX assays, transgenic larval models and the fish embryo toxicity test were particularly sensitive to WWTP effluents. The results indicate that most effects were significantly reduced or completely removed during wastewater treatment (76-100%), while embryo toxicity, estrogenic activity and thyroid disruption were still detectable in the effluents suggesting that some harmful substances remain after treatment. The responsiveness of the bioassays was compared and the human cell-based CALUX assays showed highest responsiveness in the samples. Additionally, the fish embryo toxicity test and the transgenic larval models for endocrine disrupting effects showed high responsiveness at low sample concentrations in nearly all of the effluent samples. The results showed a similar effect pattern among all WWTPs investigated, indicating that the wastewater composition could be rather similar at different locations. There were no considerable differences in the toxicity removal efficiencies of the treatment plants and no correlation was observed with WWTP characteristics, such as process configuration or sludge age. This study demonstrated that a biotest battery comprising of multiple endpoints can serve as a powerful tool when assessing water quality or water treatment efficiency in a holistic manner. Rather than analyzing the concentrations of a few selected chemicals, bioassays can be used to complement traditional methods of monitoring in the future by assessing sum-parameter based effects, such as mixture effects, and tackling chemicals that are present at concentrations below chemical analytical detection limits.

Removal of selected emerging PPCP compounds using greater duckweed (Spirodela polyrhiza) based lab-scale free water constructed wetland	WATER RESEARCH												Greater duckweed (Spirodela polyrhiza) based lab-scale free water constructed wetland (CW) was employed for removing four emerging pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) (i.e. DEET, paracetamol, caffeine and triclosan). Orthogonal design was used to test the effect of light intensity, aeration, E.coli abundance and plant biomass on the target compounds. Synthetic wastewater contaminated with the target compounds at concentration of 25 mu g/L. was prepared, and both batch and continuous flow experiments were conducted. Up to 100% removals were achieved for paracetamol (PAR), caffeine (CAF) and tricolsan (TCS) while the highest removal for DEET was 32.2% in batch tests. Based on orthogonal Duncan analysis, high light intensity (240 mu molmm(-2)s(-1)), full aeration, high plant biomass (1.00 kg/m(2)) and high E.coli abundance (1.0 x 10(6) CFU/100 mL) favoured elimination of the PPCPs. Batch verification test achieved removals of 17.1%, 98.8%, 96.4% and 95.4% for DEET, PAR, CAF and TCS respectively. Continuous flow tests with CW only and CW followed by stabilization tank (CW-ST) were carried out. Final removals of the PPCP contaminants were 32.6%, 97.7%, 98.0% and 100% for DEET, PAR, CAF and TCS, respectively, by CW system alone, while 43.3%, 97.5%, 98.2% and 100%, respectively, were achieved by CW-ST system. By adding the ST tank, PPCP concentrations decreased significantly faster (p < 0.05) compared with continuous flow CW alone. In addition, after removing aerators during continuous flow CW experiments, the treatment systems presented good stability for the PPCP removals. CW-ST showed better chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC) removals (89.3%, 91.2%, respectively) than CW only (79.4%, 85.2%, respectively). However, poor DEET removal (<50%) and high E.coli abundance (up to 1.7 log increase) in the final treated water indicated further treatment processes may be required. Statistical analysis showed significant correlations (p < 0.05) between PPCPs and water quality parameters (e.g. COD, nitrate, phosphate), and between the four PPCP compounds for the continuous flow CW and CW-ST systems. Positive results encourage further test of Greater duckweed at pilot scale ON using real wastewater. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

A risk-based approach for developing standards for irrigation with reclaimed water	WATER RESEARCH												A generalised quantitative risk assessment (QRA) is developed to assess the potential harm to human health resulting from irrigation with reclaimed water. The QRA is conducted as a backward calculation starting from a pre-defined acceptable risk level at the receptor point (defined as an annual infection risk of 10(-4) for pathogens and by reference doses (RfD) for chemical hazards) and results in an estimate of the corresponding acceptable concentration levels of the given hazards in the effluent. In this way the QRA is designed to inform the level of water treatment required to achieve an acceptable risk level and help establish reclaimed water quality standards. The QRA considers the exposure of human receptors to microbial and chemical hazards in the effluent through various exposure pathways and routes depending on the specific irrigation scenario. By considering multiple pathways and routes, a number of key aspects relevant to estimating human exposure to recycled water can be accounted for, including irrigation and crop handling practices (e.g., non-edible vs edible, spray vs. drip, withholding time) and volumes consumed (directly vs indirectly). The QRA relies on a large number of inputs, many of which were found to be highly uncertain. A possibilistic approach, based on fuzzy set theory, was used to propagate the uncertain input values through the QRA model to estimate the possible range of hazard concentrations that are deemed acceptable/safe for reclaimed water irrigation. Two scenarios were considered: amenity irrigation and irrigation of ready-to-eat food crops, and calculations were carried out for six example hazards (norovirus, Cryptosporidium, cadmium, lead, PCB118 and naphthalene) and using UK-specific input values. The human health risks associated with using reclaimed water for amenity irrigation were overall deemed low, i.e. the calculated acceptable concentration levels for most of the selected hazards were generally far greater than levels typically measured in effluent from wastewater treatment plants; however the predicted acceptable concentration levels for norovirus and Cryptosporidium suggested that disinfection by UV may be required before use. It was found that stricter concentration standards were required for hazards that are more strongly bound to soil and/or are more toxic/infectious. It was also found that measures that reduce the amount of effluent directly ingested by the receptor would significantly reduce the risks (by up to 2 orders of magnitude for the two pathogens). The results for the food crop irrigation scenario showed that stricter concentration standards are required to ensure the effluent is safe to use. For pathogens, the dominant exposure route was found to be ingestion of effluent captured on the surface of the crops indicating that risks could be significantly reduced by restricting irrigation to the non-edible parts of the crop. The results also showed that the exposure to some organic compounds and heavy metals through plant uptake and attached soil particles could be high and possibly pose unacceptable risk to human health. For both scenarios, we show that the predicted acceptable concentration levels are associated with large uncertainty and discuss the implications this has for defining quality standards and how the uncertainty can be reduced.

Nutrient loading impacts on culturable E. coil and other heterotrophic bacteria fate in simulated stream mesocosms	WATER RESEARCH												Understanding fecal indicator bacteria persistence in aquatic environments is important when making management decisions to improve instream water quality. Routinely, bacteria fate and transport models that rely on published kinetic decay constants are used to inform such decision making but may not adequately represent instream conditions. The objective of this work was to evaluate bacterial responses to applied nutrient amendments and provide additional information regarding bacterial response to applied changes that can be incorporated into future modeling efforts. Re-created stream mesocosms were established in laboratory-based, repurposed algae raceways filled with water and sediment from a small, 3rd order Southeast Texas stream. Mesocosm treatments consisted of low (10x) or high (50x) nutrient doses above ambient water concentrations operated at low (0.032 m/s) or high (0.141 m/s) flow rates. Escherichia coli and heterotrophic bacterial concentrations were quantified in water and sediment over 22 days. No significant differences in kinetic constants were observed among E. coli in water or sediment, and only E. coli in sediment showed any growth response. Heterotrophic plate counts revealed a pronounced growth response in water and sediment within 24 h of nutrient addition but did not differ significantly from control mesocosms. Significant kinetic constant differences between E. coli and heterotrophic bacteria in water were identified (p < 0.01) but did not differ significantly in sediment (p > 0.48). Results indicate that nutrient addition does affect microbial numbers instream, but competition from heterotrophic bacteria may prevent an E. coli growth response. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Our study employed the concepts of technological path and aeration frame to analyze the extensive restoration and aeration history of the hypertrophic Tuusulanjarvi in southern Finland. Continuously aerated since 1972, it has the longest history of aeration in Finland. Qualitative analysis of documentary and archival sources revealed that the longstanding preference for aeration in the context of increasing scientific controversy was based on its functional versatility and seemingly unproblematic applicability in regard to shifting emphasis and goal setting of restoration. Additionally, the stability of the aeration frame has been supported by the practical and emotional attachment of local residents to lake restoration, particularly aeration, and finally the problems and contradicting interests related to alternative restoration methods.																	0044-7447	1654-7209				DEC	2017	46	8					865	877		10.1007/s13280-017-0926-6								WOS:000412998600004	28623630

Removal of nutrients, trace organic contaminants, and bacterial indicator organisms in a demonstration-scale unit process open-water treatment wetland	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												A demonstration-scale unit process open-water wetland system was built to treat water from an effluent-dominated river (i.e., a river in which the flow consisted almost entirely of municipal wastewater effluent from May to October). Monitoring of the system over a two-year period indicated effective removal of nitrate, with concentrations decreasing by over 90% during summer. The temperature-independent areal first-order nitrate removal rate constant, k(20), ranged from 61.7 to 68.1 m yr(-1) after the microbial community was established, which is significantly higher than values typically observed in full-scale surface flow wetlands. The beta-adrenergic blockers, atenolol and propranolol, as well as the antiviral drug, acyclovir, were removed by photolysis and biotransformation in the wetland biomat, whereas the antiepileptic drug, carbamazepine, exhibited little removal. The bacterial indicators E. coli and enterococci decreased substantially during summer, mainly through sunlight exposure. Models of contaminant removal based upon measured flow rates and performance data collected at a similar pilot-scale system agreed well with measured data for nitrate and the trace organic contaminants. The model accurately predicted removal of enterococci but systematically over-predicted the removal of E. coli. During the two-year study period, routine maintenance was necessary to prevent colonization of the water surface with duckweed (Lemna spp.). Unit process open-water (UPOW) wetlands may offer a low-cost means of improving water quality in natural treatment systems that can be integrated with conventional surface-flow wetlands and other managed natural systems. The quantitative models of contaminant removal described in this study can be used to design natural treatment systems that balance the needs for local water quality requirements, available land and site-specific requirements.																	0925-8574	1872-6992				DEC	2017	109		A				76	83		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.09.017								WOS:000413737800010

Stimulation of Phytoplankton Production by Anthropogenic Dissolved Organic Nitrogen in a Coastal Plain Estuary	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												There is increased focus on nitrogen (N) containing dissolved organic matter (DOM) as a nutrient source supporting eutrophication in N-sensitive estuarine ecosystems. This is particularly relevant in watersheds undergoing urban and agricultural development, leading to increased dissolved organic N (DON) loading. To understand how this shift in N-loading influences estuarine phytoplankton production, nutrient addition bioassays were conducted in the N-limited Neuse River Estuary, North Carolina from 2014 to 2015. Additions included N-rich DOM sources characteristic of urban and agricultural development, including chicken and turkey litter leachate, wastewater treatment facility effluent, and concentrated river DOM (used as a reference). Each DOM addition was coupled with an inorganic nutrient treatment to account for inorganic nutrient concentrations (NO2/3, NH4, PO4) in each respective DOM addition. Repeated measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) showed that chicken litter leachate stimulated phytoplankton growth greater than its coupled inorganic nutrient treatment. Wastewater treatment facility effluent, turkey litter leachate, and concentrated river DOM did not stimulate phytoplankton growth greater than their respective inorganic nutrient controls. DOM fluorescence (EEM-PARAFAC) indicated the chicken litter contained a biologically reactive fluorescent DOM component, identified as the nonhumic, biologically labile, "N-peak", which may be responsible for stimulating the observed phytoplankton growth in the chicken litter leachate treatments.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				NOV 21	2017	51	22					13104	13112		10.1021/acs.est.7b03538								WOS:000416496700005	29083877

Modeling the Concentration of Volatile and Semivolatile Contaminants in Direct Contact Membrane Distillation (DCMD) Product Water	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) is an emerging water treatment technology that has high salt rejection; however, its commercialization potential for applications such as seawater desalination or industrial wastewater reuse may be limited by low rejection of volatile and semivolatile contaminants. In this manuscript, a contaminant concentration (CC) model describing the transport of volatile and semivolatile contaminants for DCMD systems was developed and validated using data from the bench-scale DCMD treatment of synthetic wastewaters. The DCMD tests showed that the more volatile contaminants (methyl-tert-butyl ether, acetone, pentanone, butanol, and hexanol) accumulated in the permeate collection stream at greater concentrations than in the feed stream. The validated CC model (average normalized root mean squared error <= 11.3%) was then used to evaluate the product water quality from the large-scale DCMD treatment of oil and gas produced waters. The modeled product water contaminant concentrations exceeded the Environmental Protection Agency limits for discharging to publicly owned treatment works. This indicated that DCMD treatment of produced waters may require additional processing to meet discharge requirements.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				NOV 21	2017	51	22					13113	13121		10.1021/acs.est.6b05663								WOS:000416496700006	29111695

We evaluated the suitability of the methodology to assess complex field contaminations through its application in the framework of a regional river monitoring network. Thanks to the high throughput acquisition of biomarker levels in G. fossarum exposed in four reference and 13 contaminated sites, we analyzed the individual responses of 38 peptides reporting for 25 proteins of interest in 170 organisms. Responses obtained in contaminated sites included inductions of vitellogenin-like proteins in male organisms, inductions of Na+K+/ATPases, and strong inhibitions of molt-related proteins such as chitinase and JHE-carboxylesterase. Proteins from detoxification and immunity processes were also found modulated in abundance. Summarizing, the results presented here show that the SRM strategy developed for multibiomarker measurement paves a very promising way to define multiple indicators of the health status of sentinel organisms for environmental hazard assessment.

Therefore, the knowledge about the distribution of nitrate in groundwater and its source has an effective role in protecting health. The study aimed to optimize an interpolation method to predict the nitrate concentration and assessment of aquifer vulnerability in Qazvin plain. Methods: One hundred sixty-two deep wells in Qazvin plain aquifer were randomly selected and nitrate concentration was analyzed in four different lands including agricultural, residential, steppe and mixed-use areas. Interpolation was done by IDW, Spline, Kriging and National neighbor methods using ArcGIS software. To select the best interpolation method, errors of predicted values were determined by Mean Relative Error (RME) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). For analysis of potential vulnerability of aquifer to nitrate pollution due to agricultural activity and sewage leaks, hazard factors and control factors were used for identification of hazard indexes (HI) using IPNOA and IPNOC model. Results: The results showed that in 8.82% and 18.52% of samples in agricultural and residential areas, the detected nitrate was above the acceptable level at 50 mg/L. National neighbor method with the lowest RME and Spline method with the lowest RMSE were provided the most accurate estimates of nitrates in the aquifer. The highest hazard was obtained in agricultural areas (HI = 6.11). Also, the most influential parameters on aquifer vulnerability were mineral fertilizer (HFf = 3), organic fertilizers (HFm = 3), irrigation systems (CFi = 1.04) and tillage patterns (CFap = 1.04). Conclusions: According to the results, National neighbor with the lowest RME was preferable than the other spatial interpolation methods for prediction of nitrate concentration in the aquifer. This method provided similar spatial distribution maps of nitrate in groundwater and that was an efficient method for assessing water quality. Hazard index as a result of agricultural activities (IPNOA) was ranged from "very low" to "low" which was in accordance with detected and predicted nitrate concentration in the aquifer. In addition he hazard of nitrate contamination from household (IPNOC) was in very low (class 2).

Assessing the chemical contamination dynamics in a mixed land use stream system	WATER RESEARCH												Traditionally, the monitoring of streams for chemical and ecological status has been limited to surface water concentrations, where the dominant focus has been on general water quality and the risk for eutrophication. Mixed land use stream systems, comprising urban areas and agricultural production, are challenging to assess with multiple chemical stressors impacting stream corridors. New approaches are urgently needed for identifying relevant sources, pathways and potential impacts for implementation of suitable source management and remedial measures. We developed a method for risk assessing chemical stressors in these systems and applied the approach to a 16-km groundwater-fed stream corridor (Grindsted, Denmark). Three methods were combined: (i) in-stream contaminant mass discharge for source quantification, (ii) Toxic Units and (iii) environmental standards. An evaluation of the chemical quality of all three stream compartments stream water, hyporheic zone, streambed sediment made it possible to link chemical stressors to their respective sources and obtain new knowledge about source composition and origin. Moreover, toxic unit estimation and comparison to environmental standards revealed the stream water quality was substantially impaired by both geogenic and diffuse anthropogenic sources of metals along the entire corridor, while the streambed was less impacted. Quantification of the contaminant mass discharge originating from a former pharmaceutical factory revealed that several 100 legs of chlorinated ethenes and pharmaceutical compounds discharge into the stream every year. The strongly reduced redox conditions in the plume result in high concentrations of dissolved iron and additionally release arsenic, generating the complex contaminant mixture found in the narrow discharge zone. The fingerprint of the plume was observed in the stream several km downgradient, while nutrients, inorganics and pesticides played a minor role for the stream health. The results emphasize that future investigations should include multiple compounds and stream compartments, and highlight the need for holistic approaches when risk assessing these dynamic systems.

Assessment of drinking water quality at the tap using fluorescence spectroscopy	WATER RESEARCH												Treated drinking water may become contaminated while travelling in the distribution system on the way to consumers. Elevated dissolved organic matter (DOM) at the tap relative to the water leaving the treatment plant is a potential indicator of contamination, and can be measured sensitively, inexpensively and potentially on-line via fluorescence and absorbance spectroscopy. Detecting elevated DOM requires potential contamination events to be distinguished from natural fluctuations in the system, but how much natural variation to expect in a stable distribution system is unknown. In this study, relationships between DOM optical properties, microbial indicator organisms and trace elements were investigated for households connected to a biologically-stable drinking water distribution system. Across the network, humic-like fluorescence intensities showed limited variation (RSD = 3.5-4.4%), with half of measured variation explained by interactions with copper. After accounting for quenching by copper, fluorescence provided a very stable background signal (RSD < 2.2%) against which a similar to 2% infiltration of soil water would be detectable. Smaller infiltrations would be detectable in the case of contamination by sewage with a strong tryptophan-like fluorescence signal. These findings indicate that DOM fluorescence is a sensitive indicator of water quality changes in drinking water networks, as long as potential interferents are taken into account.

Control strategies for nitrous oxide emissions reduction on wastewater treatment plants operation	WATER RESEARCH												The present paper focused on reducing greenhouse gases emissions in wastewater treatment plants operation by application of suitable control strategies. Specifically, the objective is to reduce nitrous oxide emissions during the nitrification process. Incomplete nitrification in the aerobic tanks can lead to an accumulation of nitrite that triggers the nitrous oxide emissions. In order to avoid the peaks of nitrous oxide emissions, this paper proposes a cascade control configuration by manipulating the dissolved oxygen set-points in the aerobic tanks. This control strategy is combined with ammonia cascade control already applied in the literature. This is performed with the objective to take also into account effluent pollutants and operational costs. In addition, other greenhouse gases emissions sources are also evaluated. Results have been obtained by simulation, using a modified version of Benchmark Simulation Model no. 2, which takes into account greenhouse gases emissions. This is called Benchmark Simulation Model no. 2 Gas. The results show that the proposed control strategies are able to reduce by 29.86% of nitrous oxide emissions compared to the default control strategy, while maintaining a satisfactory tradeoff between water quality and costs.

J	Perez, CJ; Vega-Rodriguez, MA; Reder, K; Florke, M				Perez, Carlos J.; Vega-Rodriguez, Miguel A.; Reder, Klara; Floerke, Martina			A Multi-Objective Artificial Bee Colony-based optimization approach to design water quality monitoring networks in river basins	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Water quality monitoring is important for the management of freshwater resources in river basins. Allocation of monitoring stations is the first step in the design of a water quality network. For this task, planning objectives are identified and a Multi-Objective Artificial Bee Colony-based optimization algorithm is designed and implemented in a Geographic Information System framework. Specifically, the number of stations is minimized in a range of values at the same time that the detection of lower compliance areas, the affected population and the relative importance of the river stretches are maximized. The estimation of pollutant parameters such as Biochemical Oxygen Demand, Faecal Coliform Bacteria or Total Dissolved Solids is performed by using the WorldQual model. This allows to objectively allocate monitoring stations to rivers where no real measurements are available, and thus it is especially relevant to allocate water quality stations for the first time. This approach has been tested on the Great Fish River basin (South Africa), finding networks improving the values of the objective functions between 22.22% and 47.83% with respect to the ones of the current network. Moreover, the solution analysis provides insightful and valuable information to the decision maker. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

One promising technology to address this issue is in situ healing of compromised membranes via healing agents that are added to the feed side of a membrane system and seal the defect site because of increased hydraulic drag through damage site during filtration. We herein introduce an improved in situ membrane healing method using amine-functionalized silica microparticles that is effective under varying operating conditions, overcoming limitations faced by previous healing agents such as chitosan agglomerates. The silica microparticles are functionalized with branched polyethylenimine (PEI) molecules for efficient interparticle cross-linking with glutaraldehyde. The PEI-decorated silica microparticles (SiO2@PEI MPs) were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, and zeta potential analysis. This study investigates the selective deposition of the SiO2@PEI MPs on the damage area using confocal laser scanning microscopy under variable cross-flow rate (0.5-2.0 L/min) and flushing time (10 to 30 min) conditions. The in situ healing technique recovered the particle rejection of compromised membranes to 99.1% of the original membrane's performance without any flux decline. The results of this study show that the use of SiO2@PEI MPs is a promising and practical approach to ensure membrane process integrity.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				NOV 7	2017	51	21					12630	12637		10.1021/acs.est.7b03436								WOS:000414887200065	29064689

This synergism in mixtures containing an azole has mostly been studied by effect measurements, while the underlying mechanism has been less well investigated. In this study, six azole fungicides (cyproconazole, epoxiconazole, ketoconazole, prochloraz, propiconazole, and tebuconazole) were selected to investigate their synergistic potential and their CYP inhibition strength in the aquatic invertebrate Gammarus pulex. The strobilurin fungicide azoxystrobin was chosen as co-occurring substrate, and the synergistic potential was measured in terms of internal concentrations of azoxystrobin and associated biotransformation products (BTPs). Azoxystrobin is biotransformed by various reactions, and 18 BTPs were identified. By measuring internal concentrations of azoxystrobin and its BTPs with high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry in the presence and absence of azole fungicides followed by toxicokinetic modeling, we showed that the inhibition of CYP-catalyzed biotransformation reactions indeed played a role for the observed synergism. However, synergism was only observed for prochloraz at environmentally realistic concentrations. Increased uptake rate constants, an increase in the total internal concentration of azoxystrobin and its BTPs, in vivo assays for measuring CYP activities, and G. pulex video-tracking suggested that the 2-fold increase in bioaccumulation, and, thereby, the raised toxicity of azoxystrobin in the presence of prochloraz is not only caused by inhibited biotransformation but even more by increased azoxystrobin uptake induced by hyperactivity.

Modeling nutrient removal using watershed-scale implementation of the two-stage ditch	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Western Lake Erie Basin (WLEB) is the most intensively farmed region of the Great Lakes. Because of the flat topography and poorly-drained soils many farmers rely on drainage management practices (e.g., subsurface tile drainage, ditch channelization) to maintain productive agriculture. However, these practices also facilitate the delivery of excess nutrients and sediments to Lake Erie, which have been linked to recurring harmful algal blooms (HABs) and associated environmental degradation. Implementation of inset floodplains in formerly channelized waterways via the two-stage ditch can improve water quality but the efficacy has been tested using only implementation in short reaches. Watershed models are critical tools for assessing watershed-scale implementation and as such can guide effective management. We evaluated the effectiveness of the two-stage ditch in improving water quality in the River Raisin Watershed (RRW), a major subbasin in the WLEB, combining empirical measurements for nutrient reductions from two-stage ditches across the Midwest with output from a Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. We modeled two-stage implementation in 25, 50, and 100% of headwater reaches in the RRW, and found that the practice could reduce total annual NO3--N export by 2, 5 and 10%, respectively. The two-stage was even more effective at reducing total phosphorus (TP) export, which was reduced by 12, 20 and 31%, respectively. Compared to other conservation practices, nutrient reduction efficiency for the two-stage ditch was good, both in terms of percent load reduction and cost, but watershed-scale adoption will be required in order to achieve significant nutrient reductions as called for by policymakers.

Subsurface tile drained area detection using GIS and remote sensing in an agricultural watershed	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Subsurface tile drainage has been used around the globe to lower the water table and drain soils that are seasonally or perennially wet making them suitable for agriculture and/or increasing productivity. However, tile drainage systems have a negative impact on water quality of adjacent streams and ditches due to the transport of excess fertilizer nutrients like nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from fields. To support nutrient management and conservation practices like drain water management (DWM), accurate delineation of the agricultural area drained by tiles is critical for quantifying nutrient yields (nutrient mass per area per time) to downstream water bodies. In this study, we tested Geographic Information System decision tree classification (GIS DTC) and satellite remote sensing based methods (i.e., image differencing) to determine tile drainage area in an agricultural watershed, Shatto Ditch Watershed (SDW) in Indiana, USA. Using these techniques, we estimated that 79% of the cultivated area of SDW is tile drained with 94% accuracy according to the image differencing approach whereas 55% is classified as tile drained with an accuracy of 75% based on estimates from the DTC approach with the most relaxed rule thresholds (where tiles exist on <= 4% slope with poorly and moderately well drained soils). Using satellite imagery to characterize tile drained area at a high resolution over large geographical extent shows promise and will be important for accurately quantifying nutrient yields from tiles which will inform management and conservation efforts to reduce excess nutrient export to downstream water bodies.

Phosphorus concentrations in a Florida Everglades water conservation area before and after El Nino events in the dry season	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												The Florida Everglades depends on both seasonal hydroperiods and low nutrient loading. This study investigated phosphorus concentrations in a 237,000-ha wetland complex in the Greater Florida Everglades known as Water Conservation Area 3A (WCA-3A). WCA-3A is south and downstream of Lake Okeechobee and most of the agricultural activity in the Everglades region, but immediately north and upstream of the Everglades National Park. The original goal of the study was to investigate if this water conservation area was serving as a phosphorus sink during a 9-month period (October 2015 to June 2016) that normally would have bracketed the dry winter season of south Florida. The beginning of 2016 brought several unexpected polar fronts with high rainfall, an unusual weather pattern in subtropical Florida later confirmed to have been caused by an El Nino condition in the Pacific Ocean. Samples taken at the beginning of the dry season (October through December 2015 during pre-El Nino conditions) showed low phosphorus concentrations. In April and June 2016 during post-El Nino conditions, monthly average total phosphorus concentrations averaged 7.1-7.2 ppb total phosphorus in inflow region of WCA-3A, significantly higher (P = 0.030 and 0.045) than 3.0 and to 2.6 ppb in the wetland's outflow region. The wetland was found to be a sink of phosphorus with a 47% decrease in total phosphorus from north to south during this post- El Nino time. If future additional wetlands and water quality strategies are not in place to mitigate fluxes of phosphorus during future climate variations such as this El Nino condition, this wetland complex may take on an even greater role of protecting the water quality of the downstream Everglades National Park.																	0925-8574	1872-6992				NOV	2017	108		B				391	395		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.07.028								WOS:000423883000005						
J	Mitsch, WJ				Mitsch, William J.			Solving Lake Erie's harmful algal blooms by restoring the Great Black Swamp in Ohio	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Harmful algal blooms are now a common occurrence around the world in these Anthropocene times because of fertilization of phosphorus and nitrogen for crop and animal production. One of the most dramatic cases in North America is the recent accelerated eutrophication of Lake Erie in the Laurentian Great Lakes. Also, we have lost, by some estimates, 50% of the world's wetlands in the 20th century and 90% of the wetlands in Ohio USA over the 19th and 20th centuries. We are proposing a serious analysis of an ecological engineering opportunity to restore parts of the former 400,000 ha (1 million acre) Great Black Swamp that was immediately southwest of Lake Erie in Ohio and is now one of the major sources of agricultural phosphorus to western Lake Erie through the Maumee River. Restoring and creating 20,000-40,000 ha (50,000-100,000 acres) or 5-10% of the original wetlands in the Black Swamp to optimize nutrient reduction could reduce phosphorus loading by 480-960 metric tons/year or 18-37% percent of the annual phosphorus loading by the Maumee River to Lake Erie. A thorough investigation of this idea will first require physical (mull-year mesocosm experiments), mathematical, and business models to explore biogeochemical, hydrologic and economic feasibility and reliability. If this presents reasonable results, it would be followed by the creation of a small 400-1000 ha (1000-2500 acre) demonstration treatment wetland in the Black Swamp region to see if wetland performance will scale up as predicted with the mesocosm and mathematical models. Only after a decade of studies at these smaller scale models and a demonstration levels would the full-scale nutrient retention wetlands be implemented in the former Black Swamp. When completed, these treatment wetlands would cover about 10% of the Great Black Swamp region and could remove, with proper ecological engineering design, 40% or more of the phosphorus load from the Maumee River Basin now going into Lake Erie.																	0925-8574	1872-6992				NOV	2017	108		B				406	413		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.08.040								WOS:000423883000007

Design of real-time and long-term hydrologic and water quality wetland monitoring stations in South Florida, USA	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Hydrologic regimes in tropical and subtropical regions (e.g. hurricanes, tropical storms, and droughts) impact biogeochemical processes in created and restored wetlands with variability of wet/dry seasons and extreme weather events. Our South Florida Wetland Monitoring Network (SFWMN) with three real-time hydrologic, water quality, and meteorological field stations was established by the Everglades Wetland Research Park of Florida Gulf Coast University in the subtropical Southwest Florida, USA, beginning in 2012. The stations include a restored freshwater marsh (RFM) and adjacent meteorological field station; a restored brackish water marsh (RBM); and a created freshwater treatment wetland system and adjacent meterological station (CFTW). Continuous observations of water depth, temperature, salinity, and pH for the period of January 2012 to January 2016 indicate significant differences among the restored freshwater marsh, the restored brackish marsh, and the created freshwater treatment wetlands for water temperature and pH for wet and dry seasons. The brackish wetland salinity fluctuated between 26.16 (in the dry season) to 1.03 ppt (in the wet season). The real-time dataset allowed up-to-date information of the frequency and duration of severe weather events illustrating, for example, that 70% of the 2012 annual rainfall (1129 mm) occurring in July and August with a 75.4 mm precipitation during one event tropical storm Isaac on August 26-28, 2012. This storm led to a water stage peak in the brackish wetland due to excessive watershed runoff, not tidal surges, and salinity decreased from 22.3 to 5.5 ppt. The coefficient of variation (CV) for water depth and water quality from all wetland monitoring stations exhibited similar variations during all seasons, except when the salinity for the brackish marsh (RBM) had the highest CV values (1.02) in the wet season. Principal component analysis (PCA) at each station identified the variance in water depth and water quality parameters as due to seasonal changes of precipitation in distinct wet and dry seasons. The data from these monitoring stations are also used for research by scholars and students as well as for teaching a better understanding of wetlands dynamics and function in the classroom. As a whole, these stations are being used to bring awareness about the fragile and unique hydrological conditions of wetlands in subtropical Southwest Florida, especially for long-term conditions related to sea level changes and more frequent tropical storms.

Relative importance of external and internal phosphorus loadings on affecting lake water quality in agricultural landscapes	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Internal phosphorus (P) loading from the sediment poses a high risk of being an additional P source to deteriorate water quality. Previous studies hypothesized that internal P loads can be as high as external P inputs, especially in P enriched landscapes such as agricultural areas. However, internal P loadings in eutrophic conditions are rarely quantified or compared with external P loads. In this study, we aimed to answer these three questions; 1) how much P is internally released from the sediment of hypereutrophic lakes? 2) how much do internal P loads contribute to lake water quality compared to external loads? and 3) what factors regulate the release and retention of P in the sediment? We selected four hypereutrophic lakes located in Eastern Nebraska. In the study lakes and watersheds, internal and external P loads were quantified in 2014. Total P concentrations of inflow water collected from primary water channels feeding the study lakes and daily inflow water discharge rates were used to calculate external P loads. Internal P loads were quantified from flow-through soil core incubation experiments. External TP loads varied temporarily depending on the changes in discharge, and were highest during spring storm events. The majority of internal P loading (i.e. P release from sediment) occurred in the summer when lakes experience strong stratification (i.e. anaerobic conditions). This is likely associated with oxygen availability in the sediments and chemical dissolution of P. By comparing the annual-scale of external and internal P inputs, external P loadings were still the dominant P source to the lakes, contributing up to 98% of the total P input whereas internal P loadings accounted for 4-12% of the total P input. Although internal P loads were relatively minor on an annual time scale, we found that summer internal loadings in some of study lakes exceeded their external loadings. Our results confirmed the dominant influence of external P loadings on water quality in the reservoirs. This suggests that non-point source controls and watershed management strategies to reduce external loadings should be implemented prior to internal P loading controls. Internal P loadings can be a significant P source, even if just temporarily, worsening water quality of agricultural reservoirs and downstream ecosystems in the summer. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Riparian forests play a major role in protecting water quality, and there is a need to assess the role of riparian restoration in reducing nutrients and sediment loading. This study uses watershed simulation modeling to evaluate impacts of riparian forest restoration on water quality in a tropical agricultural watershed. Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is used to simulate streamflow, suspended sediment and nutrients of the Sarapui River watershed, located in southeast Brazil. We observe a spatial and temporal variation in water quality impacts of changes in land use/land cover (LULC) and rainfall patterns. Watersheds with agricultural and some residential areas had a higher sediment and nutrients loads than forest and with pasture land uses, especially during the wet season. Forested watersheds in general had a better water quality than other LULC types. Riparian restoration in the study watershed can reduce suspended sediment (9.26%), total nitrogen (22.6%), and total phosphorus (7.83%). Protecting riparian zone and site-conservation practices is critical to improve water quality. We observe that the simulation model provides a satisfactory baseline of the watershed system to evaluate impacts of land use changes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Hsu, TTD; Mitsch, WJ; Martin, JF; Lee, J				Hsu, Tsung-Ta David; Mitsch, William J.; Martin, Jay F.; Lee, Jiyoung			Towards sustainable protection of public health: The role of an urban wetland as a frontline safeguard of pathogen and antibiotic resistance spread	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Wetlands are known for providing important ecosystem services, such as reduction of eutrophication. However, less research has focused on public health service of wetlands: their ability to protect microbial quality of water for downstream while they attract wildlife populations. For urban surface water, transmission of antibiotic resistance is also an important concern. Under anticipated climate change scenarios, more extreme precipitation patterns are emerging. Thus, runoff and flooding from increased precipitation will impair surface water quality more significantly. The objectives of this study were to 1) evaluate the dynamics of bacteria of public health concern in urban wetlands, including: Escherichia coli, Campylobacter, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), Arcobacter, and two antibiotic resistance genes (sulfonamide, sul1 and tetracycline, tetQ); and 2) identify the major fecal contamination sources using microbial source tracking (MST). Water samples were collected across the urban wetlands in central Ohio from June 2013 to June 2014 and tested with a culture-based (E. coli) and quantitative PCR (the rest) methods. Since Canada geese were the most observed wildlife at the study sites and they are known to carry an array of infectious disease agents, their fecal samples were also collected. From the water samples, E. coli (fecal indicator) had the highest occurrence in 99.2% of the total samples, followed by sul1 (98.3%), Arcobacter (94.9%), STEC (74.6%), tetQ (58.5%), and Campylobacter (1.7%). Overall reduction in E. coli was 22.3% across the wetlands, but variation was observed depending on the season. Microbial source tracking suggested a high prevalence of avian- (44.9%) and ruminant- (38.1%) originated fecal contaminations (e.g., Canada geese and deer). From the geese fecal samples, STEC (93.2%) and Arcobacter (4.5%) were detected, which could potentially compromise wetlands functions in reductions in bacteria of public health concern and antibiotic resistance. The results suggest that careful wildlife management together with long-term monitoring of microorganisms of concern are needed for making urban wetlands as a sustainable frontline safeguard of pathogen and antibiotic resistance spread in surface water.

J	Marion, JW; Zhang, F; Cutting, D; Lee, J				Marion, Jason W.; Zhang, Feng; Cutting, David; Lee, Jiyoung			Associations between county-level land cover classes and cyanobacteria blooms in the United States	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Cyanobacteria blooms can cause public health concerns related to drinking water quality and water recreation. The rapidly changing global climate is anticipated to bring about an increased frequency of extreme weather events (e.g. stronger storms, more extensive droughts), which are expected to promote more frequent cyanobacteria blooms that persist for longer durations in freshwater. Land use planning, landscape management, and ecological engineering may present mitigation opportunities for decreasing the occurrence and intensity of current and future cyanobacteria blooms through improved nutrient management strategies thereby reducing eutrophication of watersheds. To examine the potential impacts of various land cover classes (and their relative density) on cyanobacteria bloom coverage, county-level data were obtained or generated from the National Land Cover Database and the national nutrient inputs to the land surface database. These data were paired with county-level estimates of cyanobacteria bloom area obtained by satellite-based MERIS (Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer). Multivariable zero-inflated beta regression models were constructed for the U.S. and five U.S. regions for assessing the relationships between the proportion of county area experiencing a cyanobacteria bloom, county land cover types, and nutrient loading. The land cover type associated with the greatest decreases in bloom area in the national model was deciduous forest (p < 0.001). Open water extent (p = 0.001) and nitrogen loading from manure (p = 0.002) and fertilizer (p < 0.001) were positively associated with the proportion of water characterized as experiencing a cyanobacteria bloom. A significant interaction (p < 0.001) was observed between cultivated crop coverage and open water extent. Overall, increasing cultivated crop coverage was associated with increasing proportions of cyanobacteria blooms. Low intensity, medium intensity, and high intensity development land uses were not associated with bloom coverage in the national model, although development land uses were positively associated in several regional models. Ultimately, there is evidence that county-level land cover and nutrient loading, notably N in the national model, can impact countylevel cyanobacteria bloom coverage. Given regional model differences, additional remote sensing-based studies that examine watershed-based effects on cyanobacteria coverage are needed to establish watershed-specific associations. Studies that transcend county boundaries may provide greater utility than this correlational study for better characterizing land uses and mitigation measures that impact or could impact cyanobacteria bloom coverage in U.S. surface waters.																	0925-8574	1872-6992				NOV	2017	108		B				556	563		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.07.032								WOS:000423883000022

The potential for wetland systems to act as sinks for various types of pollutants indicates their potential for mitigating algal blooms. Although nutrient uptake in terrestrial treatment wetland systems has received substantial attention in the literature, relatively little is known about the mechanisms involved in floating constructed wetland (FCW) function for algal control and whether plant species can optimise performance. Here, the effect of FCWs on water quality including nutrient levels and algal biomass was investigated, along with the effect of planting with different species of macrophyte. All the planted FCWs showed significant potential for algal bloom mitigation in both hypereutrophic and mesotrophic systems; algal biomass control is proposed to be due to the direct uptake of nitrate and phosphate via macrophyte roots, rather than algaecidal effect of phenolic compounds. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) release was found to differ between species, with implications for drinking water treatment.																	0925-8574	1872-6992				NOV	2017	108		B				581	588		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.07.033								WOS:000423883000025

Phosphorus (P) impairment of fresh surface waters is a major concern in the USA and worldwide. The aim of this study is to use a bench scale P removal system that utilizes electrocoagulation (EC) to address this water quality problem. This study examined the effects of treatment parameters (initial pH, initial conductivity, power input, and initial P concentration) on the ability of the EC process to remove P in solutions with initial P concentrations less than 2 mg/L. It also investigated the ability of EC to reduce concentrations of P in surface water and treated wastewater. P concentrations in phosphate solutions, surface water, and wastewater effluent were reduced by 99% in under 60 min. The removal efficiency was demonstrated to be directly proportional to the conductivity and power supplied.																	0925-8574	1872-6992				NOV	2017	108		B				589	596		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.07.031								WOS:000423883000026

The reverse osmosis process has been selected to study since it typically uses less energy than thermal distillation. The aim of the robust design is to overcome the limitation of classical controllers in dealing with large parametric uncertainties, external disturbances, sensor noises, and unmodeled process dynamics. The analyzed desalination process is modeled as a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system with varying parameters. The control system is decoupled using a feed forward decoupling method to reduce the interactions between control channels. Both nominal and perturbed reverse osmosis systems have been analyzed using structured singular values for their stabilities and performances. Simulation results show that the system responses meet all the control requirements against various uncertainties. Finally the reduced order controller provides excellent robust performance, with achieving decoupling, disturbance attenuation, and noise rejection. It can help to reduce the membrane cleanings, increase the robustness against uncertainties, and lower the energy consumption for process monitoring.																	1061-4303	1554-7531				NOV 1	2017	89	11					1932	1941		10.2175/106143017X15054988926316								WOS:000418398500001	29080563

Development of Multiple Regression Models to Predict Sources of Fecal Pollution	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												This study assessed the usefulness of multivariate statistical tools to characterize watershed dynamics and prioritize streams for remediation. Three multiple regression models were developed using water quality data collected from Sinking Creek in the Watauga River watershed in Northeast Tennessee. Model 1 included all water quality parameters, model 2 included parameters identified by stepwise regression, and model 3 was developed using canonical discriminant analysis. Models were evaluated in seven creeks to determine if they correctly classified land use and level of fecal pollution. At the watershed level, the models were statistically significant (p < 0.001) but with low r(2) values (Model 1 r(2) = 0.02, Model 2 r(2) = 0.01, Model 3 r(2) = 0.35). Model 3 correctly classified land use in five of seven creeks. These results suggest this approach can be used to set priorities and identify pollution sources, but may be limited when applied across entire watersheds.																	1061-4303	1554-7531				NOV 1	2017	89	11					1961	1969		10.2175/106143017X14839994523901								WOS:000418398500004	28327258

To compare the efficiency of the treatment methods the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and chlorine decay and trihalomethane (THM) formation tests the important parameters needed in practice were used. A high level of DOC removal (>80%) was achieved with all the treatments. A significant difference was observed in chlorine decay rates and THM production. Pre-oxidation with 2 mg/L of O-3 and coagulation with 45 mg/L of ferric sulphate produced the most chlorine stable water followed by water treated with 80 mg/L of ferric sulphate. Chlorine decay test was found to be a more sensitive indicator of a successful treatment than DOC. The optimisation of the ozone dose is likely to identify the best water quality and chemical cost combination which is not likely achievable by the coagulation alone.

W.; Huang, Ju-Chang			Field Experiments of Chlorine Demand in Disinfection of Treated Primary Effluent	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												In the Hong Kong Harbour Area Treatment Scheme (HATS), a concentrated 10% chlorine solution (in sodium hypochlorite with a specific gravity of 1.2) is used directly to disinfect sewage that receives a chemically enhanced primary treatment (CEPT). The dense chlorine solution is injected into the treated sewage flow in the form of multiple dense jets. Field observations have revealed large variations of chlorine consumption in the treatment system. In view of the importance of the disinfection system to the environmental impact and operational cost of HATS, the mixing of a chlorine jet with the CEPT effluent and its associated chlorine consumption are studied for the first time using a 1: 2-scale sectional physical model located inside the sewage treatment plant, using sewage and a chlorine solution obtained on-site. The total residual chlorine (TRC) concentration distribution is measured at different cross sections of the chlorine mixing chamber. The overall disinfection efficiency is assessed by detailed measurement of the water quality of the outflow from the chamber, which receives only a few seconds of chlorine exposure. At a targeted dosing rate of 10-20 mg/L, only approximately 60-80% of the sewage flow is exposed to chlorine upon leaving the chamber, and approximately 70-80% of the chlorine mass flux is consumed within a very short distance (0.5-1 m, or a matter of several seconds) from the chlorine dosing unit. Overall, there is a 1-log Escherichia coli (E. coli) kill within the chlorine mixing chamber, with effective E. coli kill associated with a TRC concentration above 15 mg/L. The detailed field-scale model tests help to unravel the causes of the observed large TRC fluctuations in the plant and provide a basis for optimization of the chlorine disinfection operations (e.g., use of lower source chlorine concentration).

J	Su, Y; Guan, DJ; Su, WC; Gao, WJ				Su Yin; Guan Dongjie; Su Weici; Gao Weijun			Integrated assessment and scenarios simulation of urban water security system in the southwest of China with system dynamics analysis	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The demand for global freshwater is growing, while global freshwater available for human use is limited within a certain time and space. Its security has significant impacts on both the socioeconomic system and ecological system. Recently, studies have focused on the urban water security system (UWSS) in terms of either water quantity or water quality. In this study, water resources, water environment, and water disaster issues in the UWSS were combined to establish an evaluation index system with system dynamics (SD) and geographic information systems (GIS). The GIS method performs qualitative analysis from the perspective of the spatial dimension; meanwhile, the SD method performs quantitative calculation about related water security problems from the perspective of the temporal dimension. We established a UWSS model for Guizhou province, China to analyze influencing factors, main driving factors, and system variation law, by using the SD method. We simulated the water security system from 2005 to 2025 under four scenarios (Guiyang scenario, Zunyi scenario, Bijie scenario and combined scenario). The results demonstrate that: (1) the severity of water security in cities is ranked as follows: three cities are secure in Guizhou province, four cities are in basic security and two cities are in a situation of insecurity from the spatial dimension of GIS through water security synthesis; and (2) the major driving factors of UWSS in Guizhou province include agricultural irrigation water demand, soil and water losses area, a ratio increase to the standard of water quality, and investment in environmental protection. A combined scenario is the best solution for UWSS by 2025 in Guizhou province under the four scenarios from the temporal dimension of SD. The results of this study provide a useful suggestion for the management of freshwater for the cities of Guizhou province in southwest China.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				NOV	2017	76	9					2255	2267		10.2166/wst.2017.333								WOS:000415638000001	29144284

The experimental results showed that the vortex wave flow state in the membrane module could be formed when the Reynolds number (Re) of liquid was adjusted between 450 and 1,050, and the membrane flux declined more slowly in the vortex wave flow state than those in the laminar flow state and turbulent flow state. The MBR system was used to treat domestic wastewater under the condition of vortex wave flow state for 30 days. The results showed that the removal efficiency for CODcr and NH3-N was 82% and 98% respectively, and the permeate quality met the requirement of 'Water quality standard for urban miscellaneous water consumption (GB/T 18920-2002)'. Analysis of the energy consumption of the MBR showed that the average energy consumption was 1.90 +/- 0.55 kWh/m(3) (permeate), which was only two thirds of conventional MBR energy consumption.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				NOV	2017	76	9					2465	2472		10.2166/wst.2017.400								WOS:000415638000021	29144304					
J	Chen, H; Zuo, QT; Zhang, YY				Chen, Hao; Zuo, Qi-ting; Zhang, Yong-yong			Preliminary results of water quality assessment using phytoplankton and physicochemical approaches in the Huai River Basin, China	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Water pollution has been a significant issue in the Huai River Basin (HRB) of China since the late 1970s. In July and December 2013, two field investigations were carried out at 10 sites along the main streams of the basin. The monitoring indices contained both physicochemical variables and the structure and composition of phytoplankton communities. The correlations between communities and physicochemical variables were analyzed using cluster analysis and redundancy analysis. Moreover, water quality was evaluated using the comprehensive nutrition state index (TLI) and Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H). Results indicated that more phytoplankton species were present in December than in July, but total density was less in December. Phytoplankton communities in the midstream of the Shaying River were affected by the same physicochemical factors throughout the year, but ammonia nitrogen and total phosphorus had the greatest influence on these sites in July and December, respectively. The water pollution status of the sampling sites was much greater in the Shaying River midstream than at other sites. TLI was more suitable than H for assessing water quality in the study area. These results provide valuable information for policy makers and stakeholders in water quality assessment, water ecosystem restoration, and sustainable basin management in the HRB.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				NOV	2017	76	9					2554	2564		10.2166/wst.2017.418								WOS:000415638000030	29144313					
J	Zhang, ZC				Zhang, Zhenchao			The flocculation mechanism and treatment of oily wastewater by flocculation	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												In the present study, the performance of compound flocculants composed of different concentrations of polyaluminum chloride (PAC) and cationic polyacrylamide (CPAM), the influencing mechanism of the flocculation process and the effects of temperature, settling time, and speed and time of stirring were investigated. The results show that the poor water quality with high concentrations of oil, suspended solids (SS) and polymer greatly increases the oily wastewater emulsion stability and the difficulty of the flocculation treatment process. The compound flocculant in oily wastewater treatment can achieve best results at optimum conditions of temperature 45 degrees C, settling time 60 min, and two stirring stages, 250 r.min(-1) for 3 min followed by 100 r.min(-1) for 7 min. At the PAC dosage of 80 mg.L-1 and the CPAM dosage of 0.8 mg.L-1, the turbidity of oily wastewater is reduced from 153.8 NTU to 11.2 NTU, and the turbidity removal rate reaches 92.69%. Through further measurements, oil content and SS content are less than 10 mg.L-1, which meets the requirement of the Daqing oilfield re-injection standard.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				NOV	2017	76	10					2630	2637		10.2166/wst.2017.414								WOS:000415999900006	29168702

In this study, water columns were collected at 22 sites in the littoral zone of Lake Taihu in 2014 to investigate the distribution and concentration of nutrients and the stable isotope signatures of POM, and their potential interrelation. Generally, mean concentration of nitrogen forms (NH4+-N) showed substantial variation, probably because they had received large amounts of wastewater from various local industrial enterprises. Source analysis by stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios showed that the main POM sources were phytoplankton. Contrasting correlations were obtained between delta N-15 and N concentrations in effluent river mouths when compared with influent river mouths. In effluent river mouths, there was a significant positive correlation between delta N-15 and nitrogen concentration (total nitrogen and ammonia-nitrogen), in contrast with the negative correlation in influent river mouths. According to these results, more factors should be taken into consideration when stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes of POM are used to assess the feeding relationship between consumers and prey, as well as the energy flow pathways that support the lake pelagic food webs.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				NOV	2017	76	10					2690	2697		10.2166/wst.2017.439								WOS:000415999900013	29168709					
J	Elci, A				Elci, Alper			Evaluation of nutrient retention in vegetated filter strips using the SWAT model	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Nutrient fluxes in stream basins need to be controlled to achieve good water quality status. In stream basins with intensive agricultural activities, nutrients predominantly come from diffuse sources. Therefore, best management practices (BMPs) are increasingly implemented to reduce nutrient input to streams. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of vegetated filter strip (VFS) application as an agricultural BMP. For this purpose, SWAT is chosen, a semi-distributed water quality assessment model that works at the watershed scale, and applied on the Nif stream basin, a small-sized basin in Western Turkey. The model is calibrated with an automated procedure against measured monthly discharge data. Nutrient loads for each sub-basin are estimated considering basin-wide data on chemical fertilizer and manure usage, population data for septic tank effluents and information about the land cover. Nutrient loads for 19 sub-basins are predicted on an annual basis. Average total nitrogen and total phosphorus loads are estimated as 47.85 t/yr and 13.36 t/yr for the entire basin. Results show that VFS application in one sub-basin offers limited retention of nutrients and that a selection of 20-m filter width is most effective from a cost-benefit perspective.

Nutrient modeling for a semi-intensive IMC pond: an MS-Excel approach	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Semi-intensive Indian Major Carp (IMC) culture was practised in polythene lined dugout ponds at the Aquacultural Farm of Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, West Bengal for 3 consecutive years at three different stocking densities (S. D), viz., 20,000, 35,000 and 50,000 numbers of fingerlings per hectare of water spread area. Fingerlings of Catla, Rohu and Mrigal were raised at a stocking ratio of 4:3:3. Total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) value along with other fishpond water quality parameters was monitored at 1 day intervals to ensure a good water ecosystem for a better fish growth. Water exchange was carried out before the TAN reached the critical limit. Field data on TAN obtained from the cultured fishponds stocked with three different stocking densities were used to study the dynamics of TAN. A developed model used to study the nutrient dynamics in shrimp pond was used to validate the observed data in the IMC pond ecosystem. Two years of observed TAN data were used to calibrate the spreadsheet model and the same model was validated using the third year observed data. The manual calibration based on the trial and error process of parameters adjustments was used and several simulations were performed by changing the model parameters. After adjustment of each parameter, the simulated and measured values of the water quality parameters were compared to judge the improvement in the model prediction. Forward finite difference discretization method was used in a MS-Excel spreadsheet to calibrate and validate the model for obtaining the TAN levels during the culture period. Observed data from the cultured fishponds of three different S. D were used to standardize 13 model parameters. The efficiency of the developed spreadsheet model was found to be more than 90% for the TAN estimation in the IMC cultured fishponds.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				NOV	2017	76	10					2858	2866		10.2166/wst.2017.458								WOS:000415999900030	29168726

Cost-effective treatment of swine wastes through recovery of energy and nutrients	WASTE MANAGEMENT												Wastes from concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) are challenging to treat because they are high in organic matter and nutrients. Conventional swine waste treatment options in the U.S., such as uncovered anaerobic lagoons, result in poor effluent quality and greenhouse gas emissions, and implementation of advanced treatment introduces high costs. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to evaluate the performance and life cycle costs of an alternative system for treating swine CAFO waste, which recovers valuable energy (as biogas) and nutrients (N, P, K+) as saleable fertilizers. The system uses in-vessel anaerobic digestion (AD) for methane production and solids stabilization, followed by struvite precipitation and ion exchange (IX) onto natural zeolites (chabazite or clinoptilolite) for nutrient recovery. An alternative approach that integrated struvite recovery and IX into a single reactor, termed STRIEX, was also investigated. Pilot- and bench-scale reactor experiments were used to evaluate the performance of each stage in the treatment train. Data from these studies were integrated into a life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) to assess the cost-effectiveness of various process alternatives. Significant improvement in water quality, high methane production, and high nutrient recovery (generally over 90%) were observed with both the AD-struvite-IX process and the AD-STRIEX process. The LCCA showed that the STRIEX system can provide considerable financial savings compared to conventional systems. AD, however, incurs high capital costs compared to conventional anaerobic lagoons and may require larger scales to become financially attractive. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Interplay of water quality and vegetation in restored wetland plant assemblages from an agricultural landscape	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Water quality degradation from excessive fertilizer use and runoff is a worldwide problem. While this degradation impacts wetlands, these systems can also be a vehicle for water quality improvement. Restoration of wetlands in agricultural landscapes has recently increased, but little work has evaluated the relationship of plant assemblages and water quality parameters in restored, non-treatment wetlands. This study examines the impact of self-designed wetland plant assemblages on nitrogen and sediment dynamics. Thirty mesocosms were seeded with soil from restored wetlands and allowed to develop from the seed bank to emergent assemblages. During the 2015 growing season (seven to nine months after establishment), these assemblages were exposed to treatment loads of nitrogen and sediment, common stressors to wetlands in agricultural landscapes. Water samples were taken up to five days post-treatment in July and September to quantify interactions between the stressors and plant assemblages. Analyses showed plant assemblage identify was not structured by treatment, but by the site of soil origin. Treatment removal rates were influenced by total amount of the stressor present, with nitrogen removal rates being higher, in relative terms, in low nitrogen amended treatments. Additionally, plant quality, not quantity, was linked to nitrogen and sediment loss rates, and over time, elevated nitrogen and sediment loads were associated with decreased plant assemblage quality. This study demonstrates the ability of plants from restored wetlands to affect nutrient and sediment dynamics, with three significantly differing plant assemblages all exhibiting substantial nutrient and sediment reduction capacity. Nevertheless, we also found that in a relatively short time (seven to nine months) common stressors in agricultural settings can significantly impact wetland plant assemblage quality, and that this may be linked to a reduced capacity for nutrient and sediment removal.																	0925-8574	1872-6992				NOV	2017	108		A				255	262		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.08.034								WOS:000412127500030

Hydrologic and water quality performance of regenerative stormwater conveyance installed to stabilize an eroded outfall	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Conveying concentrated urban runoff to outfall locations frequently leads to stream bank erosion, channel incision, and the formation of headcuts. Installed in an incised eroded channel, regenerative stormwater conveyance (RSC) is a grade-control and treatment system that uses a series of pools and cascades with an underlying sand bed. As a recently developed practice, RSC performance evaluations are needed to improve the design and guide regulatory accreditation. An eroded channel with a 10% longitudinal slope was stabilized with a five-cell system and monitored for a 14-month period. A small capture volume (6-mm design event) and groundwater intrusion resulted in minimal hydrologic benefit. Hydrologic mitigation was attained only for storms less than 12.7 mm. The RSC converted a substantial 50% of inflow to media flow at the second cell; however, the media flow entirely reemerged as surface flow in the saturated downstream pools. Small but statistically significant reductions in event mean concentrations occurred: 17% total suspended sediment (TSS), 17% total phosphorus (TP), and 3% total nitrogen (TN). Water quality improvements occurred primarily between the upstream and second cell, indicating limited processing by the wetter downstream pools. Comparisons between inter-event outflow grab samples and storm event outflow concentrations show nitrogen export during inter-event periods (47% increase in TN concentration). Due to elevated inter-event concentrations, overall mass loading of nitrogen increased. Hydrologic and water quality benefits were garnered only in the first three cells where groundwater intrusion was minimal. Future implementations of RSC are encouraged to account for seasonal high water table elevations that interact with the RSC media and adequately size pool and sand layer capture volumes.

Increasing floodplain connectivity through urban stream restoration increases nutrient and sediment retention	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Stream restoration practices frequently aim to increase connectivity between the stream channel and its floodplain to improve channel stability and enhance water quality through sediment trapping and nutrient retention. To measure the effectiveness of restoration and to understand the drivers of these functional responses, we monitored five restored urban streams that represent a range of channel morphology and restoration ages. High and low elevation floodplain plots were established in triplicate in each stream to capture variation in floodplain connectivity. We measured ecosystem geomorphic and soil attributes, sediment and nutrient loading, and rates of soil nutrient biogeochemistry processes (denitrification; N and P mineralization) then used boosted regression trees (BRT) to identify controls on sedimentation and nutrient processing. Local channel and floodplain morphology and position within the river network controlled connectivity with increased sedimentation at sites downstream of impaired reaches and at floodplain plots near the stream channel and at low elevations. We observed that nitrogen loading (both dissolved and particulate) was positively correlated with denitrification and N mineralization and dissolved phosphate loading positively influenced P mineralization; however, none of these input rates or transformations differed between floodplain elevation categories. Instead, continuous gradients of connectivity were observed rather than categorical shifts between inset and high floodplains. Organic matter and nutrient content in floodplain soils increased with the time since restoration, which highlights the importance of recovery time after construction that is needed for restored systems to increase ecosystem functions. Our results highlight the importance of restoring floodplains downstream of sources of impairment and building them at lower elevations so they flood frequently, not just during bankfull events. This integrated approach has the greatest potential for increasing trapping of sediment, nutrients, and associated pollutants in restored streams and thereby improving water quality in urban watersheds.																	0925-8574	1872-6992				NOV	2017	108		A				284	295		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.08.006								WOS:000412127500033

In south Florida, stormwater treatment areas (STAs) have been utilizedto remove excessive phosphorus (P) from surface waters for more than two decades with remarkableresults. Even though the STAs have been operational for more than two decade, further improvementof P removal performance is necessary to achieve the desired outflow concentrations. This commentary critically reviews a recently published manuscript concerning the ability of alternative vegetativecommunities' ability to improve STA treatment efficiency. The commentary provides clarification of Everglades STA effluent limit and the total P water quality criterion established for the Everglades ProtectionArea.

The framework includes data quality assurance and quality control processes, automated kriging interpolation along undulating paths, and local hotspot and cluster analyses. These methods are implemented in an interactive Web application developed using the Shiny package in the R programming environment to support near-real time analysis along with 2-and 3-D visualizations. The approach is demonstrated using historical sampling data from an undulating vehicle deployed at three rivermouth sites in Lake Michigan during 2011. The normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE) of the interpolation averages approximately 10% in 3-fold cross validation. The results show that the framework can be used to track river plume dynamics and provide insights on mixing, which could be related to wind and seiche events. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

A management-oriented water quality model for data scarce catchments	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												Due to the degeneration of water quality globally, water quality models could increasingly be utilised within water resource management. However, a lack of observed data as well as financial resources often constrain the number of potential water quality models that could practically be utilised. This study presents the Water Quality Systems Assessment Model (WQSAM). WQSAM directly utilises flow data generated by systems models to drive water quality simulations. The model subscribes to requisite simplicity by constraining the number of variables simulated as well as the processes represented to only those most important to water quality management, in this case, nutrients and salinity. The model application to the upper Olifants River catchment in South Africa is described. WQSAM was able to use the limited observed data to simulate representative frequency distributions of water quality, and the approach used within WQSAM was shown to be suitable for application to data scarce catchments.

These models have guided agricultural management by simulating effects of landscape structure, farming system changes and their spatial arrangement on stream water quality. Such models generate many intermediate results that should be managed, analyzed and transformed into usable information. We describe a data warehouse (N-Catch) built to store and analyze simulation data from the spatially distributed agro-hydrological model TNT2. We present scientific challenges to and tools for building data warehouses and describe the three dimensions of N-Catch: space, time and an original hierarchical description of cropping systems. We show how to use OLAP to explore and extract all kinds of useful high-level information by aggregating the data along these three dimensions and how to facilitate exploration of the spatial dimension by coupling N-Catch with GIS. Such tool constitutes an efficient interface between science and society, simulation remaining a research activity, exploration of the results becoming an easy task accessible for a large audience.

Four seasonal sampling campaigns were conducted in 2006 and three campaigns in 2007. At least eleven sampling sites were selected across the main river and its major tributaries, Enipeus, Kladheos, Selinous, Erymanthos, Ladhon and Lousios. At each station, in situ measurements were performed and samples of water were taken for laboratory analysis. Furthermore, in situ measurements were conducted and samples of water were collected from wells and boreholes (drills) in the area near the river to assess the interaction between surface water and groundwater. The mean Pb concentrations in surface waters were found lower than the limit value of 7.2 mu g/L in inland waters. The origin of the selected heavy metals is rather natural in the Alfeios River basin, with the exception of the anthropogenic contributions of Pb from the Lousios River catchment and of Fe from the Megalopolis' mine. These data could be useful for the evaluation of the water quality, which is required by the implementation of the Alfeios River Basin Management Plan.																	2198-7491	2198-7505				NOV	2017	4			1			S23	S34		10.1007/s40710-017-0233-z								WOS:000414369000003

Permeable Biosorbent Barrier for Wastewater Remediation	ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSES-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL												Chromium is one of the heavy metals that significantly affect water quality in Mongolia. The present study is focused on the remediation of surface water contaminated with chromium (III) by a permeable barrier in order to prevent sediment pollution. The adsorption capacity of the selected materials (13X zeolite and vermiculite) was investigated at different sorbent dosages, pH and initial Cr(III) concentration. The equilibrium adsorption studies showed that vermiculite has a higher Cr(III) removal efficiency in comparison with 13X zeolite. A fungal isolate obtained from the sediment samples collected near Tuul River (Mongolia) was selected from enriched Luria-Bertani medium, showing a good performance for Cr(III) removal (78.2% for an initial concentration of 50 mg/L). The fungal isolate was genetically typed by DNA sequencing and was identified as belonging to the Alternaria alternata species. 13X zeolite showed the best performance for Cr removal in the permeable barrier assays compared to vermiculite, achieving a total removal of 96% and a global uptake of 2.49 mg/g. After 13 days of operation none of the barriers reached saturation with chromium.

Over the last decades, a number of water quality indices (WQI) has been created and applied towards this goal. In most cases, the WQI is applied in characterizing the overall quality of a water system by integrating all available data, regardless of sampling station and time. This approach may result in misleading interpretation of data and wrong or ineffective policy responses to water quality deterioration. The present study investigates whether this approach is the most appropriate or if it is necessary to take into consideration the water quality of each individual sampling. Two natural lakes in Greece were chosen as case studies and an alternative to National Sanitation Foundation Water Quality Index was applied at each sampling site and at the overall water body. The use of the water quality index presented in this study is proved to be good practice in evaluating and characterizing the water quality of lakes as it can be easily adjusted to local specific conditions. The physico-chemical characterization of an aquatic system by water quality indices is preferable to be made only if the water quality indices, calculated for each individual sampling site, show homogeneity. The identification of the considered critical parameters, which significantly affect the quality of a water body, is of high importance in order to reduce the monitoring cost without influencing the reliability of the final result.

This study developed an online analytical technique-high-performance liquid chromatography followed by photochemical reaction and chemiluminescence detection (HPLCPR-CL)-for determination of the concentration of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and three other N-nitrosamines. Its feasibility for near real-time analysis was evaluated by analyzing an ultrafiltration (UF)-treated wastewater before and after a pilotscale reverse osmosis (RO) treatment system. The online instrument with a method detection limit of 0.3-2.7 ng L-1 requires a direct injection (i.e., no sample pre-concentration) of only 20-200 mu L sample volume for the determination of N-nitrosamine concentrations every 20 min. NDMA concentrations in UF-treated wastewater were successfully monitored in a range of 50-200 ng L-1 over the course of 24 h. Likewise, NDMA concentrations in RO permeate ranged from 26-81 ng L-1 over the course of 48 h. The online monitor was capable of recording variations in N-nitrosamine concentration in RO permeate that occurred following changes in feedwater concentration and temperature. This study demonstrates the potential for online water quality assurance via direct measurement of trace levels of organic contaminants, which is highly relevant to the implementation of potable reuse.																	2053-1400	2053-1419				NOV 1	2017	3	6					1032	1036		10.1039/c7ew00296c								WOS:000413934800004

Peracetic acid disinfection kinetics for combined sewer overflows: indicator organisms, antibiotic resistance genes, and microbial community	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY												Combined sewer overflows (CSOs) degrade water quality and end-of-pipe treatment is one potential solution for retrofitting this outdated infrastructure. The goal of this research was to evaluate peracetic acid (PAA) as a disinfectant for CSOs using viability based molecular methods for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), indicator organism marker gene BacHum, and 16S rRNA genes. Simulated CSO effluent was prepared using 23-40% wastewater, representing the higher end of the range of wastewater concentrations reported in CSO effluent. PAA residual following disinfection was greatest for samples with the lowest initial COD. Treatment of simulated CSO effluent (23% wastewater) with 100 mg min L-1 PAA (5 mg L-1 PAA, 20 min) was needed to reduce viable cell sul1, tet(G), and BacHum (1.0 +/- 0.63-3.2 +/- 0.25- log) while 25 to 50 mg min L-1 PAA (5 mg L-1 PAA, 5-10 min) was needed to reduce viable cell loads (0.62 +/- 0.56-1.6 +/- 0.08log) in 40% wastewater from a different municipal treatment plant. Increasing contact time after the initial decrease in viable cell gene copies did not significantly improve treatment. A much greater applied Ct of 1200 mg min L-1 PAA (20 mg L-1 PAA, 60 min) was required for significant log reduction of 16S rRNA genes (3.29 +/- 0.13-log). No significant losses of mexB were observed during the study. Data were fitted to a Chick-Watson model and resulting inactivation constants for sul1 and tet(G) > BacHum > 16S rRNA. Amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene indicated the initial viable and total microbial communities were distinct and that treatment with PAA resulted in marked increases of the relative abundance of select phyla, particularly Clostridia which increased by 1-1.5 orders of magnitude. Results confirm that membrane disruption is a mechanism for PAA disinfection and further treatment is needed to reduce total ARGs in CSO effluent.																	2053-1400	2053-1419				NOV 1	2017	3	6					1061	1072		10.1039/c7ew00184c								WOS:000413934800008	29333272

Development and experimental validation of the composition and treatability of a new synthetic bathroom greywater (SynGrey)	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY												Bathroom greywater, including bathing and handwashing wastewater, can be reused for toilet flushing to reduce 35% of residential water demand. Despite these potential savings, greywater reuse is underutilized and the development of innovative treatment technologies is impeded by a lack of validated synthetic recipes to support laboratory-scale experimentation. The objective of this work was to develop and validate a new, representative synthetic bathroom greywater to enable reproducible and translatable treatment studies. A literature review compiled data from 49 real bathroom greywaters, which was used to set 20 water quality criteria for a synthetic recipe. A new synthetic greywater - SynGrey - was developed to match real bathroom greywater composition across all criteria and was found to be more representative of real greywater than existing recipes. SynGrey's validity was evaluated by comparing its treatability against a real bathroom greywater including via chlorination, aerobic biodegradation, adsorption, and coagulation. Total chlorine residuals were statistically similar between SynGrey and the real bathroom greywater, but doses were an order of magnitude higher than for drinking water. The readily biodegradable fraction of total chemical oxygen demand was about 40% for both greywaters. The dissolved organic carbon percent removal by activated carbon was similar between SynGrey and the real greywater (+/- 14%). Alum coagulation achieved comparable effluent turbidity, but SynGrey had a much more narrow dose curve, and coagulation achieved substantially greater total organic carbon removal from the real greywater. SynGrey represents a superior synthetic recipe for laboratory-scale experimentation to facilitate the evaluation, selection, and optimization of greywater reuse technologies.

J	Vithana, CL; Sullivan, LA; Shepherd, T				Vithana, Chamindra L.; Sullivan, Leigh A.; Shepherd, Troy			Effect of schwertmannite and jarosite on the formation of hypoxic blackwater during inundation of grass material	WATER RESEARCH												This study focused on understanding the effect of schwertmannite and jarosite, commonly found in floodplains containing acid sulfate soil materials, on the characteristics of the hypoxic blackwaters that can form when floodplain vegetation experiences prolonged inundation. The formation of these 'blackwaters' was simulated in the laboratory by inundating flood-intolerant pasture grass leaf material in both the presence of schwertmannite/jarosite (schwertmannite and jarosite treatments) minerals and their absence (control treatment) at 27.5 degrees C for 32 days. The presence of either schwertmannite or jarosite was able to decrease the concentrations of DOC, nutrients (e.g. NH3 and PO43-) and the biological oxygen demand (BOD) in the incubating water compared to the control treatment. Being fresh and labile, the pasture grass material liberated DOC immediately following inundation with a concomitant decrease in dissolved O-2 thereby resulting in anoxic and reducing conditions in the incubating water. With the onset of anoxic and reducing conditions, the biogeochemical cycling of DOC in schwertmannite and jarosite treatments might have proceeded via microbially mediated iron(III) and sulfate reduction and electron shuttling processes. Under anoxic, slightly acidic conditions, microbially mediated iron(III) reduction and subsequent dissolution of schwertmannite and jarosite were triggered by liberating Fe2+, SO42- and alkalinity to the incubating water. The resultant increase in pH led to SO42- reduction in schwertmannite, and the Fe2+ catalysed transformation of both schwertmannite and jarosite to goethite. Schwertmannite almost completely transformed to goethite within two weeks of incubation. Iron(III) in goethite (formed from schwertmannie transformation) was also reduced and likely proceeded via direct microbial reduction or via electron shuttling using the humic acids in the incubating water derived from pasture grass. These findings are highly useful in managing the coastal low lying acid sulfate soils landscapes which are subject to frequent flooding during wet seasons. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Meyers, G; Kapelan, Z; Keedwell, E				Meyers, Gregory; Kapelan, Zoran; Keedwell, Edward			Short-term forecasting of turbidity in trunk main networks	WATER RESEARCH												Water discolouration is an increasingly important and expensive issue due to rising customer expectations, tighter regulatory demands and ageing Water Distribution Systems (WDSs) in the UK and abroad. This paper presents a new turbidity forecasting methodology capable of aiding operational staff and enabling proactive management strategies. The turbidity forecasting methodology developed here is completely data-driven and does not require hydraulic or water quality network model that is expensive to build and maintain. The methodology is tested and verified on a real trunk main network with observed turbidity measurement data. Results obtained show that the methodology can detect if discolouration material is mobilised, estimate if sufficient turbidity will be generated to exceed a preselected threshold and approximate how long the material will take to reach the downstream meter. Classification based forecasts of turbidity can be reliably made up to 5 h ahead although at the expense of increased false alarm rates. The methodology presented here could be used as an early warning system that can enable a multitude of cost beneficial proactive management strategies to be implemented as an alternative to expensive trunk mains cleaning programs.

Linking terrestrial phosphorus inputs to riverine export across the United States	WATER RESEARCH												Humans have greatly accelerated phosphorus (P) flows from land to aquatic ecosystems, causing eutrophication, harmful algal blooms, and hypoxia. A variety of statistical and mechanistic models have been used to explore the relationship between P management on land and P losses to waterways, but our ability to predict P losses from watersheds often relies on small scale catchment studies, where detailed measurements can be made, or global scale models that that are often too coarse-scaled to be used directly in the management decision-making process. Here we constructed spatially explicit datasets of terrestrial P inputs and outputs across the conterminous U.S. (CONUS) for 2012. We use this dataset to improve understanding of P sources and balances at the national scale and to investigate whether well standardized input data at the continental scale can be used to improve predictions of hydrologic P export from watersheds across the U.S. We estimate that in 2012 agricultural lands received 0.19 Tg more P as fertilizer and confined manure than was harvested in major crops. Approximately 0.06 Tg P was lost to waterways as sewage and detergent nationally based on per capita loads in 2012. We compared two approaches for calculating non-agricultural P waste export to waterways, and found that estimates based on per capita P loads from sewage and detergent were 50% greater than Discharge Monitoring Report Pollutant Loading Tool. This suggests that the tool is likely underestimating P export in waste the CONUS scale. TP and DIP concentrations and TP yields were generally correlated more strongly with runoff than with P inputs or P balances, but even the relationships between runoff and P export were weak. Including P inputs as independent variables increased the predictive capacity of the best-fit models by at least 20%, but together inputs and runoff explained 40% of the variance in P concentration and 46-54% of the variance in P yield. By developing and applying a high-resolution P budget for the CONUS this study confirms that both hydrology and P inputs and sinks play important roles in aquatic P loading across a wide range of environments.

Sirajul			The public health significance of latrines discharging to groundwater used for drinking	WATER RESEARCH												Faecal contamination of groundwater from pit latrines is widely perceived as a major threat to the safety of drinking water for several billion people in rural and peri-urban areas worldwide. On the floodplains of the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta in Bangladesh, we constructed latrines and monitored piezometer nests monthly for two years. We detected faecal coliforms (FC) in 3.3-233% of samples at four sites. We differentiate a near-field, characterised by high concentrations and frequent, persistent and contiguous contamination in all directions, and a far-field characterised by rare, impersistent, discontinuous low-level detections in variable directions. Far-field FC concentrations at four sites exceeded 0 and 10 cfu/100 ml in 2.4-9.6% and 0.2-2.3% of sampling events respectively. The lesser contamination of in-situ groundwater compared to water at the point-of-collection from domestic wells, which itself is less contaminated than at the point-of-consumption, demonstrates the importance of recontamination in the well-pump system. We present a conceptual model comprising four sub-pathways: the latrine aquifer interface (near-field); groundwater flowing from latrine to well (far-field); the well-pump system; and post-collection handling and storage. Applying a hypothetical dose-response model suggests that 1-2% of the diarrhoeal disease burden from drinking water is derived from the aquifer, 29% from the well-pump system, and 70% from post-collection handling. The important implications are (i) that leakage from pit latrines is a minor contributor to faecal contamination of drinking water in alluvial deltaic terrains; (ii) fears of increased groundwater pollution should not constrain expanding latrine coverage, and (iii) that more attention should be given to reducing contamination around the well-head.

While beneficial, coagulation or ozonation alone is unable to both efficiently control membrane fouling and product water quality in many cases. Thus, in this study an emerging alternative of ferrous iron/peroxymonosulfate (Fe(II)/PMS), which can act as both an oxidant and a coagulant was employed prior to UF for treatment of natural surface water, and compared with conventional coagulation and ozonation. The results showed that the Fe(II)/PMS-UF system exhibited the best performance for dissolved organic carbon removal, likely due to the dual functions of coagulation and oxidation in the single process. The fluorescent and UV-absorbing organic components were more susceptible to ozonation than Fe(II)/PMS treatment. Fe(II)/PMS and ozonation pretreatments significantly increased the removal efficiency of atrazine, p-chloronitrobenzene and sulfamethazine by 12-76% and 50-94%, respectively, whereas coagulation exerted a minor influence. The Fe(II)/PMS pretreatment also showed the best performance for the reduction of both reversible and irreversible membrane fouling, and the performance was hardly affected by membrane pore size and surface hydrophobicity. In addition, the characterization of hydraulic irreversible organic foulants confirmed its effectiveness. These results demonstrate the potential advantages of applying Fe(II)/PMS as a pretreatment for UF to simultaneously control membrane fouling and improve the permeate quality. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Another common phenomenon at the terminus of pipelines is leakage, which is considered helpful by allowing seepage of low-quality drinking water resulting from long-term stagnation. In this study, the effect of laminar flow on alleviating water quality deterioration under different leakage conditions was investigated, and the potential thresholds of the flow rate, which can affect the iron release process, were discussed. Based on a galvanized pipe and ductile cast iron pipe pilot platform, which was established at the terminus of pipelines, this research was carried out by setting a series of leakage rate gradients to analyze the influence of different leakage flow rates on iron release, as well as the relationship with chemical and biological parameters. The results showed that the water quality parameters were obviously influenced by the change in flow velocity. Water quality was gradually improved with an increase in flow velocity, but its change regularity reflected a diversity under different flow rates (p < 0.05). The iron release was remarkably correlated to the redox potential, dissolved oxygen, pH, iron-oxidized bacteria and sulfate-reducing bacteria. The cumulative total iron release (r = 0.587, p < 0.05) and total iron release rate (r = 0.71, p < 0.022) were significantly influenced by the changes in flow velocity. In short, they tended first to increase and then to decrease with an increasing flow velocity with the threshold as approximately 40% of the critical laminar flow velocity (1.16 x 10(-3) m/s). For the pipes at the terminus of the drinking water distribution system, when the bulk water was at the critical laminar flow velocity, the concentration of total iron, the quantity and rate of total iron release remain relatively in an ideal and safe situation.

However, the accumulation and distribution of harbored elements and microbes in the different niches (loose deposits, PVC-U biofilm, and HDPE biofilm) and their corresponding potential contribution to water quality deterioration remain unknown. This precludes an in-depth understanding of water quality deterioration and the development of proactive management strategies. The present study quantitatively evaluated the distribution of elements, ATP, Aeromonas spp., and bacterial communities in distribution pipes (PVC-U, D = 110 mm, loose deposit and biofilm niches) and household connection pipes (HDPE, D = 32 mm, HDPE biofilm niches) at ten locations in an unchlorinated distribution system. The results show that loose deposits in PVC-U pipes, acting as sinks, constitute a hotspot (highest total amount per meter pipe) for elements, ATP, and target bacteria groups (e.g., Aeromonas spp., Mycobacterium spp., and Legionella spp.). When drinking water distribution system niches with harbored elements and microbes become sources in the event of disturbances, the highest quality deterioration potential (QDP) is that of HDPE biofilm; this can be attributed to its high surface-to-volume ratio. 16s rRNA analysis demonstrates that, at the genus level, the bacterial communities in the water, loose deposits, PVC-U biofilm, and HDPE biofilm were dominated, respectively, by Polaromorws spp. (2-23%), Nitrosipra spp. (1-47%), Flavobacterium spp. (1-36%), and Flavobacterium spp. (5-67%). The combined results of elemental composition and bacterial community analyses indicate that different dominant bio-chemical processes might occur within the different niches for example, iron arsenic oxidizing in loose deposits, bio-calumniation in PVC-U biofilm, and methane oxidizing in HDPE biofilm. The release of 20% loose deposits, 20% PVC-U biofilm and 10% HDPE biofilm will cause significant changes of water bacterial community. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Benthic cyanobacteria: A source of cylindrospermopsin and microcystin in Australian drinking water reservoirs	WATER RESEARCH												Cyanobacteria represent a health hazard worldwide due to their production of a range of highly potent toxins in diverse aquatic environments. While planktonic species have been the subject of many investigations in terms of risk assessment, little is known about benthic forms and their impact on water quality or human and animal health. This study aimed to purify isolates from environmental benthic biofilms sampled from three different drinking water reservoirs and to assess their toxin production by using the following methods: Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and quantitative PCR (qPCR). Microscopic observation of the isolates allowed the identification of various filamentous cyanobacterial genera: Anabaena (benthic form), Calothrix and Nostoc from the Nostocales and Geitlerinema, Leptolyngbya, Limnothrix, Lyngbya, Oxynema, Phormidium and Pseudanabaena representing non-heterocystous filamentous cyanobacteria. The Phormidium ambiguum strain AWQC-PHO021 was found to produce 739 ng/mg of dry weight (d/w) of cylindrospermopsin and 107 ng/mg (d/w) of deoxycylindrospermopsin. The Nostoc linckia strain AWQC-NOS001 produced 400 ng/mg (d/w) of a microcystin analogue. This is the first report of hepatotoxin production by benthic cyanobacteria in temperate Australian drinking water reservoirs. These findings indicate that water quality monitoring programs need to consider benthic cyanobacteria as a potential source of toxins. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The implications of drought and water conservation on the reuse of municipal wastewater: Recognizing impacts and identifying mitigation possibilities	WATER RESEARCH												As water agencies continue to investigate opportunities to increase resilience and local water supply reliability in the face of drought and rising water scarcity, water conservation strategies and the reuse of treated municipal wastewater are garnering significant attention and adoption. Yet a simple water balance thought experiment illustrates that drought, and the conservation strategies that are often enacted in response to it, both likely limit the role reuse may play in improving local water supply reliability. For instance, as a particular drought progresses and agencies enact water conservation measures to cope with drought, Influent flows likely decrease while influent pollution concentrations increase, particularly salinity, which adversely affects wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) costs and effluent quality and flow. Consequently, downstream uses of this effluent, whether to maintain streamflow and quality, groundwater recharge, or irrigation may be impacted. This is unfortunate since reuse is often heralded as a drought-proof mechanism to increase resilience. The objectives of this paper are two-fold. First, we illustrate using a case study from Southern California during its most recent drought how drought and water conservation strategies combine to reduce influent flow and quality and, subsequently, effluent flow and quality. Second, we use a recently developed regional water reuse decision support model (RWRM) to highlight cost-effective strategies that can be implemented to mitigate the impacts of drought on effluent water quality. While the solutions we identify cannot increase the flow of influent or effluent coming into or out of a treatment plant, they can improve the value of the remaining effluent in a cost-effective manner that takes into account the characteristics of its demand, whether it be for landscaping, golf courses, agricultural irrigation, or surface water augmentation.

Multiparametric monitoring of microbial faecal pollution reveals the dominance of human contamination along the whole Danube River	WATER RESEARCH												The microbial faecal pollution of rivers has wide-ranging impacts on a variety of human activities that rely on appropriate river water quality. Thus, detailed knowledge of the extent and origin of microbial faecal pollution is crucial for watershed management activities to maintain safe water use. In this study, the microbial faecal pollution levels were monitored by standard faecal indicator bacteria (SFIB) along a 2580 km stretch of the Danube, the world's most international river, as well as the Danube's most important tributaries. To track the origin of faecal pollution, host-associated Bacteroidetes genetic faecal marker qPCR assays for different host groups were applied in concert with. SFIB. The. spatial resolution analysis was followed by a time resolution analysis of faecal pollution patterns over 1 year at three selected sites. In this way, a comprehensive faecal pollution map of the total length of the Danube was created, combining substantiated information on both the extent and origin of microbial faecal pollution. Within the environmental data matrix for the river, microbial faecal pollution constituted an independent component and did not cluster with any other measured environmental parameters. Generally, midstream samples representatively depicted the microbial pollution levels at the respective river sites. However, at a few, somewhat unexpected sites, high pollution levels occurred in the lateral zones of the river while the midstream zone had good water quality. Human faecal pollution was demonstrated as the primary pollution source along the whole river, while animal faecal pollution was of minor importance. This study demonstrates that the application of host-associated genetic microbial source tracking markers in concert with the traditional concept of microbial faecal pollution monitoring based on SFIB significantly enhances the knowledge of the extent and origin of microbial faecal pollution patterns in large rivers. It constitutes a powerful tool to guide target-oriented water quality management in large river basins. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Addressing industrial structure upgrading and spatial optimization based on water environment carrying capacity has become an urgent issue. This paper establishes an analytical framework that uses a combination of economic and water environment information for industrial structure upgrading and spatial optimization based on water environment carrying capacity. This framework promotes the practical application of water environment carrying capacity theory for socio-ecological sustainability. The input-output table, information entropy method and a simulation platform of water environment carrying capacity using a multi-agent system are integrated into the analytical framework. A spatial assessment of the water environment carrying capacity, industrial structure upgrading and spatial optimization is performed for Changzhou, China. With the measures implementation of industrial structure upgrading and spatial optimization, the economic scale of the electrical equipment and machinery industry, which is the most important industry in Changzhou City, would reach 126,814.68 billion yuan, nearly 73 times its current value. In addition, the total local industrial economy would reach 3319.81 billion yuan, nearly 1.6 times its current scale. Due to the industrial concentration, the increased economic scale would create additional benefits, including the whole study region reaching the water quality goal and the water quality in urban areas significantly improving. The measures of industrial structure upgrading and spatial optimization would help to achieve a mutually beneficial balance between environmental protection and economic development. The analytical framework establishes the internal link between industrial structure upgrading and spatial optimization based on the water environment carrying capacity. The links from water quality to industrial structure upgrading and spatial optimization are also established. These connections could support the fine-scale management of water environments and could help local governments to plan sustainable socio-ecologic development. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, ultrasonic (US) treatment has been well-known as an advanced treatment process for the removal of complex inorganic and organic contaminants in water and WW. US treatment has shown substantial advantages, such as cleanliness, safety, energy savings, and negligible or no secondary pollution products. This review provides a summary of recent research on the removal of EDCs and PPCPs by US treatment and also provides information valuable for applications of US treatment in water and WW treatment. The removal of numerous EDCs and PPCPs of different classes was reviewed based on the current literature to (i) address key factors (water quality conditions (pH, temperature, background common ions, and promoters/scavengers), US frequency, power, and reactor type) influencing the sonodegradation of EDCs and PPCPs and their intermediates during US treatment, (ii) evaluate the effects of various catalysts and hybrid processes on sonodegradation, and (iii) discuss EDC and PPCP removal according to their properties. Additionally, areas of future research in US treatment for the removal of EDCs and PPCPs from water are suggested. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The phosphate adsorption by RC-BOFS was rapid in the first 0.5 h and the pseudo-second-order kinetic model fit the data better than the pseudo-first-order kinetic model. The maximum phosphate adsorption capacities of RC-BOFS under different pH were in the following order: 3.57 mg P g(-1) (pH 5) > 2.47 mg P g(-1) (pH 7) > 1.46 mg P g(-1) (pH 9). Small-size RC-BOFS (0.8-2.3 mm) was more efficient with 23% higher phosphate adsorption than big-size RC-BOFS (2.3-4.6 mm). Characterization of RC-BOFS before and after phosphate adsorption by XRD, FTIR and SEM-EDS indicated that phosphate adsorption by RC-BOFS was dominated by metal oxide and precipitation by calcium and was closely related to the slag chemical properties. The phosphate saturation time in constructed wetland with coarse sand was predicted about 292 days, whereas the longevity of constructed wetland with adding about 25% RC-BOFS to the coarse sand can significantly increase up to 1349 days. It was concluded that the horizontal flow constructed wetland with sand 75%: RC-BOFS 25% ratio could achieve high phosphate removal rate and near-neutral pH for meeting the acceptable water quality discharge standard from water treatment plant.

Investigating the effects of heat activated persulfate on the degradation of furfural, a component of hydraulic fracturing fluid chemical additives	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL												Improper well casings and produced water handling can lead to hydraulic fracturing fluid migration and groundwater pollution. Interactions among the chemical components can cause compositional changes in hydraulic fracturing fluids. This study focuses on degradation or transformations of 3furfuraldehyde (or furfural) by activated-persulfate oxidation, two chemicals reported in hydraulic fracturing additives. As hydraulic fracturing conditions may be conducive to persulfate activation, the degradation of furfural was examined using elevated temperatures, varying persulfate dosing and Fe (III) concentration, initial pH, and the presence of other chemical additives (e.g., a gelling agent and an enzyme breaking agent). Experiments showed furfural degradation using activated persulfate followed pseudo-first order kinetics with respect to the furfural concentration. Impacts of pH and ferric sulfate concentrations were investigated at different temperatures and the results were fit to the Arrhenius model to establish the activation energy. Decreasing the pH to 2.54 caused an increase in the furfural removal. The addition of ferric sulfate to solutions with pH 5.4 had no impact on the activation energy of furfural oxidation, which was 107 kJ mol(-1), while decreasing the pH to 2.54 allowed for the activation energy to decrease to 75 kJ mol(-1). Quenching with methanol and tert-butyl alcohol indicated significant hydroxyl radical contributions to furfural degradation compared to sulfate radicals during thermal persulfate activation in the presence of iron and acidic conditions. Furthermore, furfural degradation was monitored in the presence of other hydraulic fracturing chemical additives establishing furfural degradation does not occur as rapidly. However, furfural does still degrade in this matrix and this indicates that persulfate may break down other chemicals in hydraulic fracturing fluids more preferentially than the target gelling agent.

Susceptibility of Goethite to Fe2+-Catalyzed Recrystallization over Time	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Recent work has shown that iron oxides, such as goethite and hematite, may recrystallize in the presence of aqueous Fe2+ under anoxic conditions. This process, referred to as Fe2+-catalyzed recrystallization, can influence water quality by causing the incorporation/release of environmental contaminants and biological nutrients. Accounting for the effects of Fe2+-catalyzed recrystallization on water quality requires knowing the time scale over which recrystallization occurs. Here, we tested the hypothesis that nanoparticulate goethite becomes less susceptible to Fe2+-catalyzed recrystallization over time. We set up two batches of reactors in which Fe-55(2+) tracer was added at two different time points and tracked the Fe-55 partitioning in the aqueous and goethite phases over 60 days. Less Fe-55 uptake occurred between 30 and 60 days than between 0 and 30 days, suggesting goethite recrystallization slowed with time. Fitting the data with a box model indicated that 17% of the goethite recrystallized after 30 days of reaction, and an additional 2% recrystallized between 30 and 60 days. The decreasing susceptibility of goethite to recrystallize as it reacted with aqueous Fe2+ suggested that recrystallization is likely only an important process over short time scales.

Acid Rock Drainage Treatment Using Membrane Distillation: Impacts of Chemical-Free Pretreatment on Scale Formation, Pore Wetting, and Product Water Quality	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Acid rock drainage (ARD) is a metal-rich wastewater that forms upon oxidation of sulfidic minerals. Although ARD impacts >12,000 miles of rivers in the U.S. and has an estimated cleanup cost of $32-$72 billion, the low pH and high metal concentrations in ARD make rapid, high volume treatment without chemical addition difficult. This research focuses on a novel method of ARD treatment, membrane distillation (MD). In MD, heated ARD is separated from a cooled distillate by a hydrophobic, water-excluding membrane. Because water only passes through the membrane in the vapor phase, nonvolatile sulfate and heavy metals are retained in the concentrate stream. A preliminary in silico analysis using an electrolyte thermodynamic model indicated that MD of 10 different mine wastes yields product water containing no contaminants at concentrations >0.2 ppm. MD tests of synthetic ARD used a similar to 34 degrees C temperature difference, operated at 80% recovery, and produced an initial flux of 38.4 +/- 1.1 L.m(-2).h(-1). This flux decreased slightly after scaling by iron oxyhydroxide; however, membranes maintained >99% dissolved solids rejection. Both flux decline and membrane scale formation decreased after a chemical-free, thermal precipitation pretreatment. These results indicate that MD can purify contaminated, acidic wastewater using low-grade heat sources, such as geothermal energy, without chemical addition.

Distribution System Operational Deficiencies Coincide with Reported Legionnaires' Disease Clusters in Flint, Michigan	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												We hypothesize that the increase in reported Legionnaires disease from June 2014 to November 2015 in Genesee County, MI (where Flint is located) was directly linked to the switch to corrosive Flint River water from noncorrosive Detroit water from April 2014 to October 2015. To address the lack of epidemiological data linking the drinking water supplies to disease incidence, we gathered physiochemical and biological water quality data from 2010 to 2016 to evaluate characteristics of the Flint River water that were potentially conducive to Legionella growth. The treated Flint River water was 8.6 times more corrosive than Detroit water in short-term testing, releasing more iron, which is a key Legionella nutrient, while also directly causing disinfectant to decay more rapidly. The Flint River water source was also 0.8-6.7 degrees C warmer in summer months than Detroit water and exceeded the minimum Legionella growth temperature of 20 degrees C more frequently (average number of days per year for Detroit was 63 versus that for the Flint River, which was 157). The corrosive water also led to 1.3-2.2 times more water main breaks in 2014-2015 compared to 2010-2013; such disruptions have been associated with outbreaks in other locales. Importantly, Legionella spp. and Legionella pneumophila decreased after switching back to Detroit water, in terms of both gene markers and culturability, when August and October 2015 were compared to November 2016.

In the ZHZ, NaP1 zeolite was covered with hydrous zirconia, which existed as an amorphous phase. Experimental results in pond water indicated that ZHZ could efficiently remove soluble reactive phosphorus. The 28-day sediment incubation experiments showed that capping sediment with ZHZ resulted in a more efficient, rapid and sustained decrease in P concentration when compared with the traditional alum treatment method. Furthermore, ZHZ increased the sediment stability, resulting in. the lowest turbidity, total phosphorus and soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations in overlying water following artificially induced resuspension of sediment. Phosphorus fractionation of sediment showed that the dominant P form transferred from HCl-extractable P to residual P, and the most release-sensitive P (labile P and reductant reactive P) was decreased after ZHZ application. Overall, ZHZ is a highly effective P-immobilization material. ZHZ has high potential as a sediment capping material to control internal P loading in eutrophic water bodies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This so-called 'aliasing' phenomenon is poorly recognised in water research. Using advances in in-situ sensor technology it is now possible to monitor sufficiently frequently to avoid the onset of aliasing. A systems modelling procedure is presented allowing objective identification of sampling rates needed to avoid aliasing within strongly rainfall-driven chemical dynamics. In this study aliasing of storm chemograph shapes was quantified by changes in the time constant parameter (TC) of transfer functions. As a proportion of the original TC, the onset of aliasing varied between watersheds, ranging from 3.9-7.7 to 54-79 %TC (or 110-160 to 300 -600 min). However, a minimum monitoring rate could be identified for all datasets if the modelling results were presented in the form of a new statistic, Delta TC. For the eight H+, DOC and NO3-N datasets examined from a range of watershed settings, an empirically-derived threshold of 1.3(Delta TC) could be used to quantify minimum monitoring rates within sampling protocols to avoid artefacts in subsequent data analysis.

Design of waste stabilization pond systems: A review	WATER RESEARCH												A better design instruction for waste stabilization ponds is needed due to their growing application for wastewater purification, increasingly strict environmental regulations, and the fact that most of previous design manuals are outdated. To critically review model-based designs of typical pond treatment systems, this paper analyzed more than 150 articles, books, and reports from 1956 to 2016. The models developed in these publications ranged from simple rules and equations to more complex first-order and mechanistic models. From a case study on all four approaches, it appeared that rules of thumb is no longer a proper tool for pond designs due to its low design specification and very high output variability and uncertainty. On the other hand, at the beginning phase of design process or in case of low pressure over land and moderate water quality required, regression equations can be useful to form an idea for pond dimensions. More importantly, mechanistic models proved their capacity of generating more precise and comprehensive designs but still need to overcome their lack of calibration and validation, and overparameterization. In another case study, an essential but often overlooked role of uncertainty analysis in pond designs was investigated via a comparison between deterministic and uncertainty based approaches. Unlike applying a safety factor representing all uncertainty sources, probabilistic designs quantify the uncertainty of model outputs by including prior uncertainty of inputs and parameters, which generates more scientifically reliable outcomes for decision makers. Based on these findings, we advise engineers and designers to shift from the conventional approaches to more innovative and economic tools which are suitable for dealing with large variations of natural biological systems.

Effective removal of phosphate from aqueous solution using humic acid coated magnetite nanoparticles	WATER RESEARCH												Effective removal of excess phosphate from water is critical to counteract eutrophication and restore water quality. In this study, low cost, environmentally friendly humic acid coated magnetite nano particles (HA-MNP) were synthesized and applied for the remediation of phosphate from aqueous media. The HA-MNPs, characterized by FTIR, TEM and HAADF-STEM showed the extensive coating of humic acid on the magnetite surface. The magnetic nanoparticles with diameters of 7-12 nm could be easily separated from the reaction mixture by using a simple hand held magnet. Adsorption studies demonstrate the fast and effective separation of phosphate with maximum adsorption capacity of 28.9 mg/g at pH 6.6. The adsorption behavior follows the Freundlich isotherm suggesting the formation of nonuniform multilayers of phosphate on the heterogeneous surface of HA-MNP. The adsorption kinetic fits the pseudo-second order model well with rate constants of 0.206 +/- 0.003, 0.073 +/- 0.002 and 0.061 +/- 0.003 g mg(-1) min(-1) for phosphate (P) concentrations of 2, 5 and 10 mg/L respectively. The removal of phosphate was found higher at acidic and neutral pH compared to basic conditions. The nanoparticles exhibit good selectivity and adsorption efficiency for phosphate in presence of co-existing ions such as Cl-, SO42- and NO3- with some inhibition effect by CO32-. The effect of temperature on the adsorption reveals that the process is endothermic and spontaneous. HA-MNPs are promising, simple, environmentally friendly materials for the removal of phosphate from aqueous media. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This study generated microcosms that mimicked riverbank sediment resuspension into the water of a typical Mediterranean river as a consequence of heavy rainfall. The mobilization and inactivation of six fecal pollution indicators and microbial source tracking markers were evaluated. The T-90 values in the sediments were: 4 days for sorbitol-fermenting Bifidobacterium, 11 days for culturable E. coli, 36 days for bacteriophages infecting Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron strain GA17 and more than 42 days for qPCR-detected E. coli, somatic coliphages and sulfite-reducing clostridia spores. Bacteriophages and bacteria showed different resuspension and sedimentation patterns. The data obtained could be used in predictive models to assess the effects of climate change on surface water quality. Pathogen mobilization into the water column poses a risk for humans, animals and the natural environment, and breaches the One Health approach. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Development of a bioanalytical test battery for water quality monitoring: Fingerprinting identified micropollutants and their Contribution to effects in surface water	WATER RESEARCH												Surface waters can contain a diverse range of organic pollutants, including pesticides, pharmaceuticals and industrial compounds. While bioassays have been used for water quality monitoring, there is limited knowledge regarding the effects of individual micropollutants and their relationship to the overall mixture effect in water samples. In this study, a battery of in vitro bioassays based on human and fish cell lines and whole organism assays using bacteria, algae, daphnids and fish embryos was assembled for use in water quality monitoring. The selection of bioassays was guided by the principles of adverse outcome pathways in order to cover relevant steps in toxicity pathways known to be triggered by environmental water samples. The effects of 34 water pollutants, which were selected based on hazard quotients, available environmental quality standards and mode of action information, were fingerprinted in the bioassay test battery. There was a relatively good agreement between the experimental results and available literature effect data. The majority of the chemicals were active in the assays indicative of apical effects, while fewer chemicals had a response in the specific reporter gene assays, but these effects were typically triggered at lower concentrations. The single chemical effect data were used to improve published mixture toxicity modeling of water samples from the Danube River. While there was a slight increase in the fraction of the bioanalytical equivalents explained for the Danube River samples, for some endpoints less than 1% of the observed effect could be explained by the studied chemicals. The new mixture models essentially confirmed previous findings from many studies monitoring water quality using both chemical analysis and bioanalytical tools. In short, our results indicate that many more chemicals contribute to the biological effect than those that are typically quantified by chemical monitoring programs or those regulated by environmental quality standards.

An experimental study on the influence of water stagnation and temperature change on water quality in a full-scale domestic drinking water system	WATER RESEARCH												The drinking water quality changes during the transport through distribution systems. Domestic drinking water systems (DDWSs), which include the plumbing between the water meter and consumer's taps, are the most critical points in which water quality may be affected. In distribution networks, the drinking water temperature and water residence time are regarded as indicators of the drinking water quality. This paper describes an experimental research on the influence of stagnation time and temperature change on drinking water quality in a full-scale DDWS. Two sets of stagnation experiments, during winter and summer months, with various stagnation intervals (up to 168 h of stagnation) were carried out. Water and biofilms were sampled at two different taps, a kitchen and a shower tap. Results from this study indicate that temperature and water stagnation affect both chemical and microbial quality in DDWSs, whereas microbial parameters in stagnant water appear to be driven by the temperature of fresh water. Biofilm formed in the shower pipe contained more total and intact cells than the kitchen pipe biofilm. Alphaproteobacteria were found to dominate in the shower biofilm (78% of all Proteobacteria), while in the kitchen tap biofilm Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria were evenly distributed.

Modelling the transport and decay processes of microbial tracers in a macro-tidal estuary	WATER RESEARCH												The Loughor Estuary is a macro-tidal coastal basin, located along the Bristol Channel, in the South West of the U.K. The maximum spring tidal range in the estuary is up to 7.5 m, near Burry Port Harbour. This estuarine region can experience severe coastal flooding during high spring tides, including extreme flooding of the intertidal saltmarshes at Llanrhidian, as well as the lower industrial and residential areas at Llanelli and Gowerton. The water quality of this estuarine basin needs to comply with the designated standards for safe recreational bathing and shellfish harvesting industries. The waterbody however, potentially receives overloading of bacterial inputs that enter the estuarine system from both point and diffuse sources. Therefore, a microbial tracer study was carried out to get a better understanding of the faecal bacteria sources and to enable a hydro-environmental model to be refined and calibrated for both advection and dispersion transport. A two-dimensional hydro-environmental model has been refined and extended to predict the highest water level covering the intertidal floodplains of the Loughor Estuary. The validated hydrodynamic model for both water levels and currents, was included with the injected mass of microbial tracer, i.e. MS2 coliphage from upstream of the estuary, and modelled as a non-conservative tracer over several tidal cycles through the system. The calibration and validation of the transport and decay of microbial tracer was undertaken, by comparing the model results and the measured data at two different sampling locations. The refined model developed as a part of this study, was used to acquire a better understanding of the water quality processes and the potential sources of bacterial pollution in the estuary.

Health risks from exposure to untreated wastewater used for irrigation in the Mezquital Valley, Mexico: A 25-year update	WATER RESEARCH												Wastewater reuse for agriculture is common worldwide; wastewater treatment, however, is rare in many countries, leading to high potential for exposure to harmful pathogens. Mexico City, one of the largest producers of untreated wastewater for agricultural use worldwide, was the site of key epidemiologic studies conducted in the 1990s. We both reviewed the literature on and conducted a cross-sectional study of diarrheal risk and wastewater contamination to provide an updated assessment of health risks and to inform an upcoming update of the 2006 WHO guidelines on wastewater reuse. We surveyed communities in the Mezquital Valley that use wastewater for irrigation and communities that use well water to compare the prevalence of self-reported diarrheal disease in children under five years old. Wastewater, well water, household environmental samples, and stool samples were collected and analyzed. Communities exposed to wastewater had a higher one-week prevalence of diarrhea (10%) compared to unexposed communities (5%). This association remained in an adjusted modified Poisson regression model (PR = 2.31, 95% CI 1.00, 531), but not when limited to households engaged in agriculture. Water quality indicators document differences between irrigation water from the two community groups. These results are in agreement with 25 population studies identified by our review that were conducted since or not included in the 2006 WHO guidelines and show consistent negative impacts of wastewater exposure on health. While overall diarrheal prevalence has declined when compared to studies conducted over 25 years ago in the same region, the association of diarrheal disease and wastewater exposure has remained and possibly increased. With rising urbanization worldwide, attention to these risks and wastewater treatment is becoming increasingly important. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The use of reclaimed municipal wastewater for this purpose was demonstrated by numerous studies and full-scale installations. On the other hand, reuse of industrial effluents in irrigation is uncommon and the knowledge in this field is limited. This work aims at assessing the suitability of agro-industrial effluent reuse for irrigation. In the case study presented, a full-scale tertiary treatment based on membrane ultrafiltration and UV disinfection was tested at an agro-industrial site in Apulia (Italy). The wastewater treatment plant processed the stream produced at a vegetable canning factory, and the treated effluents were used for field scale irrigation tests. The variability of wastewater quality and its effects on treatment process performances and reclaimed water quality were investigated. An economic evaluation of the full scale tertiary treatment was also performed. The results showed that the adopted technologies effectively removed suspended solids and the faecal indicator Escherichia coli below the local standards for reuse in irrigation. Furthermore, the use of treated agro-industrial wastewater had no inhibitory effects on the growth of tomato and broccoli, neither resulted in any faecal contamination of crops. In general, the present study shows that reuse of treated wastewater for irrigation is a suitable practice to close the water cycle in the agro-industrial sector. This is very important in areas where the sustainability of agriculture and transformation activities depends on the water available for irrigation. This practice also avoids the discharge of pollutants into water bodies, reducing the environmental impacts of agro-industrial productions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In storage ecosystems, the natural process of solar light irradiation plays a key role in water quality, altering disinfection byproduct formation potential in later use. This study investigated changes in haloacetamide formation potential (HAcAm FP) during subsequent chloramination when reclaimed water was exposed to solar light irradiation. Significant decreases in HAcAm FP were observed for the solar light irradiated reclaimed water, with reductions of 27%-69% for different haloacetamides. Moreover, transformation of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) to inorganic nitrogen occurred during irradiation. The application of N-15-labeled monochloramine indicated that the nitrogen source of the decreased HAcAms mainly originated from DON, rather than chloramine. Chloramination of the model compound L-asparagine after irradiation demonstrated that the decreased HAcAms could be attributed to the decrease in DON. After solar light irradiation, the brominated HAcAm FP in the presence of bromide was also reduced, while the bromine incorporation factor remained steady. Overall, this study revealed the contribution of natural processes in controlling HAcAm FP during subsequent chloramination, suggesting solar light irradiation is important to water purification during reclaimed water storage.

Herein, a superstructural phosphate scavenger, La-MOF-500, composed of La2O2CO3, is rationally designed by derivation from lanthanum metal organic frameworks (La(1,3,5-BTC)(H2O)(6)) by calcination. La-MOF-500 has a hierarchical micro/nano structure of microsphere-nanorod-nanoparticle: urchin-like microsphere is comprised of many nanorods and the individual nanorod was formed by piling up plentiful thin nanoparticles. The hierarchical micro/nano structure provides La-MOF-500 with an intriguing phosphate capture capacity of 173.8 mg P/g and a high utilization of lanthanum active sites, simultaneously, which was a challenge in previous research. Moreover, La-MOF-500 exhibits a good tolerance of foreign species. Even in the water from Songhua River (China), La-MOF-500 can remove phosphate to be less than 10 mu g P/L. This development is expected to be meaningful for practical water purification. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, environmental fate models developed for traditional contaminants are limited in their ability to simulate nanomaterials' environmental behavior by incomplete understanding and representation of the processes governing nanomaterial distribution in the environment and by scarce empirical data quantifying the interaction of nanomaterials with environmental surfaces. In this study, the well-known Water Quality Analysis Simulation Program (WASP) was updated to incorporate particle collision rate and particle attachment efficiency to simulate multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) fate and transport in surface waters. Heteroaggregation attachment efficiencies (alpha(het)) values derived from sediment attachment studies are used to parametrize WASP for simulation of MWCNTs transport in Brier Creek, a coastal plain river located in central eastern Georgia, and a tributary to the Savannah River. Simulations using a constant MWCNT load of 0.1 kg d(-1) in the uppermost Brier Creek water segment showed that MWCNTs were present predominantly in the Brier Creek water column, while downstream MWCNT surface and deep sediment concentrations exhibited a general increase with time and distance from the source, suggesting that MWCNT releases could have increasing ecological impacts in the benthic region over long time frames.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				OCT 3	2017	51	19					11174	11184		10.1021/acs.est.7b01477								WOS:000412716500029	28876918

The influences of feed pH (3.0-10.0), feed total dissolved solids (TDS) (1182-5319 mg L-1) and feed dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (0.54-2.43 mg L-1) on the separating efficiencies of two different NF membranes (Thin-Film Composite (DL) and Polyamide (DK)) were investigated. In addition, long-term operation for 580 h was also conducted by the superior NF membrane to evaluate the performance stability and fouling potential after a number of subsequent cleaning cycles. Within the scope of the test, NF separating performance in terms of salt rejection showed different changing tendencies: V-shaped curve for pH, inverted V-shaped curve for TDS and linear curve for DOC. While in general, specific permeate flux was reduced in different degrees except for DK membrane with feed pH variation. The observed separating performance decline with operating time was mainly due to the scale formation on the NF membrane surface, which was rinsed effectively (FR1 = 97.80% and RR1 = 61.63%; FR2 = 95.40% and RR2 = 49.35%) by chemical cleaning, as certified by FESEM - EDX and AFM images.																	2214-7144					OCT	2017	19						147	155		10.1016/j.jwpe.2017.07.021								WOS:000431411100020

We present an overview of deep-well recharge applications which have taken place in the Netherlands over the last two decades. We present the purpose of each application, the issues which had to be resolved, the preventive measures which were taken to improve performance and the lessons learned from each experience. Examples are given of applications which aimed at the storage of water for drinking and other purposes such as irrigation, achieving environmental goals and disposal of wastewater. Applications aiming at drinking water production usually faced issues related to the quality of the abstracted water not meeting drinking water standards with respect to various elements, such as iron, manganese and arsenic. Storage of water in brackish aquifers was complicated by buoyancy effects making part of the recharged water irrecoverable. Recharge of water with the purpose of recovering declined groundwater tables and fighting seawater intrusion was hindered by clogging of the injection well while the disposal of wastewater was limited to aquifers of lower groundwater quality.																	1606-9749					OCT	2017	17	5					1201	1211		10.2166/ws.2017.032								WOS:000417944300001

The paper presents a conceptual framework and typology to assess watershed ecological restoration based on the properties and processes of sustainable watershed development. According to multiple life stages, habitat properties and existing legal frameworks and applicable valuation approaches, the bio-indicator that integrates natural, political and socio-economic dimensions is proposed. With existing assessment results and official web-pages as references, evaluation systems concerning human impacts on aquatic systems are set forth. Suitable aquatic bio-indicators can standardize the monitoring methodology with respect to water quality, organic pollutants and pesticides, generation time, migration ability, saprobic status, taxonomic composition and diversity. A large number of fish-based indexes have been developed to monitor and manage river ecosystems. Biophysical and statistical models are being used to identify influential stream variables that correlate with macroinvertebrate indices. A probabilistic fuzzy hybrid model to assess river water quality is proposed. The method and process of ecological risk assessment are provided based on adaptive management principles. The environmental sustainability index (ESI) is used to estimate the degree of environmental restoration sustainability with the emergy triangle as a reference.																	1606-9749					OCT	2017	17	5					1232	1240		10.2166/ws.2017.017								WOS:000417944300005

The treatment scheme was: (1) As(III) in contaminated water is oxidized by arsenite-oxidizing bacteria fixed in the sponges in the reactor; (2) Fe(II) naturally existing in the water is oxidized by dissolved oxygen; (3) Fe(III) is precipitated as iron hydroxide and As(V) is co-precipitated with the iron hydroxide; and finally (4) the co-precipitates are fixed in the sponges. This system could remove As from As-contaminated water on a small scale and at low cost. The results showed that, after using the DHS reactor, As and Fe concentrations in the treated water were lower than water quality standards for drinking water when Fe(II) concentration in the influent was lower than 10 mg/L and the Fe/As ratio was higher than 6.67-8.42, with dependence on the Fe concentration. Additionally, even if Fe concentration is higher than 10 mg/L, the treatment system is still applicable if the pH of the influent is higher than 7 or the retention time is longer than 2 h.																	1606-9749					OCT	2017	17	5					1249	1259		10.2166/ws.2017.025								WOS:000417944300007

Investigation of natural organic matter (NOM) character and its removal in a chlorinated and chloraminated system at Rand Water, South Africa	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												In its natural environment, natural organic matter (NOM) is not problematic. However, during water treatment NOM does affect water quality specifically during the disinfection step, where if NOM is present it reacts with disinfectants resulting in the formation of disinfection by-products. To emphasize the importance of NOM monitoring during potable water treatment this study aimed to characterize NOM and evaluate NOM removal by a conventional water treatment plant considering seasonal trends. NOM was characterized by making use of NOM polarity and specific ultraviolet absorbance. NOM removal was monitored with high-performance size exclusion chromatography, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and UV254 analyses. The polarity rapid assessment method indicated that the hydrophobic and hydrophilic NOM fractions within the surface water increased during a period of heavy rain when floods occurred, but conversely decreased during an average rain season. Although NOM character showed variability during the 5-year study period, seasonal relationship during high and low flow seasons between aromatic NOM and total trihalomethane (TTHM) formation was not evident. Aromatic NOM was not the only precursor to TTHM formation, which stresses the need to implement advanced NOM characterization techniques during NOM monitoring to study reactivity of the individual NOM fraction with the disinfectant used at the water treatment plant.

In this study, we conducted high-frequency, synchronous field observations of meteorology, hydrology, and water quality to determine the relationship between sediment release rate and wind speed in the central region of Lake Taihu. We combined these results with our previous findings from other regions to establish the temporal-spatial variation in sediment release patterns for this lake. We then calculated the annual total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) release fluxes. We constructed an environmental fluid dynamics code (EFDC) model; we then loaded the temporal-spatial variation parameters and simulated the effects on different TN and TP concentrations. Overall, the following results were observed: (1) the critical wind speed at which sediment was first suspended in the central region of the lake was 4 m/s, and the fitted curve of the sediment release rate and wind speed was r = 144.7x - 100 (R-2 = 0.851); and (2) the annual TN and TP release fluxes of Lake Taihu were approximately 3,086 and 740 tons, respectively.

Evaluation of the potential impact of Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam and pumping scenarios on groundwater level in the Nile Delta aquifer	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												The main objective of this study is to evaluate the potential impact of Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) and pumping scenarios on groundwater level by a three- dimensional groundwater model of the Nile Delta using MODFLOW software. The Nile Delta has highly intensive irrigation canal networks that share yearly about 35.5 km(3) of water. In this study, an integrated three- dimensional groundwater model is built considering the actual condition of the irrigation canals and their recharges of the Nile Delta aquifer. The model was calibrated for estimating the vertical and hydraulic conductivity. The model was run for three scenarios: (1) reduction of water depth in canals, (2) increasing pumping discharge from the aquifer and (3) combination between the first and second scenarios. Results reveal that the effect of increasing the pumping discharge on groundwater level in the Nile Delta is more significant than decreasing the water depth of the canals network due to the fact of the existence of the upper clay layer which reduces the amount of water penetrating and reaching the groundwater in the aquifer. The last scenario presents the worst case as the average drawdown reached 1.26 m, 1.7 m and 1.35 m in the western, central and eastern parts of the Nile Delta respectively. The study results should be taken in account for studying the saltwater intrusion and climate change impacts on the Nile Delta region.

Statistical assessment of water quality of a Ramsar site wetland	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												This study was conducted to evaluate the wetland water quality (WWQ) over a period of 3 years and establish relationships between these qualities using Ramsar site Uchali Wetland, Pakistan (32 degrees 33'N, 72 degrees 01'E). WWQ data obtained were subjected to summary statistics, generalized linear model (glm), correlation, covariance and cluster analysis. The glm of the monthly mean water indices showed that the mean returned for pH (2.57) was not significant while means for others were significant (p< 0.05). The correlation analysis of the WWQ indices indicated that 56% of the pairing indices were inversely correlated while 44% were directly correlated and three piles of clusters of WWQ indices were distinct. The wetland water is not very safe for drinking but safe for other non- domestic uses since it contains fewer microbes and the water health model as arrived at in this study provides a management protocol for wetland water.

Hydrochemical characteristics and quality assessment of urban groundwater in Urmia City, NW Iran	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality and hydrochemical characteristics of urban groundwater in Urmia City, northwest of Iran. In order, 59 groundwater samples were collected and analyzed for various anions and cations. Result shows that, mineral weathering, ion exchange and anthropogenic activity are the main hydrochemical processes controlling urban groundwater chemistry. The evaluation of groundwater geochemistry in the flow path beneath the urban area shows that, due to land use changes, the hydrochemical change occurs predominantly in electrical conductivity (EC), Cl- and NO3. The EC is increased in the direction of groundwater flow and in the last decade in industrial areas. According to the groundwater quality index values, most of the samples fit into the good quality class and samples with poor quality are located in the old residential, parks and agricultural areas of the city. The calculation of the irrigation water quality indices (Na%, sodium adsorption ratio, permeability index, residual sodium carbonate), and industrial water quality indices (Ryznar stability index, Langelier saturation index, Larson- Skold, Puckorius scaling index) indicated that the quality of water for irrigation purposes could be classified in the excellent to permissible categories. However, as for the industrial uses, the results also revealed that most of the samples could be classified in the aggressive and very aggressive categories.																	1606-9749					OCT	2017	17	5					1410	1425		10.2166/ws.2017.039								WOS:000417944300023

Water as a weapon in ancient times: considerations of technical and ethical aspects	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												This paper addresses the issue of how water played a role in ancient conflicts, from the poisoning of water sources to flooding, to stop the advance of enemy armies. It deals with military actions quoted by several ancient Greek and Roman authors, who in some cases narrate these experiences first-hand. Although many abhorred such actions, they were considered tactical expedients to resort to, as cited by the war manuals of the time. The analysis starts from the 'manual' Strategemata of Sextus Julius Frontinus, in addition to other references left by historians and chroniclers of different periods. It continues with the evaluation of the impact of the intentional actions of water contamination described by the ancient authors, according to present toxicological and health knowledge.																	1606-9749					OCT	2017	17	5					1490	1498		10.2166/ws.2017.043								WOS:000417944300030

However, it remains challenging because of hydrological uncertainties in the single scale. A multimodal water quality prediction model based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and support vector regression (SVR) is proposed to address this problem. Based on the idea of decomposition and ensemble, dissolved oxygen (DO), one representation in water quality, is firstly decomposed into several intrinsic mode functions, which are then modeled by the SVR in each mode. According to the reconstruction theory of the EEMD, the subresults predicted by the SVR of each mode are summarized into the final results. The proposed model is evaluated by the weekly DO concentrations during 2014-2015 from one monitoring station of the Jialing River, China. A back propagation neural network and the standard SVR models are used for a comparison study. The results demonstrate that the addressed model, combining the mode representation capacity of the EEMD and the nonlinear mapping of the SVR, has the best prediction performance among the peer models.

J	Greenway, M				Greenway, Margaret			Stormwater wetlands for the enhancement of environmental ecosystem services: case studies for two retrofit wetlands in Brisbane, Australia	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Constructed stormwater wetlands are examples of 'blue-green' ecological engineering in the urban environment providing a range of ecosystem services. A study was undertaken in Brisbane, Australia to examine the enhancement of environmental ecosystem services in 2 retrofit wetlands. Originally concrete drainage channels in existing residential catchments, a series of wetlands and ponds were created i.e. green infrastructure in a brownfield setting. Boardwalks, pathways and interpretive signage were incorporated into the design. Golden Pond wetland was only 0.2% of the catchment whereas Bridgewater Creek - Bowie's Flat wetland was 0.4% of the catchment. The larger 0.8 ha Bridgewater Creek wetland had an overflow bypass channel. Water quality (suspended solids and nutrients) and the diversity of aquatic macro invertebrates were monitored for 2-4 years after construction. During storm events suspended solids increased at Golden Pond due to resuspension from the high velocities in this small linear flow system. Resuspension was minimised at Bridgewater Creek due to the by-pass channel. During dry weather suspended solids in both wetlands increased due to resuspension from the activity of waterbirds. Both wetlands were effective in reducing nutrient concentrations especially NOx-N and PO4-P, attributed to biological uptake; but during dry periods NH4-N increased within the system. The concept of irreducible background concentrations in wetland systems is discussed. Open water and aquatic vegetation provided habitats for macroinvertebrates. Species richness increased by more than 50% in both stormwater wetlands, compared to the concrete drains. Wetland sizing and design are essential parameters for water quality improvement and biodiversity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Li, WJ; Li, LJ; Qiu, GY				Li, Wenjiang; Li, Linjun; Qiu, Guoyu			Energy consumption and economic cost of typical wastewater treatment systems in Shenzhen, China	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Wastewater treatment, a great potential alternative to alleviate water shortage, has been attached more and more importance in China, and has been developing very fast. The quantity of wastewater treatment plants in China has increased up to 3272 in June 2013, and has a total handling capacity of 0.14 billion t/day. However, wastewater treatment requires to consuming a lot of energy, and even energy consumption is often the main operation cost of wastewater treatment systems. Thus, it is very necessary to explore energy consumption of wastewater treatment systems and its influential factors, and seek for some possible pathways to save energy and lower cost. In this paper, we investigated the average energy consumption per unit wastewater treatment in Shenzhen, and analyzed the effect of treatment capacity and treatment technology on the energy cost per unit of wastewater treatment. The results showed that the average energy consumption of wastewater treatment plants in Shenzhen was about 0.20 +/- 0.06 kWh/t, much less than those in some developed countries. This result may be related to the advanced wastewater treatment plants newly constructed and the low water quality requirements of wastewater treatment in Shenzhen. As the key to wastewater treatment, biochemical treatment sub-process consumed 50-70% of total energy cost in wastewater treatment. Secondly, the larger the treat capacity, the lower the energy cost per unit of wastewater treatment was. And the difference of treatment technologies can also significantly affect the energy consumption per unit of wastewater treatment. Finally, labor cost and electricity consumption respectively covered about 30.1% and 26.3% of total economic cost in the three typical wastewater treatment plants in original Shenzhen. Thus, upgrading treatment machines & equipment and improving management level are two effective alternatives to decrease energy consumption and lower total economic cost of wastewater treatment plants in Shenzhen and even China.

However, transitions towards regenerative urban built environments that widely incorporate sustainable drainage systems are "per se" innovative journeys that encounter barriers which include the limited evidence on the performance of these systems which, in many countries, are still unknown to professionals and decision makers. A further important barrier is the frequently poor interaction among stakeholders; key items such as sustainable drainage systems provide collective benefits which also demand collective efforts. With the aim of overcoming such innovation-driven barriers, six showcase projects (including rain gardens acting as infiltration basins, swales and a green roof) to demonstrate the feasibility and suitability of sustainable drainage systems were developed and/or retrofitted in two cities of the Valencian region of Spain as a part of an European project, and their performance was monitored for a year. The data acquired, after being fully analyzed and presented to a group of key regional stakeholders, is proving to be a valuable promoter of the desired transition (for instance in influencing the support to SuDS in recent regional legislation). This paper presents detailed data on how these urban ecological drainage infrastructure elements reduce runoff (peak flows and volumes) and improve its quality, contributing to the goal of healthier and livable cities. The data show that the pilots have good hydraulic performance under a typical Mediterranean climate and also provided water quality benefits. Furthermore, it shows how engagement can contribute to smarter governance in the sense of smoothing the difficulties faced by innovation when being presented, understood, and endorsed by professionals and decision-makers in the field of stormwater management. Finally, activities undertaken in the demonstration sites monitored, show how they have been drivers of innovation and transition towards a new stormwater paradigm in Spain, serving as a reference to other urban areas in the Mediterranean.

Impact of Corrosion Control on Biofilm Development in Simulated Partial Lead Service Line Replacements	ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE												Interaction of water quality, flow conditions, and the presence of lead and biofilm was examined in simulated partial lead service line replacement. Recirculating pipe loops were connected to individual 90-L reservoirs, and biofilm was collected from polycarbonate coupons. Three corrosion inhibitors, including sodium orthophosphate (OP) (1 mg-P/L), zinc orthophosphate (ZOP) (1 mg-P/L), or sodium silicate (10 mg/L), were used to treat Pb-Cu pipe loops. Controls included an "inhibitor-free,'' "galvanic free,'' and "lead-free'' with Pb-Cu, Pb-PVC, and PVC-PVC coupled pipe loops, respectively. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) was used to measure energy production of living cells and as a proxy to assess biofilm growth. The two highest (significant) ATP counts were found in the OP (under stagnant conditions) and ZOP (under flow-through conditions). Sodium silicates generally produced lower ATP counts compared to the phosphate-based inhibitors in the flow-through condition, although these differences were not statistically significant. Significant positive correlation between presence of lead and biofilm (ATP) and presence of copper and biofilm (ATP) were observed, although this observation does not imply a linear relationship. Biofilm was observed to act as a significant reservoir for lead with values ranging from 0.06 to 0.81 mu g Pb/cm(2) before chlorination to 0.04 to 0.21 mu g Pb/cm(2) postchlorination. This work highlights the potential for biofilm to act as a reservoir and subsequently as a source of lead release, and underscores the value of including biofilm evaluation when selecting corrosion inhibitors.																	1092-8758	1557-9018				OCT	2017	34	10					711	720		10.1089/ees.2016.0507								WOS:000412299000003

A continuous consumption of polluted water as drinking water or for culinary purposes is by no means a minor hazard for people's health that must be studied. This research presents a new methodology for the spatial analysis of health risk rate from intake of nitratepolluted groundwater. The method is illustrated through its application to a water quality sampling campaign performed in the south of Spain in 2003. The probability risk model used by the US Environmental Protection Agency has been applied, considering a residential intake framework and three representative population age groups (10, 40 and 65 years). The method was based upon coupling Monte Carlo simulations and geostatistics, which allowed mapping of the health risk coefficient (RC). The maps obtained were interpreted in the framework of water resources management and user's health protection (municipalities). The results showed waterborne health risk caused by nitrate-polluted water is moderately low for the region. The observed risk was larger for the elderly and children, although no significant differences were found among the three age groups (RC average values of 95th percentile for age of 0.37, 0.33 and 0.37, respectively). Significant risk values of RC[ 1 were obtained for 10 % of the surface in the NW site of the study area, where the municipalities with the highest contamination thresholds are located (agricultural activity). Nitrate concentration and intake rate stood out as the main explanatory variables of the RC.

Twenty-nine borehole water samples were collected in the dry season (July/August 2012) and another 27 samples from the same localities in the wet season (March 2013) from the study area. The samples were analysed for trace elements arsenic (As), cadmium(Cd), chromium(Cr), selenium (Se), and lead (Pb) using the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry technique. The average concentrations of As, Cd, Cr, Se, and Pb were 11.3, 0.3, 33.1, 7.1, and 6.0 lg/L in the dry season and 11.0, 0.3, 28.3, 4.2, and 6.6 mu lg/L in the wet season, respectively. There was evidence of seasonal fluctuations in concentrations of all analysed elements except for As, though Cd and Pb displayed low concentrations (<0.2 and <6.0 mu g/L, respectively) in almost all sampled boreholes. Se and Cr concentrations slightly exceed the South African National Standard permissible limits for safe drinking water in few boreholes. A total of four boreholes exceeded the water quality guideline for As with two of these boreholes containing five times more As than the prescribed limit. The spatial distribution patterns of elevated As closely correlate with the underlying geology. The findings of this investigation have important implications for human health of the communities drinking from the affected boreholes.																	0269-4042	1573-2983				OCT	2017	39	5					1201	1219		10.1007/s10653-016-9887-0								WOS:000413749200017	27744552

In order to enhance the stability of silica microsphere, titania was coated over silica microsphere by using sol-gel process. To enhance the exchange capacity of titania coated silica microsphere for Cs, it was functionalized with potassium ferrocyanide. The whole assembly was impregnated in calcium alginate in order to remove the Cs134+137 from potable water without altering drinking water quality parameters. Experiments were conducted by spiking the groundwater and seawater in the concentration range of 1000-50,000 BqL(-1.) Removal efficiency of more than 99% and 97% were observed in case fresh water and marine environment respectively. Sorption capacity of the material was evaluated by using stable Cs. Maximum sorption of Cs was seen at the pH range 7.5-8.5 and the equilibrium time required for the removal of Cs was 24 h. Kinetic models and adsorption isotherm equations (Langmuir & Freundlich) were used to fit the experiment data for describing the sorption process. The maximum sorption capacity of the beads is 23.55 mg g(-1) in case of stable Cs and the sorption follows the Langmuir isotherm. From the kinetic study it was observed that the reaction is following the pseudo first order kinetic equation.																	2213-3437					OCT	2017	5	5					5187	5195		10.1016/j.jece.2017.09.056								WOS:000414041300110

JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												This study aimed to evaluate the influence of sub-daily precipitation time steps on model performance and hydrological components by applying the Green and Ampt infiltration method using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Precipitation was measured at a resolution of 0.1mm and aggregated to 5-, 15-, 30-, and 60-min time steps. Daily discharge data over a 10-year period were used to calibrate and validate the model. Following a global sensitivity analysis, relevant parameters were optimized through an automatic calibration procedure using SWAT-CUP for each time step. Daily performance statistics were almost equal among all four time steps (NSE approximate to 0.47). Discharge mainly consisted of groundwater flow (55%) and tile flow (42%), in reasonable proportions for the investigated catchment. In conclusion, model outputs were almost identical, showing simulations responded nearly independently of the chosen precipitation time step. This held true for (1) the selection of sensitive parameters, (2) performance statistics, (3) the shape of the hydrographs, and (4) flow components. However, a scenario analysis revealed that the precipitation time step becomes important when saturated hydraulic conductivities are low and curve numbers are high. The study suggests that there is no need in using precipitation time steps <1h for lowland catchments dominated by soils with a low surface runoff potential if daily flow values are being considered.

However, these ubiquitous assets, valued at approximately $600,000 per km(2) in a representative suburban watershed, are ideal candidates to aid in reversing such cycles of channel degradation because improving their functionality would not necessarily require property acquisition or heavy construction. The objective of this research was to develop a simple, cost-effective device that could be installed in detention basin outlets to reduce the erosive power of the relatively frequent storm events (similar to < two-year recurrence) and provide a passive bypass to maintain flood control performance during infrequent storms (such as the 100-year recurrence). Results from a pilot installation show that the Detain H2O device reduced the cumulative sediment transport capacity of the preretrofit condition by greater than 40%, and contributed to reduced flashiness and prolonged baseflows in receiving streams. When scaling the strategy across a watershed, these results suggest that potential gains in water quality and stream channel stability could be achieved at costs that are orders of magnitude less than comparable benefits from newly constructed stormwater control measures.																	1093-474X	1752-1688				OCT	2017	53	5					1032	1047		10.1111/1752-1688.12548								WOS:000412132000005

Modeling Watershed-Scale Impacts of Stormwater Management with Traditional versus Low Impact Development Design	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Stormwater runoff and associated pollutants from urban areas in the greater Chesapeake Bay Watershed (CBW) impair local streams and downstream ecosystems, despite urbanized land comprising only 7% of the CBW area. More recently, stormwater best management practices (BMPs) have been implemented in a low impact development (LID) manner to treat stormwater runoff closer to its source. This approach included the development of a novel BMP model to compare traditional and LID design, pioneering the use of comprehensively digitized storm sewer infrastructure and BMP design connectivity with spatial patterns in a geographic information system at the watershed scale. The goal was to compare total watershed pollutant removal efficiency in two study watersheds with differing spatial patterns of BMP design (traditional and LID), by quantifying the improved water quality benefit of LID BMP design. An estimate of uncertainty was included in the modeling framework by using ranges for BMP pollutant removal efficiencies that were based on the literature. Our model, using Monte Carlo analysis, predicted that the LID watershed removed approximately 78kg more nitrogen, 3kg more phosphorus, and 1,592kg more sediment per square kilometer as compared with the traditional watershed on an annual basis. Our research provides planners a valuable model to prioritize watersheds for BMP design based on model results or in optimizing BMP selection.																	1093-474X	1752-1688				OCT	2017	53	5					1081	1094		10.1111/1752-1688.12559								WOS:000412132000008

Designing and Implementing a Network for Sensing Water Quality and Hydrology across Mountain to Urban Transitions	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Water resources are increasingly impacted by growing human populations, land use, and climate changes, and complex interactions among biophysical processes. In an effort to better understand these factors in semiarid northern Utah, United States, we created a real-time observatory consisting of sensors deployed at aquatic and terrestrial stations to monitor water quality, water inputs, and outputs along mountain to urban gradients. The Gradients Along Mountain to Urban Transitions (GAMUT) monitoring network spans three watersheds with similar climates and streams fed by mountain winter-derived precipitation, but that differ in urbanization level, land use, and biophysical characteristics. The aquatic monitoring stations in the GAMUT network include sensors to measure chemical (dissolved oxygen, specific conductance, pH, nitrate, and dissolved organic matter), physical (stage, temperature, and turbidity), and biological components (chlorophyll-a and phycocyanin). We present the logistics of designing, implementing, and maintaining the network; quality assurance and control of numerous, large datasets; and data acquisition, dissemination, and visualization. Data from GAMUT reveal spatial differences in water quality due to urbanization and built infrastructure; capture rapid temporal changes in water quality due to anthropogenic activity; and identify changes in biological structure, each of which are demonstrated via case study datasets.																	1093-474X	1752-1688				OCT	2017	53	5					1095	1120		10.1111/1752-1688.12557								WOS:000412132000009

As a result, most models are calibrated and, if possible, validated using limited measured data. However, little research has been done to determine the impact of length of available calibration data on model parameterization and performance. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of length of calibration data (LCD) on parameterization and performance of the Agricultural Policy Environmental eXtender model for predicting daily, monthly, and annual streamflow. Long-term (1984-2015) measured daily streamflow data from Rock Creek watershed, an agricultural watershed in northern Ohio, were used for this study. Data were divided into five Short (5-year), two Medium (15-year), and one Long (25-year) streamflow calibration data scenarios. All LCD scenarios were calibrated and validated at three time steps: daily, monthly, and annual. Results showed LCD affected the ability of the model to accurately capture temporal variability in simulated streamflow. However, overall average streamflow, water budgets, and crop yields were simulated reasonably well for all LCD scenarios.																	1093-474X	1752-1688				OCT	2017	53	5					1164	1177		10.1111/1752-1688.12564								WOS:000412132000013

Cost analyses suggest regulated sources can reduce compliance costs by purchasing agricultural nonpoint source credits. Yet, such point-nonpoint trades are rare. This article assesses the demand for agricultural nonpoint sources in well-developed nutrient trading programs in Virginia for industrial and municipal wastewater treatment plants, municipal stormwater programs, and land developers. Evidence suggests nutrient trading programs in Virginia will not stimulate investments in pollutant reduction practices on working agricultural lands. The lack of demand for agricultural nonpoint source credits can be attributed to a substantial degree to the design features and incentives present in multiple overlapping regulatory programs. The legal setting that dampens regulated source demand for nonpoint source credits in Virginia is broadly representative of conditions found elsewhere in the United States.																	1093-474X	1752-1688				OCT	2017	53	5					1178	1194		10.1111/1752-1688.12565								WOS:000412132000014

Water Quality Signals from Rural Land Use and Exurbanization in a Mountain Landscape: What's Clear and What's Confounded?	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												In mountainous landscapes with high climatic and geomorphic variability, how do rural land uses and exurbanization alter hydrology and water quality? We evaluated effects of rural land use and exurbanization on streamflows, suspended sediment concentrations and loads, specific conductance, and summer water temperatures in 12 streams and rivers within the Upper Little Tennessee River basin in the southern Appalachian Mountains. Eleven streams featured low levels of development (>61% forest cover) but differed in land use patterning, basin size, annual precipitation, and watershed morphology. One urban stream, located within the largest town in the basin, provided the high development comparative endpoint. Even low levels of rural development and exurbanization were associated with substantial increases in suspended sediment concentrations, sediment loads, and summer stream temperature daily maxima and diurnal variation. Observed summer temperature increases were much larger than would be expected due to global climate change over the next century. Specific conductance was idiosyncratic among the smaller streams. These water quality changes were not accompanied by streamflow changes that were discernible amid the high natural variation in precipitation and geomorphology. The water quality findings suggest the need for applying the best management practices, including riparian buffers, to even low levels of rural development.																	1093-474X	1752-1688				OCT	2017	53	5					1212	1228		10.1111/1752-1688.12567								WOS:000412132000016

Unfortunately, there are few publicly available data sources at the local level and even fewer at the national scale. In this research, randomly selected points within agricultural lands were examined for selected conservation practices using Google Earth aerial imagery by a team of interpreters. In total, 13,530 points had field boundaries digitized, and were subsequently examined and classified. The presence of terraces, grassed waterways, contour farming, center pivot irrigation, strip cropping, ponds, riparian vegetation, filter strips, and land cover were noted. Subjectivity among interpreters was evaluated using duplicate samples and was found to be similar to image misclassification rates in other research. Conservation practice adoption rates for selected major river basins compared favorably with data collected by the Conservation Effects Assessment Project. The frequency of occurrence of each conservation practice was summarized and presented by ecoregion. To facilitate future research, point level data and software source code developed in this research are available via the web at . Aerial imagery was found to be a powerful, inexpensive, and easily accessible tool to assess large-scale conservation practice implementation for certain conservation practices.

J	Piyoosh, AK; Ghosh, SK				Piyoosh, Atul Kant; Ghosh, Sanjay Kumar			Effect of autocorrelation on temporal trends in rainfall in a valley region at the foothills of Indian Himalayas	STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT												This study examines the effect of autocorrelation on step and monotonic trends in seasonal and annual rainfall. Initially, for step change, modified-Pettitt test is applied in two ways. First, using the corrected and unbiased trend-free-pre-whitening (TFPWcu) approach. Second, using a new approach in which time series is modelled by intervention analysis for modified Pettitt test. Subsequently, for monotonic trends, Mann-Kendall (MK) and six approaches of modified Mann-Kendall (MMK) test are applied to NCDC data for period 1901-2012 and its sub-periods. Approaches of MMK include pre-whitening (PW), trend-free-pre-whitening (TFPW), TFPWcu, two Variance Correction Approaches (VCAs) based on empirical formula (VCA:CF1) and Monte-Carlo-Simulations (VCA:CF2) and long term persistence (MK-LTP). A single change point is identified in 1970 for annual and monsoon rainfall from original and modified-Pettitt's test using TFPWcu, while time series modelling approach has not exhibited any change point. Process shift in rainfall series is also studied using CUSUM and multiple change points are identified using Segment-Neighbourhood method. Outcomes of MMK show that TFPWcu is able to efficiently limit the effect of autocorrelation and may be preferred over PW and TFPW. The VCA:CF2 is not dependent on whole autocorrelation structure and corrects variance of all data series using lag-1 autocorrelation and may be preferred over VCA:CF1. MK-LTP considers long term persistence and it has exhibited presence of weaker trends than exhibited by other approaches. VCA:CF2 and MK-LTP are used to study trends of rainfall in Dehradun.																	1436-3240	1436-3259				OCT	2017	31	8					2075	2096		10.1007/s00477-016-1347-y								WOS:000413233000012

Optimization of hydrometric monitoring network in urban drainage systems using information theory	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Regular and continuous monitoring of urban runoff in both quality and quantity aspects is of great importance for controlling and managing surface runoff. Due to the considerable costs of establishing new gauges, optimization of the monitoring network is essential. This research proposes an approach for site selection of new discharge stations in urban areas, based on entropy theory in conjunction with multi-objective optimization tools and numerical models. The modeling framework provides an optimal trade-off between the maximum possible information content and the minimum shared information among stations. This approach was applied to the main surface-water collection system in Tehran to determine new optimal monitoring points under the cost considerations. Experimental results on this drainage network show that the obtained cost-effective designs noticeably outperform the consulting engineers' proposal in terms of both information contents and shared information. The research also determined the highly frequent sites at the Pareto front which might be important for decision makers to give a priority for gauge installation on those locations of the network.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				OCT	2017	76	7					1603	1613		10.2166/wst.2017.226								WOS:000412778000002	28991778

To illustrate the applicability of ANFIS method, the upstream catchment of Feitsui Reservoir in Taiwan is chosen as the case study area. The appropriate input variables used to develop the ANFIS models are determined based on the t-test. The results obtained by ANFIS are compared with those by multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural networks (ANNs). Simulated results show that the identified ANFIS model is superior to the traditional MLR and nonlinear ANNs models in terms of the performance evaluated by the Pearson coefficient of correlation, the root mean square error, the mean absolute percentage, and the mean absolute error. These results indicate that ANFIS models are more suitable than ANNs or MLR models to predict the nonlinear relationship within the variables caused by the complexity of aquatic systems and to produce the best fit of the measured BOD concentrations. ANFIS can be seen as a powerful predictive alternative to traditional water quality modeling techniques and extended to other areas to improve the understanding of river pollution trends.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				OCT	2017	76	7					1739	1753		10.2166/wst.2017.359								WOS:000412778000014	28991790

This study presents such a new system, with coupled membrane bioreactor-microbial fuel cell features, which can not only treat wastewater, but also recovers energy from wastewater by electricity generation, and form a new resource by photosynthesis while providing the dissolved oxygen by algae. Specifically, in the system, the MnO2/polyaniline is used to modify the stainless steel mesh and to function well as system membrane and cathode, with satisfactory filtration and catalysis performance. The system enables continuous wastewater treatment with stable pollutant removal and electricity generation. Under the membrane flux of 119.4 Lm(-2) h(-1) , a maximum power density of 1.2 W m(-3) can be achieved, the algae multiply 6.1 times, and satisfactory wastewater treatment effect is achieved.

We found that organic matter is the main pollution source of Yitong River and its tributaries. A black-odor evaluation model that can describe the pollution of the Yitong River water system was developed, and this model has the parameters I = 0.21 [CODCr] + 0.18 [DO] - 0.36[NH3-N] + 0.91. The model performance was satisfactory with a black-odor defining accuracy of 69%. Moreover, we found that CODCr, NH3-N, and DO are the influential factors of the Yitong River black-odor water body and that their threshold values when the water body transitioned to black odor were 109.2, 1.90, and 7.50 mg.L-1, respectively. We found that most of the Yitong River was polluted by six heavy metals, namely, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn. We used the Nemerow method to calculate the heavy metal pollution degree of each sampling point and found that 60% of the points were seriously polluted. Furthermore, we drew the heavy metal pollution distribution map of the Yitong River. Finally, we proposed an effective measure called new-type multistep constructed wetland to improve the water quality of Yitong River.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				OCT	2017	76	8					2051	2064		10.2166/wst.2017.372								WOS:000413666500011	29068335

Bank filtration in a coastal lake in South Brazil: water quality, natural organic matter (NOM) and redox conditions study	CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY												Bank filtration (BF) was evaluated as new treatment or pre-treatment option for drinking water production in Brazil. General water quality parameters, natural organic matter (NOM) and redox conditions were evaluated in Lagoa do Peri, a costal lake in Santa Catarina, South Brazil. Studies in two periods at two bank filtrations well systems, in a 45-m-length column and in a test filter laboratory scale set-up, were performed. The well systems and the column showed the removal of turbidity and colour from around 7 NTU and 65 Pt-Co, respectively, to below the local regulations (1 NTU and 15 Pt-Co units). Both systems demonstrated a good removal of NOM and trihalomethanes (THM) precursors with a preference removal of THM precursors. The NOM and THM precursor removal in the large column and the test filter were effectively modelled. In both cases, an easily degradable organic matter fraction was modelled; in the large column a moderate degradable fraction was identified as well. The first fraction was removed during the first days of travel time of the bank filtrate. A change to reduced redox conditions was observed in the large column experiment. The same happened in the wells system, showing the dissolution of iron, manganese and sulphide in the bank filtrate. This was the principal drawback of BF comparing with the already existing direct filtration (DF) treatment plant. BF performed slightly better in THM precursor removal (52%) than DF (42%). Therefore, BF could be a pre-treatment for the DF treatment system, and the existing facility could be adapted for iron and manganese removal.

J	Wang, HB; Qin, J; Hu, YH				Wang, Hongbing; Qin, Jun; Hu, Yonghong			Are green roofs a source or sink of runoff pollutants?	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Retention of rainwater runoff is a primary function of green roofs in their contribution as one of the main indicators of "Sponge City". However, the influence of green roofs on runoff quality and whether they are a source or sink of pollutants is ambiguous. A concept model of pollutant cycling is proposed in this paper, based on a systematic literature review, which includes the direct factors substrate and structure of the green roof system; and indirect factors such as plant species, irrigation, fertilizer, atmospheric deposition, and age of the green roof. In addition, the model identifies each factor as a pollutant source or sink and explores relations among the factors. Examples in the literature were drawn to demonstrate the factors and pollutant materials including metallic elements such as Zn, Pb, Cd, Fe, Mn, Cr, Cu, and Ca; and nutrients such as N, NO3--N, NH4-N, DON, P, PO43--P, K, and DOC. The concept of "moderate growth vigor" is proposed; moderate growth is optimal for runoff quality and low and persistent fertility, and a low benchmark to control diseases and insect pests. The concept of "clean sources and pollutant retention" should be adopted, i.e., pollutant sources such as substrate, irrigation water, fertilizer, pesticide, and other local pollution sources should be removed or cleaned, and pollutants should be detained or decreased by plant degradation, slow-release material, filter layer, and actinic and microbial degradation. These results will aid understanding of the mechanism of runoff pollution and improve stormwater runoff quality from source to sink in green roofs.

Impacts of gravel jetting on the composition of fish spawning substrates: Implications for river restoration and fisheries management	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Fine sediments can impact river biota, with egg and larval stages of lithophilic fish particularly sensitive to deposition of sand- to clay-sized particles ('fines') in spawning gravels. Mitigation and restoration methods include jetting to cleanse gravels of fines. Despite wide application, impacts of jetting on gravel composition and quality have rarely been quantified. Here, gravel jetting impacts on sediment composition in the River Great Ouse (UK), were tested during an in-situ experiment completed at riffle (55.6 +/- 13.4 m(2)) and patch (0.3 m(2)) scales to determine its magnitude and persistence on surface and subsurface substrate conditions. Before-after (riffle) and control-impact (patch) designs were used, with bedload sediment traps installed downstream of experimental patches to investigate the sediments mobilised during jetting. At the riffle scale, surface grain size was significantly altered; fines were removed resulting in coarser and better-sorted sediments. Similar patterns were detected at the patch scale, although sediment sorting was not significantly altered. Despite reduced fine sediment content of subsurface gravels at the riffle scale, the overall grain size composition was not significantly altered. At the patch scale, no subsurface improvements were detected. Temporally, at the riffle scale, no changes in surface or subsurface sediments lasted more than 12 months; patch scale changes generally persisted for less than 3 months. Thus, whilst gravel jetting could improve spawning gravel quality for surface spawning fishes, including European barbel Barbus barbus, its effects are short-lived. Because subsurface sediments are not affected by gravel jetting, the benefits are limited for redd-building fishes, such as salmonids. Consequently, reducing fine sediment delivery to rivers, such as by changes in agricultural practices, is more sustainable for managing excessive river sedimentation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

N.; Abed, Suhail N.; Scholz, Miklas			Recycling of domestic wastewater treated by vertical-flow wetlands for irrigation of two consecutive Capsicum annuum generations	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Due to water scarcity, there is great interest in reusing various nutrient-rich wastewaters. The aim of this article is consequently to evaluate if domestic wastewater treated by various wetland systems can be successfully recycled to irrigate generations of commercial crops such as Chilli (Capsicum annuum) grown in compost within a laboratory environment to obtain a cultivar adapted to domestic wastewater. The corresponding objectives were to assess the irrigation water for long-term growth when applying recycled wastewater, the impact of various wastewaters subject to the wetland characteristics, the impact of treated wastewater volume for irrigation, and the economic return of different experimental set-ups in terms of marketable yields. The vertical-flow wetlands treated domestic wastewater well, meeting the irrigation water quality standards for most water quality parameters, except for phosphorus (4.2 +/- 0.48 mg/l), ammonia-nitrogen (4.2 +/- 2.64 mg/l), potassium (7.0 +/- 3.03 mg/l) and total coliforms (69647 +/- 64852.6 CFU/100 ml), which showed high values significantly (p < 0.05) exceeding common thresholds set for irrigation applications of 2 mg/l, 5 mg/l, 2 mg/l, and 1000 CFU/100 ml. Chilli generations were grown successfully when applying wastewater treated by wetlands and organic soil. High Chilli generation yields concerning economic return were linked with wetlands containing small aggregates with long contact and resting times and fed with a high inflow loading rate (undiluted wastewater), releasing more nutrients into their effluent producing the best fruit quality with respect to weight, length and width resulting in a greater marketable profit of about 46% compared with the others. First generation Chilli plants were grown with considerably shorter heights and produced abundant fruit numbers, which were harvested earlier than their mothers due to the reduction (approximately 55%) of irrigation water volume used for them compared to their mothers. However, excessive nutrients applied on mother plants via irrigation water resulted in better fruit quality regarding dimensions and weights compared with their corresponding first generation plants, leading to a greater marketable profit by about 25%.

However, there is limited information on the overall effectiveness of these programs on improving stream ecological conditions. To address this issue, replicate streams from southeastern Arkansas draining watersheds containing predominately croplands (n = 4, termed "cropland") and created wetlands (n = 4, termed "wetland") were monitored monthly from August 2012 through July 2013. Although repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVA) detected many significant time x stream type interactions, several habitat parameters and total habitat scores exhibited a general improvement in wetland streams. Some water quality conditions were better in wetland streams (e.g., lower turbidity, total suspended solids, and nutrient) compared to cropland streams. The time (season) effect was significant (p < 0.05) for 13 of the 14 water quality parameters measured, meaning that water quality varied seasonally. Among the water quality parameters measured, three (water temperature, pH, and turbidity) exhibited significant (p < 0.05) time x stream type interaction, meaning that the stream type effect was not consistent through time (seasons). Fish community sampling collected 6543 specimens from 12 species during the study period; 4410 and 2133 fish specimens were collected from cropland and wetland streams, respectively. Fish community metrics such as species diversity, species evenness, and species richness index were not significantly (p > 0.05) greater in wetland streams. Overall, the conservation wetlands in the Lower Mississippi River Basin appear to have significantly improved stream habitat and moderately improved water quality, though no significant fish community effect was detected.

The results showed that although the water column was typically net heterotrophic, the ecosystem as a whole displayed autotrophic characteristics. The mean net community production from the seagrass meadows was 99.31 +/- 45.13 mM C m(-2) d(-1), while the P/R ratio varied between 1.49 and 1.56. Oxygen produced through in situ photosynthesis, exhibited higher dependence over dissolved CO2 and available light. Apportionment of carbon stores in biomass indicated that nearly three-fourths were available belowground compared to aboveground. However, the sediment horizon accumulated nearly 40 times more carbon than live biomass. The carbon storage capacities of the sediments and seagrass biomass were comparable with the global mean for seagrass meadows. The results of this study highlight the major role of seagrass meadows in modification of seawater chemistry. Though the seagrass meadows of Palk Bay are increasingly subject to human impacts, with coupled regulatory and management efforts focused on improved water quality and habitat conservation, these key coastal ecosystems will continue to be valuable for climate change mitigation, considering their vital role in C dynamics and interactions with the overlying water column.

Oude			Fast calculation of groundwater exfiltration salinity in a lowland catchment using a lumped celerity/velocity approach	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												To support operational water management of freshwater resources in coastal lowlands, a need exists for a rapid, well-identifiable model to simulate salinity dynamics of exfiltrating groundwater. This paper presents the lumped Rapid Saline Groundwater Exfiltration Model (RSGEM). RSGEM simulates groundwater exfiltration salinity dynamics as governed by the interplay between water velocity, gradually adjusting the subsurface salinity distribution, and pressure wave celerity, resulting in a fast flow path response to groundwater level changes. RSGEM was applied to a field site in the coastal region of the Netherlands, parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis were performed using generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation. The model showed good correspondence to measured groundwater levels, exfiltration rates and salinity response. Moreover, RSGEM results were very similar to a detailed, complex groundwater flow and transport model previously applied to this field site. (C) 2017 The Authors.

A loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for the rapid detection of Enterococcus spp. in water	WATER RESEARCH												Faecal pollution of water and the resulting potential presence of human enteric pathogens is a predominant threat to public health. Microbiological water quality can be assessed by the detection of standard faecal indicator bacteria (SFIB) such as E. coil or certain Enterococcus species. In recent years, isothermal amplification methods have become a useful alternative to polymerase chain reaction (PCR), allowing molecular diagnostics with simple or no instrumentation. In this study, a novel screening method for the molecular detection of Enterococcus spp. by loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is described. A set of six specific LAMP primers was designed to amplify a diagnostic fragment of the Enterococcus 23S rRNA gene, which is present in several enterococcal species targeted by quantitative PCR (qPCR), which is the standard technique recommended by the US Environmental Protection Agency. Sensitivity and specificity tests were performed using a set of 30 Enterococcus and non-target bacterial reference strains. It is shown that LAMP is equally sensitive and even more specific than the qPCR assay. A dilution series of Enterococcus faeons DNA revealed that the LAMP method can reliably detect 130 DNA target copies per reaction within 45 min. Additionally, enterococci isolated from Austrian surface waterbodies, as well as a set of DNA extracts from environmental waters, were tested. Contingency analysis demonstrated a highly significant correlation between the results of the developed LAMP assay and the reference qPCR method. Furthermore, a simple staining procedure with a fluorescence dye demonstrated the identification of amplified products by eye. In conclusion, this method is an important component for the efficient screening and testing of water samples in low-resource settings lacking sophisticated laboratory equipment and highly trained personnel, requiring only a simple heating block.

Two pilot-scale ozonation reactors (4-5 m(3) h(-1)), a 4-chamber reactor and a tubular reactor, were investigated by either conventional ozonation and/or the advanced oxidation process (AOP) O-3/H2O2. The effects of selected operational parameters, such as ozone dose (0.5-3 mg L-1) and H2O2 dose (O-3:H2O2 = 1:3-3:1 (mass ratio)), and selected water quality parameters, such as pH (6.5-8.5) and initial bromide concentration (15 200 Lig L-1), on micropollutant abatement and bromate formation were investigated. Under the studied conditions, compounds with high second-order rate constants k03>104 M-1 s(-1) for their reaction with ozone were well abated (>90%) even for the lowest ozone dose of 0.5 mg L-1. Conversely, the abatement efficiency of sucralose, which only reacts with hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH), varied between 19 and 90%. Generally, the abatement efficiency increased with higher ozone doses and higher pH and lower bromide concentrations. H2O2 addition accelerated the ozone conversion to "OH, which enables a faster abatement of ozone-resistant micropollutants. Interestingly, the abatement of micropollutants decreased with higher bromide concentrations during conventional ozonation due to competitive ozone-consuming reactions, except for lamotrigine. due to the suspected reaction of HOBr/ORC with the primary amine moieties. In addition to the abatement of micropollutants, the evolution of the two main transformation products (TPs) of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) and tramadol (TRA), chlorothiazide (CTZ) and tramadol N oxide (TRA-NOX), respectively, was assessed by chemical analysis and kinetic modeling. Both selected TPs were quickly formed initially to reach a maximum concentration followed by a decrease of their concentrations for longer contact times. For the studied conditions, the TP's concentrations at the outlet of the reactors ranged from 0 to 61% of the initial parent compound concentration, CTZ being a more persistent TP against further oxidation than TRA-NOX. Finally, it was demonstrated in both reactors that the formation of bromate (BrOi), a potentially carcinogenic oxidation by-product, could be controlled by H2O2 addition with a general improvement on micropollutant abatement. Post-treatment by granular activated carbon (GAC) filtration enabled the reduction of micropollutants and TPs concentrations but no changes in bromate were observed. The combined algae assay showed that water quality was				McArdell, Christa/R-9710-2017	McArdell, Christa/0000-0002-5251-7541												0043-1354					OCT 1	2017	122						234	245		10.1016/j.watres.2017.05.018								WOS:000407404300024	28601791

High pesticide loadings can potentially result in polluted stream water. The objective of this study was to determine the pesticide loadings and concentrations of three typical pesticides (atrazine, oxadiazon, and isoprothiolane) in river water from a middle high latitude agricultural watershed in northern China. During this study, we evaluated the watershed pesticide loss patterns for two crop types over three decades. For this purpose, we integrated data from field investigations, laboratory experiments, and modeling simulations involving a distributed hydrological solute transport model (Soil and Water Assessment Tool, SWAT). SWAT was employed to compare the temporal spatial fate and behaviors of atrazine, oxadiazon, and isoprothiolane from 1990 to 2014 in a watershed area amounting to 141.5 km(2). The results showed that the three pesticides could be detected at different locations throughout the watershed, and isoprothiolane was detected at the maximum value of 1.082 mu g/L in surface runoff of paddy land. The temporal trend for the yearly loading of atrazine decreased slightly over time, but the trends for oxadiazon and isoprothiolane increased markedly over an 18-year analysis period. In regard to the pesticide concentrations in water, atrazine was associated with the largest value of nearly 1.4 mu g/L. July and August were the found to be prime periods for pesticide loss from paddy land, and the biggest monthly loss of atrazine from dryland appeared in June. Under similar usage conditions, isoprothiolane loading from paddy fields ranked as the largest one among the three types of pesticides and reached up to 17 g/ha. Limited monitoring data were useful for validating the model, which yielded valuable temporal-spatial data on the fate of pesticides in this watershed. With the expansion of paddy rice cultivation, risks for pesticide contamination of water bodies will increase. The results of this study should be valuable for future exposure and risk assessments aimed at protecting the environment and human health. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Winton, RS; River, M				Winton, R. Scott; River, Mark			The biogeochemical implications of massive gull flocks at landfills	WATER RESEARCH												Gulls have long been observed concentrating in flocks of tens to hundreds of thousands at the anthropogenic food sources provided by landfills. Yet, the biogeochemical implications of the landfill gull phenomenon have been largely ignored. This study has two goals: 1) to understand the magnitude and geographic extent of landfill gulls in North America, and 2) to quantify the amount of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) transported from landfills to gull roosting sites in order to understand their potential impacts on water quality and methane (CH4) emission. We synthesized and mapped data from the eBird Citizen Science database and found that 1.4 million gulls have been documented at landfills throughout North America, though the actual population is probably greater than 5 million. Using a carnivorous bird transport model we estimate that these gulls transport 39,000 to 139,000 kg of P and 240,000 to 858,000 kg of N y(-1) to neighboring water bodies and avoid roughly 1.1 to 3.9 Tg y(-1) of landfill CH4 emissions. The avoided CH4 emission mitigation is insignificant in the context of gross landfill emissions, but the transported nutrients may be relevant to water quality management at local and continental scales. For example, at the Jordan Lake reservoir in North Carolina, a flock of 49,000 Ring billed Gulls (Larus delawarensis) annually deposits landfill feces containing 1070 kg P, an amount equivalent to approximately half of total maximum daily load reduction targets and worth roughly $2.2 million USD in nutrient credits. We estimate that continent-wide gull impacts are worth at least $100 million in nutrient offset credits. We conclude that mega-flocks of landfill gulls are common and widespread, and that their capacity to transport nutrients may be contributing to the eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems and water supplies.

Information on the abundance and distribution of cyanobacteria is fundamental to support risk assessment and management activities. In the present study, an approach based on Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis was used to estimate the concentrations of chlorophyll a (Chla) and the cyanobacterial biomarker pigment phycocyanin (PC) using data from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in Lake Chaohu (China's fifth largest freshwater lake). The approach was developed and tested using fourteen years (2000-2014) of MODIS images, which showed significant spatial and temporal variability of the PC:Chla ratio, an indicator of cyanobacterial dominance. The results had unbiased RMS uncertainties of <60% for Chla ranging between 10 and 300 mu g/L, and unbiased RMS uncertainties of <65% for PC between 10 and 500 mu g/L. Further analysis showed the importance of nutrient and climate conditions for this dominance. Low TN:TP ratios (<29:1) and elevated temperatures were found to influence the seasonal shift of phytoplankton community. The resultant MODIS Chla and PC products were then used for cyanobacterial risk mapping with a decision tree classification model. The resulting Water Quality Decision Matrix (WQDM) was designed to assist authorities in the identification of possible intake areas, as well as specific months when higher frequency monitoring and more intense water treatment would be required if the location of the present intake area remained the same. Remote sensing cyanobacterial risk mapping provides a new tool for reservoir and lake management programs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Cd is a typical heavy metal leached from farmland that is related to phosphate fertilizers and carries serious environmental risk. The spatial-vertical pattern of Cd in soil and the vertical trend of Cd in the river sediment core were analyzed, which showed the migration and accumulation of Cd in the watershed. To prevent watershed Cd loss, biochar was employed, and leaching experiments were conducted to investigate the Cd loss from soil depending on the initial concentration. Four rainfall intensities, 1.25 mm/ h, 2.50 mmih, 5.00 mm/h, and 10.00 mm/h, were used to simulate typical rainfall scenarios for the study area. Biochar was prepared from corn straw after pretreatment with ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (ADP) and pyrolysis at 400 degrees C under anoxic conditions. To identify the effects of biochar amendment on Cd migration, the biochar was mixed with soil for 90 days at concentrations of 0%, 0.5%, 1.0%, 3.0%, and 5.0% soil by weight. The results showed that the Cd leaching load increased as the initial load and rainfall intensity increased and that eluviation caused surface Cd to diffuse to the deep soils. The biochar application caused more of the heavy metals to be immobilized in the amended soil rather than transported into the waterbody. The sorption efficiency of the biochar for Cd increased as the addition level increased to 3%, which showed better performance than the 5% addition level under some initial concentration and rainfall conditions. The research indicated that biochar is a potential material to prevent diffuse heavy metal pollution and that a lower addition makes the application more feasible. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This work aims to develop a green water treatment sequence using a natural coagulant (Moringa oleifera) and a natural activated carbon (vegetable coconut palm) to remove Microcystis aeruginosa and natural organic matter in an integrated process. The proposed sequence, coagulation/flocculation/dissolved air flotation and activated carbon, is an eco-friendly and innovative option for water treatment managers, since it includes environmentally friendly products for the contaminant removal from water, replacing the traditional inorganic/synthetic coagulants and adsorbents. Results demonstrated that waters with concentrations as high as 150-200 mu g/I. of chlorophyll a and natural organic matter between 5 and 16 mg C/L presented removals higher than 80% for turbidity and chlorophyll a, 70-80% for dissolved organic matter and 80-90% for UV254nm. Moringa oleifera natural coagulant removed almost 80% of Microcystis aeruginosa cells in coagulation/flocculation/dissolved air flotation processes. The coconut palm activated carbon showed a high capacity to adsorb DOC from water with a maximum adsorbed capacity of 51.8 mg/g at equilibrium. The values obtained in treated water for the parameters measured are very encouraging, so this innovative integrated sequence may be used for improving water quality, benefiting human health and wellbeing.

J	Garcia, CA; Hodaifa, G				Agabo Garcia, Cristina; Hodaifa, Gassan			Real olive oil mill wastewater treatment by photo-Fenton system using artificial ultraviolet light lamps	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Large volume of untreated olive oil mill wastewater (OMW) is being stored in evaporation rafts. Given the high organic load and the presence of phenolic compounds in OMW, an effective treatment process should be implemented. In this work, an advanced oxidation process (photo-Fenton) operating in a batch reactor was used to treat OMW. All experiments were developed using FeCl3 as a catalyst. Different H2O2 concentrations (5.0, 8.0, 11.0, 15.0, 16.0, 21.0, 24.0 and 30.0 g/L) were studied as well as four commercial medium pressure UV-lamps (Standard, Z1, Z2 and Z3). The common operation conditions were: pH = 3, temperature 20 degrees C, [catalyst] = 3.0 and direct ultraviolet light (UV-light). The samples were analysed at different times during the experiments to determine water quality parameters. In general, high total carbon, total organic carbon, total phenolic compounds and turbidity removal percentages (>90%) were registered in all experiments, at all oxidant concentrations studied. Increasing oxidant concentrations did not imply a noticeable rise on the final removal percentages (approximately 5% at these experimental conditions). Total nitrogen content removal percentages were determined and varied in the range of 62.5 - 75.5%. UV-lamps presented virtually similar removal percentages with the following averages COD = 95.7 +/- 0.53%, total phenolic compounds = 93.6 +/- 2.5%, total carbon = 94.0 +/- 1.2%, total organic carbon = 96.3 +/- 0.6%, total nitrogen = 74.9 +/- 6.8% and turbidity 92.5 +/- 1.9%.

And aeration plays an important role in its sustainable operation, as well as economic and environmental feasibility. In this study, two patterns to reduce aeration intensity, i.e., semi aeration (SA) and intermittent aeration (IA) were used to improve the economic and environmental benefits of media-based aquaponics. Results showed that SA aquaponics, in which the energy efficiencies on culturing fish and crop were improved respectively by 78.20% and 77.61% compared with Control, had the potential to obtain higher economic benefits. Although both SA and IA could save half of the aeration cost by reducing aeration flux and time respectively, the product yields in SA weren't impaired seriously while in IA aquaponics they were. And the nitrogen utilization efficiency (NUE) of SA aquaponics was 113% higher than that of IA aquaponics, mainly attributed to the more stable dissolved oxygen concentration in SA. Better water quality was obtained in IA aquaponics, however, it was achieved at the cost of higher N loss (mainly in the form of N-2), which subsequently reduced the potential for further improvement of NUE. Both SA and IA could considerably reduce GHG emissions from aquaponics, due to lower energy requirement. IA aquaponics showed the lowest N2O emission, but the primary source (over 97%) of greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions from aquaponics was off-site indirect CO2 emission. Taking productivity and environmental impact into consideration, semi-aeration was believed to be a better choice when reducing aeration. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Effects of an Extreme Flood on Trace Elements in River Water-From Urban Stream to Major River Basin	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Major floods adversely affect water quality through surface runoff, groundwater discharge, and damage to municipal water infrastructure. Despite their importance, it can be difficult to assess the effects of floods on streamwater chemistry because of challenges collecting samples and the absence of baseline data. This study documents water quality during the September 2013 extreme flood in the South Platte River, Colorado, USA. Weekly time-series water samples were collected from 3 urban source waters (municipal tap water, streamwater, and wastewater treatment facility effluent) under normal-flow and flood conditions. In addition, water samples were collected during the flood at 5 locations along the South Platte River and from 7 tributaries along the Colorado Front Range. Samples were analyzed for 54 major and trace elements. Specific chemical tracers, representing different natural and anthropogenic sources and geochemical behaviors, were used to compare streamwater composition before and during the flood. The results differentiate hydrological processes that affected water quality: (1) in the upper watershed, runoff diluted most dissolved constituents, (2) in the urban corridor and lower watershed, runoff mobilized soluble constituents accumulated on the landscape and contributed to stream loading, and (3) flood induced groundwater discharge mobilized soluble constituents stored in the vadose zone.

Transcriptomic approach for assessment of the impact on microalga and macrophyte of in-situ exposure in river sites contaminated by chlor-alkali plant effluents	WATER RESEARCH												Water quality degradation is a worldwide problem, but risk evaluation of chronic pollution in-situ is still a challenge. The present study aimed to evaluate the potential of transcriptomic analyses in representative aquatic primary producers to assess the impact of environmental pollution in-situ: the microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and the macrophyte Elodea nuttallii were exposed 2 h in the Babeni Reservoir of the Olt River impacted by chlor-alkali plant effluent release resulting in increased concentrations of Hg and NaCl in receiving water. The response at the transcriptomic level was strong, resulting in up to 5485, and 8700 dysregulated genes (DG) for the microalga and for the macrophyte exposed in the most contaminated site, respectively. Transcriptomic response was congruent with the concentrations of Hg and NaCl in the water of the impacted reservoir. Genes involved in development, energy metabolism, lipid metabolism, nutrition, and RedOx homeostasis were dysregulated during in-situ exposure of both organisms. In addition, genes involved in the cell motility of C. reinhardtii and development of the cell wall of E. nuttallii were affected. DG were in line with adverse outcome pathways and transcriptomic studies reported after exposure to high concentrations of Hg and NaCl under controlled conditions in the laboratory. Transcriptomic response provided a sensitive measurement of the exposure as well as hints on the tolerance mechanisms of environmental pollution, and is thus promising as an early-warning tool to assess water quality degradation.

Seabed gallery intakes: Investigation of the water pretreatment effectiveness of the active layer using a long-term column experiment	WATER RESEARCH												Seabed gallery intake systems used for seawater reverse osmosis facilities employ the same principle of water treatment as slow sand filtration in freshwater systems. An investigation concerning the effectiveness of the active layer (top layer) in improving raw water quality was conducted by using a long-term bench-scale columns experiment. Two different media types, silica and carbonate sand, were tested in 1 m columns to evaluate the effectiveness of media type in terms of algae, bacteria, Natural Organic Matter (NOM) and Transparent Exopolymer Particles (TEP) removal over a period of 620 days. Nearly all algae in the silica sand column, 87% (sigma = 0.04) of the bacteria, 59% (sigma = 0.11) of the biopolymer fraction of NOM, 59% (sigma = 0.16) of particulate and 32% (sigma = 0.25) of colloidal TEP were removed during the last 330 days of the experiment. Total removal was observed in the carbonate sand column for algal concentration, while the bacterial removal was lower at 74% (sigma = 0.08). Removal of biopolymers, particulate and colloidal TEP were higher in the carbonate column during the last 330 days with 72% (sigma = 0.15), 66% (sigma =0.08) and 36% (sigma = 0.12) removed for these organics respectively. Removal of these key organics through the 1 m thick column, representing the active layer, will likely reduce the rate of biofouling, reduce chemical usage and minimize operating cost in SWRO systems. The data show that the media will require several months at the beginning of operation to reach equilibrium so that high organic removal rates can be achieved. No development of a "schmutzdecke" layer occurred. The experimental results suggest that unlike freshwater slow sand filtration wherein most water treatment occurs in the upper 10 cm, in seawater systems treatment occurs throughout the full active layer depth of 1 m. The results of this study will help in designing and operating seabed gallery intake systems in varied geological conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Evaluation of methods to sample fecal indicator bacteria in foreshore sand and pore water at freshwater beaches	WATER RESEARCH												Fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) are known to accumulate in foreshore beach sand and pore water (referred to as foreshore reservoir) where they act as a non-point source for contaminating adjacent surface waters. While guidelines exist for sampling surface waters at recreational beaches, there is no widely-accepted method to collect sand/sediment or pore water samples for FIB enumeration. The effect of different sampling strategies in quantifying the abundance of FIB in the foreshore reservoir is unclear. Sampling was conducted at six freshwater beaches with different sand types to evaluate sampling methods for characterizing the abundance of E. coli in the foreshore reservoir as well as the partitioning of E. coli between different components in the foreshore reservoir (pore water, saturated sand, unsaturated sand). Methods were evaluated for collection of pore water (drive point, shovel, and careful excavation), unsaturated sand (top 1 cm, top 5 cm), and saturated sand (sediment core, shovel, and careful excavation). Ankle-depth surface water samples were also collected for comparison. Pore water sampled with a shovel resulted in the highest observed E. coli concentrations (only statistically significant at fine sand beaches) and lowest variability compared to other sampling methods. Collection of the top 1 cm of unsaturated sand resulted in higher and more variable concentrations than the top 5 cm of sand. There were no statistical differences in E. coli concentrations when using different methods to sample the saturated sand. Overall, the unsaturated sand had the highest amount of E. coli when compared to saturated sand and pore water (considered on a bulk volumetric basis). The findings presented will help determine the appropriate sampling strategy for characterizing FIB abundance in the foreshore reservoir as a means of predicting its potential impact on nearshore surface water quality and public health risk.

However, the development of reliable WQMS is fatally constrained by severe contamination and biofouling of sensors due to the hostile analytical environment of wastewaters, especially raw sewages, that challenges the limit of existing sensing technologies. In this work, we report a technological solution to enable the development of WQMS for real-time abnormal event detection with high reliability and practicality. A vectored high flow hydrodynamic self-cleaning approach and a dual-sensor self-diagnostic concept are adopted for WQMS to effectively encounter vital sensor failing issues caused by contamination and biofouling and ensure the integrity of sensing data. The performance of the WQMS has been evaluated over a 3-year trial period at different sewage catchment sites across three Australian states. It has demonstrated that the developed WQMS is capable of continuously operating in raw sewage for a prolonged period up to 24 months without maintenance and failure, signifying the high reliability and practicality. The demonstrated WQMS capability to reliably acquire real-time wastewater quality information leaps forward the development of effective wastewater source management system.

Incidence of gastrointestinal illness following wet weather recreational exposures: Harmonization of quantitative microbial risk assessment with an epidemiologic investigation of surfers	WATER RESEARCH												We modeled the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) illness associated with recreational exposures to marine water following storm events in San Diego County, California. We estimated GI illness risks via quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) techniques by consolidating site specific pathogen monitoring data of stormwater, site specific dilution estimates, literature-based water ingestion data, and literature based pathogen dose-response and morbidity information. Our water quality results indicated that human sources of contamination contribute viral and bacterial pathogens to streams draining an urban watershed during wet weather that then enter the ocean and affect nearshore water quality. We evaluated a series of approaches to account for uncertainty in the norovirus dose-response model selection and compared our model results to those from a concurrently conducted epidemiological study that provided empirical estimates for illness risk following ocean exposure. The preferred norovirus dose-response approach yielded median risk estimates for water recreation-associated illness (15 GI illnesses per 1000 recreation events) that closely matched the reported epidemiological results (12 excess GI illnesses per 1000 wet weather recreation events). The results are consistent with norovirus, or other pathogens associated with norovirus, as an important cause of gastrointestinal illness among surfers in this setting. This study demonstrates the applicability of QMRA for recreational water risk estimation, even under wet weather conditions and describes a process that might be useful in developing site-specific water quality criteria in this and other locations.

In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was applied to model streamflow, sediment, and pesticide diuron loading in the San Joaquinwatershed, a major contributing area to the elevated pesticide levels in the downstream Delta. The Sequential Uncertainty Fitting version 2 (SUFI-2) algorithm was employed to perform calibration and uncertainty analysis. A combination of performance measures (PMs) and standardized performance evaluation criteria (PEC) was applied to evaluate model performance, while prediction uncertainty was quantified by 95% prediction uncertainty band (95PPU). Results showed that streamflow simulation was at least "satisfactory" at most stations, with more than 50% of the observed data bracketed by the 95PPU. Sediment simulation was rated as at least "satisfactory" based on two PMs, and diuron simulation was judged as "good" by all PMs. The 95PPU of sediment and diuron bracketed about 40% and 30% of the observed data, respectively. Significant correlations were observed between the diuron loads, and precipitation, streamflow, and the current and antecedent pesticide use. Results also showed that the majority (>70%) of agricultural diuron was transported during winter months, when direct exposure of biocontrol agents to diuron runoff is limited. However, exposure in the dry season could be a concern because diuron is relatively persistent in aquatic system. This study not only provides valuable information for the development of biological weed control plan in the Delta, but also serves as a foundation for the continued research on calibration, evaluation, and uncertainty analysisof spatially distributed, physically based hydrologic models.

Persistent Urban Influence on Surface Water Quality via Impacted Groundwater	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Growing urban environments stress hydrologic systems and. impact downstream water quality. We examined a third-order catchment that transitions from an undisturbed mountain environment into urban Salt Lake City, Utah. We performed synoptic surveys during al range of seasonal baseflow conditions and utilized multiple lines of, evidence to identify mechanisms by which urbanization impacts water quality. Surface water chemistry did not change appreciably until several kilometers into the urban environment, where concentrations of solutes such as, chloride and nitrate increase quickly in a gaining reach: Groundwater springs discharging in this gaining system demonstrate the role of contaminated baseflow from an aquifer in driving stream chemistry. Hydrometric and hydrochemical observations were used to estimate that the aquifer contains approximately 18% water sourced from the urban area. The carbon and nitrogen dynamics indicated the urban aquifer also serves as a biogeochemical reactor. The evidence of surface water groundwater exchange on a spatial scale of kilometers and time scale of months to years suggests a need to evolve the hydrologic model of anthropogenic impacts to urban water quality to include exchange with the subsurface. This has implications on the space and time scales of water quality mitigation efforts.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				SEP 5	2017	51	17					9477	9487		10.1021/acs.est.7b00271								WOS:000410255800007	28730814

Trees and Streets as Drivers of Urban Stormwater Nutrient Pollution	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Expansion of tree cover is a major management goal in cities because of the substantial benefits provided to people, and potentially to water quality through reduction of stormwater volume by interception. However, few studies have addressed the full range of potential impacts of trees on urban runoff, which includes deposition of nutrient-rich leaf litter onto streets connected to storm drains. We analyzed the influence of trees on stormwater nitrogen and phosphorus export across 19 urban watersheds in Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN, U.S.A., and at the scale of individual streets within one residential watershed. Stormwater nutrient concentrations were highly variable across watersheds and strongly related to tree canopy over streets, especially for phosphorus. Stormwater nutrient loads were primarily related to road density, the dominant control over runoff volume. Street canopy exerted opposing effects on loading, where elevated nutrient concentrations from trees near roads outweighed the weak influence of trees on runoff reduction. These results demonstrate that vegetation near streets contributes substantially to stormwater nutrient pollution, and therefore to eutrophication of urban surface waters. Urban landscape design and management that account for trees as nutrient pollution sources could improve water quality outcomes, while allowing cities to enjoy the myriad benefits of urban forests.

Quantifying Lake Water Quality Evolution: Coupled Geochemistry, Hydrodynamics, and Aquatic Ecology in an Acidic Pit Lake	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Assessment of water quality evolution in the thousands of existing and future mine pit lakes worldwide requires new numerical tools that integrate geochemical, hydrological, and biological processes. A coupled model was used to test alternative hypothesized controls on water quality in a pit lake over years. The evolution of pH, Al, and Fe were closely linked; field observations were reproduced with generic solubility equilibrium controls on Fe(III) and Al and a commonly reported acceleration of the abiotic Fe(II) oxidation rate by 2-3 orders of magnitude. Simulations indicated an ongoing acidity loading at the site, and the depletion of Al mineral buffering capacity after similar to 5 years. Simulations also supported the existence of pH limitation on nitrification, and a limitation on phytoplankton growth other than the commonly postulated P and DIC limitations. Furthermore, the model reproduced the general patterns of salinity, pH, Al, and Fe during an uncontrolled river breach in 2011, however, incorporating sediment biogeochemical feedbacks is required to reproduce the observed postbreach internal alkalinity generation in the lake. The modeling approach is applicable to the study of hydrological, geochemical, and biological interactions for a range of lake and reservoir management challenges.

However, the detailed benefits and costs associated with integrated RTC have yet to be comprehensively evaluated. Built on state-of-the-art modeling and analytical tools, a three-step framework is proposed to develop integrated RTC strategies which cost-effectively maximize environmental outcomes. Results from a case study show integrated RTC can improve river quality by over 20% to meet the "good status" requirements of the EU Water Framework Directive with a 15% reduced cost, due to responsive aeration with changing environmental assimilation capacity. The cost-effectiveness of integrated RTC strategies is further demonstrated against tightening environmental standards (to the strictest levels) and against two commonly used compliance strategies. Compared to current practices (seasonal/monthly based operation), integrated RTC strategies can reduce costs while improving resilience of the system to disturbances and reducing environmental risk.

Devin; Thalheimer, Andrew H.; Zhao, Lanying			Contaminant mass flux and forensic assessment of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons: Tools to inform remediation decision making at a contaminated site in Canada	REMEDIATION-THE JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP COSTS TECHNOLOGIES & TECHNIQUES												Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) andmetal(loid) mass flux estimates and forensic assessment using PAH diagnostic ratios were used to inform remediation decision making at the Sydney Tar Ponds (STPs) and Coke Ovens cleanup project in eastern Canada. Environmental effects monitoring of surface marine sediments in Sydney Harbor indicated significantly higher PAH concentrations during the first year of remediation monitoring compared to baseline. This was equivalent to PAH loadings of similar to 2,000 kg over a 15-month period. Increases in sediment PAH concentrations raised serious concerns for regulators, who requested cessation of remediation activities early in the $400M (CAD) project. Historically, the STPs were reported as the primary source of PAH contamination in Sydney Harbor with estimated discharges of 300 to 800 kg/year between 1989 and 2001. Mass flux estimates of PAHs and metal(loid)s and PAH diagnostic ratios were used to evaluate if increases in PAH concentrations in marine sediments were the result of the STPs remediation activities. PAH mass flux estimates approximated that 17 to 97 kg/year were discharged from the STPs during three years of remediation and were corroborated by an independent PAH flux estimate of 119 kg in year 1. PAH fluxes to the Sydney Harbor were mostly surface water derived, with groundwater contributing negligible quantities (0.002-0.005 kg/year). Fluxes of metal(loid) s to harbor sediments were stable or declining across all years and were mirrored in sediment metal(loid) concentrations, which lacked temporal variation, unlike total PAH concentrations. Flux results were also corroborated using PAH diagnostic ratios, which found a common source of PAHs. Coal combustion was likely the principal source of PAHs and not migration from the STPs during remediation. Although short-term residual sediment PAH increases during onset of remediation raised concerns for regulators, calls for premature cessation of remediation early in the project were unwarranted based on only one year of monitoring data. Mass flux estimates and forensic assessments using PAH diagnostic ratios proved useful tools to inform remediation decision making that helped environmental protection and reduced costs associated with lost cleanup time.																	1051-5658	1520-6831				FAL	2017	27	4					9	17		10.1002/rem.21525								WOS:000423925100002

The main cause of water contamination is social and development activities of human being along with increasing population. The community in the study area has acute shortage of drinking water along with about 40 to 60% has no access to safe drinking water. This study indicates drinking water quality of two major sources of coastal belt of Karachi one is supplied by Karachi Water & Sewerage Board (KWSB) as tap water and the other through groundwater. The physicochemical analysis was carried out by following the standard methods for checking the quality of drinking water. The analyzed results showed that the quality of groundwater was unfit as potable water. The most critical situation was observed as high level of contamination followed by high turbidity and increased salinity levels. TDS in surface water were found 12% above and TDS in groundwater was 20% below the National Drinking Water Quality Standards (NDWQS) of Pakistan as well as the permissible WHO drinking water quality guidelines.																	2234-1722	2234-1730				SEP	2017	6	3					203	216		10.12989/aer.2017.6.3.203								WOS:000419972800004

This lake is one of the clear water lakes in Olsztyn, but the progressive deterioration of water quality has been observed during recent years. The phosphorus concentration in the water-sediment interface, phosphorus fractions quantity and the amount of components which can bind this element was investigated in the upper (0-5 cm) layer of deposits. The aim of study was to analyze the potential influence of bottom sediment on the lake water quality. The obtained results revealed that the bottom sediment of Tyrsko Lake can be classified as mixed, silica-organic type, with a relatively high content of iron (over 4% Fe in d.w.). The total phosphorus content was ca. 3.5 mg P g(-1) d.w. on average. Phosphorus in the bottom sediment was bound mainly with organic matter (NaOH-nrP fraction), which had over 50% share in TP. Highly mobile fractions (NH4-Cl-P and BD-P) together only included ca. 5% to 7% TP. The obtained results show that the bottom sediment of Tyrsko Lake can bind phosphorus quite effectively. The calculated internal mineral phosphorus loading during summer stagnation period was 10.9 kg and it was lower that the assessed annual external phosphorus load (22.6 kg). The assessed annual phosphorus loading from both sources was still lower than the critical load according to Vollenweider criteria. However, due to the fact that the internal loading phenomenon is occurring in the lake, it should be taken into consideration that the lake water quality can deteriorate gradually during the longer time perspective. These findings should be accounted for in the future if the potential protection and restoration procedures will be developed.

The main tasks of both reservoirs are to improve the water balance by means of regulating the levels and water outflow. Three characteristic measurement and control points were selected on both reservoirs in accordance to the water flow in the longitudinal section. The first and third points were located near the inflow and outflow of water, while the second in the middle of the reservoirs. Samples of water for the study were collected from the surface layer of the shore zone of the reservoirs once a month from March 2015 to February 2017 (water from two hydrological years was analyzed). Water samples were subject to determination of total phosphorus, total nitrogen, and chlorophyll "a" concentrations, as well as turbidity. Contamination of the water reservoirs with biogenic compounds is a common problem and at the same time difficult to eliminate due to the scattered nature of external sources of pollution, especially in the case of agricultural catchments, as well as the inflow of untreated sewage from areas directly adjacent to the reservoirs. Based on achieved results, high values of TSI (TN), TSI (TP), TSI (Chl), and overall TSI, clearly indicate the progressive degradation of water quality in analyzed reservoirs. Appearing water blooms due to the mass development of phytoplankton adversely affect the quality of water in the reservoirs and biochemical processes occurring both in water and bottom sediments, are conditioned by progressive eutrophication.																	2299-8993					SEP	2017	18	5					160	167		10.12911/22998993/74627								WOS:000416835200020

Analyses of physicochemical indices revealed that waters along the whole length of the stream qualified for below good status due to the exceeded EC and nitrate nitrogen concentrations. It was found that among 21 analyzed physicochemical indices, statistically significant differences occurred for 5: total dissolved solids, SO42-, Mg2+, K+ and water pH. In the headwaters section values of four salinity indices were significantly higher in relation to the other part of the stream. Assessment of anthropogenic factors affecting the catchment water resources conducted on the basis of unitary and percent indices revealed that the dominant category shaping the physicochemical status of the Korzkiewka stream water is municipal economy. The intensity of the influence of the factors from this category was from medium to very high, while in case of sewage discharged through the sewage network, even to outlier intensity. Forestry and agriculture exerted medium pressure, whereas the factors from the industry category had hardly any influence on water in the stream.

The long-term research was performed at Kivesvaara experimental plots (64 degrees 28'N, 27 degrees 33'E) and Oijusluoma small catchments (65 degrees 50'N, 29 degrees 0'E), with a detailed snow observation at Paljakka (65 degrees 26'N, 26 degrees 26'E). Forestry practices included clear-cut, shelterwood and seed cutting with different techniques of soil preparation and reforestation. The clear-cut (particularly by the total biomass harvest including stump removal) has increased the water yield (a positive feedback). But, on the other hand, it has caused a drop in retention and lag-time, and an increase of peak-flows, as well as increasing mobility of nitrogen and phosphorus. Thus, the clear-cut of mature spruce stands (Picea abies) increased the groundwater recharge by 63 mm (i. e., 24%), and the total biomass harvest of one-half of the experimental catchment increased the water yield by 44 mm (i. e., 15%) during three years after the harvest. A significant increase in contents of nitrogen persisted in groundwaters more than 25 years after the clear-cut, and 10 years after the natural regeneration (shelterwood or seed cutting). During the monitored period of 28 years, the total output of nitrogen from subsequent forest plantations ranged from 12 to 21 tons per hectare (i. e., exceeding 5-9 times the output from control mature spruce stands). By natural regeneration, the ten-year mean load of nitrogen exceeded 2.5-5 times the load at control plots. After the total biomass harvest (a whole tree and stump removal), the mean annual outflow of nitrogen and phosphorus was 5.4 and 0.11 kg ha(-1) (exceeding 2.5 and 1.8 times the pre-treatment stream-flow). These results confirmed the hypothesis of a significant impact of forest practices on water resource control in the boreal forest biome.

Mineral Processing Residue Use as Substrate in a Modular Engineered Wetland for Wastewater Treatment	ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSES-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL												Safeguarding the water quality of Poyang Lake, China's largest freshwater lake, is essential for long-term regional water resource sustainability. The use of locally-available mineral processing residues as reactive substrate in engineered wetlands may provide a costeffective treatment alternative for mixed agricultural and domestic wastewaters entering Poyang Lake. In this study, Chinese iron-and steel-making slags and a titanium mineral processing residue with high nutrient removal capacity were identified in laboratory experiments. A pilot-scale modular wetland system consisting of free water surface, and vertical and horizontal subsurface flow units, all planted with locally-available vegetation, was constructed at the Poyang Lake Modelling Experiment and Research Base in Jiangxi Province. Assessment of nutrient removal efficiency and effluent water quality was undertaken to inform upscaling and optimization of the modular unit process wetland design. The pilot-scale wetland system removed 55% of inorganic N in influent wastewater and was particularly effective in P attenuation, removing 81% of total P. The environmentally-acceptable pH of wetland system effluents, along with low concentrations of dissolved metals and the absence of potential for either N-or Si-limitation, indicated that the modular wetland system examined was potentially suitable for treatment of mixed wastewater entering Poyang Lake. The use of the selected mineral processing residues as reactive substrate in engineered wetland systems enhanced pollutant removal processes in the modular engineered wetland system, effectively attenuating pollutants in mixed wastewater.																	2198-7491	2198-7505				SEP	2017	4	3					523	547		10.1007/s40710-017-0247-6								WOS:000414368400003

Such mapping could lead to optimal utilization and protection from quality deterioration. In this paper, a geospatial based water quality index is developed for preparing water quality class suitability map. The aim of this study is to provide an overview of the spatial variation of groundwater quality parameters, i. e., Fluoride (F-), Nitrate (NO3-), Chloride (Cl-), Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), pH and Total Hardness (TH) in the Khushkhera -Bhiwadi-Neemrana Investment Region (KBNIR). Groundwater samples were collected from 14 locations, tested in the laboratory and were analyzed using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) techniques. Geospatial analyst tools were used to generate various thematic maps, and interpolation techniques were applied to identify the spatial distribution of groundwater quality parameters. Groundwater quality was analyzed in detail and compared with BIS and WHO water quality standards. Multivariate statistical techniques, such as Correlation Matrix Analysis and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were carried out. The correlation coefficient showed TDS highly correlated with chloride (r = 0.725), and a negative correlation (r =-0.656) between pH and nitrate. It was observed that 36.02% of the populated area depends on excellent quality groundwater and 23.56% on good quality groundwater, while poor and moderately poor quality groundwater is available for respectively 6.26% and 34.16% of the populated area. Also, only 65.88% of the total geographical area within the KBNIR region is hydrochemically suitable for drinking purposes. Attempts are also made to compare these results with PCA results.																	2198-7491	2198-7505				SEP	2017	4	3					645	662		10.1007/s40710-017-0257-4								WOS:000414368400010						
J	Islam, N; Rodriguez, MJ; Farahat, A; Sadiq, R				Islam, Nilufar; Rodriguez, Manuel J.; Farahat, Ashraf; Sadiq, Rehan			Minimizing the impacts of contaminant intrusion in small water distribution networks through booster chlorination optimization	STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT												Contaminant intrusion in a water distribution network (DN) has three basic pre-conditions: source of contaminant (e.g., leaky sewer), a pathway (e.g., water main leaks), and a driving force (e.g., negative pressure). The impact of intrusion can be catastrophic if residual disinfectant (chlorine) is not present. To avoid microbiological water quality failure, higher levels of secondary chlorination doses can be a possible solution, but they can produce disinfectant by-products which lead to taste and odour complaints. This study presents a methodology to identify potential intrusion points in a DN and optimize booster chlorination based on trade-offs among microbiological risk, chemical risk and life-cycle cost for booster chlorination. A point-scoring scheme was developed to identify the potential intrusion points within a DN. It utilized factors such as pollutant source (e.g., sewer characteristics), pollution pathway (water main diameter, length, age, and surrounding soil properties, etc.), consequence of contamination (e.g., population, and land use), and operational factors (e.g., water pressure) integrated through a geographical information system using advanced ArcMap 10 operations. The contaminant intrusion was modelled for E. Coli O156: H7 (a microbiological indicator) using the EPANET-MSX programmer's toolkit. The quantitative microbial risk assessment and chemical (human health) risk assessment frameworks were adapted to estimate risk potentials. Booster chlorination locations and dosages were selected using a multi-objective genetic algorithm. The methodology was illustrated through a case study on a portion of a municipal DN.																	1436-3240	1436-3259				SEP	2017	31	7			SI		1759	1775		10.1007/s00477-017-1440-x								WOS:000412457300015

It is an environmentally friendly drainage system that was designed to increase infiltration, reduce peak flow at outlet, improve water quality, through different BMPs, such as grass swale, retention pond, etc. A special feature of BIOECODS is ecological swale with on-line subsurface detention. This study attempted to create a model of ecological swale with on-line subsurface conveyance system with InfoWorks SD. The new technique has been used Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) model to describe overland flow routing and Soil Conservation Service Method (SCS) used to model infiltration or subsurface flow. The modeling technique has been proven successful, as the predicted and observed closely match each other, with a mean error of 4.58 to 7.32%. The calibrated model then used to determine the ratio of the flow exchange between the surface and subsurface drainage system. Results from the model showed that the runoff ratio exchange between the surface and subsurface is 60 to 90%.

This farm-scale study took place along a 1 km section of a headwater stream in southern Quebec (southeastern Canada). Five tree species with contrasted ecological characteristics were planted (Populus x canadensis, Fraxinus pennsylvanica, Quercus macrocarpa, Quercus rubra and Pinus strobus), with black plastic (polyethylene) mulches as the vegetation management method, as well as a control with no vegetation management, all within a fenced herbaceous riparian buffer. Tree growth and survival were measured along with soil nutrient supply. Significant Species x Vegetation treatment interactions where observed for all growth variables (p < 0.001), but also for soil nitrate (NO3) supply (p < 0.01). All species benefited from the plastic mulch treatment, but varied greatly in their responses. After 5 years, mulched hybrid poplar produced 774 times more stem volume than red oak without mulch. Across all species/vegetation treatment combinations, a 13-fold variation in soil NO3 supply rate was observed during the 4th growing season. Compared to the other species, NO3 supply rate in hybrid poplar plots was 3987% lower in the plastic mulch treatment and 4862% lower in the control treatment. Significantly higher soil NO3 supply rates were observed beneath the mulches of non nitrophilous species (white pine and red oak). Red oak growth was negatively correlated with NO3 supply (R-2 = 0.57, p < 0.05) in the mulch treatment. Early-successional nitrophilous species (hybrid poplar and red ash) planted with the plastic mulch led to the lowest increase in soil NO3 and the greatest gains in buffer structural attributes (stem volume, diameter and height). Hybrid poplar growth was positively correlated with soil NO3 supply (R-2 = 0.86, p < 0.001) in the control treatment. Natural abandoned field/grassland invaders (white pine and bur oak) grew well without black plastic mulch, while the growth of non-mulched red oaks was marginal. In the control treatment, stem volume was a strong negative predictor (across all species) of soil NO3 supply (R-2 = 0.91, p < 0.05), indicating that under herbaceous vegetation competition larger trees have a greater ability to reduce soil NO3. This study provides evidence that particular tree species/vegetation management treatment combinations strongly influence early riparian buffer structural development and soil NO3 dynamics in agricultural riparian zones.

Finding the harvesting frequency to maximize nutrient removal in a constructed wetland dominated by submerged aquatic plants	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Water quality is still poor in many freshwater ecosystems around the world as a result of anthropogenic nutrient loading. Constructed wetlands can be used to remove excess nutrients. In these wetlands, helophytes or free floating aquatic plants are traditionally used to absorb the nutrients. The nutrients are subsequently exported upon harvesting of the plants. However, rooted submerged plants may be more effective to extract nutrients from moderately eutrophicated ecosystems than helophytes or floating species. Here, we tested how the frequency of harvesting affected submerged biomass production, biomass nutrient content and the resulting amount of nutrients removed, as well as the vegetation composition and structure. Two Myriophyllum spicatum dominated shallow ponds, with moderately low surface water nutrient loading (similar to 5.6 mg N.m(-2).d(-1) and similar to 1.32 mg P.m(-2).d(-1)) were used. Each pond was subjected to four harvesting treatments: mowing lx, 2x, 3 x or 5 x between May and September 2015. Harvesting 2 x or 3 x removed most biomass and nutrients, while mowing either 5 x or only once at the end of the growing season removed the lowest amount of nutrients from the system. Furthermore, the dominance of M. spicatum in the vegetation was best maintained in plots mown 2 x, while its cover declined in plots mown more frequently, resulting in an increase of charophyte abundance. We conclude that harvesting at an intermediate frequency is best when aiming to remove the maximum amount of nutrients under a moderately low nutrient loading. Harvesting more frequently may be a suitable management method to reduce dominance of M. spicatum in situations where it causes nuisance problems due to massive growth. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A consistent investigation for three years about macrophyte, phy-toplankton, zooplankton and water quality has been conducted to explore the effect of macrophyte restoration on improving aquatic ecosystem. The results showed that macrophyte biomass and coverage after the restoration were as high as 821 g/m(2) and 55%, respectively, and the dominant species were Cer-atophyllum demersum, Myriophyllum verticillatum and Potamogeton crispus. Moreover, chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN), total suspended solids (TSS) and nitrate nitrogen (NN) significantly decreased yearly, but the changes in total phosphorus (TP) and ammonia nitrogen (AN) were not significant during the investigation. Phytoplankton density and biomass significantly decreased, and the dominant species changed from blue-green algae to green algae. Zooplankton density and biomass, however, significantly increased yearly, and the small-sized dominant species (such as, Keratella cochlearis, Polyarthra trigla, etc.) were gradually replaced by the large-sized species (such as, Asplanchna priodonala, Alma guttata, etc.) during the restoration. In addition, macrophyte was negatively correlated with nutrients, but positively correlated with zooplankton. Phytoplankton was also positively related with TN. These correlations showed that restored macrophytes could decrease nutrition loading in water body, inhibit phytoplankton growth to decrease the risk of algae blooms, and support more large-sized zooplankton to strengthen the top-down control of phytoplankton. Therefore, our results showed that macrophyte restoration is a very potential and effective method to combat with the eutrophication and develop water quality in the eutrophic subtropical lakes, and deserves more attentions in future subtropical/tropical lake managements.

Characterising urban zinc generation to identify surface pollutant hotspots in a low intensity rainfall climate	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Characterising stormwater runoff quality provides useful insights into the dynamics of pollutant generation and wash off rates. These can be used to prioritise stormwater management strategies. This study examined the effects of a low intensity rainfall climate on zinc contributions from different impermeable urban surface types. First flush (FF) and steady state samples were collected from seven different surfaces for characterisation, and the data were also used to calibrate an event-based pollutant load model to predict individual 'hotspot' surfaces across the catchment. Unpainted galvanised roofs generated very high concentrations of zinc, primarily in the more biologically available dissolved form. An older, unpainted galvanised roof had FF concentrations averaging 32,338 mu g/L, while the new unpainted roof averaged 4,782 mu g/L. Roads and carparks also had elevated zinc, but FF concentrations averaged only 822-1,584 mu g/L. Modelling and mapping expected zinc loads from individual impermeable surfaces across the catchment identified specific commercial roof surfaces to be targeted for zinc management. The results validate a policy strategy to replace old galvanised roof materials and avoid unpainted galvanised roofing in future urban development for better urban water quality outcomes. In the interim, readily-implemented treatment options are required to help mitigate chronic zinc impacts on receiving waterways.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				SEP	2017	76	6					1370	1377		10.2166/wst.2017.306								WOS:000411845600009	28953463

Multivariate statistical techniques were applied to study temporal and spatial variations in water quality of a segment of the Marikina River. The data set included 12 physico-chemical parameters for five monitoring stations over a year. Cluster analysis grouped the monitoring stations into four clusters and identified January-May as dry season and June-September as wet season. Principal components analysis showed that three latent factors are responsible for the data set explaining 83% of its total variance. The chemical oxygen demand, biochemical oxygen demand, total dissolved solids, Cl- and PO43- are influenced by anthropogenic impact/eutrophication pollution from point sources. Total suspended solids, turbidity and SO42- are influenced by rain and soil erosion. The highest state of pollution is at the Payatas creek outfall from March to May, whereas at downstream stations it is in May. The current study indicates that the river monitoring requires only four stations, nine water quality parameters and testing over three specific months of the year. The findings of this study imply that Payatas landfill requires a proper leachate collection and treatment system to reduce its impact on the Marikina River.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				SEP	2017	76	6					1510	1522		10.2166/wst.2017.279								WOS:000411845600023	28953477

Peak flows were released in the early part of the pulse to simulate a spring flood, with approximately 101.7 mcm released at Morelos Dam on the U.S.-Mexico border. The remainder of the pulse flow water was released to the riparian corridor via Mexicali Valley irrigation spillway canals, with 20.9 mcm released at Km 27 Spillway (41 km below Morelos Dam) and 9.3 mcm released at Km 18 Spillway (78 km below Morelos Dam). We used sequential satellite images, overflights, ground observations, water discharge measurements, and automated temperature, river stage and water quality loggers to document and describe the progression of pulse flow water through the study area. The rate of advance of the wetted front was slowed by infiltration and high channel roughness as the pulse flow crossed more than 40 km of dry channel which was disconnected from underlying groundwater and partially overgrown with salt cedar. High lag time and significant attenuation of flow resulted in a changing hydrograph as the pulse flow progressed to the downstream delivery points; two peak flows occurred in some lower reaches. The pulse flow advanced more than 120 km downstream from Morelos Dam to reach the Colorado River estuary at the northern end of the Gulf of California. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The applied MST tools combined microbial analyses and molecular tests to detect and define the source(s) and dominant origin(s) of faecal water contamination. Faecal indicator bacteria Escherichia coli and host-specific Bacteroidales 16 s rRNA gene markers have been employed. The study revealed that the newly developed contribution profiling of faecal origin derived from the Bacteroidales DNA could quantitatively distinguish between human and non-human pollution origins. Further, the outcomes of the MST test have been compared with the results of both physicochemical analyses and tests of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs). A strong positive correlation was discovered between the human marker and PPCPs. Gabapentin was the most frequently detected compound and it showed the uppermost positive correlation with the human marker. The study demonstrated that the NBTS performs satisfactorily with the removal of E. coli but not PPCPs. Interestingly, the presence of PPCPs in the water samples was not correlated with high concentrations of E. coli. Neither has the latter an apparent correlation with the human marker.

Adapted optimization model for planning regional wastewater systems: case study	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Wastewater systems are of crucial importance to the promotion of sustainable development. Through an integrated planning approach, the costs can be minimized and the resulting benefits maximized. A planning approach at regional level exploits the economies of scale, while achieving a better environmental performance. In this paper we set out a decision support approach for the planning of regional wastewater systems. Optimization models are used, aimed at finding optimal configurations for the location, type and size of the system's infrastructure: sewers, pump stations, and wastewater treatment plants. Solutions are evaluated in terms of the cost of installing, operating and maintaining the infrastructure, and the water quality in the river that receives the treated wastewater. The river water quality varies in accordance with the effluent discharges, and is assessed using environmental parameters. The models are solved with a simulated annealing algorithm complemented by a local improvement procedure. Its application is illustrated through a case study in the Una river basin region, in Brazil.

Until now, general end-users have had no effective method to measure the drinking water quality in situ and identify first-hand any violation. In return, there has been no feedback closed-loop of water quality monitoring and a control regime along distribution systems to provide real-time in situ early-warning for water treatment plants. This study targeted this crucial challenge by developing flat flexible thin micro-electrode array (MEA) sensors that integrate multiple types of mm-sized sensors to simultaneously monitor critical water quality parameters (temperature, conductivity, pH, Cl- and ClO-). MEA films were directly mounted onto a water tube that simulated a distribution system. Each type of sensor showed high accuracy with an R-2 value higher than 0.95 in the calibration tests. The shock tests clearly demonstrated the higher sensitivity of the MEA sensors than commercial sensors, and the advantage of integrating multiple types of sensors on a single film for autocorrection. More importantly, the Ag nanoparticle-modified ClO- MEA sensors showed high selectivity in the presence of competing elements (Cl-). Four-week tests in tap water revealed the intact structure of the MEA sensors and stable signal output. Overall, the MEAs possessed high accuracy, sensitivity, and selectivity for monitoring water quality. The flat flexible thin material and integrated configuration make the deployment of the sensors easy along distribution systems and at end-user points, and ultimately enable the in situ assessment of water quality in the water infrastructure.																	2053-1400	2053-1419				SEP 1	2017	3	5					865	874		10.1039/c7ew00103g								WOS:000408431500008

The main challenges for practical applications of bioanode sensors in water quality assessment include their narrow detection range, long analysis time, and hysteresis effects. To overcome these limitations, a new operation method was proposed and examined in microbial electrolysis cell (MEC)-based bioanode sensors. The new operation method consists of normal operation (0.6 V application), a reset step (1.8 V application for 1 min), and a test step (1.2 V application for 2 min). The inclusion of the reset step in the sensor operation eliminated potential hysteresis effects and thus resulted in accurate correlations between readily biodegradable COD (chemical oxygen demand) and electric current with consistent R-2 values of 99% in triplicated sensor experiments. The high voltage application (1.2 V) during the test step not only enhanced sensor accuracy but also extended the detection range up to 130 mg-COD L-1. The combination of a reset step and a test step was proven to allow reliable sensor applications of MECs and other bioelectrochemical systems. Even with the greatly improved sensor accuracy, the correlation between readily biodegradable COD (acetate) and electric current varied substantially in 2 days. The findings indicate that bioanode sensors can be used for rapid organic detection in 3 min with very high accuracies but require frequent sensor calibration.

Hydrologic Performance of Regenerative Stormwater Conveyance in the North Carolina Coastal Plain	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												Regenerative stormwater conveyance (RSC) is an open channel, sand-filtering system composed of a series of shallow aquatic pools, riffle weirs, native vegetation, and underlying media beds. Surface runoff entering an RSC is conveyed as nonerosive surface flow or subsurface seep through the media, and exits the system as surface flow, seep out, exfiltration into parent soil, or evapotranspiration (ET). Regenerative stormwater conveyances are expected to perform similar to other sand-media-based low-impact development (LID) stormwater control measures (SCMs), but the hydrological and water quality efficiencies of RSC have not been sufficiently validated in a variety of hydrogeological conditions to date. A RSC was installed in the coastal plain of North Carolina, receiving runoff from 5.2 ha. Surface flow was reduced substantially through the RSC, with 84% of inflow converted to a shallow interflow-like seep, referred to in this paper as seep out. High groundwater levels resulted in small overall exfiltration rates, but increased evaporation rates due to extended ponding. The conversion of surface runoff to seep out has significant implications for stormwater mitigation, releasing filtered water at slower rates than conventional conveyance channels, similar to undeveloped watersheds. The Brunswick RSC released similar fraction of seep out to that of shallow interflow observed in undeveloped watersheds.

Correcting Systematic Underprediction of Biochemical Oxygen Demand in Support Vector Regression	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) is a variable that is missing or inaccurate in many water quality data sets because of difficulties in diluting highly polluted water samples. Machine learning algorithms, particularly support vector regression (SVR), are useful to build regression models to fill gaps in these data sets. The SVR can underpredict extreme-high values when they are few in number and underrepresented. This paper evaluates two methods, bootstrapping and data expansion, to mitigate the problem by increasing the proportion of extreme-high BOD in the data set before training the gap-filling model. Both methods were tested on the water quality data of Yuen Long Creek, Hong Kong, for the years 2000-2014. Both methods were effective in mitigating systematic underprediction and reducing their residual errors when the proportion of extreme-high values in the data set were increased from 3 to 30-40%. Both methods were useful for gap filling on BOD time series because extreme-high values are often the ones missing or inaccurate when highly polluted samples are diluted.

Evaluation of Bioretention Cell Performance Seven Years Postconstruction	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												Bioretention cells (BRCs) are stormwater control measures that integrate water quantity and quality management. Previous research primarily focused on the performance of cells less than two years old, before potential clogging and sorption site saturation. To assess long-term effectiveness, this project evaluated the performance of a BRC after seven years to determine reductions in flow rate, flow volume, suspended solids, nitrogen, phosphorus, and fecal indicator bacteria (FIB). These observations were compared with analyses conducted immediately postconstruction. Inflow and outflow water samples were collected for sediment, nutrients, and FIB. Soil media samples were collected from multiple depths and analyzed for denitrifying bacteria. Results indicate the BRC remains effective at reducing storm flows, nutrients, and FIB. These reductions were correlated to outflow volume, rather than storm characteristics. The majority of denitrifying bacteria were present in the top media layers, despite the presence of an internal water storage layer for denitrification. This finding suggests denitrification primarily occurs at anoxic microsites in the upper layers and that a lack of carbon at deeper depths may limit significant microbial growth.

This lake supplies approximately four million people with drinking water and has undergone strong re-oligotrophication over the past decades. We calculated depth-specific annual oxygen depletion rates (ODRs) during the period of stratification and found that 50% of the observed variability in ODR was already explained by a simple separation into a sediment- and volume-related oxygen consumption. Adding a linear factor for water depth further improved the model indicating that oxygen depletion increased substantially along the depth. Two other factors turned out to significantly influence ODR: total phosphorus as a proxy for the lake's trophic state and mean oxygen concentration in the respective depth layer. Our analysis points to the importance of nutrient reductions as effective management measures to improve and protect the oxygen status of such large and deep lakes.

A model of hydrology and water quality for stormwater control measures	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												Stormwater control measures (SCMs) are a management strategy that can reduce runoff and nitrogen (N) export from urban watersheds by creating an ecosystem that stores water and promotes N retention and removal. This work develops and explores a computer model that simulates the dynamic hydrologic and water quality processes of SCMs. Data from an SCM in Charlotte, NC was used for model calibration and validation. The hydrologic routines successfully simulated distributions of observed storm event outflow volumes and duration without calibration. Through calibration, the model reproduced observed distributions of event mean concentrations of both nitrate and ammonium in SCM outflow. Model sensitivity to varied air temperature, inflow N concentrations, and inflow volumes was determined. Scenario testing showed that deeper SCMs have greater inorganic N removal efficiencies because they have more stored volume of relatively N-deplete water, and therefore have a greater capacity to dilute relatively N-rich inflow.

Climate Change Impacts on Harmful Algal Blooms in US Freshwaters: A Screening-Level Assessment	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CyanoHABs) have serious adverse effects on human and environmental health. Herein, we developed a modeling framework that predicts the effect of climate change on cyanobacteria concentrations in large reservoirs in the contiguous U.S. The framework, which uses climate change projections from five global circulation models, two greenhouse gas emission scenarios, and two cyanobacterial growth scenarios, is unique in coupling climate projections with a hydrologic/water quality network model of the contiguous United States. Thus, it generates both regional and nationwide projections useful as a screening-level assessment of climate impacts on CyanoHAB prevalence as well as potential lost recreation days and associated economic value. Our projections indicate that CyanoHAB concentrations are likely to increase primarily due to water temperature increases tempered by increased nutrient levels resulting from changing demographics and climatic impacts on hydrology that drive nutrient transport. The combination of these factors results in the mean number of days of CyanoHAB occurrence ranging from about 7 days per year per waterbody under current conditions, to 16-23 days in 2050 and 18-39 days in 2090. From a regional perspective, we find the largest increases in CyanoHAB occurrence in the Northeast U.S., while the greatest impacts to recreation, in terms of costs, are in the Southeast.

Quantitative CrAssphage PCR Assays for Human Fecal Pollution Measurement	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Environmental waters are monitored for fecal pollution to protect public health and water resources. Traditionally, general fecal-indicator bacteria are used; however, they cannot distinguish human fecal waste from other animal pollution sources. Recently, a novel bacteriophage, crAssphage, was discovered by metagenomic data mining and reported to be abundant in and closely associated with human fecal waste. To confirm bioinformatic predictions, 384 primer sets were designed along the length of the crAssphage genome. Based on initial screening, two novel crAssphage qPCR assays (CPQ_056 and CPQ_064) were designed and evaluated in reference fecal samples and water matrices. The assays exhibited high specificities (98.6%) when tested against an animal fecal reference library, and crAssphage genetic markers were highly abundant in raw sewage and sewage impacted water samples. In addition, CPQ_056 and CPQ_064 performance was compared to HF183/BacR287 and HumM2 assays in paired experiments. Findings confirm that viral crAssphage qPCR assays perform at a similar level to well-established bacterial human-associated fecal-source-identification approaches. These new viral-based assays could become important water quality management and research tools.

Organic Carbon Amendments for Enhanced Biological Attenuation of Trace Organic Contaminants in Biochar-Amended Stormwater Biofilters	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												This study sought to evaluate how dissolved organic carbon (DOC) affects attenuation of trace organic contaminants (TOrCs) in biochar-amended stormwater biofilters. It was hypothesized that (1) DOC-augmented runoff would demonstrate enhanced TOrC biodegradation and (2) biochar-amended sand bearing DOC-cultivated biofilms would achieve enhanced TOrC attenuation due to sorptive retention and biodegradation. Microcosm and column experiments were conducted utilizing actual runoff, DOC from straw and compost, and a suite of TOrCs. Biodegradation of TOrCs in runoff was more enhanced by compost DOC than straw DOC (particularly for atrazine, prometon, benzotriazole, and fipronil). 16S rRNA gene quantification and sequencing revealed that growth-induced microbial community changes were, among replicates, most consistent for compost-augmented microcosms and least consistent for raw runoff microcosms. Compost DOC most robustly enhanced utilization of TOrCs as carbon substrates, possibly due to higher residual nutrient levels upon TOrC exposure. Sand columns containing just 0.5 wt % biochar maintained sorptive TOrC retention in the presence of compost-DOC-cultivated biofilms, and TOrC removal was further enhanced by biological activity. Overall, these results suggest that coamendment with biochar and compost may robustly enhance TOrC attenuation in stormwater biofilters, a finding of significance for efforts to mitigate the impacts of runoff on water quality.

In vitro bioassays with limited key toxicological end points have been shown to be suitable to evaluate mixtures of organic pollutants in wastewater and recycled water. Omics approaches such as transcriptomics can monitor biological effects at the genome scale. However, few studies have applied omics approach in the assessment of mixtures of organic micropollutants. Here, an omics approach was developed for profiling bioactivity of 10 water samples ranging from wastewater to drinking water in human cells by a reduced human transcriptome (RHT) approach and dose-response modeling. Transcriptional expression of 1200 selected genes were measured by an Ampliseq technology in two cell lines, HepG2 and MCF7, that were exposed to eight serial dilutions of each sample. Concentration-effect models were used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and to calculate effect concentrations (ECs) of DEGs, which could be ranked to investigate low dose response. Furthermore, molecular pathways disrupted by different samples were evaluated by Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. The ability of RHT for representing bioactivity utilizing both HepG2 and MCF7 was shown to be comparable to the results of previous in vitro bioassays. Finally, the relative potencies of the mixtures indicated by RHT analysis were consistent with the chemical profiles of the samples. RHT analysis with human cells provides an efficient and cost-effective approach to benchmarking mixture of micropollutants and may offer novel insight into the assessment of mixture toxicity in water.

Results revealed that compared to photolysis, the photocatalytic degradation efficiencies of the four sulfonamides were significantly enhanced with the addition of g-C3N4, and more than 90% of photodegradation removal was obtained. The effects of typical water quality parameters, including solution pH, bicarbonate ion and humic acid, on the photodegradation process were discussed. It was found that although the photodegradation of the four sulfonamides exhibited different trends under the variation of the water quality parameters, an excellent photocatalytic removal could always be achieved, illustrating the robustness and effectiveness of the g-C3N4 photodegradation process. The ESR measurements showed that both OH center dot and center dot O-2(-) were produced in the photocatalytic process of g-C3N4 under visible light irradiation. And trapping experiments confirmed that center dot O-2(-) and holes played a significant role in the photodegradation of SMX, SDZ and SMZ; but holes and OH center dot were the main oxidative species for SSX degradation. Finally, according to the oxidation products detected by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (UPLC/MS/MS), the degradation pathways of the four sulfonamides were proposed and compared. It was found that there were some common pathways shared by the different sulfonamides, such as cleavage of S-N bond and hydroxylation of the benzene ring (the main degradation pathways for SSX). More importantly, some specific photodegradation pathways were also identified: (1) the nitration of amino group on the benzene ring occurred for SMX, SDZ and SMZ (the main degradation pathway for SMX, SDZ and SMZ), but not for SSX; (2) the bond cleavage between benzene ring and S occurred only in degradation of SSX; and (3) the carboxylation of the methyl group occurred only in degradation of SMZ.

J	Masindi, V				Masindi, Vhahangwele			Recovery of drinking water and valuable minerals from acid mine drainage using an integration of magnesite, lime, soda ash, CO2 and reverse osmosis treatment processes	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING												In this study, the possibility of recovering valuable minerals and drinking water from acid mine drainage was explored. Neutralisation of Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) and recovery of metals were done at 60 mins of equilibration. DOW water & Process solutions, Reverse Osmosis System Analysis (ROSA), version 9.1 was used to further purify the resultant water to meet the drinking quality standards as required by the South African National Standard (SANS) report (SANS 241). The obtained results revealed that drinking water, metals, gypsum, hydrated lime/limestone were recovered from the treatment process as valuable resources. This was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray Fluorescence (XRF). Morphological properties of initial and recovered minerals were examined using High Resolution Scanning Electron Microscopy (HR-SEM). Carbon Dioxide (CO2) was bubbled through soda treated water to recover limestone and to stabilise the pH of the product water (pH approximate to 7.5). Post treatment, the resultant water was further purified by simulated Reverse Osmosis (RO) system to produce water that meet the drinking water quality as stipulated by SANS 241 standards. The pH of recovered drinking water was approximate to 6.5. The metals removal efficiency of the RO system was approximate to 100%. In general, this study demonstrated that the integration of magnesite, lime, soda ash, CO2 and reverse osmosis treatment processes can convert environmental pollutants and waste resources into commercially valuable products that have industrial applications.																	2213-3437					AUG	2017	5	4					3136	3142		10.1016/j.jece.2017.06.025								WOS:000411143200010

Though soil is treated by electrokinetic (EK) to remove contaminants, this technology cannot take the lead without treatment of groundwater. In the present study, the groundwater sample was collected from Kathanganni Village, Tirupur(Textile Valley) and treated with a chemical process for removal of hardness and followed by the electrodialysis process. Two different current densities viz., 10 mA/cm(2)(system I) and 20 mA/cm(2)(system II) were used. Mixed metal oxide (IrO2-RuO2-TiO2/Ti) was used as anode and Titanium used as cathode. The anionic exchange (AMI - 7001) and cationic exchange (CMI -7000) membranes were placed between anodic and cathodic compartments respectively. The anolyte and catholyte reservoirs were filled with distilled water and the middle compartment filled with chemically treated contaminated water. The optimization of alkali and soda ash for efficient removal of hardness in the groundwater was examined. The efficient removal of salinity such as chloride (90%), sulfate (98%), and TDS (96%) were achieved within 12 h of electrodialysis process. This treated water quality was compared with standard irrigation water quality parameters. The electrical conductivity of the groundwater effectively reduced from 19.3 +/- 1 dS/m to 0.538 +/- 0.5 dS/m for the system I and 0.795 +/- 0.6 dS/m for system II with energy consumption of 53.85 and 149.68 kWh/m(3) for the system I and system II respectively.																	2213-3437					AUG	2017	5	4					3190	3200		10.1016/j.jece.2017.06.033								WOS:000411143200016						
J	Chang, CL; Li, MY				Chang, Chia-Ling; Li, Meng-Yuan			Predictions of Diffuse Pollution by the HSPF Model and the Back-Propagation Neural Network Model	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												Watershed models are important tools for predicting the possible change of watershed responses. Environmental models comprise the deterministic model and the probabilistic model. This study discusses the Hydrological Simulation Program Fortran (HSPF) and the Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPNN); these two models represent the deterministic model and the probabilistic model, respectively. As the properties of the two models are distinct, they have differing abilities to predict surface-runoff pollution. For the two models, the runoff simulation results are satisfactory. However, due to the limitation of the water quality monitoring records, pollution simulation is more difficult than runoff simulation. The results indicate that the prediction accuracy in the pollution simulation can be improved by adjusting the BPNN neurons. On the contrary, improving the prediction accuracy is limited by HSPF. Although the flexibility of BPNN is higher than HSPF, sufficient historical monitoring records are important for both of these models.																	1061-4303	1554-7531				AUG 1	2017	89	8					732	738		10.2175/106143017X14902968254665								WOS:000411925800007	28743327

A pilot project was conducted to evaluate the impact of rain gardens on the water quality and volume reduction of storm runoff from urban streets in a combined sewer area. The study took place in a six-block area on South Grand Boulevard in St. Louis, Missouri. The impact was assessed through a comparison between the pre-construction (2011/ 2012) and the post-construction (2014) phases. Shortly after the rain gardens were installed, the levels of total suspended solids, chloride, total nitrogen, total phosphorous, zinc, and copper increased. The level of mercury was lower than the detection level in both phases. E. coli was the only parameter that showed statistically significant decrease following the installation of rain gardens. The likely reason for initial increase in monitored water quality parameters is that the post-construction sampling began after the rain gardens were constructed but before planting, resulted from soil erosion and wash-out from the mulch. However, the levels of most of water quality parameters decreased in the following time period during the post-construction phase. The study found 76% volume reduction of stormwater runoff following the installation of rain gardens at one of studied sites. Statistical analysis is essential on collected data because of the encountered high variability of measured flows resulted from low flow conditions in studied sewers.

China's Sponge City construction: A discussion on technical approaches	FRONTIERS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & ENGINEERING					International Low Impact Development Conference	2016	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	Chinese Soc Civil Engineers, Water Ind Soc, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Water Environm Res Inst, Chinese Acad Engn, Tsinghua Univ, Peking Univ, Beijing Univ Civil Engn & Architecture				Since 2014, China has been implementing the Sponge City Construction initiative, which represents an enormous and unprecedented effort by any government in the world for achieving urban sustainability. According to preliminary estimates, the total investment on the Sponge City Plan is roughly 100 to 150 million Yuan (RMB) ($15 to $22.5 million) average per square kilometer or 10 Trillion Yuan (RMB) ($1.5 Trillion) for the 657 cities nationwide. The Sponge City Plan (SCP) calls for the use of natural processes such as soil and vegetation as part of the urban runoff control strategy, which is similar to that of low impact development (LID) and green infrastructure (GI) practices being promoted in many parts of the world. The SCP includes as its goals not only effective urban flood control, but also rainwater harvest, water quality improvement and ecological restoration. So far, the SCP implementation has encountered some barriers and challenges due to many factors. The present paper presents a review of those barriers and challenges, offers discussions and recommendations on several technical aspects such as control goals and objectives; planning/design and construction of LID/GI practices; performance evaluation. Several key recommendations are proposed on Sponge City implementation strategy, Site-specific regulatory framework and technical guidance, Product innovation and certification, LID/GI Project financing, LID/GI professional training and certification, public outreach and education. It is expected that the successful implementation of the SCP not only will bring about a sustainable, eco-friendly urbanization process in China, but also contribute enormously to the LID/GI research and development with the vast amount of relevant data and experiences generated from the Sponge City construction projects.

This is achieved by utilizing an engineered system containing a surface layer of mulch, a thick soil media often amended with a variety of materials to improve water quality, a variety of vegetation, and underdrains, depending on the surrounding soil characteristics. Bioretention systems have been studied quite extensively for warm climate applications, but data strongly supporting their long-term efficacy and application in cold climates is sparse. Although it is apparent that bioretention is an effective stormwater management system, its design in cold climate needs further research. Existing cold climate research has shown that coarser media is required to prevent concrete frost from forming. For spring, summer and fall seasons, if sufficient permeability exists to drain the system prior to freezing, peak flow and volume reduction can be maintained. Additionally, contaminants that are removed via filtration are also not impacted by cold climates. In contrary, dissolved contaminants, nutrients, and organics are significantly more variable in their ability to be removed or degraded via bioretention in colder temperatures. Winter road maintenance salts have been shown to negatively impact the removal of some contaminants and positively impact others, while their effects on properly selected vegetation or bacteria health are also not well understood. Research in these water quality aspects has been inconsistent and therefore requires further study.

The "sponge city" concept emphasizes that the runoff can permeate the soil or be stored temporarily, and rainwater could be used again when it is needed. Beijing is one of the earliest cities to study rainwater harvesting and LID techniques in China. Through long-term monitoring of rainfall, runoff flow, and water quality of a campus demonstration project in Beijing, the runoff quantity and pollutant concentration variations have been analyzed. Furthermore, the runoff reduction effects of single LID measure, such as green roof, filtration chamber, and permeable pavement, have been investigated. Additionally, the overall reduction effectiveness of the LID system on the average annual rainfall runoff and pollution load has been discussed. Preliminary studies suggest that runoff pollutant concentration is positively correlated with the rainfall interval time, and the longer rainfall interval time leads to higher runoff pollutant concentrations. The very good outflow quality of the rainwater harvesting system could satisfy the reclaimed water quality standard for scenic entertainment use. The non-point-source pollution reduction effects of the LID system are obvious because the pollutants could be removed by filtration on the one hand and the pollution load could be reduced because of the significantly reduced outflow on the other hand.

In this work, we encapsulated electroactive biofilms with biocompatible polydopamine (PDA) to protect against extreme acid shock. The bacterial cells were completely encapsulated in similar to 50 nm films formed by PDA spheres, which protected their viability and current recoverability even after pH 0.5 and 1.5 shocks. The limiting current density of the PDA-encapsulated anode was 0.20 +/- 0.05 A/m(2), which was 1900% higher than that of the unprotected control (0.01 +/- 0.01 A/m(2)) after strong acid shock (pH 0.5, 30 min). Without PDA encapsulation, the biofilm partly disintegrated with a thickness decreased by 68% from 72 to 23 mu m, where 92% of the cells were dead. Our findings reported a novel and effective method for protecting electroactive biofilm under extreme conditions, which will greatly extend the use of BESs in the future.

Experiments with feedwater containing clays (kaolinite) and natural organic matter (humic acid) revealed that the combined effect of coagulation and electric field mitigated membrane fouling in the ECMR, resulting in higher water flux than the conventional combination of electrocoagulation and UF in separate units (EC-UF). Higher current densities and weakly acidic pH in the EMCR favored faster generation of large flocs and effectively reduced membrane pore blocking. The hydraulic resistance of the formed cake layers on the membrane surface in ECMR was reduced due to an increase in cake layer porosity and polarity, induced by both coagulation and the applied electric field. The formation of a polarized cake layer was controlled by the applied current density and voltage, with cake layers formed under higher electric field strengths showing higher porosity and hydrophilicity. Compared to EC-UF, ECMR has a smaller footprint and could achieve significant energy savings due to improved fouling resistance and a more compact reactor design.

Channel routing is a typical example of the mathematical conceptualization of watershed landscape and processes in hydrologic modeling. We investigated the sensitivity of accuracy, equifinality, and uncertainty of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) modeling to channel dimensions to demonstrate how a conceptual representation of a watershed system affects streamflow and sediment modeling. Results showed the amount of uncertainty and equifinality strongly responded to channel dimensions. On the other hand, the model performance did not significantly vary with the changes in the channel representation due to the degree of freedom allowed by the conceptual nature of hydrologic modeling in the parameter calibration. Such findings demonstrated good modeling performance statistics do not necessarily mean small output uncertainty, and partial improvements in the watershed representation may neither increase modeling accuracy nor reduce uncertainty. We also showed the equifinality and uncertainty of hydrologic modeling are case-dependent rather than specific to models or regions, suggesting great caution should be used when attempting to transfer uncertainty analysis results to other modeling studies, especially for ungauged watersheds.

J	Shabani, A; Zhang, XD; Ell, M				Shabani, Afshin; Zhang, Xiaodong; Ell, Mike			Modeling Water Quantity and Sulfate Concentrations in the Devils Lake Watershed Using Coupled SWAT and CE-QUAL-W2	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Devils Lake is an endorheic lake in the Red River of the North basin in northeastern North Dakota. During the last two decades, the lake water level has risen by nearly 10m, causing floods that have cost more than 1 billion USD in mitigation measures. Another increase of approximately 1.5m in the lake water level would cause spillage into the Sheyenne River. To alleviate this potentially catastrophic spillage, two artificial outlets were constructed. However, the artificial drainage of water into the Sheyenne River raises water quality concerns because the Devils Lake water contains significantly higher concentrations of dissolved solids, particularly sulfate. In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was coupled with the CE-QUAL-W2 model to simulate both water balance and sulfate concentrations in the lake. The SWAT model performed well in simulating daily flow in tributaries with E-NS>0.5 and |PBIAS|<25%, and reproduced the lake water level with a root mean square error of 0.35m for the study period from 1995 to 2014. The water temperature and sulfate concentrations simulated by CE-QUAL-W2 for the lake are in general agreement with the field observations. The model results show that the operation of the two outlets since August 2005 has lowered the lake level by 0.70m. Furthermore, the models show pumping water from the two outlets raises sulfate concentrations in the Sheyenne River from similar to 100 to >500mg/L.

Agricultural drainage ditches function to remove water quickly from farmed landscapes. Conventional ditch designs lack the form and function of natural stream systems and tend to be unstable and provide inadequate habitat. In October of 2009, 1.89km of a conventional drainage ditch in Mower County, Minnesota, was converted to an alternative system with a two-stage channel to investigate the improvements in water quality, stability, and habitat. Longitudinal surveys show a 12-fold increase in the pool-riffle formation. Cross-sectional surveys show an average increase in bankfull width of approximately 10% and may be associated to an increased frequency in large storm events. The average increase in bankfull depth was estimated as 18% but is largely influenced by pool formation. Rosgen Stability Analyses show the channel to be highly stable and the banks at a low risk of erosion. The average bankfull recurrence interval was estimated to be approximately 0.30years. Overall, the two-stage ditch design demonstrates an increase in fluvial stability, creating a more consistent sediment budget, and increasing the frequency of important instream habitat features, making this best management practice a viable option for addressing issues of erosion, sediment imbalance, and poor habitat in agricultural drainage systems.																	1093-474X	1752-1688				AUG	2017	53	4					886	902		10.1111/1752-1688.12541								WOS:000407043700011

Improving Predictive Models of In-Stream Phosphorus Concentration Based on Nationally-Available Spatial Data Coverages	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Spatial data are playing an increasingly important role in watershed science and management. Large investments have been made by government agencies to provide nationally-available spatial databases; however, their relevance and suitability for local watershed applications is largely unscrutinized. We investigated how goodness of fit and predictive accuracy of total phosphorus (TP) concentration models developed from nationally-available spatial data could be improved by including local watershed-specific data in the East Fork of the Little Miami River, Ohio, a 1,290km(2) watershed. We also determined whether a spatial stream network (SSN) modeling approach improved on multiple linear regression (nonspatial) models. Goodness of fit and predictive accuracy were highest for the SSN model that included local covariates, and lowest for the nonspatial model developed from national data. Septic systems and point source TP loads were significant covariates in the local models. These local data not only improved the models but enabled a more explicit interpretation of the processes affecting TP concentrations than more generic national covariates. The results suggest SSN modeling greatly improves prediction and should be applied when using national covariates. Including local covariates further increases the accuracy of TP predictions throughout the studied watershed; such variables should be included in future national databases, particularly the locations of septic systems.

Fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) in combination with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) has been used as a powerful tool for the characterization of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in WWTPs. However, a recent work has revealed the drawback of PARAFAC analysis, i.e., overestimating the component number. A novel method, parallel factor framework-clustering analysis (PFFCA), has been developed in our earlier work to resolve this drawback of PARAFAC. In the present work, both PARAFAC and PFFCA were used to analyze the EEMs of water samples from a full-scale WWTP from a practical application point of view. The component number and goodness-offit from these two methods were compared and the relationship between the relative score change of component and the actual concentration was investigated to evaluate the estimation error introduced by both methods. PFFCA score and actual concentration exhibited a higher correlation coefficient (R-2 - 0.870) compared with PARAFAC (R-2 < 0.771), indicating that PFFCA provided a more accurate relative change estimation than PARAFAC. The results suggest that use of PARAFAC may cause confusion in selecting the component number, while EEM-PFFCA is a more reliable alternative approach for monitoring water quality in WWTPs.

J	Radcliffe, JC; Page, D; Naumann, B; Dillon, P				Radcliffe, John C.; Page, Declan; Naumann, Bruce; Dillon, Peter			Fifty Years of Water Sensitive Urban Design, Salisbury, South Australia	FRONTIERS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & ENGINEERING												Australia has developed extensive policies and guidelines for the management of its water. The City of Salisbury, located within metropolitan Adelaide, South Australia, developed rapidly through urbanisation from the 1970s. Water sensitive urban design principles were adopted to maximise the use of the increased run-off generated by urbanisation and ameliorate flood risk. Managed aquifer recharge was introduced for storing remediated low-salinity stormwater by aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) in a brackish aquifer for subsequent irrigation. This paper outlines how a municipal government has progressively adopted principles of Water Sensitive Urban Design during its development within a framework of evolving national water policies. Salisbury's success with stormwater harvesting led to the formation of a pioneering water business that includes linking projects from nine sites to provide a non-potable supply of 5 x 10(6) m(3) . year (-1). These installations hosted a number of applied research projects addressing well configuration, water quality, reliability and economics and facilitated the evaluation of its system as a potential potable water source. The evaluation showed that while untreated stormwater contained contaminants, subsurface storage and end-use controls were sufficient to make recovered water safe for public open space irrigation, and with chlorination, acceptable for third pipe supplies. Drinking water quality could be achieved by adding microfiltration, disinfection with UV and chlorination. The costs that would need to be expended to achieve drinking water safety standards were found to be considerably less than the cost of establishing dual pipe distribution systems. The full cost of supply was determined to be AUD$1.57 m (-3) for non-potable water for public open space irrigation, much cheaper than mains water, AUD $3.45 m (-3) at that time. Producing and storing potable water was found to cost AUD$1.96 to $2.24 m (-3).

J	Zhang, J; Wei, Z; Jia, HF; Huang, X				Zhang, Jiao; Wei, Zhen; Jia, Haifeng; Huang, Xia			Factors influencing water quality indices in a typical urban river originated with reclaimed water	FRONTIERS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & ENGINEERING												The water quality in a typical urban river segment originated with reclaimed water in Beijing was monitored for two years to investigate the evolution of water quality along the river, and statistical analysis was applied to determine factors influencing water quality of such river recharged by reclaimed water. It was found that no significant change in pollutant concentrations (including COD, NH4 +-N, TN and TP) was observed during this time, and their average values were close to those of the original reclaimed water. However, turbidity and algal contents fluctuated temporally in the direction of river flow. Statistical analysis showed that turbidity was strongly positively correlated with algal contents for flow rate < 0.1 m . s (-1), whereas it was strongly positively correlated with both algal contents and TOC for flow rate > 0.1 m . s (-1). It was observed that diatom was the absolute predominant phyla with Melosira as the major species. In terms of algal bloom control, the specific growth rate of algae was strongly correlated to temperature, and was influenced by flow rate as well. Compared with two other rivers originated with reclaimed water and one originated with natural water, the ShannonWiener index in the objective river was the lowest, with values between 0.7 and 1.6, indicating a high risk for algal bloom. Statistics showed that Shannon-Wiener index was strongly negatively correlated to nutrient salts and cations.

Arsenic concentrations (mu g/L) were ranged from 12 to 448.5 and which exceeded the WHO recommended limit (10 mu g/L) in all cases. The calculated average daily dose (3.3 x 10(-0.4) to 1.2 x 10(-0.2) mg/kg day) and hazard quotient (1.1-40) reflected the potential health risk to local population due to tube well water consumption as drinking purpose. Sodium percent (Na%), sodium absorption ratio, residual sodium carbonate, Kelly's index and magnesium absorption ratio were also determined to assess the suitability of tube well water for irrigation purpose. The resulting piper plot revealed the Na-Ca-HCO3 type water chemistry of the area and generally alkaline environment. The spatial distribution of arsenic in the tube well waters pinpoints the significant contribution of anthropogenic activities to arsenic pollution. Nevertheless, different statistical tools, including principal component analysis, hierarchical cluster analysis and correlation matrices, revealed the contribution of both natural and anthropogenic activities and alkaline type of aquifers toward the high level of arsenic contamination.

The results showed that the removal rates for chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) reached 14.56%-30.49%, 38.21%-67.96%, and 24.22%-41.14% respectively, in the TEC treatment, and 51.22%-57.90%, 64.61%-81.95%, and 40.29%-53.45% respectively, in the IMAEC treatment, suggesting that the IMAEC revetment treatment showed higher water purification performance than the TEC revetment treatment. The results of SUVA254, a250/a365 and a253/a203 indicated that the IMAEC treatment showed relatively high removal efficiencies of refractory aromatic compounds. Parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis indicated that the removal rates for three fluorescent components (humic-like Components 1 and 2, and protein-like Component 3) reached 27.94%, 9.69% and 27.86 respectively, in the TEC treatment, and 51.35%, 30.10%, and 52.97% respectively, in the IMAEC treatment. 2D-COS mapping suggested that protein-like materials were more susceptible than humic-like substances, to the addition of metal ions. Protein-like materials can preferentially interact with metal ions, resulting in the effective removal of DOM-metal complexes, and can further influence the migration and transformation of metal ions.

ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Wading birds have declined across Europe as the intensification of lowland agriculture has resulted in the loss and degradation of wetland areas. Lowland aggregate extraction sites that incorporate areas of fine, waste sediments deposited in silt lagoons have the potential to be restored for wader conservation. We set out to determine the potential value of silt lagoons to wading birds by comparing the water quality, sediment profiles, aquatic invertebrate abundance and diversity (prey availability) and wader site use at five sites representing various stages of active aggregate extraction and restoration for conservation purposes. Wader counts were conducted monthly over a twelve month period using replicated scan samples, and the invertebrate communities studied during the breeding and autumn migration season (June-September). Water quality variables were similar between sites, but sediments from active quarries were dominated by moderately sorted fine sands in comparison to the coarser sediment profiles of restored areas. June and September there was no significant difference in invertebrate diversity between sites, however richness was significantly lower on quarry sites and total abundance a factor of ten higher at restored sites than on silt lagoons, with the dominant taxa similar across all sites. Waders used all sites; albeit at lower abundance and richness on silt lagoons and two species were recorded breeding on active silting sites. We conclude that the fine, uniform sediments of modern silt lagoons limited invertebrate diversity and abundance, diminishing the value of silt lagoons to waders. Simple low-cost intervention measures increasing substrate heterogeneity and creating temporary ponds could increase invertebrate richness and abundance, and enhance the conservation potential of these sites.

Water quality before and after watershed-scale implementation of stormwater wet ponds in the coastal plain	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Wet ponds have been used extensively for stormwater control throughout the US, including coastal areas. Despite the widespread application of these water control structures, few studies have investigated how watershed-scale implementation of wet ponds affects downstream water quality or how the pollutant removal efficacy of wet ponds changes over time in a coastal setting. This study utilizes a seven year data set of nutrient, total suspended solid, and chlorophyll-a concentration data collected during baseflow and stormflow from two coastal headwater streams draining a developed (28% impervious) and an undeveloped (1.2% impervious) watershed. The seven year record encompasses before, during, and after a large construction project and concurrent implementation of wet ponds in the developed watershed that drain 97% of the watershed area. Additional nutrient, total suspended solid, and chlorophyll-a concentration data were collected from within a wet pond in the developed watershed during baseflow over a single spring and summer. A comparison of stream water quality before and after the construction project and wet pond implementation in the developed watershed showed that mean chlorophyll-a, nitrate-nitrite (NOx-), organic nitrogen, and total suspended solid concentrations significantly increased, the mean orthophosphate (PO43-) concentration significantly decreased, and the mean ammonium (NH4+) concentration did not change. Over a three year time period after construction and pond implementation, developed stream chlorophyll-a, ammonium, and organic nitrogen concentrations decreased, and nitrate-nitrite, orthophosphate, and total suspended solid concentrations increased compared to the reference stream during the same period, indicating changes in pollutant removal capacity. A comparison of baseflow and stormflow samples during the Post period and samples from a wet pond in the developed watershed indicated that ponds were functioning as sources of chlorophyll-a and total suspended solids to the stream and sinks for nitrate-nitrite. Overall, watershed-scale implementation of wet ponds in the developed watershed failed to mitigate many negative water quality impacts caused by increased development. This study suggests that centralized stormwater management may not be optimal for maintaining water quality in coastal environments, and that pond retrofits combined with frequent excavation could improve pollutant removal by wet ponds. Further research on the effects of nutrient cycling in coastal wet ponds and wet pond maintenance is needed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Etheridge, JR; Burchell, MR; Birgand, F				Etheridge, J. Randall; Burchell, Michael R., II; Birgand, Francois			Can created tidal marshes reduce nitrate export to downstream estuaries?	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Constructed marshes have the potential to serve as a buffer between anthropogenic sources of nitrogen and nutrient sensitive estuaries. Yet, there is little information available on the reduction of nitrogen loads that created tidal marshes might provide. A 5.6 ha brackish marsh was constructed between row crop agricultural production and an estuary in North Carolina. Nitrate-N fluxes in and out of the marsh were monitored multiple times per hour for over a year to capture tidal and storm dynamics. Out of the five storms when most of the fluxes occurred, nitrate was retained in four (up to 42%), and released in the fifth, such that over the monitoring period the marsh retained 9% (40 kg) of the nitrate that entered. Nutrient addition tracer studies confirmed the potential nitrate retention (up to 45%) of the marsh. The residence time of water in the constructed brackish marsh was identified as the primary factor limiting nitrate retention through an examination of the factors that were related to percent nitrate retention. A retention model based on a mass transfer coefficient was applied during the storm events and tracer studies to further evaluate the marsh N retention capacity. The model adequately simulated the nitrate retention with calibrated mass transfer coefficients (0.1-0.56 m day(-1)) that fell within the range of those reported in literature for other systems. These results indicate that constructed tidal marshes can serve as substantial nitrate sinks and can be an integral part of overall plans to reduce the nutrient export to estuaries.

Effectiveness of water diversion and erosion control structures on skid trails following timber harvesting	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Sediment in forested watersheds is produced primarily from highly disturbed areas such as skid trails. Forestry best management practices (BMPs) have been developed to minimize erosion and water quality problems, but the efficacies of various BMP options such as water bars are not well documented. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of different distances (slope lengths) between water diversion structures (water bars) on runoff volume and soil loss on different skid trail gradients on two soils with different textures. The treatments were located in an Iranian temperate forest and included combinations of three levels of trail gradient (<10%, 10-20% and >20%), four different distances between water bars (25, 50, 75, and 100 m), and two soil textures (clay loam and silt loam). Results showed that runoff volume increased curvilinearly and soil loss linearly with distances between water bars regardless of the soil texture and trail gradient. The greater distances on trail gradients >20% resulted in the highest amounts of runoff and soil loss; shorter distances on trail gradients <10% resulted in the lowest runoff and soil loss amount for the two tested soil textures. On the clay loam soil, 50 and 75 m were the most effective distances between water bars for trail gradients >20 and <20%, respectively. On the silt loam soil, 25 m and 50 m were the most effective distances between water bars for trail gradients >20 and <20%, respectively. The results of our study confirm that slope angle is a primary factor in controlling surface runoff and soil loss on skid trails and that soil texture becomes increasingly important as slope gradients become steeper. Therefore, reducing skid trail slope during construction skid trails is recommended to decrease surface runoff and soil loss in forest operations. Further, BMPs should consider soil texture in addition to slope gradient when recommending spacing between water bars. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The EFA results showed the monitoring stations to be distinguished by two main factors. The representative stations of which the variance was almost explained by the specific factor were selected. We applied PCA to the monitoring data of representative stations, and then analyzed the EOF-patterns that indicate the characteristics of water-quality variation for each factor. With the interpretation of main factors and EOF-patterns causing dominant water quality variations, the monitoring network of Nakdong River could be spatially and seasonally evaluated according to the contribution of each factor.

In particular, inadequate sanitation resulting in high contamination of surface water with pathogens of fecal origin is a serious issue in developing countries such as Lao P.D.R. Despite the health implications of the consumption of contaminated surface water, the environmental fate and transport of pathogens of fecal origin and their indicators (Fecal Indicator Bacteria or FIB) are still poorly known in tropical areas. In this study, we used measurements of flow rates, suspended sediments and of the FIB Escherichia coli (E. coli) in a 60-ha catchment in Northern Laos to explore the ability of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to simulate watershed-scale FIB fate and transport. We assessed the influences of 3 in-stream processes, namely bacteria deposition and resuspension, bacterial regrowth, and hyporheic exchange (i.e. transient storage) on predicted FIB numbers. We showed that the SWAT model in its original version does not correctly simulate small E. coli numbers during the dry season. We showed that model's performance could be improved when considering the release of E. coli together with sediment resuspension. We demonstrated that the hyporheic exchange of bacteria across the Sediment-Water Interface (SWI) should be considered when simulating FIB concentration not only during wet weather, but also during the dry season, or baseflow period. In contrast, the implementation of the regrowth process did not improve the model during the dry season without inducing an overestimation during the wet season. This work thus underlines the importance of taking into account in-stream processes, such as deposition and resuspension, regrowth and hyporheic exchange, when using SWAT to simulate FIB dynamics in surface waters.

Currently used methods within EU allow at least a 2.2 day period for obtaining the analytical results, making outdated the information forwarded to the public. Obtained results and beach assessment are influenced by the temporal and spatial characteristics of sample collection, and numerous environmental parameters, as well as by differences of official water standards. This paper examines the temporal variation of microbiological parameters during the day, as well as the influence of the sampling hour, on decision processes in the management of the beach. Apart from the fecal indicators stipulated by the EU Bathing Water Directive (E. coli and enterococci), additional fecal (C. perfringens) and non-fecal (S. aureus and P. aeriginosa) parameters were analyzed. Moreover, the effects of applying different evaluation criteria (national, EU and U.S. EPA) to beach ranking were studied, and the most common reasons for exceeding water-quality standards were investigated. In order to upgrade routine monitoring, a predictive statistical model was developed. The highest concentrations of fecal indicators were recorded early in the morning (6 AM) due to the lack of solar radiation during the night period. When compared to enterococci, E. coli criteria appears to be more stringent for the detection of fecal pollution. In comparison to EU and U.S. EPA criteria, Croatian national evaluation criteria provide stricter public health standards. Solar radiation and precipitation were the predominant environmental parameters affecting beach water quality, and these parameters were included in the predictive model setup. Predictive models revealed great potential for the monitoring of recreational water bodies, and with further development can become a useful tool for the improvement of public health protection.

A novel concept in ground water quality management: Towards function specific screening values	WATER RESEARCH												This paper is meant to initiate and feed the discussion on a more sophisticated procedure for the derivation and use of groundwater screening values (GSVs). To this purpose, the possibilities and tools for the derivation of function specific GSVs, i.e., GSVs that depend on the actual contact of humans and ecosystems with groundwater and groundwater-related mediums, are elaborated in this study. Application of GSVs geared to the specific use and function of specific groundwater volumes could result in a more effective and cost-efficient groundwater quality management, without compromising the protection of human health and the ecosystem. Therefore, a procedure to derive function specific GSVs was developed. For illustrative purposes, risk limits have been derived for human health and ecological protection targets, for arsenic, benzene, methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and vinylchloride. Agriculture and Nature reserves (combined), Residential and Industrial land uses have been considered and two different groundwater management purposes, i.e., curative and sustainable groundwater management. For each of the four contaminants, this results in a series of risks limits for each function and land use combination. It is shown that for all four contaminants higher groundwater screening values are considered appropriate for less sensitive combinations of function and land use. In the process towards (policy) implementation of these function specific GSV, it is recommended to evaluate the selection of protection targets; the scientific basis of the risk assessment procedures applied and the methodology to assess the time factor for groundwater quality assessment, given the fact that groundwater is a dynamic medium. Moreover, protection levels must be harmonized with national or regional groundwater quality standards and correspond with the requirements of the Groundwater Daughter Directive of the European Union Water Framework Directive. Groundwater plumes that are judged as 'no need for remediation' are not compatible with the Water Framework Directive requirement to take actions to prevent or limit inputs of contaminants, even when no receptor is present. However, the European Commission formulated a series of exemptions, to avoid that the "prevent" requirement would imply an onerous and sometimes unfeasible task. The function specific GSVs derived in this study could be used to identify the groundwater volumes that do not result in an unacceptable risk. 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Spatial identification of critical nutrient loads of large shallow lakes: Implications for Lake Taihu (China)	WATER RESEARCH												Ongoing eutrophication frequently causes toxic phytoplankton blooms. This induces huge worldwide challenges for drinking water quality, food security and public health. Of crucial importance in avoiding and reducing blooms is to determine the maximum nutrient load ecosystems can absorb, while remaining in a good ecological state. These so called critical nutrient loads for lakes depend on the shape of the load-response curve. Due to spatial variation within lakes, load-response curves and therefore critical nutrient loads could vary throughout the lake. In this study we determine spatial patterns in critical nutrient loads for Lake Taihu (China) with a novel modelling approach called Spatial Ecosystem Bifurcation Analysis (SEBA). SEBA evaluates the impact of the lake's total external nutrient load on the local lake dynamics, resulting in a map of critical nutrient loads for different locations throughout the lake. Our analysis shows that the largest part of Lake Taihu follows a nonlinear load-response curve without hysteresis. The corresponding critical nutrient loads vary within the lake and depend on management goals, i.e. the maximum allowable chlorophyll concentration. According to our model, total nutrient loads need to be more than halved to reach chlorophyll-a concentrations of 30-40 mu g L-1 in most sections of the lake. To prevent phytoplankton blooms with 20 mu g L-1 chlorophyll-a throughout Lake Taihu, both phosphorus and nitrogen loads need a nearly 90% reduction. We conclude that our approach is of great value to determine critical nutrient loads of lake ecosystems such as Taihu and likely of spatially heterogeneous ecosystems in general.

Moreover, an increasing number of SAs has been detected in natural water and urban water supply systems in recent years because they cannot be completely removed through conventional water treatment processes. Therefore, sulfamethazine (SMZ) in urban water systems was selected as a target to be investigated. The reaction kinetics of sulfamethazine chlorination were studied in a pilot-scale water distribution system (WDS) under the influence of different factors, including pH, temperature, flow rate and pipe materials, to determine the optimal factors for removing SMZ and to provide a reference for water quality in urban drinking water systems. According to the experimental results, the kinetics models of SMZ chlorination fitted a second-order reaction in pure water. The degradation of SMZ was not only affected by the water quality conditions but also the operating temperatures, flow rates and pipe materials. The rate constants of SMZ chlorination under different temperatures were related to the Arrhenius equation. Different flow rates had little effect on SMZ degradation. In different pipes, the degradation rates of SMZ followed the order stainless steel pipe > polyethylene pipe (PE) > ductile iron pipe. Moreover, eight reaction intermediates during SMZ degradation were observed and identified, and a degradation pathway was proposed. The concentrations of trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs) during the degradation of SMZ in WDS were also determined. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Bu, LJ; Bi, C; Shi, Z; Zhou, SQ				Bu, Lingjun; Bi, Chen; Shi, Zhou; Zhou, Shiqing			Significant enhancement on ferrous/persulfate oxidation with epigallocatechin-3-gallate: Simultaneous chelating and reducing	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL												A kind of green tea extract, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) was introduced into Fe2+ activated persulfate (Fe2+/PS) system to enhance the degradation efficiency of atrazine. The involvement of EGCG improved atrazine degradation significantly in the pH range of 2.0-7.0, which could be interpreted by the strong reducing and chelating ability of EGCG. EGCG showed a better performance than hydroxylamine and ascorbic acid in modified Fe2+/PS systems, as the presence of EGCG could not only accelerate the transformation of Fe3+ to Fe2+, but prevent the formation of iron precipitation. Batch experiments were conducted and atrazine degradation depended upon the dosage of EGCG, persulfate, Fe2+, and other water quality parameters including initial pH, co-existing anions and natural organic matters. Radical quenching test and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis were also performed and results showed that two kinds of radicals (sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radical) were verified to exist and play a significant role on atrazine degradation in the Fe2+/EGCG/PS system. Moreover, possible intermediates of atrazine were identified by HPLC/MS/MS and degradation pathWays of atrazine and EGCG were proposed. This study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding on the potential application of EGCG to enhance degradation of refractory organics in water. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

It was found that Mn2+ adsorbs on the MnM sediment, and under aerobic conditions, rapid Mn(II) oxidation takes place. The MnM exhibited superior Mn(II) adsorption capacity compared to other commercially available manganese oxide catalysts. A filter loaded with anthracite-supported MnM was developed and used as a highly efficient, reagentless catalyst for the continuous oxidative removal of dissolved Mn. A 10-13m3<bold>h</bold>-1 pilot plant was constructed for Mn removal from Mn-rich effluent by atmospheric oxygen oxidation. The system operated continuously for more than two years with minimal maintenance, without oxidative regeneration. No ripening period was required, and the fixed bed exhibits exceptionally high catalytic efficiency. The proposed filter is superior to synthetic supported manganese oxide reactors because it does not require periodic regeneration by strong oxidizers; it is superior to filtration units for manganese removal because it does not require ripening time. A possible explanation for the superior catalytic activity based on the delicate, two-dimensional structure of MnM is presented.

Integration of energy audits in the Life Cycle Assessment methodology to improve the environmental performance assessment of Recirculating Aquaculture Systems	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												In Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS), water is continuously treated and recirculated as opposed to being discharged untreated into the environment as in other type of fish production systems; the design and production parameters will determine the overall energy consumption. This energy-intensive nature hampers their sustainability and cost-effectiveness. This paper proposes a combination of two methods (i.e. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) with energy audits) to: improve environmental performance of RAS, identify energy consumption and thus, its environmental and monetary effects in order to seek cost reduction. The proposed methodology was proved with a case study focused in a pilot-scale RAS unit used in codfish (Gadus morhua) production, located in the Basque coastal area (northern Spain). Feed and juvenile production transportation, oxygen transportation and energy consumed during the whole experiment were considered as inputs for the assessment. Energy consumption was measured both continuously by an energy meter embedded in the RAE unit as well as with a portable energy analyzer to measure each of the energy-consuming devices independently. Although the system required an average of 29.40 kWh/kg fish for successful system operation, the energy consumption varied by season presenting maximum and minimum periods of 40.57 and 18.43 kWh/kg fish, respectively. Main consumers included the heat pump, followed by the main and secondary pumps, respectively. Energy audit's results show the success in identifying the devices that consumed the largest amount of energy, and recorded data served to feed the Life Cycle Inventory and perform a more complete and precise LCA. Fossil fuel based on-farm electricity for the on-growing of fish was shown to be the most environmentally unfriendly input; it was the major impact producer in the assessed impact categories. It showed a temporal variability depending on the water temperature, which resulted to be the main factor linked to the energy use. This aided performing a precise assessment including system-specific scenarios. The combination of LCA and on-farm energy audit represents a useful tool to secure a more complete assessment with a periodic assessment to design a less energy intensive, profitable and sustainable system; likewise, it increases the speed and transparency of governance and decision-making, taking into account the time-based fluctuation of the energy consumption throughout the production cycle.

Data suggested FIB exceedances could be traced to gulls based on gull marker prevalence and correlations with FIB concentrations in seawater, sand, and eelgrass. In contrast, human marker concentrations and a tracer dye test did not indicate prevalent human sources. Exponential decay of gull marker in sand amended with live Catellicoccus marimammalium suggested that measured marker reflected fecal inputs versus growth outside the host. Improved water quality was coincident with a 2013 bird exclusion structure, consistent with NSE. However, load allocation needed for TMDL reconsideration was hampered by variable ratios of FIB, MST markers, and pathogens measured in seawater and in gull, cat, and raccoon feces Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment is a suggested path forward because such models can incorporate distributions from a combination of FIB sources and communicate criteria in terns of human health risk.

J	Zhang, XL; Huang, M				Zhang, Xiaole; Huang, Meng			Ensemble-based release estimation for accidental river pollution with known source position	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS												Dispersion model is an important tool for decision makers to accurately assess risks and effectively plan countermeasures during river pollution accidents, but their applications suffer from significant modeling uncertainties, primarily due to the scarce information of the source. A fully sequential inverse estimation method is proposed to reconstruct the temporal release for accidental river pollution. The method is based on a one-dimensional advection-dispersion model in conjunction with the augmented ensemble Kalman filter method. Detailed analysis of the ensemble background error covariance (BEC) matrix is conducted to elucidate the "flow-dependent" mechanism, which enables the inversion method to simultaneously take into account the uncertainties in the hydrological parameters (mean flow velocity and longitudinal dispersion coefficient). The method is evaluated with six field tracer experiments with various mean flow velocities, ranging from 0.085 to 0.889 m s(-1), and also compared with the commonly used Tikhonov regularization inverse estimation method to demonstrate its performance improvement. The results indicate that it successfully reconstructs the temporal release and reduces the relative errors of the total release estimation by about 12.4% on average compared with the Tikhonov method, since the errors caused by the uncertainties in mean flow velocity and longitudinal dispersion coefficient are effectively alleviated.

J	Gerba, CP; Betancourt, WQ				Gerba, Charles P.; Betancourt, Walter Q.			Viral Aggregation: Impact on Virus Behavior in the Environment	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Aggregates of viruses can have a significant impact on quantification' and behavior of viruses in the environment. Viral aggregates may be formed in numerous ways. Viruses may form crystallike structures and aggregates in the host cell during replication or may form due to changes in environmental conditions after virus particles are released from the host cells. Aggregates tend to form mear the isoelectric point of the virus, under the influence of certain salts and salt concentrations in solutiOn, cationic polymers, and suspended organic matter. The given conditions under which aggregates form in the environment are highly dependent on the type of virus, type of salts in solution (cation, anion, monovalent, divalent) and pH. However, virus typo greatly influences the conditions when aggregation/disaggregation will occur, making predictions difficult under any given set of water quality conditions. Most studies have shown that viral aggregates increase the survival of viruses in the environment and resistance to disinfectants, especially with more reactive disinfectants. The presence of viral aggregates may also result in overestimation of removal by filtration processes. Virus aggregation-disaggregation is a complex process and predicting the behavior of any individual virus is difficult under a given set of environmental circumstances without actual experiniental data.

The data collected over a four-year research period included quality parameters of water taken from the water distribution system in the period between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2014. In the analysis the supply zones of four municipal water treatment plants in Krakow were considered. The selection of 29 water sampling points within the supply area allowed comparing water quality with respect to operational and technological aspects. Factor analysis enabled 4 components explaining correlations between tap water quality variables to be distinguished. It follows from the research performed that the obtained factors applied to 77% of overall water variability. The highest share was assigned to factor 1 that explained 32% of the chemical composition of water under consideration and was correlated with calcium, conductance, nitrates (V), magnesium and to a moderate extent with Sigma THM (with negative sign).																	2299-8993					JUL	2017	18	4					110	117		10.12911/22998993/74288								WOS:000416834200014

The backwash water samples were taken from the circuits located in two indoor facilities with a different purpose of the basins. Moreover, the samples were characterized by varying quality, as described by selected physicochemical parameters (such as turbidity and ultraviolet absorbance UV254). Commercial membranes were used for the tests. The transport-separation properties of the membranes were determined based on the volumetric flux of the permeate. In addition, backwash water samples before and after the membrane process were subjected to toxicological assessment using the Microtox (R) screening test. The performed processes contributed to a significant reduction in turbidity and the value of UV254 ultraviolet absorbance, both in the ultrafiltration and nanofiltration processes. Whereas, significant differences in transport properties were noted within individual processes. A great influence of backwash water quality, including physicochemical parameters, on the course and results of the membrane filtration processes was demonstrated. In all of the nanofiltration cycles carried out, the removal of the toxic properties of the backwash water with respect to bacteria in the Microtox (R) test was found. Nevertheless, samples with high values of resultant physicochemical parameters after the ultrafiltration process were still characterized by high toxicity. Pressure membrane processes show high effectiveness in the removal of contaminants from backwash water. However, it is necessary to introduce supporting processes aimed at reducing membrane pore blocking by deposits and organic compounds, and in the case of ultrafiltration, assuring the safety of the purified stream in terms of the toxicological effect.																	2299-8993					JUL	2017	18	4					130	136		10.12911/22998993/74282								WOS:000416834200017

Samples of bottom sediments were collected on the basis of regular measurement grid of 46 points located in the area of the water reservoir Poraj. The collected samples were analyzed in terms of content of following elements, which values are in range: total phosphorus (TP) 0.06 - 5.06 g/kg, total nitrogen (TN) 0.17 - 9.66 g/kg, organic matter (OM) 0.49 - 28.41% of solid content, aluminum (Al) 2.44 - 145.15 g/kg and iron (Fe) 0.28 - 16.50 g/kg. By using of GIS system, spatial distribution of obtained results of laboratory analyzes were interpolated (Inverse Distance Weighted method was used). On basis of spatial distribution it was noted that in northern part of water reservoir bottom sediments have greater values of TP, TN and OM than in southern part. The study also included calculation of correlation between: OM and TN (n = 46, R-2 = 0.9335), TN and Fe (n = 46, R-2 = 0.8782), TN and Al (n = 46, R-2 = 0.8629), OM and Fe (n = 46, R-2 = 0.8243), OM and Al (n = 46, R-2 = 0.7981), TP and Fe (n = 46, R-2 = 0.7456), TP and Al (n = 46, R-2 = 0.6209). The presented pilot studies show that the potential content of phosphorus, nitrogen and organic matter in the sediments of the water reservoir Poraj can reach a significant level. The need to plan and carry out further research allowing the evaluation of the properties of the analyzed elements and examining their potential impact on water quality in the tested water reservoir was stated.																	2299-8993					JUL	2017	18	4					178	184		10.12911/22998993/74277								WOS:000416834200023

The oxidation reaction was carried out in the presence of sodium hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide and ozone with/without UV radiation. EHMC degradation and the analysis of products were performed using gas chromatograph coupled with a mass spectrometry detector. The most effective method of EHMC degradation turned out to be ozonation with participation of UV radiation. In this system, degradation proceeded most quickly and generated a small amount of by-products (2-propyl-1-pentanol; 4-metoxybenzaldehyde and Z-EHMC). Under the influence of sodium hypochlorite, numerous chloroorganic products were formed, which can cause secondary contamination of water. Application of appropriate oxidation processes can contribute to degradation of micropollutants and thus to improvement of water quality.																	2299-8993					JUL	2017	18	4					204	210		10.12911/22998993/74273								WOS:000416834200027

A hierarchical approach is developed to present the monitoring locations within a format that satisfies the objectives of social stakeholders for making final decisions. First, a CE-QUAL-W2 model is applied to simulate water quality variables in the reservoir for a long time using a set of historic data. Second, transinformation entropy theory is used to quantify mutual information among a set of monitoring stations for each water quality variable. Then, a non-dominating sorting genetic algorithm-based model is developed for multi-objective optimization of the water quality monitoring network. Finally, a social choice method is applied to the identified non-dominated solutions to achieve a strategy that is compromised among stakeholders. The variations of the water quality variables at different depths and different seasons are investigated. The proposed approach is illustrated for Karkheh Reservoir in Iran. The number of optimized monitoring stations is the same for all seasons (three out of 22 potential stations) using different social choice methods. The results show the appropriate performance of the proposed methodology for optimization of reservoir water quality monitoring stations.																	1606-9749					JUL	2017	17	4					966	974		10.2166/ws.2016.196								WOS:000408713700007

Comparing volatile organic compound emissions during equalization in wastewater treatment between the flux-chamber and mass-transfer methods	PROCESS SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION												The emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) during equalization in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is a particular source of concern. In this study, VOC emissions during equalization in three industrial WWTPs were analyzed by two different approaches. The flux-chamber method is a standard method used in many countries including Taiwan, as the theory behind the mass-transfer method is well-established. The objective was to investigate whether different outcomes were generated between two estimation methods and to determine potential overestimation of VOC, chemical oxygen demand (COD), or total organic carbon (TOC) removals in the WWTPs due to VOC emission during equalization. In the results, the estimated VOC fluxes during equalization were similar between two approaches. Recognizable amounts of VOCs were emitted during equalization (up to 28.2%, 13.6%, and 7.6% in three WWTPs). Their impacts on the COD (e.g., less than 0.1% in three WWTPs) or TOC removals (e.g., less than 11.4% in three WWTPs) were rather limited. Through the correlation analysis, the estimated VOC emission flux was not dependent upon individual but on co-influence of the compound's physicochemical characteristics, water quality, and operation during equalization. Although two approaches generated similar outcomes, the results by the flux-chamber method seemed to be more relevant to the operation during equalization, while the water quality were more important to the results by the mass-transfer method. Both methods were effective to quantify VOC emission during wastewater equalization, as the flux-chamber method is possibly a preferable option given their applicability and economic comparison.

The total phosphorus contents in Eling Lake, Longbao Lake and Sea Star were higher than Class I water quality standards, and the total nitrogen contents in Eling Lake, Sea Star and Zhaling Lake were higher than Class I water quality standards as well. The concentration contour maps of the nitrate nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen, total phosphorus and total nitrogen showed that the indicators of the four lakes in the east, the west, and the center of the lake did not have the same trend. From 2012 to 2015, each of the measured nutrients showed a rising trend year by year. The four lakes are polluted by both endogenous and exogenous pollution, and it is necessary to limit the exogenous pollution and protect the alpine lakes immediately.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				JUL	2017	76	2					396	412		10.2166/wst.2017.091								WOS:000406789800015	28726705

A bench-scale experiment was conducted and several water quality parameters including turbidity, ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (UV254), total organic carbon and tetracycline concentration were evaluated, taking coagulation membrane filtration and magnetic flocculation membrane filtration processes as reference treatments. The experimental results showed that at the optimum doses of 20 mg.L-1 ferric chloride (FeCl3), 4 mg.L-1 magnetite (Fe3O4) and 6 mg.L-1 reclaimed magnetic flocs in RMFMF processes, removal efficiencies of above evaluated parameters ranged from 55.8% to 92.9%, which performed best. Simultaneously, the largest average particle size of 484.71 mu m and the highest fractal dimension of 1.37 of flocs were achieved, which did not only present the best coagulation effect helpful in enhancing the performance of removing multiple contaminants, but also lead to the generation of loose and porous cake layers favouring reduced permeate flux decline and membrane fouling.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				JUL	2017	76	2					490	500		10.2166/wst.2017.218								WOS:000406789800024	28726714

Robustness of the models and compliance of their sensitivity with current quality limits are investigated. The following indicators are studied: total suspended solids (TSS), turbidity, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and nitrate. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) is used to find linear correlations between absorbances and indicators of interest. Artificial samples are made by simulating a sludge leak on the wastewater treatment plant and added to the original dataset, then divided into calibration and prediction datasets. The models are built on the calibration set, and then tested on the prediction set. The best models are developed with: PLSR for COD (R-pred(2) = 0.80), TSS (R-pred(2) = 0.86) and turbidity (R-pred(2) = 0.96), and with a simple linear regression from absorbance at 208 nm (R-pred(2) = 0.95) for nitrate concentration. The input of artificial data significantly enhances the robustness of the models. The sensitivity of the UV/Vis spectrometry monitoring system developed is compatible with quality requirements of reclaimed water production processes.

J	Pramanik, BK; Shu, L; Jegatheesan, V				Pramanik, Biplob Kumar; Shu, Li; Jegatheesan, Veeriah			A review of the management and treatment of brine solutions	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY												There has been a considerable expansion in the use of desalination plants for supplying potable water to many communities in the world. However, the production of brine, which is known to be a concentrated solution, is an integral part of the operation of the desalination plant, which faces critical environmental challenges because of its high salinity. Therefore, a cost-effective and environmentally benign brine management system is required prior to its proper disposal. Currently, several disposal options including surface water discharge, deep well injection, and evaporation ponds have been used. However, these processes are unsustainable and their use is limited by a high capital cost and limited applications. Various conventional treatments including physicochemical, oxidation and biological processes with varying extents of organics removal have been reported. Nowadays, membrane-based technologies appear to be cost-effective methods for managing brine concentrate as they can recover valuable resources and produce clean water with high recovery. This paper critically reviews current technologies for concentrate management, including disposal practices and treatment processes. The characteristics of the brine in terms of water quality and its impact on open water bodies are discussed. This paper examines emerging membrane processes such as forward osmosis, membrane distillation, and electrodialysis that show promise for minimizing brine volume, in recovering valuable resources and improvement of water recovery. This paper also discusses the fact that integrated membrane processes are better for brine management for resource recovery together with water purification in wastewater treatment facilities and can achieve a zero liquid discharge.																	2053-1400	2053-1419				JUL 1	2017	3	4					625	658		10.1039/c6ew00339g								WOS:000404718800004

Emerging investigators series: hydrogen sulfide production in municipal stormwater retention ponds under ice covered conditions: a study of water quality and SRB populations	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY												Stormwater retention ponds have become an integral component of stormwater management across the world. Under prolonged hypoxia, these ponds are capable of releasing large quantities of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas. In this study, water quality constituents and bacterial communities in sediment were analyzed in two stormwater retention ponds, RSP1 (reference pond) and RSP2 (problematic pond) over a period of two years, to identify the factors driving H2S production and understand the microbial community associated with H2S production in stormwater ponds. It was found that the background total sulfide concentrations were not statistically different between the two ponds during summer (RSP2: 0.012 +/- 0.001 mg L-S-1; RSP1: 0.010 +/- 0.001 mg L-S-1) and were statistically different during ice covered winter operation (RSP2: 6.375 +/- 1.135 mg L-S-1; RSP1: 0.016 +/- 0.009 mg L-S-1). The study showed a lack of correlation between total sulfide concentrations in RSP2 and soluble chemical oxygen demand, sulfate, soluble total phosphorus, total ammonia nitrogen, nitrate, nitrite and pH. However, DO concentrations demonstrated a strong negative correlation with total sulfides concentrations in RSP2 (p < 0.006, r = -0.58, n = 26), which confirmed DO as the critical water quality parameter linked to H2S production in stormwater ponds. Finally, it was found that seasonal change, ice covered versus non-ice covered operation and a comparison between a H2S emitting pond and non-emitting pond all did not promote a measurable proliferation of sulfatereducing bacteria nor a community shift in the sulfate-reducing bacterial population. Hence, the study demonstrates that sulfide production is a result of increased ubiquitous SRB activity in stormwater retention ponds and the emission of H2S gas is not indicative of SRB proliferation or a population shift towards specific SRB taxa.

Improved contaminant removal in vegetated stormwater biofilters amended with biochar	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY												The potential for carbonaceous sorbents to improve contaminant removal (particularly for trace organic contaminants, TOrCs) in stormwater biofilters was evaluated in intermittently dosed, vegetated columns simulating scaled-down treatment systems. Columns amended with biochar or granular activated carbon (GAC) were evaluated relative to performance benchmarks set by columns representing unamended treatment systems (i.e., sand filters and vegetated biofilters). Biochar amendment (6.7 wt%, 33 vol%) strongly improved TOrC removal, despite potential fouling due to the presence of an upper compost-amended layer. Biochar-amended biofilter columns maintained greater than 99% TOrC removal throughout five months of dosing with TOrC-spiked creek water (equivalent to approximately 1.3 years of runoff volume), relative to less than 50% removal of most TOrCs by unamended biofilter columns. GAC amendment (6.7 wt%, 12.5 vol%) also improved TOrC removal, though less effectively than biochar (>70% removal), because the bio-char's lower density (i.e., higher volume composition) and smaller particles improved performance. These results indicate that full-scale biochar-amended biofilters could potentially remove TOrCs effectively for several years, as treatment depths up to five times greater than the 10 cm experimental depth may be feasible for full-scale systems. Further, contaminant removal survey experiments conducted after 6 months of operation revealed that biochar amendment improved removal of total organic carbon, total nitrogen, nitrate, and total dissolved phosphorus in biofilters by greater than 60%. The findings of this study demonstrate the potential of biochar amendment to broadly improve contaminant removal in biofilters, motivating and informing the application of full-scale biochar-amended biofilters for improved water quality.																	2053-1400	2053-1419				JUL 1	2017	3	4					726	734		10.1039/c7ew00070g								WOS:000404718800011

A literature review of system operation	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												Optimisation of the operation of water distribution systems has been an active research field for almost half a century. It has focused mainly on optimal pump operation to minimise pumping costs and optimal water quality management to ensure that standards at customer nodes are met. This paper provides a systematic review by bringing together over two hundred publications from the past three decades, which are relevant to operational optimisation of water distribution systems, particularly optimal pump operation, valve control and system operation for water quality purposes of both urban drinking and regional multiquality water distribution systems. Uniquely, it also contains substantial and thorough information for over one hundred publications in a tabular form, which lists optimisation models inclusive of objectives, constraints, decision variables, solution methodologies used and other details. Research challenges in terms of simulation models, optimisation model formulation, selection of optimisation method and postprocessing needs have also been identified.

A model library for simulation and benchmarking of integrated urban wastewater systems	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												This paper presents a freely distributed, open-source toolbox to predict the behaviour of urban wastewater systems (UWS). The proposed library is used to develop a system-wide Benchmark Simulation Model (BSM-UWS) for evaluating (local/global) control strategies in urban wastewater systems (UWS). The set of models describe the dynamics of flow rates and major pollutants (COD, TSS, N and P) within the catchment (CT), sewer network (SN), wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and river water system (RW) for a hypothetical, though realistic, UWS. Evaluation criteria are developed to allow for direct assessment of the river water quality instead of the traditional emission based metrics (for sewer overflows and WWTP discharge). Three case studies are included to illustrate the applicability of the proposed toolbox and also demonstrate the potential benefits of implementing integrated control in the BSM-UWS platform. Simulation results show that the integrated control strategy developed to maximize the utilization of the WWTP's capacity represents a balanced choice in comparison to other options. It also improves the river water quality criteria for unionized ammonia and dissolved oxygen by 62% and 6%, respectively. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Pilot scale experiments were performed in a distribution system simulator by injecting arsenic and measuring both adsorption onto iron pipe material and the oxidation of arsenite by hypochlorite in tap water to form arsenate. A mathematical model describing these processes was developed and simulated using EPANET-MSX, a hydraulic and multi-species water quality software for pipe networks. Model parameters were derived from the pilot-scale experiments. The model was applied to both the distribution system simulator and EPANET example network #3, a real-world model of a drinking water system serving approximately 78,000 customers. The model can be applied to systems-level studies of arsenic fate and transport in drinking water resulting from natural occurrences, accidental spills, or intentional introduction into water.

This study assessed the suitability of marginal lands in Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB) for three promising biofeedstocic crops, switchgrass, Miscanthus and hybrid poplar. The land suitability was categorized into 5 suitability classes (not-, poorly-, moderately-, good-and highly-suitable) based on a fuzzy logic based land suitability evaluation procedure. The results showed that 60% of marginal lands in UMRB were moderately to highly suitable for growth of the targeted biofeedstock crops. Predicted bioethanol production from marginal land in the UMRB with consideration of suitability level was two thirds of the production predicted without consideration of suitability level. Our results better constrain the potential of marginal land for biofuel production as well as the importance of land suitability evaluation for policy analysis targeting biofuel development on marginal lands.

J	Grochowska, J; Augustyniak, R; Lopata, M				Grochowska, Jolanta; Augustyniak, Renata; Lopata, Michal			How durable is the improvement of environmental conditions in a lake after the termination of restoration treatments	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												The study was conducted on Lake Dlugie,a water body lying in Olsztyn, a town situated in northeastern Poland. From 1956 to 1976raw wastewater was discharged into Lake Dlugie and therefore heavy pollution was the reason for the total degradation of this lake. The concentrations of nutrients were very high in the bottom water layer (TN 22.89 mg L-1, TP 3.50 mg L-1). The mean concentration of chlorophyll an exceeded 60 mu g L-1 on average and Secchi disc visibility was less than 1 m. The discontinuation of sewage discharge into the lake caused the saprotrophic state to transform into hypertrophy. Further improvement of the environmental conditions in the lake was possible only after the implementation of an appropriate restoration method. The restoration procedure of this lake began in 1987. The first stage involved an artificial aeration method, and the second stage consisted of a phosphorus inactivation method. The applied restoration methods led to the improvement of Lake Dlugie's water quality. Even ten years after the restoration oscillated in the range of 5-10 mu g L-1, Chlorophyll a contents oscillated in the range of 5-10 mu g L-1, and Secchi disc visibility amounted to c.a. 4.5 m.

They are affected by nutrient and light availability and seasonal changes. In this study, we investigated the changes of C/N metabolism and growth of three natural submersed macrophyte populations (i.e., each in a different site), Potamogeton maackianus, in response to water depth gradients with 0.5 m interval in a freshwater lake for four seasons. Changes were identified by measuring the biomass of the sampled macrophytes and metabolite contents of soluble carbohydrate (SC), starch, and free amino acid (FAA) in their organs. Results showed that no significant and consistent changes were found in the SC and FAA contents in leaves and stems from 1.0 m to 5.5 m water depth, as compared to previous results of controlled studies, suggesting a relative stable C/N metabolism in response to the depth gradients in studied natural populations of P. maackianus. The metabolite contents with the most variations appeared mainly because of seasonal changes. The metabolite contents of the macrophyte populations were more closely correlated with the chemical parameters than with the light parameters in water columns. No significant correlations were found between the metabolite contents with the light attenuation coefficient ($K$) and Secchi depth (SD) in water columns. The NO3-N and total phosphorus (TP) contents in water columns were positively correlated with the SC and starch contents in leaves, respectively. The NH4-N content in water columns was negatively related to the FAA content in leaves. Metabolite contents had weak correlations with depth gradients and light parameters, probably because of the physiological integration among individuals by developed stolons and the canopy-forming characteristic of this species. Our results highlighted the importance of water quality to the C/N metabolism in natural population of submersed macrophyte. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, implementing this empirical comparative approach at a greater spatial scale remains a challenge due to the diversity of biogeographical contexts encompassed by regional and national scales. We showed in previous studies that the use of standard organisms caged permits the use of a common biomonitor over a far greater geographical range, while limiting the influence of confounding factors on levels of bioavailable contamination. In this study, levels of Cd, Hg, Ni and Pb contamination assessed by active biomonitoring with caged Gammarus fossarum were compared to abundances of on-site gammarids, on 94 sites in France. Based on this national dataset of in situ bioassays, we first re-determined bioavailable background assessment concentrations (BBACs), i.e. concentrations measured in caged G. fossarum indicating a significant bioavailable contamination, which we had previously defined at a regional scale for these four metallic elements. On-site gammarid abundances were retrieved from monitoring programs implemented by French water agencies for the evaluation of ecological status for the European Water Framework Directive. These abundances were corrected for the influence of stream physico-chemical typology in order to permit a reliable comparison of gammarid densities between sites at the national scale. Clear trends of degradation of gammarid densities with increasing levels of bioaccumulated concentrations were identified for three of the four elements (Cd, Ni and Pb). Threshold concentrations in caged organisms above which the numbers of free-ranging gammarids were abnormally low namely bioavailable ecological assessment concentrations (BEACs) were determined. The reliability and validity of the BEACs, their comparison with BBACs and their usefulness in terms of prioritisation of contaminants, sites in freshwater management, are discussed.

To our knowledge, this study is the first to describe the variability of surface water quality in inland waters in China, the affecting drivers behind the changes, and how the government-financed conservation actions have impacted water quality. Water quality was found to be poorest in the North and the Northeast China Plain where there is greater coverage of developed land (cities + cropland), a higher gross domestic product (GDP), and higher population density. There are significant positive relationships between the concentration of the annual mean chemical oxygen demand (COD) and the percentage of developed land use (cities + cropland), GDP, and population density in the individual watersheds (p < 0.001). During the past decade, following Chinese government financed investments in environmental restoration and reforestation, the water quality of Chinese inland waters has improved markedly, which is particularly evident from the significant and exponentially decreasing GDP-normalized COD and ammonium (NH4+-N) concentrations. It is evident that the increasing GDP in China over the past decade did not occur at the continued expense of its inland water ecosystems. This offers hope for the future, also for other industrializing countries, that with appropriate environmental investments a high GDP can be reached and maintained, while simultaneously preserving inland aquatic ecosystems, particularly through management of sewage discharge.

Modeling Water-Quality Parameters Using Genetic Algorithm-Least Squares Support Vector Regression and Genetic Programming	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												The modeling and monitoring of water-quality parameters is necessary because of the ever increasing use of water resources and contamination caused by sewage disposal. This study employs two data-driven methods for modeling water-quality parameters. The methods are the least-squares support vector regression (LSSVR) and genetic programming (GP). Model inputs to the LSSVR algorithm and GP were determined using principal component analysis (PCA). The coefficients of the LSSVR were selected by sensitivity analysis employing statistical criteria. The results of the sensitivity analysis of the LSSVR showed that its accuracy depends strongly on the values of its coefficients. The value of the Nash-Sutcliffe (NS) statistic was negative for 60% of the combinations of coefficients applied in the sensitivity analysis. That is, using the mean of a time series would produce a more accurate estimate of water-quality parameters than the LSSVR method in 60% of the combinations of parameters tried. The genetic algorithm (GA) was combined with LSSVR to produce the GA-LSSVR algorithm with which to achieve improved accuracy in modeling water-quality parameters. The GA-LSSVR algorithm and the GP method were employed in modeling Na+, K+, Mg2+, SO42-, Cl-, pH, electric conductivity (EC), and total dissolved solids (TDS) in the Sefidrood River, Iran. The results indicate that the GA-LSSVR algorithm has better accuracy for modeling water-quality parameters than GP judged by the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the NS criterion. The NS static established, however, that the GA-LSSVR and GP methods have the capacity to model water-quality parameters accurately.

Galvanic Corrosion of Lead by Iron (Oxyhydr)Oxides: Potential Impacts on Drinking Water Quality	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Lead exposure via drinking water remains a significant public health risk; this study explored the potential effects of upstream iron corrosion on lead mobility in water distribution systems. Specifically, galvanic corrosion of lead by iron (oxyhydr)oxides was investigated. Coupling an iron mineral cathode with metallic lead in a galvanic cell increased lead release by 531 mu g L-1 on average a 9-fold increase over uniform corrosion in the absence of iron. Cathodes were composed of spark plasma sintered Fe3O4 or alpha-Fe2O3 or field extracted Fe3O4 and alpha-FeOOH. Orthophosphate immobilized oxidized lead as insoluble hydroxypyromorphite, while humic acid enhanced lead mobility. Addition of a humic isolate increased lead release due to uniform corrosion by 81 mu g L-1 and-upon coupling lead to a mineral cathode-release due to galvanic corrosion by 990 mu g L-1. Elevated lead in the presence of humic acid appeared to be driven by complexation, with Pb-208 and UV254 size-exclusion chromatograms exhibiting strong correlation under these conditions (R-average(2) = 0.87). A significant iron corrosion effect was consistent with field data: lead levels after lead service line replacement were greater by factors of 2.3-4.7 at sites supplied by unlined cast iron distribution mains compared with the alternative, lined ductile iron.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				JUN 20	2017	51	12					6812	6820		10.1021/acs.est.7b01671								WOS:000404087400021	28557454

A Complementary Isothermal Amplification Method to the US EPA Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction Approach for the Detection of Enterococci in Environmental Waters	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												We report a novel molecular assay, based on helicasedependent amplification (HDA), for the detection of enterococci as markers for fecal pollution in water. This isothermal assay targets the same Enterococcus 23S r-RNA gene region as the existing quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Methods 1611 and 1609 but can be entirely performed on a simple heating block. The developed Enterococcus HDA assay successfully discriminated 15 enterococcal from 15 non-enterococcal reference strains and reliably detected 48 environmental isolates of enterococci. The limit of detection was 25 target copies per reaction, only 3 times higher than that of qPCR. The applicability of the assay was tested on 30 environmental water sample DNA extracts, simulating a gradient of fecal pollution. Despite the isothermal nature of the reaction, the HDA results were consistent with those of the qPCR reference. Given this performance, we conclude that the developed Enterococcus HDA assay has great potential as a qualitative molecular screening method for resource-limited settings when combined with compatible up- and downstream processes. This amplification strategy can pave the way for developing a new generation of rapid, low-cost, and field-deployable molecular diagnostic tools for water quality monitoring.

However, little empirical evidence exists to characterize the potential health benefits from sanitation externalities. This study investigated the effect of community sanitation coverage versus individual household sanitation access on child health and drinking water quality. Using a Census of 121 villages in rural Mali, we analyzed the association of community latrine coverage (defined' by a 200 m radius surrounding a household) and individual household latrine ownership with child growth and household stored water quality. Child height-for-age had a significant and positive linear relationship with community latrine coverage, while child weight-for-age and household water quality had nonlinear relationships that leveled off above 60% coverage (p < 0.01; generalized additive models). Child growth and water quality were not associated with individual household latrine ownership. The relationship between community latrine coverage and child height was strongest among households without a latrine; for these households, each 10% increase in latrine coverage was associated with a 0.031 (p-value = 0.040) increase in height-for-age z-score. In this study, the level of sanitation access of surrounding households was more important than private latrine access for protecting water quality and child health.

Effect of aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) on recovered stormwater quality variability	WATER RESEARCH												Aquifer Storage and Recovery (ASR) is increasingly being considered as a means of reusing urban stormwater to supplement available urban water resources. Storage of stormwater in an aquifer has been shown to affect water quality but it has also been claimed that storage will also decrease the stormwater quality variability making for improved predictability and management. This study is the first to document the changes in stormwater quality variability as a result of subsurface storage at four full scale ASR sites using advanced statistical techniques. New methods to examine water quality are required as data is often highly left censored and so traditional measures of variability such as the coefficient of variation are inappropriate. It was observed that for some water quality parameters (most notably E. coli) there was a marked improvement of water quality and a significant decrease in variability at all sites. This means that aquifer storage prior to engineered treatment systems may be advantageous in terms of system design to avoid over engineering. For other parameters such as metal(loids)s and nutrients the trend was less clear due to the numerous processes occurring during storage leading to an increase in variability, especially for geogenic metals and metalloids such as iron and arsenic. Depending upon the specific water quality parameters and end use, use of ASR may not have a dampening effect on stormwater quality variability. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Fecal contamination of seagulls was characterized by quantifying a novel genetic marker targeting Catellicoccus marimamalium. Quantification of this marker was combined with those of Escherichia coli, human-associated Bacteroidales, thermophilic Campylobacter and Helicobacter. Findings of a year-round study indicate that C marimamalium levels correlated strongly, both spatially and temporally, with seagull migration. A steady increase in C marimammalium concentrations was recorded between October 2014 and March 2015, which peaked at about 5-log copies/100 mL in January. However, a background level of about 2.1-log copies/100 mL was noticeable from April through September when seagulls were absent, probably due to other host sources or secondary habitats for C marimammalium. Seagull migration also caused an apparent elevation of E. coli concentrations (86% and 60%, respectively for qPCR and culture method; p < 0.001) as well as Campylobacter and Helicobacter (66% and 68%, respectively; p < 0.001). Nonetheless, in contrast to the declining levels of E. coli, Campylobacter and Helicobacter, the human-specific Bacteroidales marginally increased in the seagull-absent season, indicating a limited influence of human activities, compared with seagull migration, on the seasonal variations in microbial water quality of the lake. The elevated levels of FIB, Campylobacter and Helicobacter along with C marimammalium may imply human health risk of the lake water due to seasonal seagull migration, which requires further investigation for risk assessment.

Kinetics and mechanism of sulfate radical- and hydroxyl radical-induced degradation of highly chlorinated pesticide lindane in UV/peroxymonosulfate system	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL												Lindane is a highly persistent chlorinated pesticide and a potent endocrine disruptor. The strong electron withdrawing property of the chlorine atoms results in a relatively low reactivity of lindane with (OH)-O-center dot in conventional advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). In this study, the degradation of lindane by UV (254 nm)/peroxymonosulfate (UV/PMS), which can generate both (OH)-O-center dot and SO4 center dot-, was investigated. A second-order rate constant of 13 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1) between lindane and SO4 center dot- was determined using competition kinetics, suggesting a strong role of SO4 center dot-. The degree of degradation changed with different initial solution pH, achieving 86, 92 and 55% removal of lindane at pH 4.0, 5.8 and 8.0, respectively, in 180 min, attributable to the varying concentrations of (OH)-O-center dot and SO4 center dot-. The addition of common water quality constituents, e.g., humic acid or inorganic anions, at pH 5.8 showed a varied inhibition effect with 61% degradation in the presence of 1.0 mg L-1 humic acid, and 45, 60, 88 and 91% degradation in the presence of 1 mM CO32-, HCO3-, Cl- and SO42-, respectively, in 180 min. With the kinetics being demonstrated to be feasible, the degradation mechanism of lindane by UV/PMS was also assessed. Based on the detected by-products through GC-MS analysis, plausible reaction pathways were proposed, suggesting dechlorination, chlorination, dehydrogenation and hydroxylation via (OH)-O-center dot and/or SO42- attack. Meanwhile, reasonable mineralization efficiency was observed, with a 56% total organic carbon removal in 360 min, at an initial PMS concentration of 500 mu M. Results from both degradation kinetics and transformation mechanism indicate that UV/PMS is a potential method for the treatment of water contaminated with lindane. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Microbial water quality monitoring is crucial for managing water resources and protecting public health. However, institutional testing activities in sub-Saharan Africa are currently limited. Because the economics of water quality testing are poorly understood, the extent to which cost may be a barrier to monitoring in different settings is unclear. This study used cost data from eighteen African monitoring institutions (piped water suppliers and health surveillance agencies in six countries) and estimates of water supply type coverage from fifteen countries to assess the annual financial requirements for microbial water testing at both national and regional levels, using World Health Organization recommendations for sampling frequency. We found that a microbial water quality test costs 21.0 +/- 11.3 USD, on average, including consumables, equipment, labor, and logistics, which is higher than previously calculated. Our annual cost estimates for microbial monitoring of piped supplies and improved point sources ranged between 8,000 USD for Equatorial Guinea and 1.9 million USD for Ethiopia, depending primarily on the population served but also on the distribution of piped water system sizes. A comparison with current national water and sanitation budgets showed that the cost of implementing prescribed testing levels represents a relatively modest proportion of existing budgets (<2%). At the regional level, we estimated that monitoring the microbial quality of all improved water sources in sub-Saharan Africa would cost 16.0 million USD per year, which is minimal in comparison to the projected annual capital costs of achieving Sustainable Development Goal 6.1 of safe water for all (14.8 billion USD).

Interaction between Physical Heterogeneity and Microbial Processes in Subsurface Sediments: A Laboratory-Scale Column Experiment	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Physical heterogeneity determines interstitial [GRAPHIC] fluxes in porous media. Nutrients and organic matter distribution in depth influence physicochemical and microbial processes occurring in subsurface. Columns 50 cm long were filled with sterile silica sand following five different setups combining fine and coarse sands or a mixture of both mimicking potential water treatment barriers. Water was supplied continuously to all columns during 33 days. Hydraulic conductivity, nutrients and organic matter, biofflm biomass, and activity were analyzed in order to study the effect of spatial grain size heterogeneity on physicochemical and microbial processes and their mutual interaction. Coarse sediments showed higher biomass and activity in deeper areas compared to the others; however, they resulted in incomplete denitrification, large proportion of dead bacteria in depth, and low functional diversity. Treatments with fine sediment in the upper 20 cm of the columns showed high phosphorus retention. However, low hydraulic conductivity values reported in these sediments seemed to constraint biofflm activity and biomass. On the other hand, sudden transition from coarse-to-fine grain sizes promoted a hot-spot of organic matter degradation and biomass growth at the interface. Our results reinforce the idea that grain,: size disposition in subsurface sandy sediments drives the interstitial fluxes, influencing microbial processes.

Thermophilic biological treatment could save a large amount of thermal energy, but the major obstacle of a reuse are the poor sludge settling properties under thermophile conditions, leading to insufficient water quality if conventional gravimetric phase separation is applied. MBR technology is a promising alternative which allows a recirculation of treated water for improving the water and energy footprint. So far, there is only limited experience with thermophilic MBR at the time. In this study, a thermophilic MBR with a submerged membrane (TSMBR) was operated to treat wastewater from a paper mill with a COD concentration of 25-30 g L-1. The TSMBR was integrated into the operational process of the paper mill. Research questions were the influence of suspended solids, food to microorganism ratio (F/M ratio), cross-flow-aeration and filtration flux to the fouling of the membrane. Applying the critical flux concept, optimal operating conditions and costs for a future economic full-scale implementation could be derived. Key results are inter alia a sub-critical flux of below 10 L m(-2) h(-1) is recommended for long-time durability of the membrane for minimizing the irreversible fouling and the permeability decrease. A chemical cleaning does not change the critical flux, but improves the permeability of the membrane significantly. of suspended solids of above 14 g L-1. A stable process and cleaning could only be ensured by a F/M ratio of below 0.4 g(COD) g(MLSS)(-1) d(-1). Higher values result in an increased cake layer formation and intensive foaming.

Therefore, it is important to develop an environmentally friendly and economic method to treat palm oil mill effluent (POME). The main aim of this study was to investigate the potential of Lemna minor (L. minor) and Chlamydomonas incerta (C. incerta) with catalog number (KR349061) for the bioremediation of POME in order to achieve higher water quality standard and further produce organic fertilizer. In this study, three different experiments were conducted by using L. minor, followed by addition of C. incerta, and further combination of L. minor and C. incerta. The concentration of nitrate (NO3-), ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3-N), phosphate (PO4-P), Electrical Conductivity (EC) and salinity in produced fertilizer were measured, and then they were compared with two current commercial fertilizers. Growth factors such as growth rates, average number of leaf and height of root of L. minor of plants were also determined. The results showed that the microalgae and macrophytes were capable of removing only 4.4% of chemical organic demand (COD) whereas the respective maximum removal rates for NO3-, NH3-N, and PO4-P were 12.5%, 11.3%, and 70.47%. Also, the average differences of NO3-, NH3-N, and PO4-P concentrations in produced fertilizer in comparison with two current commercial fertilizers were 95, 39.5, and 62.5 mg/g, respectively. The results of this study revealed that only L. minor was converted into fertilizer. This study elaborated that both L. minor and C. incerta are able to remove a part of organic pollutants and nutrients from POME.

Physico-chemical data were derived from 42 groundwater samples, and were further used to map human health risk in Lucknow monitoring area. The analysis reveals that the carbonate and silicate weathering along with reverse ion exchange, cation exchange, sulphide oxidation, dissociation of residual halides are the major solute processes controlling the ionic concentration of groundwater in Lucknow. Groundwater is predominantly of Na+-Ca2+-HCO3- type having all cations and anions within prescribed WHO limits except for Fe2+ and NO3-. Ionic concentrations of groundwater were combined to derive a Water Quality Index (WQI) using spatial overlay in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). WQI reveals that about 47.8% of the total 133.52 km(2) area covering Cis-Gomti localities of the city has nearly poor water quality for drinking use which is possibly due to high Fe2+ and NO3- influx in shallow unconfined aquifers. WQI is integrated with urban population density index data to map spatial distribution of human health risk due to consumption of poor water quality. Results reveal that the sites located in and around the vicinity of Alambagh, Kaiserbagh and Hazratganj, covering 9.81% of the total area, are potential ` hot spot' at moderate to high health risk, and require substantial remediation measures to control the anthropogenic influx on a long-term basis.																	2198-7491	2198-7505				JUN	2017	4	2					375	397		10.1007/s40710-017-0232-0								WOS:000414367800005

Impacts of Heronries on Water Quality as Evaluated through Escherichia coli and Fecal Sterol Analyses	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												The authors used fecal sterol analysis to determine the potential contribution of E. coli from heronries to waterbodies in east-central Texas. They analyzed E. coli and fecal sterol concentrations in samples from four heronries during the breeding seasons in 2011-2013. The highest E. coli concentrations were in water samples from the two largest heronries established directly over water. The main sterols in fecal samples were cholesterol and stigmasterol, and in water, cholesterol, coprostanol, and cholestanol. Total sterols ranged 979 to 5838 ng/g dry weight in fecal samples, and 13 to 600 ng/L in water samples. There was a positive correlation between E. coli and the sum of bird sterols in water exposed directly to fecal deposition, but not in water surrounding the heronries. The authors found a strong association between E. coli and stigmasterol, suggesting that the presence of stigmasterol in water could be used for predicting E. coli sources from heronries nesting close to waterbodies.

J	Ngoc, NM; Inoue, T; Yokota, K				Nguyen Minh Ngoc; Inoue, Takanobu; Yokota, Kuriko			Ultrasonic extraction method for quantifying bioavailable phosphorus in particulate form	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING												Eutrophication is a common problem in closed bodies of water areas during the summer. Recent reports have alleged that bioavailable phosphorus (BAP) in particulate forms contributes to eutrophication. However, current methods for quantifying particulate BAP are time-consuming and tedious. Here, we investigated the use of extraction with 0.1 M NaOH solution in combination with ultrasonication to quantify potential BAP in particulate forms in soils and suspended sediments from an agricultural area. The ultrasonic extraction process was considerably less time-consuming than conventional methods and would thus permit analysis of a greater number of samples. The bioavailability of extractable P was verified in algal growth potential assays involving P-starved Microcystis aeruginosa. The high correlation between the concentration of extracted BAP and M. aeruginosa growth at day 25 of incubation proved that the entire BAP fraction could be obtained in a single-step extraction. However, algal growth was also observed in cultures in which solid residues were the sole P source, confirming that the P left behind after extraction could be taken up by algal cells. This result suggests that in P-depleted media, algae could utilize cellular nutrients for growth. Therefore, M. aeruginosa is inappropriate for use in bioassays in P-depleted environments. Cellular mechanism of P uptake by algae should be investigated further to elucidate the factors that might limit or interfere with algal growth in nutrient-depleted environments.																	2213-3437					JUN	2017	5	3					2498	2507		10.1016/j.jece.2017.04.047								WOS:000405370200043

But factors influencing their growth are still poorly understood. In the present study the effect of micronutrients, N:P ratio and silica concentration on benthic diatom Synedra sp. grown in fish pond waste water was studied along with nutrient removal efficiency. We have studied nine different treatments, of which addition of micronutrient mixture Nualgi along with adjusted N: P to 6:1 resulted in highest cell density, followed by silicate enrichment, whereas only N:P adjustment and Nualgi addition had no significant effect on diatom growth. At the end of the growth experiment, the N removal efficiencies of treatment groups (50.23%-65.44%) were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of the control group (43.56%), whereas phosphate removal efficiency was significantly higher (P < 0.05) with Nualgi and N:P adjustment (53.37%-68.98%). The silicate consumption was significantly higher in the control group, at 63.87%, than in other experimental groups. These results will give us a new insight into important factors influencing beneficial algae growth and simultaneous nutrient removal from aquaculture waste water.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				JUN	2017	75	12					2777	2783		10.2166/wst.2017.156								WOS:000404557300006	28659517

Advanced phosphorus removal via coagulation, flocculation and microsieve filtration in tertiary treatment	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The applicability of microsieve technology together with coagulation and flocculation for advanced phosphorus removal was investigated. A pilot unit including a microsieve with 10 mu m mesh size was operated continuously with secondary effluent from Ruhleben wastewater treatment plant in Berlin. By applying a pretreatment of 0.07-0.09 mmol/L (as metal) coagulant and 1.5-2 mg/L cationic polymer, total phosphorus values below 80 mu g/L were achieved. Coagulation with polyaluminum chloride (PACl) produced a better effluent quality compared to FeCl3, as less suspended solids and less residual coagulant were found in the microsieve effluent. In addition, the transmittance of UV radiation through the water was improved by using PACl. The produced amount of backwash water was always below 3% (on average 1.6%). Under optimized mixing conditions, polymer doses of 0.6 mg/L were possible without losses in water quality and filtration performance. Microsieving with chemical pretreatment is a viable option for high quality effluent polishing.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				JUN	2017	75	12					2875	2882		10.2166/wst.2017.166								WOS:000404557300016	28659527

All of these sources emit pathogens and fecal indicator bacteria into the surface water, which the EU Bathing Water Directive addresses by giving threshold values for the indicators Escherichia coli and intestinal enterococci. This study presents a comparison between 21 scenarios of costs for processes that reduce the load of Escherichia coli and intestinal enterococci into the Ruhr River during and shortly after rain events. The methods examined include UV irradiation for WWTPs, integrated sewer management and treatment of CSOs with vertical flow constructed wetlands or performic acid. For pollution by diffuse overland flow, we evaluated organizational measures. The treatment of only diffuse pollution shows merely a slight effect on intestinal enterococci, but none on Escherichia coli and hence, was not considered further. Combining all three CSO reduction methods with the irradiation of WWTP effluent provides the best simulation results in terms of reducing both indicator bacteria.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				JUN	2017	75	11					2659	2668		10.2166/wst.2017.141								WOS:000403486600019	28617286

Compared with the control pond, the experiment pond had better water quality as indicated by 64.2% reduction in chlorophyll a, and 81.1% reduction in algal cells. The chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus concentration were reduced by 55.1%, 57.5%, and 50.8%, respectively. The treatment efficiency is mainly due to the growth control of Microcystis (i.e. cell reduction of 96.4%). The gas vesicles collapsing because of the water pressure was suggested to be the mechanism for Microcystis suppression by the deep well circulation treatment. The Microcystis lost its buoyancy after gas vesicles collapsed and it settled to the bottom of the aquaculture pond. As a result, the algae reproduction was suppressed because algae could only grow in the area with enough sunlight (i.e. water depth less than 1 m).																	0273-1223	1996-9732				JUN	2017	75	11					2692	2701		10.2166/wst.2017.159								WOS:000403486600022	28617289

Micro-zooplankton grazing as a means of fecal bacteria removal in stormwater BMPs	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												A priority for environmental managers is control of stormwater runoff pollution, especially fecal microbial pollution. This research was designed to determine if fecal bacterial grazing by micro-zooplankton is a significant control on fecal bacteria in aquatic best management practices (BMPs); if grazing differs between a wet detention pond and a constructed wetland; and if environmental factors enhance grazing. Both 3-day grazing tests and 24-h dilution assays were used to determine grazing differences between the two types of BMP. Micro-zooplankton grazing was a stronger bacteria removal mechanism in stormwater wetlands rich in aquatic vegetation compared to a standard wet detention pond, although grazing was important in detention ponds as well. Our experiments indicated that the majority of grazers that fed on fecal bacteria were <20 mu m in size. Grazing rates were positively correlated with fecal coliform abundance and increased water temperatures. Enumeration of grazers demonstrated that protozoans were significantly more abundant among wetland vegetation than in open water, and open wetland waters contained more flagellates and dinoflagellates than open wet detention pond waters. Grazing on fecal bacteria in BMPs is enhanced by aquatic vegetation, and grazing in aquatic BMPs in warmer climates should be greater than in cooler climates.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				JUN	2017	75	11					2702	2715		10.2166/wst.2017.170								WOS:000403486600023	28617290

Planning and establishment principles for constructed wetlands and riparian buffer zones in agricultural catchments	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												In a great number of scientific articles on water quality improvement using constructed wetlands (CW) and riparian buffers zones (RBZ) at catchment scale, contradictory results are found. In most cases this is due to underestimating or even ignoring the role of the hydrological factor for water quality improvement. It has often resulted in biased estimates of buffering systems' efficiency at catchment scale and, consequently, has caused planning and establishment failures, mistakes and inconsistencies in legislative acts and finally, it has influenced stakeholder's willingness to support these eco-technological measures. In this paper we present a short but critical overview of the potential of CWs and RBZs in water quality improvement at catchment scale and highlight the most important aspects to be considered when planning, establishing and managing these systems.

Recovering hydromorphological functionality to improve natural purification capacity of a highly human-modified wetland	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING					9th International Meeting of the European-Chapter of the Society-of-Wetland-Scientists (SWS) on Wetlands Biodiversity and Services - Tools for Socio-Ecological Development held Jointly with the 6th Conference of the European-Pond-Conservation-Network	SEP 14-18, 2014	Huesca, SPAIN	Soc Wetland Scientists, European Chapter, European Pond Conservat Network				Modification of the hydrological regime by human actions can reduce the capacity of wetlands to improve water quality. For the first time, a study was conducted of the inherent pollution attenuation capacity of wetlands associated with the highly regulated Spanish Tagus River. We determined the natural purification capacity of a floodplain where irrigated agriculture predominates and hydraulic connection with the river is virtually nonexistent. To this end, continuous hydrophysical measurements and sediment and water samples were taken during the period extending from April 2013 to March 2014. A multi-parametric dataset including hydraulic, physico-chemical, bacterial and macroinvertebrate indicators was collected from ten piezometers located within a meander, together with two additional sampling points in the river. Sampling was performed monthly to measure hydraulic and physico-chemical parameters and quarterly for bacteria and macroinvertebrates. The data enabled us to implement different but complementary methodological approaches to characterize denitrification. Specifically, we performed: (i) end-member mixing analysis (EMMA); (ii) macroinvertebrate characterization; (iii) denitrification potential analysis; (iv) bacterial assemblage structure analysis; and (v) hydrological modeling of the current and different future management scenarios. All the approaches except EMMA indicated the same conclusion: denitrification is almost nonexistent due to the fact that the study site does not present the hydric soil and oxygen-limited conditions required to enable denitrification. The EMMA analysis showed that theoretical nitrate concentrations were lower than expected in some areas during the summer months (e.g. Delta NO3 = -41 in August 2013), which may have been because irrigation intensity was spatiotemporal variable at the study site. Our results show that floodplain denitrification has been drastically reduced due to the suppression of flood pulses. In this context, restoration of the hydrological regime in riverine wetlands would lead to the decay of nitrates whose dynamic evolution increases with flooding, as scenarios tested by the MOHID hydro-biogeochemical model have demonstrated.

Assessment of the denitrification process in alluvial wetlands at floodplain scale using the SWAT model	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING					9th International Meeting of the European-Chapter of the Society-of-Wetland-Scientists (SWS) on Wetlands Biodiversity and Services - Tools for Socio-Ecological Development held Jointly with the 6th Conference of the European-Pond-Conservation-Network	SEP 14-18, 2014	Huesca, SPAIN	Soc Wetland Scientists, European Chapter, European Pond Conservat Network				As alluvial plains support intensive agricultural activities, they often suffer from groundwater nitrate pollution. Denitrification is recognised as an important process in nitrate pollution control in riparian zones. In shallow aquifer zones influenced by recharged surface water, denitrification efficiently attenuates nitrate in groundwater as well, and the exchange between surface water and groundwater has a significant impact on the occurrence of denitrification. Denitrification is simulated in numerous models, however most models do not take into account the denitrification occurring in shallow aquifers or the influence of recharge surface water in the alluvial aquifer with organic carbon and bacteria to activate denitrification. In this study, a new module was developed that represents the occurrence of denitrification in the shallow aquifer of alluvial floodplains. Nitrate inputs in the shallow aquifer caused by the recharged river water through both lateral (river bank) and vertical (surface) infiltration and the influence of flooding on nitrate leaching were added to the Soil and Water Assessment Tool - Landscape Unit Darcy (SWAT-LUD) model. The influences of both dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) on denitrification were evaluated. The modified model was applied on an experimental site located in the floodplain of the Garonne River (southwest France). Results showed that the modified SWAT-LUD model was able to simulate the aquifer nitrate concentration in the near-bank zone (riparian zone) satisfactorily. The near-bank zone in the floodplain played the most important role in attenuating nitrate through denitrification with an annual denitrification rate of around 130 kg N-NO(3)(-)ha(-1)y(-1), representing about 40% of the nitrate input in this area. POC was more important than DOC in the denitrification process, especially in the near-bank zone where 98% of the nitrate was attenuated through POC consumption. Relationships between denitrification rates, groundwater levels and total input nitrate masses in the near-bank zone were determined. The results illustrated that groundwater levels were positively related to the denitrification rates in the near-bank zone. The absolute denitrification rate increased as the nitrate content increased, but the relative consumption rate by denitrification decreased. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Samples were taken during different periods of the year during 2011-2014 to evaluate the influence of agricultural activities during the two years following their completion. Nitrate concentration was significantly higher in the in-stream wetlands, showing a clear dilution effect caused by the inputs of the irrigation return flows. The patterns followed by the first-order nitrate removal rate constant were different for in-stream and off-stream wetlands and during irrigation and non-irrigation seasons. During non-irrigation seasons, the nitrate outflowing concentration was found to be negatively correlated (p < 0.01) to the first-order nitrate removal rate constant for in-stream wetlands, indicating that high nitrate inputs may restrict the effectiveness of the wetlands. Temperature and dissolved oxygen were also found to significantly influence the performance of off-stream wetlands during non-irrigation seasons, but only dissolved oxygen promoted the nitrate removal during the irrigation period, indicating the influence of the seasonal factor on nitrate and wetlands dynamics. The results of this study showed that although a longer time is required to achieve optimal wetland development, wetlands can be used as buffer zones that effectively remove nitrates. This study emphasizes the influence of the agricultural seasonality of the factors affecting nitrate removal in wetlands, expanding the information provided by similar studies and validating a model that is applicable to a wide range of agricultural, hydrological and seasonal conditions.

Riparian forest is thus a green infrastructure for biodiversity conservation. However, a long history of landscape alteration now calls for maintenance and restoration by ecological engineering. This study evaluates management guidelines advocating constant vs. variable width of riparian forest protected zones in managed landscapes. In naturally dynamic forests, stands with gap-phase dynamic along streams often provide a network of habitats with a high degree of continuity in tree canopy cover and dead wood for biodiversity conservation and delivery of ecosystem services including water purification. Based on the observation that tall herb sites indicate a potential for temporally continuous forest cover, we tested three null hypotheses. Tall herb sites ( 1) are equally common in the riparian zone and in the surrounding forest landscape; ( 2) have the same width on both sides of a stream; and ( 3) their widths are independent of the width of the adjacent stream. We described the ground vegetation in transects along and perpendicular to streams, and in the surrounding landscape, in six 3rd stream order catchment located in Sweden, Lithuania and the Komi Republic of Russia. The results showed that tall herb sites were 21-27 times more common along streams compared to in the rest of the landscape, the width of tall herb sites varied considerably along streams, and it was independent of the width of the adjacent stream. This study suggests that rather than fixed-width guidelines for riparian set-asides, to support cost-efficient maintenance of riparian forest, local site conditions should be used as guide for planning, maintenance and engineering of riparian ecotones. Because tall herb forest sites were historically cleared for agricultural purposes, the potential natural amount of riparian forest is severely underestimated. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In recent years, the water quality of this reservoir has been seriously threatened by eutrophication resulting from increased nonpoint source pollution loads. In this study, we used a Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to calculate pollution loads (total nitrogen [TN] and total phosphorus [TP]) in the area surrounding the Yuqiao Reservoir. We then established a coupled two-dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model that was used to simulate temporal and spatial distributions of TN and TP from June to September 2008. SWAT model results provided water quality boundary conditions for the coupled two-dimensional model. Results indicated that Liu Xiangying and Wu Baihu were the main TN inlets, and the average TN concentration in the reservoir was highest in September (3.74 mg/L). Meanwhile, the TP concentration in the eastern portion of the Yuqiao Reservoir was higher than that in the west, and the average TP concentration peaked in August (1.56 mg/L). The combination of the SWAT model and two-dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model provides an effective method to simulate water pollution with consideration of various factors.																	1092-8758	1557-9018				JUN	2017	34	6					418	432		10.1089/ees.2016.0124								WOS:000403206700005

The lake has hosted numerous different management efforts. Diversion of sewage waters away from the lake in 1979 resulted in a considerable reduction of external P loading. Due to diffuse loading from agricultural areas, external loading however still exceeds the critical loading of the lake, thus having an effect on the water quality. The total P concentration of surface layers has decreased but is still on a hypertrophic level (90 g1-1). The high productivity of the lake is maintained also by intensive internal P loading, and the sediment has a potential to release P to the water for decades even if external loading would be reduced to a tolerable level. Internal P loading has not decreased over the studied decades despite numerous within-lake management efforts (aeration with different methods, food web management). In opposite, our results demonstrated that destratification applied since 1998 resulted in a persisting internal P loading. Destratification has increased the concentration of oxygen and decreased the concentration of soluble P in deep water, but at the same time it has accelerated P release from aerobic bottoms. This can be due to elevated near-bottom temperatures, enhanced liberation of organic P through accelerated mineralization, and increased sediment resuspension by aeration-induced turbulence. Additionally, increasing wind velocities may have a role in the increasing aerobic internal loading. Food web management has compensated for the amplified P-cycling, revealed by the decreasing chlorophyll:total P ratio. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The concept has found some success with point source water pollution, but very few trades have occurred in over 50 programs in the United States (U.S.) that have focused on nonpoint sources (NPSs). To understand why success has been slow, we identified three environments needed for programs to succeed: physical, economic, and institutional. We estimate that only 5% of watersheds in the U.S. currently listed as nutrient impaired provide a viable physical environment for trading nitrogen; 13% are suitable for phosphorus. Economic and institutional challenges would shrink that domain even further. Therefore, we find places with the ideal physical, economic, and institutional environments necessary for feasible WQT programs are virtual policy utopias - rare places with ideal environments. Fortunately, a growing literature provides the tools necessary to identify where these policy utopias are and to expand that domain through a better understanding about how to manage WQT programs more effectively.																	1093-474X	1752-1688				JUN	2017	53	3					514	520		10.1111/1752-1688.12532								WOS:000402846200002

USE OF SWAT TO ESTIMATE SPATIAL SCALING OF PHOSPHORUS EXPORT COEFFICIENTS AND LOAD REDUCTIONS DUE TO AGRICULTURAL BMPS	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Phosphorus export coefficients (kg/ha/yr) from selected land covers, also called phosphorus yields, tend to get smaller as contributing areas get larger because some of the phosphorus mobilized on local fields gets trapped during transport to regional watershed outlets. Phosphorus traps include floodplains, wetlands, and lakes, which can then become impaired by eutrophication. The Sunrise River watershed in east central Minnesota, United States, has numerous lakes impaired by excess phosphorus. The Sunrise is tributary to the St. Croix River, whose much larger watershed is terminated by Lake St. Croix, also impaired by excess phosphorus. To support management of these impairments at both local and regional scales, a Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model of the Sunrise watershed was constructed to estimate load reductions due to selected best management practices (BMPs) and to determine how phosphorus export coefficients scaled with contributing area. In this study, agricultural BMPs, including vegetated filter strips, grassed waterways, and reduction of soil-phosphorus concentrations reduced phosphorus loads by 4-20%, with similar percentage reductions at field and watershed spatial scales. Phosphorus export coefficients from cropland in rotation with corn, soybeans, and alfalfa decreased as a negative power function of contributing area, from an average of 2.12 kg/ha/yr at the upland field scale (similar to 0.6 km(2)) to 0.63 kg/ha/yr at the major river basin scale (20,000 km(2)).																	1093-474X	1752-1688				JUN	2017	53	3					547	561		10.1111/1752-1688.12523								WOS:000402846200005

URBAN STREAMFLOW RESPONSE TO IMPORTED WATER AND WATER CONSERVATION POLICIES IN LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Los Angeles has a long history of importing water; however, drought, climate change, and environmental mitigation have forced the City to focus on developing more local water sources (target of 50% local supply by 2035). This study aims to improve understanding of water cycling in Los Angeles, including the impacts of imported water and water conservation policies. We evaluate the influence of local water restrictions on discharge records for 12 years in the Ballona Creek (urban) and Topanga Creek (natural) watersheds. Results show imported water has significantly altered the timing and volume of streamflow in the urban Ballona watershed, resulting in runoff ratios above one (more streamflow than precipitation). Further analysis comparing pre- vs. during-mandatory water conservation periods shows there is a significant decrease in dry season streamflow during-conservation in Ballona, indicating that prior to conservation efforts, heavy irrigation and other outdoor water use practices were contributing to streamflow. The difference between summer streamflow pre- vs. during-conservation is enough to serve 160,000 customers in Los Angeles. If Los Angeles returns to more watering days, educating the public on proper irrigation rates is critical for ensuring efficient irrigation and conserving water; however, if water restrictions remain in place, the City must take the new flow volumes into account for complying with water quality standards in the region.																	1093-474X	1752-1688				JUN	2017	53	3					626	640		10.1111/1752-1688.12515								WOS:000402846200010

In the present study, metal contents and toxicity of soils, aqueous extracts from soils and mine drainage waters from an abandoned F-Ba-Pb-Zn mining area in Osor (Girona, NE Spain) were evaluated through chemical extractions and ecotoxicity bioassays. Toxicity assessment in the terrestrial compartment included lethal and sublethal endpoints on earthworms Eisenia fetida, arthropods Folsomia candida and several plant species, whereas aquatic tests involved bacteria Vibrio fischeri, microalgae Raphidocelis subcapitata and crustaceans Daphnia magna. Total concentrations of Ba (250-5110 mg kg(-1)), Pb (940 to > 5000 mg kg(-1)) and Zn (2370-11,300 mg kg(-1)) in soils exceeded intervention values to protect human health. Risks for the aquatic compartment were identified in the release of drainage waters and in the potential leaching and runoff of metals from contaminated soils, with Cd (1.98-9.15 A mu g L-1), Pb (2.11-326 A mu g L-1) and Zn (280-2900 A mu g L-1) concentrations in filtered water samples surpassing US EPA Water Quality Criteria (2016a, b). Terrestrial ecotoxicity tests were in accordance with metal quantifications and identified the most polluted soil as the most toxic. Avoidance and reproduction tests with earthworms showed the highest sensitivity to metal contamination. Aquatic bioassays performed in aqueous extracts from soils confirmed the results from terrestrial tests and also detected toxic effects caused by the mine drainage waters. Algal growth inhibition was the most sensitive aquatic endpoint. In view of the results, the application of a containment or remediative procedure in the area is encouraged.																	0269-4042	1573-2983				JUN	2017	39	3					665	679		10.1007/s10653-016-9840-2								WOS:000402049700014	27260479

During these times, use of a woodchip heavy-use area (HUA) presents advantages such as a soft, supportive, and dry foot surface for animals and protection of the pasture and pasture soils. However, woodchip HUAs can also be a centralized source of high nutrient loads due to their drainage outflows. A column study was conducted to assess the nutrient load reduction potential of: 1) six types of wood media (including torrefied wood media and biochar) that could be used in a woodchip HUA versus a gravel control, and 2) providing a 48 h retention time within the wood media to enhance nitrogen removal through denitrification. The woody media provided significant liquid waste volume reduction compared to the gravel in simulated events (53%-61% vs. 39% reductions, respectively), and there may be additional liquid storage capacity in the woodchips not utilized during these rapid events. Substantial total nitrogen removal by the wood treatments (mean removal efficiencies > 50%) was observed across the simulated events, although nitrate leaching also occurred. Nitrate removal was enhanced during the 48 h retention test which showed removal was governed by availability of labile carbon (i.e., fresh woodchips exhibited > 70% nitrate removal). The retention test also indicated biochar mixtures provided some of the best total phosphorus removal, but the greatest benefits across all parameters was provided by the Mixed Hardwood treatment.

Microbial diversity is commonly used as a bioindicator of ecosystems functioning. However, there is a lack of sensitivity of microbial diversity indicators in the case of moderate and chronic environmental degradation, such as atmospheric deposition of pollutants, agricultural practices, diffuse pollution by wastewater and climate change. As a consequence, there is a need for alternative bioindicators of soils and water quality. Here, we discuss the interest of adopting a more integrative approach based on biotic interaction networks beyond the simple diversity indicators. We review how the various biotic interactions can be integrated in the various microbial networks such as trophic, mutualistic and co-occurrence networks. Then we discuss the efficiency of microbial networks and associated metrics to detect changes in microbial communities. We conclude that the connectance, the number of links and the average degree of co-occurrence networks could vary from 10 to 50% in response to minor perturbations when microbial diversity parameters remain stable. Finally, we analyze studies that aimed at linking microbial networks and activity to evaluate the potential of such networks for providing simple and operational indicators of ecosystem quality and functioning.

The framework conceptualizes GI practices using blocks (spatial features) and connectors (interfaces) representing functional components of a GI. The blocks represent spatial features with the ability to store water (e.g., pond, soil, benthic sediments, manhole, or a generic storage zone) and water quality constituents including chemical constituents and particles. The hydraulic module can solve a combination of Richards equation, kinematic/diffusive wave, Darcy, and other user-provided flow models. The particle transport module is based on performing mass-balance on particles in different phases, e.g., mobile and deposited in soil with constitutive theories controlling their transport, settling, deposition, and release. The reactive transport modules allow constituents to be in dissolved, sorbed, bound to particles, and undergo user-defined transformations. Four applications of the modeling framework are presented that demonstrate its flexibility for simulating urban GI performance. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Improved validation framework and R-package for artificial neural network models	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												Validation is a critical component of any modelling process. In artificial neural network (ANN) modelling, validation generally consists of the assessment of model predictive performance on an independent validation set (predictive validity). However, this ignores other aspects of model validation considered to be good practice in other areas of environmental modelling, such as residual analysis (replicative validity) and checking the plausibility of the model in relation to a priori system understanding (structural validity). In order to address this shortcoming, a validation framework for ANNs is introduced in this paper that covers all of the above aspects of validation. In addition, the validann R-package is introduced that enables these validation methods to be implemented in a user-friendly and consistent fashion. The benefits of the framework and R-package are demonstrated for two environmental modelling case studies, highlighting the importance of considering replicative and structural validity in addition to predictive validity.

An adjoint-based numerical method has been developed to determine the optimal placement of chlorine sensors in drinking water networks at a low computational cost. From a practical engineering perspective, the proposed optimal placement corresponds to the set of sensors that minimizes the area in which the unknown model parameters cannot be identified. The numerical strategy is implemented in the hydraulic software EPANET. Using the adjoint framework, we develop and apply an adaptive strategy in a French drinking water network that provides the optimal placement from 1 sensor to 6 sensors. We show that the highest reduction of the non-identifiable area is obtained at the first stages of the adaptive strategy. After 4 sensors, a plateau is reached. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Input variable selection with a simple genetic algorithm for conceptual species distribution models: A case study of river pollution in Ecuador	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												Species distribution models (SDMs) have received increasing attention in freshwater management to support decision making. Existing SDMs are mainly data-driven and often developed with statistical and machine learning methods but with little consideration of hypothetic ecological knowledge. Conceptual SDMs exist, but lack in performance, making them less interesting for decision management. Therefore, there is a need for model identification tools that search for alternative model formulations. This paper presents a methodology, illustrated with the example of river pollution in Ecuador, using a simple genetic algorithm (SGA) to identify well performing SDMs by means of an input variable selection (IVS). An analysis for 14 macroinvertebrate taxa shows that the SGA is able to identify well performing SDMs. It is observed that uncertainty on the model structure is relatively large. The developed tool can aid model developers and decision makers to obtain insights in driving factors shaping the species assemblage. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Multiple lines of evidence to identify sewage as the cause of water quality impairment in an urbanized tropical watershed	WATER RESEARCH												Indicator bacteria, which are conventionally used to evaluate recreational water quality, can originate from various non-human enteric and extra-enteric sources, hence they may not be indicative of human health risk nor do they provide information on the sources of contamination. In this study we utilized traditional (enterococci and Escherichia coli) and alternative (Clostridium perfringens) indicator bacteria, F-specific coliphage, molecular markers for microorganisms associated with human sewage (human associated Bacteroides and polyomaviruses), and microbial community analysis tools (16S rRNA gene fragment amplicon sequencing), to identify and evaluate human sewage-related impact in the Manoa watershed in Honolulu, Hawaii. Elevated concentrations of enterococci (geometric mean ranging from 1604 to 2575 CFU 100 mL(-1)) and C perfringens (45-77 CFU 100 mL(-1)) indicated impairment of the urbanized section of the stream, while indicator bacteria concentrations decreased downstream in the tidally influenced Ala Wai Canal. The threshold values triggering water quality violation notifications in Hawaii were exceeded in 33.3-75.0% of samples collected at sites in the urbanized section of Manoa Stream, but were not exceeded in any of the samples collected at an upstream site located in a forested area. Correlation between indicator bacteria concentrations and rainfall amounts was weak to moderate but significant (E. coli R = 0.251, P = 0.009; enterococci R = 0.369, P < 0.001; C. perfringens R = 0.343, P < 0.001), while concentrations of human fecal-associated molecular markers were not significantly correlated with rainfall (human-associated Bacteroides, R = 0.131, P = 0.256; human-associated polyomaviruses, R = 0.213, P = 0.464). Presence of human sewage was confirmed by detection of human associated Bacteroides and human polyomavirus in the urbanized section of Manoa Stream (83.3 -100% and 41.7-66.7% positive samples respectively). It was further confirmed by microbial community analyses which suggested that an average 2.4-3.4% of the total bacterial population in this section was associated with sewage. Microbial community profiles were significantly influenced by rainfall (R-2 = 0.4390, P < 0.001), pH (R-2 = 0.3077, P = 0.006), salinity (R-2 = 0.2614, P = 0.038), and conductivity (R-2 = 0.2676, P = 0.031). Although microbial diversity fluctuated throughout the watershed, it was lower in the impaired section. Leaking sewer systems and illegal cross-connections are implicated in the impairment of the watershed, hence both the sewer and the storm water lines should be routinely inspected. Collectively, our data suggest that information derived from the analysis of microbial communities complements current marker-based microbial source tracking techniques and environmental monitoring programs.

However, even though these elements lead to improved water quality, the water quality may be impacted during its distribution through piped networks due to the processes such as pipe material release, biofilm formation and detachment, accumulation and resuspension of loose deposits. Irregular changes in supply-water quality may cause physiochemical and microbiological de-stabilization of pipe material, biofilms and loose deposits in the distribution system that have been established over decades and may harbor components that cause health or esthetical issues (brown water). Even though it is clearly relevant to customers' health (e.g., recent Flint water crisis), until now, switching of supply-water quality is done without any systematic evaluation. This article reviews the contaminants that develop in the water distribution system and their characteristics, as well as the possible transition effects during the switching of treated water quality by destabilization and the release of pipe material and contaminants into the water and the subsequent risks. At the end of this article, a framework is proposed for the evaluation of potential transition effects. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Uncertainty analysis for effluent trading planning using a Bayesian estimation-based simulation-optimization modeling approach	WATER RESEARCH												In this study, a Bayesian estimation-based simulation-optimization modeling approach (BESMA) is developed for identifying effluent trading strategies. BESMA incorporates nutrient fate modeling with soil and water assessment tool (SWAT), Bayesian estimation, and probabilistic possibilistic interval programming with fuzzy random coefficients (PPI-FRC) within a general framework. Based on the water quality protocols provided by SWAT, posterior distributions of parameters can be analyzed through Bayesian estimation; stochastic characteristic of nutrient loading can be investigated which provides the inputs for the decision making. PPI-FRC can address multiple uncertainties in the form of intervals with fuzzy random boundaries and the associated system risk through incorporating the concept of possibility and necessity measures. The possibility and necessity measures are suitable for optimistic and pessimistic decision making, respectively. BESMA is applied to a real case of effluent trading planning in the Xiangxihe watershed, China. A number of decision alternatives can be obtained under different trading ratios and treatment rates. The results can not only facilitate identification of optimal effluent-trading schemes, but also gain insight into the effects of trading ratio and treatment rate on decision making. The results also reveal that decision maker's preference towards risk would affect decision alternatives on trading scheme as well as system benefit. Compared with the conventional optimization methods, it is proved that BESMA is advantageous in (i) dealing with multiple uncertainties associated with randomness and fuzziness in effluent-trading planning within a multi source, multi-reach and multi-period context; (ii) reflecting uncertainties existing in nutrient transport behaviors to improve the accuracy in water quality prediction; and (iii) supporting pessimistic and optimistic decision making for effluent trading as well as promoting diversity of decision alternatives.

To explore this, we combined iron-reducing or substrate-limited anaerobic conditions and aerobic pilot-scale reactors directly at a wastewater treatment plant. To investigate the detoxification by these processes, we applied two in vitro bioassays for baseline toxicity (Microtox) and reactive toxicity (AREc32) as well as in vivo bioassays with aquatic model species in two laboratory experiments (Desmodesmus subspicatus, Daphnia magna) and two on-site, flow-through experiments (Potamopyrgus antipodarum, Lumbriculus variegatus). Moreover, we analyzed 31 commonly occurring micropollutants and 10 metabolites. The baseline toxicity of raw wastewater was effectively removed in full-scale and reactor scale activated sludge treatment (>85%), while the oxidative stress response was only partially removed (>61%). A combination of an anaerobic pre-treatment under iron reducing conditions and an aerobic nitrification significantly further reduced the residual in vitro toxicities by 46-60% and outperformed the second combination consisting of an aerobic pre-treatment and an anaerobic post-treatment under substrate limiting conditions (27-43%). Exposure to effluents of the activated sludge treatment did not induce adverse in vivo effects in aquatic invertebrates. Accordingly, no further improvement in water quality could be observed. Compared to that, the removal of persistent micropollutants was increased. However, this observation was restricted to a limited number of compounds and the removal of the sum concentration of all target micropollutants was relative low (14-17%). In conclusion, combinations of strictly anaerobic and aerobic processes significantly enhanced the removal of specific and non-specific in vitro toxicities. Thus, an optimization of biological wastewater treatment can lead to a substantially improved detoxification. These otherwise hidden capacities of a treatment technology can only be uncovered by a complementary biological analysis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Monitoring UF membrane performance treating surface-groundwater blends: Limitations of FEEM-PARAFAC on the assessment of the organic matter role	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL												The decrease of water quantity and quality in water scarcity areas is palliated by improving water treatments with membrane technologies. System performance and efficiency, and then cost, is mainly affected by membrane fouling, which is still not well understood and controlled appropriately. In this study, the influence of content and composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on a membrane ultrafiltration (UF) stage from a full-scale UF stage in a drinking water treatment plant (DWTP) fed with surface water, groundwater (or blends of them) was investigated. Excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy coupled with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) was used to characterize and assess DOM changes in water samples Water streams feeding the UF stage showed high variability in DOM content and composition. FEEM-PARAFAC analysis allowed the differentiation of seven different organic components. Additionally to the characterization and monitoring of DOM in the full-scale UF stage, a bench scale UF pilot was run to experimentally correlate the impact of water quality with membrane performance. The experiments included testing synthetic solutions of model foulants (synthetic humic acid and bovine serum albumin) and blends of complex waters. To quantify fouling, the total fouling index (TFI) and the hydraulically irreversible fouling index (HIFI) were calculated for each filtration run. According to the results obtained, the correlation plots between the PARAFAC components and the fouling indices pointed at microbial byproducts (C1) and humic-like components (C2, C4, C5) as the ones showing higher correlations.

Setting water quality criteria for agricultural water reuse purposes	JOURNAL OF WATER REUSE AND DESALINATION												The use of reclaimed water for agricultural irrigation is practiced worldwide and will increase in the future. The definition of water quality limits is a useful instrument for the assessment of water quality regarding its suitability for irrigation purposes and the performance of wastewater treatment steps. This study elaborates water quality objectives for a water reuse project in a setting where national guidelines do not exist. Internationally established guidelines are therefore applied to the local context. Additional limits for turbidity, total suspended solids, biochemical and chemical oxygen demand, total phosphorus and potassium are suggested to meet the requirements of water reuse projects. Emphasis is put on water quality requirements prior to UV disinfection and nutrient requirements of cultivated crops. The presented values can be of assistance when monitoring reclaimed water quality. To facilitate the realization of water reuse projects, comprehensive and more detailed information, in particular on water quality requirements prior to disinfection steps, should be provided as well as regarding the protection of the irrigation infrastructure.																	2220-1319					JUN	2017	7	2					121	135		10.2166/wrd.2016.194								WOS:000400139700002

CBZ concentration increased by a factor of two (from 37 to ca. 70 ng/L) regardless of the treatment conditions, and its metabolites, 10,11-dihydro-10hydroxycarbamazepine (approximately 500 ng/L after SAT) and CBZ-10,11-epoxide (12-42 ng/L after SAT) were not effectively removed after SAT. Our results indicated that some metabolites of pharmaceuticals are present at much higher concentration than the original forms in the SAT effluent, and that some metabolites are more persistent during SAT with a relatively short retention time (i.e., 30 days). The study indicated that more attention should be paid to the formation and fate of metabolites in the water quality management of SAT effluent.																	2220-1319					JUN	2017	7	2					142	151		10.2166/wrd.2016.208								WOS:000400139700004

This new concept, addressed as water-reuse risk assessment program (WRAP), has been further developed from hazard analysis of critical control points (HACCP) to illustrate the potential hazards which are the roots of hindering intra-facility water reuse strategies. For industrial sectors applying water reclamation and reuse schemes, it is paramount that the reclaimed water quality stays within the desired quality. The objective of WRAP is to establish a new methodology and knowledge, which will contribute to the sustainable development of industrial water management, and demonstrate its capabilities in identifying and addressing any potential hazards in the selected schemes adoption by the industries. A 'what-if' scenario was simulated using a refinery as a case study to show strategies on how to benefit reclaimed or reuse water based on reliable, applied and scientific research within the process integration area. In conclusion, the WRAP model will facilitate operators, consultants and decision makers to reuse water on a fit-for-use basis whilst avoiding contaminant accumulation in the overall system and production of sub-quality products from inadequate processes after several reuses.																	2220-1319					JUN	2017	7	2					162	174		10.2166/wrd.2016.175								WOS:000400139700006

The results show that there is an appreciable difference between indices values for the same water sample. The results also show that water quality categorization for sampling stations in the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment WQI (CCMEWQI) and British Columbia WQI (BCWQI) was found to be 'marginal' for all sampling stations, except Hammam Boughrara reservoir and Mouillah wadi where it was found to be 'poor'. For the Aquatic Toxicity Index, it was found to be 'totally unsuitable for normal fish life' for all stations and 'suitable only for hardy fish species' for Mouillah wadi and Boughrara reservoir. The results show that this transboundary catchment always needs strategies for more effective pollution control management. Future use of WQIs in this way should prove a valuable tool for environmental planning decision-makers in tracking water quality change.

The spatial patterns of delta N-15 corresponded to the urbanization level, and the nitrogen cycle was associated with the hydrological regime at the basin level. During the high flow season of summer, nonpoint sources from fertilizer/soils and atmospheric deposition constituted the highest proportion of the total nitrogen load. The point sources from sewage/manure, with high ammonium concentrations and high delta N-15 and delta O-18 contents in the form of nitrate, accounted for the largest inputs among all sources during the low flow season of winter. Hot spot areas with heavy point source pollution were identified, and the pollutant transport routes were revealed. Nitrification widely during the warm seasons, with decreased delta O-18 values; whereas great potential for denitrification existed during the low flow seasons of autumn and spring. The study showed that point source reduction could have effects over the short-term; however, long-term efforts to substantially control agriculture nonpoint sources are essential to eutrophication alleviation for the receiving lake, which clarifies the relationship between point and nonpoint source control.

However, the relative contribution of abiotic and biotic factors to riparian denitrification capacity remains elusive. Here we report the,spatioternporal dynamics of potential and unamended soil denitrification rates in 20 wetlands along the Han River, an important water source in central China. We also quantified the abundance Of soil denitrifying microorganisms using nirK and nirS genes. Results showed that soil denitrification rates were significantly different between riparian and reservoir Shoreline wetlands, but not between mountain and lowland wetlands. In addition, soil denitrification rates showed strong seasonality, with higher values in August (summer) and April (spring) but lower values in January (winter). The potential and unamended denitrification rates were positively correlated with edaphic conditions (moisture and carbon concentration), denitrifier abundance, and plant species richness. Path analysis further revealed that edaphic conditions could regulate denitrification rates both directly and indirectly through their effects on denitrifier abundance. Our findings highlight that not only environmental factors, but also biotic factors including denitrifying microorganisms and standing vegetation, play an important role in regulating denitrification rate and N removal capacity in riparian wetlands.

Variation of Bacterial Communities with Water Quality in an Urban Tropical Catchment	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												A major challenge for assessment of water quality in tropical environments is the natural occurrence and potential growth of Fecal Indicator Bacteria (FIB). To gain a better understanding of the relationship between measured levels of FIB and the distribution of sewage-associated bacteria, including potential pathogens, in the tropics this study compared the abundance of FIB (Total coliforms and E. coli) and the Bacteroidales (HF183 marker) with bacterial community structure determined by next-generation amplicon sequencing. Water was sampled twice over 6 months from 18 sites within a tropical urban catchment and reservoir, followed by extraction of DNA from microorganisms, and sequencing targeting the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Multivariate statistical analyses indicated that bacterial community composition (BCC) varied between reservoir and catchment, within catchment land-uses, and with E. coli concentration. B eta regression indicated that the proportion of sequences from sewage-associated taxa (SAT) or, pathogen-like sequences (PLS) were predicted most significantly by measured levels of E. coli(log MPN/100 mL) (chi(2) > 8.7; p < 0.003). In addition, SAT were significantly predicted by log HF183 levels (chi(2)=13.1; p = 0.0003) while PLS were not. Our study suggests that measurements of E. coli concentration could be useful in predicting samples enriched in sewage-associated and pathogen-like bacteria in tropical environments despite the potential for nonconservative behavior.

Predictive Power of Clean Bed Filtration Theory for Fecal Indicator Bacteria Removal in Stormwater Biofilters	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Green infrastructure (also referred to as low impact development, or LID) has the potential to transform urban stormwater runoff from an environmental threat to a valuable water resource. In this paper we focus on the removal of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB, a pollutant responsible for runoff associated inland and coastal beach closures) in stormwater biofilters (a common type of green infrastructure). Drawing on a combination of previously published and new laboratory studies of FIB removal in biofilters, we find that 66% of the variance in FIB removal rates can be explained by clean bed filtration theory (CBFT, 31%), antecedent dry period (14%), study effect (8%), biofilter age (7%), and the presence or absence of shrubs (6%). Our analysis suggests that, with the exception of shrubs, plants affect FIB removal indirectly by changing the infiltration rate, not directly by changing the FIB removal mechanisms or altering filtration rates in ways not already accounted for by CBFT. The analysis presented here represents a significant step forward in our understanding of how physicochemical theories (such as CBFT) can be melded with hydrology, engineering design, and ecology to improve the water quality benefits of green infrastructure.

Although still little is known about the ecological consequences of altered hydromorphology, understanding the factors at play can contribute to sustainable environmental management. In this study we aimed to identify the hydromorphological features controlling a key ecosystem function and the spatial scales where such linkages operate. As hydromorphological and chemical pressures often occur in parallel, we examined the relative importance of hydromorphological and chemical factors as determinants of leaf breakdown. Leaf breakdown assays were investigated at 82 sites of rivers throughout the French territory. Leaf breakdown data were then crossed with data on water quality and with a multi-scale hydro morphological assessment (i.e. upstream catchment, river segment, reach and habitat) when quantitative data were available. Microbial and total leaf breakdown rates exhibited differential responses to both hydromorphological and chemical alterations. Relationships between the chemical quality of the water and leaf breakdown were weak, while hydromorphological integrity explained independently up to 84.2% of leaf breakdown. Hydrological and morphological parameters were the main predictors of microbial leaf breakdown, whereas hydrological parameters had a major effect on total leaf breakdown, particularly at large scales, while morphological parameters were important at smaller scales. Microbial leaf breakdown were best predicted by hydromorphological features defined at the upstream catchment level whereas total leaf breakdown were best predicted by reach and habitat level geomorphic variables. This study demonstrates the use of leaf breakdown in a biomonitoring context and the importance of hydromorphological integrity for the functioning of running water. It provides new insights for environmental decision-makers to identify the management and restoration actions that have to be undertaken including the hydromorphogical features that should be kept in minimal maintenance to support leaf breakdown.

J	Su, Y; Gao, B; Mao, L				Su, Yu; Gao, Bin; Mao, Liang			Concurrent agglomeration and straining govern the transport of C-14-labeled few-layer graphene in saturated porous media	WATER RESEARCH												Deposition of graphene on environmental surfaces will dictate its transport and risks. In this work, the deposition, mobilization, and transport of C-14-labeled few-layer graphene (FLG) in saturated quartz sand were systematically examined. Increasing solution ionic strength (IS) (1-100 mmol/L NaCl) resulted in greater retention of FLG (33-89%) in the sand and more hyper-exponential distribution of FLG along the sand column. Only a small fraction (<= 7.4%) of the retained FLG was remobilized due to perturbation of IS by deionized water. These results indicate that trapping in pore spaces (i.e., physical straining) plays a dominant role in FLG deposition rather than attachment onto the surfaces of the sand. When IS, FLG input concentration, and flow velocity favor particle-particle interaction over particle-collector interaction, concurrent agglomeration within the pores promotes straining. In addition, electrostatic and steric repulsion that derived from the adsorbed organic macromolecules on FLG effectively reduced agglomeration and thereby enhanced transport and release of FLG. Moreover, the recovery of FLG (that deposited at 100 mmol/L NaCl) in the effluent reached 33% after speeding up the deionized water flushing rate. These findings highlight the need for FLG management in view of variations in transport behavior when assessing water quality and associated risks. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Krueger, T				Krueger, Tobias			Bayesian inference of uncertainty in freshwater quality caused by low-resolution monitoring	WATER RESEARCH												Regulatory, low temporal resolution monitoring of freshwater quality does not fully capture the frequency distributions of the requisite parameters, particularly those that are highly skewed and heavy tailed. Hence the summary statistics ultimately compared to environmental standards are uncertain. Quantifying this uncertainty is crucial for robust water quality assessment and possible remediation, but requires strong assumptions. This paper compares three ways to model the missing data needed to fully characterise a frequency distribution in a Bayesian framework using multi-year/multi-location orthophosphate (arithmetic mean standard), dissolved oxygen (DO; 10th percentile standard) and ammonia (90th percentile standard) data from the Tamar catchment in Southwest England. First, fitting an assumed parametric model of the frequency distribution (lognormal or Weibull), there is appreciable uncertainty around the "best" model fit. Second, Bayesian Model Averaging is more general in accommodating cases where the data are ambiguous with regard to the best model, but does not take into account possibly missing data. Third, a quasi-nonparametric multinomial model of the monitoring process that places some weight on those missing data yields wider and heavier-tailed frequency distributions. One-at-a-time sensitivity analysis suggests that the multinomial model for mean orthophosphate is sensitive to the choice of support range and the prior weights given to the missing data. Sensitivity is lower for 10th percentile DO and 90th percentile ammonia. The resultant probability densities of ecological status under the EU Water Framework Directive span several status classes, meaning ecological status is more uncertain than previously acknowledged. For orthophosphate, the regulatory, empirical determination of ecological status is not only overly precise but also biased. (C) 2017 The Author.

This study analyzed the temporal trend (1979-2014) of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations and export from four adjacent coastal basins in south Florida where land and water resources are highly managed through an intricate canal network. The method of integrated seasonal-trend decomposition using LOESS (LOcally weighted regrESSion) was employed for trend detection. The results indicated that long-term trends in TN and TP concentrations (increasing/decreasing) varied with basins and nutrient species, reflecting the influence of basin specific land and water management practices. These long-term trends were intervened by short-term highs driven by high rainfall and discharges and lows associated with regional droughts. Seasonal variations in TP were more apparent than for TN. Nutrient export exhibited a chemostatic behavior for TN from all the basins, largely due to the biogenic nature of organic N associated with the ubiquity of organic materials in the managed canal network. Varying degrees of chemodynamic export was present for TP, reflecting complex biogeochemical responses to the legacy of long-term fertilization, low soil P holding capacity, and intensive stormwater management. The anthropogenic and hydro-climatic influences on nutrient concentration and export behavior had great implications in nutrient loading abatement strategies for aquatic ecosystem restoration of the downstream receiving waterbody.

With a global focus, the pertinent practical, theoretical and social aspects of RWH are reviewed in order to ascertain the state of the art. Avenues for future research are also identified. A major finding is that the degree of RWH systems implementation and the technology selection are strongly influenced by economic constraints and local regulations. Moreover, despite design protocols having been set up in many countries, recommendations are still often organized only with the objective of conserving water without considering other potential benefits associated with the multiple-purpose nature of RWH. It is suggested that future work on RWH addresses three priority challenges. Firstly, more empirical data on system operation is needed to allow improved modelling by taking into account multiple objectives of RWH systems. Secondly, maintenance aspects and how they may impact the quality of collected rainwater should be explored in the future as a way to increase confidence on rainwater use. Finally, research should be devoted to the understanding of how institutional and socio-political support can be best targeted to improve system efficacy and community acceptance.

Potential of floating production for delta and coastal cities	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												The disruption of nutrient cycles caused by human activities such as agriculture and burning fossil fuels is impacting ecosystem services on global and local scales. The increasing concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere contributes to rising global temperatures and ocean acidification, whereas the accumulation of nutrients in water systems is leading to degradation of water quality and biodiversity. City populations play a major role in carbon dioxide and nutrient emissions as 'end consumers' of resources. The current challenge towards more resource-efficient cities is to transform urban metabolism from linear to cyclical. Discharged nutrients and carbon dioxide can be used as input for algae, which fixate carbon very efficiently into energetic storage compounds as starch or lipids. However, cities often lack the space to implement large-scale algae production. This article evaluates the potential of reusing nutrients and carbon dioxide to produce algae, food and biofuel on water nearby coastal and delta cities. First, nutrients and carbon dioxide discharge is estimated and two scenarios are developed. From the cities nutrient production, the potential algal yield is evaluated and translated into feed, food and oil yields. Two delta cities are chosen as case studies: Rotterdam and Metro Manila. The conclusion of this article is that Floating Production can help cities increasing their resilience in the field of food and energy. Floating Production can also contribute to a solution for global land shortage. The combination of food and energy production with floating urban development provides a climate-proof urban expansion in delta and coastal areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Detailed NMR investigation of cyclodextrin-perfluorinated surfactant interactions in aqueous media	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS												Perfluorochemicals (PFCs) are contaminants of serious concern because of their toxicological properties, widespread presence in drinking water sources, and incredible stability in the environment. To assess the potential application of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-cyclodextrins for PFC remediation, we investigated their complexation with linear fluorinated carboxylic acids, sulfonates, and a sulfonamide with carbon backbones ranging from C4-C9. F-19 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy studies demonstrated beta-CD formed the strongest complexes with these PFCs. The polar head group had a modest influence, but for PFCs with backbones longer than six carbons, strong association constants are observed for 1:1 (K-1:1 similar to 10(5) M-1) and 2:1 (K-2:1 similar to 10(3) M-1) beta-CD:PFC complexes. Excess beta-CD can be used to complex 99.5% of the longer chain PFCs. Competition studies with adamantane-carboxylic acid and phenol confirmed the nature and persistence of the beta-CD:PFC complex. Detailed analyses of the individual NMR chemical shifts and Job plots indicate the favored positions of the beta-CD along the PFC chain. Solution pH, ionic strength, and the presence of humic acid have modest influence on the 13-CD:PFC complexes. The strong encapsulation of PFCs by (beta-CD under a variety of water quality conditions demonstrates the tremendous potential of CD-based materials for the environmental remediation of PFCs.

Application of Moringa Oleifera seed extract to treat coffee fermentation wastewater	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS												Wastewater generated from wet processing of coffee cherries degrades stream water quality downstream of processing mills and impacts human health. The widespread popularity of coffee as an export makes this a global problem, although the immediate impact is local. Approximately 40% of all coffee around the world is wet processed, producing wastewater rich in organic nutrients that can be hazardous to aquatic systems. Moringa Oleifera Seed Extract (MOSE) offers promise as a local and affordable "appropriate" coagulation technology for aiding in the treatment of coffee wastewater. Field research was conducted at the Kauai Coffee Company to investigate the application of MOSE to treat coffee fermentation wastewater (CFW). Coagulation tests were conducted at five pH CFW levels (3-7) and MOSE doses (0-4 g/L). After settling, TSS, COD, nitrate, nitrite, total nitrogen, and pH of supernatant from each test were measured. MOSE reduced TSS, COD, nitrate, and nitrite in CFW to varying degrees dependent on pH and dose applied. TSS removal ranged from 8% to 54%. Insoluble COD removal ranged from 26% to 100% and total COD removal ranged from 1% to 25%. Nitrate and nitrite reduction ranged from 20% to 100%. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Comparison of three corrosion inhibitors in simulated partial lead service line replacements	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS												Partial lead service line replacements (PLSLR) were simulated using five recirculating pipe loops treated with either zinc orthophosphate (1 mg/L as P), orthophosphate (1 mg/L as P) or sodium silicate (10 mg/L). Two pipe loops served as "inhibitor-free" (Pb-Cu) and "galvanic free" (Pb-PVC) controls. Changes in water quality (CSMR [0.2 or 1], conductivity[approximate to 330 mu S/cm or approximate to 560 mu S/cm], chlorine [1.4mg/L]) were not observed to provide a significant impact on lead or copper release, although galvanic corrosion was shown to be a driving factor. Generally, both orthophosphate and zinc orthophosphate provided better corrosion control for both total and dissolved lead (30 min, 6 h, 65 h) and copper (30 min, 6 h), when compared to either the inhibitor-free control or the sodium silicate treated system. This work highlights the importance of understanding the complex interplay of corrosion inhibitors on particulate and dissolved species when considering both lead and copper. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Path to Impact for Autonomous Field Deployable Chemical Sensors: A Case Study of in Situ Nitrite Sensors	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Natural freshwater systems have been severely affected by excess loading of macronutrients (e.g., nitrogen and phosphorus) from fertilizers, fossil fuels, and human and livestock waste. In the USA, impacts to drinking water quality, biogeochemical cycles, and aquatic ecosystems are estimated to cost US$210 billion annually: Field-deployable nutrient sensors (FDS) offer potential to support research and resource management efforts by acquiring higher resolution data than are currently supported by expensive conventional sampling methods. Following nearly 40 years of research and development, FDS instruments are now starting to penetrate commercial markets. However, instrument uncertainty factors (high cost, reliability, accuracy, and precision) are key drivers impeding the uptake of FDS by the majority of users. Using nitrite sensors as a case study, we review the trends, opportunities, and challenges in producing and implementing FDS from a perspective of innovation and impact. We characterize the user community and consumer needs, identify trends in research roaches, tabulate state-of-the-art examples and specifications, and, discuss data life, cycle considerations. With further development of FDS through prototyping and testing in real-world applications, these tools can deliver information for protecting and restoring natural waters, enhancing process control for industrial operations and water treatment, and providing novel research insights.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				MAY 2	2017	51	9					4755	4771		10.1021/acs.est.6b06171								WOS:000400723200004	28332819

Occurrence and In Vitro Bioactivity of Estrogen, Androgen, and Glucocorticoid Compounds in a Nationwide Screen of United States Stream Waters	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												In vitro bioassays are sensitive, effect-based tools used to quantitatively screen for chemicals with nuclear receptor activity in environmental samples. We measured in vitro estrogen (ER), androgen (AR), and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activity, along with a broad suite of chemical analytes, in streamwater from 35 well-characterized sites (3 reference and 32 impacted) across 24 states and Puerto Rico. ER agonism was the most frequently detected with nearly all sites (34/35) displaying activity (range, 0.054(-1)16 ng E2Eq L-1). There was a strong linear relationship (r2 = 0.917) between in vitro ER activity and concentrations of steroidal estrogens after correcting for the in vitro potency of each compound. AR agonism was detected in 5/35 samples (range, 1.6-4.8 ng DHTEq L-1) but concentrations of androgenic compounds were largely unable to account for the in vitro activity. Similarly, GR agonism was detected in 9/35 samples (range, 6.0-43 ng DexEq L-1); however, none of the recognized GR-active compounds on the target-chemical analyte list were detected. The utility of in vitro assays in water quality monitoring was evident from both the quantitative agreement between ER activity and estrogen concentrations, as well as the detection of AR and GR activity for which there were limited or no corresponding target-chemical detections to explain the bioactivity. Incorporation of in vitro bioassays as complements to chemical analyses in standard water quality monitoring efforts would allow for more complete assessment of the chemical mixtures present in many surface waters.

Use of Multiple Linear Regression Models for Setting Water Quality Criteria for Copper: A Complementary Approach to the Biotic Ligand Model	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Biotic Ligand Models (BLMs) for metals are widely applied in ecological risk assessments and in the development of regulatory water quality guidelines in Europe, and in 2007 the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) recommended BLM-based water quality criteria (WQC) for Cu in freshwater. However, to-date, few states have adopted BLM-based Cu criteria into their water quality standards on a state-wide basis, which appears to be due to the perception that the BLM is too complicated or requires too many input variables. Using the mechanistic BLM framework to first identify key water chemistry parameters that influence Cu bioavailability, namely dissolved organic carbon (DOC), pH, and hardness, we developed Cu criteria using the same basic methodology used by the USEPA to derive hardness-based criteria but with the addition of DOC and pH. As an initial proof of concept, we developed stepwise multiple linear regression (MLR) models for species that have been tested over wide ranges of DOC, pH, and hardness conditions. These models predicted acute Cu toxicity values that were within a factor of +/- 2 in 77% to 97% of tests (5 species had adequate data) and chronic Cu toxicity values that were within a factor of +/- 2 in 92% of tests (1 species had adequate data). This level of accuracy is comparable to the BLM. Following USEPA guidelines for WQC development, the species data were then combined to develop a linear model with pooled slopes for each independent parameter (i.e., DOC, pH, and hardness) and species-specific intercepts using Analysis of Covariance. The pooled MLR and BLM models predicted species-specific toxicity with similar precision; adjusted R2 and R2 values ranged from 0.56 to 0.86 and 0.66-0.85, respectively. Graphical exploration of relationships between predicted and observed toxicity, residuals and observed toxicity, and residuals and concentrations of key input parameters revealed many similarities and a few key distinctions between the performances of the two models. The pooled MLR model was then applied to the species sensitivity distribution to derive acute and chronic criteria equations similar in form to the USEPAs current hardness-based criteria equations but with DOC, pH, and hardness as the independent variables. Overall, the MLR is less responsive to DOC than the BLM across a range of hardness and pH conditions but more responsive to hardness than the BLM. Additionally, at low and intermediate hardness, the MLR model is less responsive than the BLM to pH, but the two models respond comparably at high hardness. The net effect of these different response profiles is that under many typical water quality conditions, MLR- and BLM-based criteria are quite comparable. Indeed, conditions where the two models differ most (high pH/low hardness and low pH/high hardness) are relatively rare in natural aquatic systems. We suggest that this MLR-based approach, which includes the mechanistic foundation of the BLM but is also consistent with widely accepted hardness-dependent WQC in terms of development and form, may facilitate adoption of updated state-wide Cu criteria that more accurately account for the parameters influencing Cu bioavailability than current hardness-based criteria.

J	He, L; Xu, ZD; Fan, X; Li, J; Lu, HW				He, Li; Xu, Zongda; Fan, Xing; Li, Jing; Lu, Hongwei			Meta-Modeling-Based Groundwater Remediation Optimization under Flexibility in Environmental Standard	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												This study develops a meta-modeling based mathematical programming approach with flexibility in environmental standards. It integrates numerical simulation, meta-modeling analysis, and fuzzy programming within a general framework. A set of models between remediation strategies and remediation performance can well guarantee the mitigation in computational efforts in the simulation and optimization process. In order to prevent the occurrence of over-optimistic and pessimistic optimization strategies, a high satisfaction level resulting from the implementation of a flexible standard can indicate the degree to which the environmental standard is satisfied. The proposed approach is applied to a naphthalene-contaminated site in China. Results show that a longer remediation period corresponds to a lower total pumping rate and a stringent risk standard implies a high total pumping rate. The wells located near or in the down-gradient direction to the contaminant sources have the most significant efficiency among all of remediation schemes.																	1061-4303	1554-7531				MAY 1	2017	89	5					456	465		10.2175/106143017X14839994523541								WOS:000411925000008	28442006

Under optimized analytical conditions, chromatographic separation was performed in 3 min, in isocratic mode, using an Acquity UHPLC C18 column and a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile, water, and formic acid (60:40:0.1, v/v/v) at a flow rate of 0.4 mL min 1. Electrospray ionization tandem interface was employed prior to mass spectrometric detection. Good linearity (R-2 >= 0.9987) and low limits of detection (0.04-0.4 ng L-1) and quantification (0.1-1.2 ng L-1) were obtained. The extraction recoveries ranged from 98 +/- 1% to 100 +/- 1% and the relative standard deviations were less than 1.53%. The matrix effect was between 9812 and 100 +/- 1%. The obtained results clearly demonstrate that the developed method is accurate and highly sensitive for the simultaneous determination of N-nitroso-n-propylamine, Nnitrosomorpholine, N-nitrosomethylethylamine and N-nitrosodimethylamine at ultra-trace levels (ng L-1) in different types of water samples. Therefore, this method can be a useful analytical tool for future toxicological, water quality surveillance studies and for the investigation of drinking water quality.

A Romanian case study	PROCESS SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION					8th International Conference on Environmental Engineering and Management (ICEEM)	SEP 09-12, 2015	Iasi, ROMANIA	Gheorghe Asachi Tech Univ Iasi, Dept Environm Engn & Management				The paper proposes discussions of some concrete datasets resulted for three solutions of wastewaters management systems applied in case of a Romanian petroleum chemical company. These management options, differing especially in type (centralized or decentralized system) and wastewaters treatment system, were emphasized, mainly by real datasets on treatment performance, polluting species removals, risk of some residuals in treated effluents and natural watercourse nearby, but also environmental impact assessment, using the alternative methodology of global pollution index (I*(Gp)). Interpreting datasets based on in-time analyzed physical-chemical quality indicators and river characteristics, it was estimated the standard quality classification of receiving watercourse as 'medium' (water quality indices, WQI = 55.58 - 67.47), affected more or less by treated effluents discharged in it. The environmental risks of some selected residuals in treated effluents and natural aquatic receptor were assessed by the risk quotient (RQ) which appreciated the risk of residuals toward aquatic life as no to low-medium level, with few exceptions. The impact assessment results conclude an admissible pollution status of natural water receptor due to company wastewaters mechanical-chemical-biological treatment plant activities, in decentralized (I*(Gp) = 1.73) and centralized (I*(Gp) =1.83) system, but generating discomfort effects to aquatic life due to only mechanical-chemical treatment plant operating in decentralized system (I*(Gp) =2.205). Direct discharge of un-treated industrial wastewaters had been interdicted. These real results underline that decentralized systems are reliable, qualitatively efficient and costly effective, offering long-term solution, and that all wastewaters management strategies of petroleum chemical company had been adapted to specific on-site functioning situations.

Lohan)	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The effect of two different water sources (treated waste water and lake water) used for irrigation on the soil geochemical properties and the fruit quality parameters of the Lohan guava were studied. The fruits' physical attributes, physicochemical attributes, nutritional attributes, mineral content as well as consumers' acceptance were evaluated. The properties of the different water sources and their effect, on both the soil and the quality of the fruits, were evaluated. Analysis of the irrigation water revealed that treated waste water was of acceptable quality with reference to irrigation water quality guidelines, while the lake water used for irrigation fell short in several aspects. The different water sources used for irrigation in the farms affected the soil geochemical properties significantly. The quality of guavas harvested from the farms that were irrigated with different water sources was significantly different. Irrigation water qualities were observed to have positive effects on the quality of the fruits and consumers' acceptance as observed from the results of quality analysis and the consumers' acceptance test.

It analyses the temporal and spatial distributions and utilisation of underground water according to the main components and corresponding water quality standards for underground water. Thereby, it can provide a scientific basis for the development, utilisation, planning, and management of groundwater resources. Set pair analysis (SPA), based on the improved five-element connectivity degree, was used in this research to establish a comprehensive evaluation model of water quality, so as to evaluate the groundwater quality in XuChang, Henan Province, China. Meanwhile, fuzzy evaluation was also used to measure groundwater quality. As demonstrated in the research results, SPA is proven to be convenient and useful with objective and stable results, it therefore is an effective approach with which to evaluate groundwater quality. In addition, the results obtained using SPA matched those from fuzzy comprehensive evaluation; it was concluded, based on the analysis, that the groundwater in XuChang was severely polluted. The groundwater quality at the observation points located in the lower reaches is poorer than that of the upper reaches; hazardous substances permeate underground to pollute shallow groundwater through decomposition and loss due to weathering and rainfall.																	1606-9749					MAY	2017	17	3					632	642		10.2166/ws.2016.135								WOS:000401654600002

However, little information exists on the effects of cistern materials and construction methods on water quality. This study assessed the quality of rainwater and harvested rainwater stored in different types of cisterns, using multivariate statistical analysis techniques. The harvesting system consisted of ditches underground to direct the water stream collected by catchments through pipes to the two-stage grit chambers, the rainwater runoff ultimately being fed into the cisterns. Water samples were collected monthly over 6 months from October 2008 to April 2009. The harvested rainwater generally did not meet drinking water standards due to severe bacterial contamination. To determine the factors affecting water quality, principal components and factor analysis divided the water's physicochemical composition into four principal components: ions, suspended pollutants, reducing substances, and acidity-alkalinity, which collectively accounted for 80.4% of the total variance. Cluster analysis confirmed the results. It was determined that pollutants in harvested rainwater were mainly derived from the catchments, surrounding fields, and local atmosphere. Furthermore, factor scores ranked water quality to select the optimum material and construction method. It was concluded that cement was superior to stabilized soil for rainwater storage. However, considering water quality, cost, and environmental friendliness the stabilized soil cistern using the stiff construction method was worthy of consideration.

In-stream detection of waterborne priority pollutants, and applications in drinking water contaminant warning systems	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												Advancements in real-time water monitoring technologies permit rapid detection of in-stream, inpipe water quality, and alert of threats from waste loads. Legislation mandating the establishment of water resources monitoring, presence of hazardous contaminants in effluents, and perception of the vulnerability of the water distribution system to attacks, have spurred technical and economic interest. Alternatively to traditional analyzers, chemosensors operate according to physical principles, without sample collection (online), and are capable of supplying parameter values continuously and in real-time. This review paper contains a comprehensive survey of existing and expected online monitoring technologies for measurement/detection of pollutants in water. The state-of-the-art in online water monitoring and contaminant warning systems is presented. Application examples are reported. Monitoring costs will become a lesser part of a water utility budget due to the fact that automation and technological simplification will abate human cost factors, and reduce the complexity of laboratory procedures.																	1606-9749					MAY	2017	17	3					707	725		10.2166/ws.2016.168								WOS:000401654600009

Removal of aluminium and iron from surface water by conventional water treatment	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												Detailed source water monitoring showed large variations in the total concentrations of aluminium and iron in the Vaal Dam, South Africa, which were highlighted as a specific concern for one of the largest drinking water treatment plants in South Africa. This study aimed to better understand the presence of these metals in the source water, removal of these metals through the conventional treatment process, and final water quality trends, for the period 2008 to 2014. Aluminium and iron concentrations were highly variable and showed significant influence on colour and turbidity in source water. Sedimentation performed well, and removed over 70% of the metal concentration from the raw water. Filtration removed 15% of the remaining aluminium and iron concentrations. The pH and turbidity of the final water had minor effects on the metal concentration in the final water. The conventional treatment process was shown to be capable of removing aluminium and iron from the source water as both were within water quality limits in the final water. This study highlighted the importance of source water quality monitoring and treatment plant efficacy in evaluating whether the current treatment technology is appropriate for current and future challenges.																	1606-9749					MAY	2017	17	3					733	744		10.2166/ws.2016.170								WOS:000401654600011

Many factors affect the delivery of water through distribution networks. Some of these factors are relevant to water quality, quantity and the condition of the infrastructure itself. The deterioration of water quality in the WDN leads to failure at the water quality level, which can be critical because it is closest to the point of delivery and there are virtually no safety barriers before consumption. Accordingly, developing a powerful monitoring system that takes into consideration water demand distribution, the vulnerability of the distribution system and the sensitivity of the population to the deterioration of water quality can be very beneficial and, more importantly, could save lives if there was any deterioration of water quality due to operational failure or cross-contamination events. In this paper, a framework for a water quality monitoring system that considers water demand distribution, the vulnerability of the system and the sensitivity of the population using fuzzy synthetic evaluation and optimization algorithms is developed. The proposed approach has been applied to develop a monitoring system for a real WDN in Saudi Arabia.																	1606-9749					MAY	2017	17	3					811	824		10.2166/ws.2016.174								WOS:000401654600019						
J	Parsaie, A; Haghiabi, AH				Parsaie, Abbas; Haghiabi, Amir Hamzeh			Numerical routing of tracer concentrations in rivers with stagnant zones	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												Modeling pollution transmission in rivers is an important subject in environmental engineering studies. Numerical approaches to modeling pollution transmission in rivers are useful tools for managing the water quality. The advection-dispersion equation is the governing equation in the transport of pollution in rivers. Recently, due to advances in fractional calculus in engineering modeling, the simulation of pollution transmission in rivers has been improved using the fractional derivative approach. In this study, by solving the fractional advection-dispersion equation (FRADE), a numerical model was developed for the simulation of pollution transmission in rivers with stagnant zones. To this purpose, both terms of the FRADE equation (advection and fractional dispersion) were discretized separately and the results were connected using a time-splitting technique. The analytical solution of a modified advection-dispersion equation (MADE) model and observed data from the Severn River in the UK were used to demonstrate the model capabilities. Results indicated that there is a good agreement between observed data, the analytical solution of the MADE model, and the results of the developed numerical model. The developed numerical model can accurately simulate the long-tailed dispersion processes in a natural river.

We manufactured filter disks with varied clay, burn-out material, burn-out material sieved with different mesh sizes, and burn-out material to clay ratios and calculated filter characteristics, including porosity, density, shrinkage, and flow rate. Water was run through filters daily for 4 weeks, and flow rate and Escherichia coli reduction, as measured by log reduction value (LRV), were tested twice weekly. Our results suggest: (1) the first and last LRV test results do not correlate strongly (R-2 = 0.38, p < 0.010); (2) there is not a strong association between flow rate and first, average, or last LRV results (R-2 = 0.17, p = 0.090; R-2 = 0.30, p = 0.020; R-2 = 0.24, p = 0.040); and (3) first and average LRV are associated with burn-out material (R-2 = 0.68, p < 0.001; R-2 = 0.60, p < 0.001), and last LRV is associated with burn-out material and mesh size (R-2 = 0.54, p < 0.050). Recommendations for filter factories, are to: (1) verify filtration efficacy with repeated bacteria reduction tests when materials, processing, or filter characteristics vary; (2) carefully control production variables; and (3) continue flow rate testing each filter to evaluate within and across batch production consistency.																	1606-9749					MAY	2017	17	3					859	869		10.2166/ws.2016.176								WOS:000401654600024						
J	Gunkel, M; Pawlowsky-Reusing, E				Gunkel, M.; Pawlowsky-Reusing, E.			Field campaign on sediment transport behaviour in a pressure main from pumping station to wastewater treatment plant in Berlin	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												As part of the project KURAS, the Berliner Wasserbetriebe realized a field campaign in 2015 in order to increase the process knowledge regarding the behaviour of transported sediment in the pressure main leading from the pumpstation to the wastewater treatment plant. The field campaign was conducted because of a lack of knowledge about the general condition of the pressure main due to its bad accessibility and the suspicion of deposits caused by hydraulic underload. The practical evidence of the sediment transport performance of this part of the sewer system, dependent on different load cases, should present a basis for further analysis, for example regarding flushing measures. A positive side-effect of the investigation was the description of the amount of pollutants caused by different weather conditions in combined sewer systems and the alterations of the sewage composition due to biogenic processes during transport. The concept included the parallel sampling of the inflow at the pumpstation and the outflow at the end of the pressure main during different weather conditions. By calculating the inflow to the pressure main, as well as its outflow at different flow conditions, it was possible to draw conclusions in regard to the transport behaviour of sediment and the bioprocesses within an 8.5 km section of the pressure main. The results show clearly that the effects of sedimentation and remobilization depend on the flow conditions. The balance of the total suspended solids (TSS) load during daily variations in dry weather shows that the remobilization effect during the run-off peak is not able to compensate for the period of sedimentation happening during the low flow at night. Based on the data for dry weather, an average of 238 kg of TSS deposits in the pressure main remains per day. The remobilization of sediment occurs only due to the abruptly increased delivery rates caused by precipitation events. These high pollution loads lead to a sudden strain at the wastewater treatment plant. It was found that the sediment transport behaviour is characterized by sedimentation up to a flow velocity of 0.35 m/s, while remobilization effects occur above 0.5 m/s. The assumption of bad sediment transport performance in the pressure main was confirmed. Therefore, the results can be used as a basis for further analysis, for example regarding periodical flushing as a means of cleaning the pressure main. The findings, especially regarding the methods and processes, are transferable and can be applied to other pressure mains in combined sewer systems. Besides the outlined evaluation of the sediment transport behaviour of the pressure main, the collected data were used in the project to calibrate a sewer system model, including a water quality model for the catchment area, and as a contribution towards an early physically based sediment transport modelling in InfoWorks CS.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				MAY	2017	75	9					2025	2033		10.2166/wst.2017.044								WOS:000401150500004	28498115

However, the use of filter-feeding aquatic animals to control eutrophic water bodies remains debatable. As such, more work is needed to understand the combined effects of submerged macrophytes and aquatic animals on the restoration of eutrophic water bodies. In this study, we first conducted a mesocosm experiment to evaluate the combined effects of submerged macrophytes and aquatic animals on water body restoration, and then applied these results in the field. We found that silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) deteriorated water quality by increasing nutrient and total suspended solid concentrations, and decreased the biomass of submerged macrophytes. However, triangle sail mussels (Hyriopsis cumingii) promoted the establishment of a clear-water state by grazing on phytoplankton and detritus, and stimulating submerged macrophyte growth. In practical ecological engineering, we suggest that silver carp can be used at low density (20 g/m(3)) as a biomanipulation tool, despite their potential to deteriorate water quality. Furthermore, stocking mussels in nets at a biomass of 150 g/m3 can be effectively used to restore eutrophicated water bodies. Finally, Hydrilla verticillata and Potamogeton malaianus, in combination with filter-feeding aquatic animals, are suitable submerged macrophyte species for the restoration of eutrophicated lakes.

ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												While phosphorus (P) is a vital element in freshwater systems, excessive P loads will induce eutrophication. Large inputs of various pollutants, including P, to rivers in semi-arid regions result in complex environmental problems. In this study, we investigate dissolved oxygen (DO), ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3), chemical oxygen demand (CODcr), soluble reactive P (SRP) in surface water and pore water, and sediment P in the Niuwei River, within the Hai River Basin. From our results we developed and tested a theory for P release in semi-arid regions driven by DO. The results show that NH3 and CODcr can cause variations in DO in surface water. The presence of pollutants at high concentrations caused seasonal hypoxia. Hypoxic river water induced adsorption and hydrolysis of NaOH-Pi and labile organic P (L-Po), which then resulted in increased SRP concentrations in pore water and surface water. Overall, our results illustrate that NH3 and CODcr may be important for P adsorption and desorption and for management of water quality problems in rivers in semi-arid regions.

Performance of a hybrid pilot-scale constructed wetland system for treating oil sands process-affected water from the Athabasca oil sands	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Mining leases in the Athabasca oil sands (AOS; near Ft. McMurray, Canada) produce large volumes of oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) that contain potentially problematic constituents requiring treatment prior to surface water discharge into receiving aquatic systems. The aim of this research was to identify constituents of concern (COCs) in OSPW sourced from an AOS external tailings facility and design a hybrid pilot-scale constructed wetland treatment systems (CWTS) to decrease concentrations of COCs and subsequently mitigate risks. COCs were identified based on comparisons to ambient water quality thresholds for the protection of aquatic life (i.e. Canadian Environmental Quality Guidelines [CEQGs], Alberta Environment Water Quality Guidelines [Alberta WQGs], and United States Environmental Protection Agency Water Quality Criteria [USEPA WQC]) and toxicity endpoints. Performance of the hybrid pilot-scale CWTS was evaluated by rate and extent of COC removal and change in toxicity as measured by an aquatic invertebrate Ceriodaphnia dubia. Following characterization of OSPW, specific COCs were identified as: naphthenic acids (NAs), oil and grease (O/G), metals/metalloids (Al, B, Cu, Ni, Se, and Zn), chloride, and total suspended solids (TSS). A hybrid pilot-scale CWTS was designed to promote treatment processes to alter (transfer and transform) COCs using sequential reducing and oxidizing wetland reactors and a solar photocatalytic treatment reactor using fixed film titanium dioxide (TiO2). Performance criteria were achieved as the CWTS decreased concentrations of NM, O/G, and metals below protective thresholds and decreased toxicity to C. dubia. Results from this study provide proof-of-concept data to inform hybrid passive or semi-passive treatment approaches (i.e. constructed wetlands) that could be used to mitigate COCs contained in OSPWs.

It ultimately affects the water quality of large shallow lakes through sediment resuspension and nutrient diffusion. Impacts of the wind field, hence needed to be studied, especially; (1) the impacts of wind field on the vertical profile, and (2) on the generation of the reverse flow field at large shallow wind exposed lakes. The present study investigated the wind field impacts on the water flow field at different water depths in the large shallow Taihu Lake by using precise wind and velocity profile data acquired at Dongtaihu bay. The results revealed that wind speed and direction have dominant effects on water movement in the large shallow lake. High frequency of wind direction generates more frequent reverse flow field at each layer of the water column. The dominant wind directions found with a high probability of Contribution in the generation of reverse flows at the surface (42.4%), upper middle (38.4%) and bottom (51.5%) layers with large-scale shear of the flow field. Similarly, probability statistics showed that dominant wind speeds have more contributions in the generation of compensation currents at the lower middle (42.6%) layer of the vertical water profile with medium scale shear of the flow field. High wind speeds play a major role in the generation of large flows at all layers of flow profile, but long-term steady wind speeds with consistent wind direction generate stable current in the large shallow lake which reduce the diffusion and nutrient resuspension in the large shallow Taihu Lake. Results of the current study provide a novel ground to study sediment/nutrient resuspension, transport and water quality scenarios in large shallow wind exposed lakes while considering reverse flow field in shallow waters.

Effects of submerged zone, media aging, and antecedent dry period on the performance of biochar-amended biofilters in removing fecal indicators and nutrients from natural stormwater	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Biochar has demonstrated promising performance as an amendment to biofilter soil media in removing fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) from simulated stormwater. However, there is no study that investigates its efficacy in treating natural stormwater runoff. Additional information, including the effects of antecedent dry period, microbial biofilm, and presence of a saturation zone on the performance of biochar-augmented biofilters are needed to inform their field implementation. This study uses laboratory column experiments to monitor FIB (enterococci and Escherichia coli) and nutrient removal capacity of biochar-amended biofilters for 140 days using natural stormwater. Our study also investigates the effects of antecedent dry days (ADD) and the presence of a saturation zone (SZ) on the performance of lab-scale biochar-amended biofilters. The results suggest insignificant influence of the ADD and SZ on FIB removal performance, however biofilters with a SZ perform significantly better in removing nitrate-nitrogen compared to those without a SZ. In addition, it appears that the presence of biofilm augments nutrient removal capacity but reduces FIB removal capacity. Our observations indicate that biochar-amended biofilters are able to treat (to comply with recreational water quality standard for FIB) urban stormwater runoff for the duration of the experiment. Nitrate- and ammonium-nitrogen removal in the biologically aged biofilters is found to be 50-60% while the total dissolved phosphorus and the organic nitrogen removal is 20-30%.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in Australian stormwater biofilters	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Stormwater biofilters are important tools for managing runoff in urban watersheds. To the authors' knowledge, there have been no accounts examining the presence of mycorrhizal fungi in biofilters. This plant-fungi relationship is an important interaction in most terrestrial ecosystems, playing a role in nutrient dynamics, water cycling, and soil organic matter decomposition. The presence of mycorrhiza in biofilters could have implications for nutrient and metal uptake in plants, and thus enhance removal of target pollutants. Additionally, the establishment, growth, and survivability of plants could be enhanced when roots are colonized by mycorrhizae. The aim of this study was to determine the extent of colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in biofilters of varying ages in three Australian cities: Melbourne, Perth, and Sydney. The 32 biofilters surveyed supported 56 plant species, with dominant species belonging to the Cyperaceae, Iridaceae, Juncaceae, Onagraceae, Poaceae, and Xanthorrhoeaceae families. Mycorrhizal associations were identified from 4 of the 11 most dominant plant species from 9 different biofilters, but relatively low percentages of mycorrhizal colonization (3-25% colonization) were observed in biofilter plant roots. Mycorrhizal colonization was not related to biofilter age. These results demonstrate that mycorrhizal fungi colonize plant roots growing in biofilters. These findings provide useful evidence of the presence of mycorrhizal fungi in stormwater biofilters that support subsequent investigation into their roles in these systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Potential of using immobilizing agents in aided phytostabilization on simulated contamination of soil with lead	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Lead (Pb) is one of the key heavy metals which have a significant influence on the individual components of the natural environment. A glasshouse pot experiment was designed to evaluate the potential use of different amendments as immobilizing agents in the aided phytostabilization of Pb-contaminated soil, using Lolium perenne L The research aimed to determine the influence of Pb in doses of 0, 100, 200, 400 and 800 mg/kg of soil, as well as diatomite, chalcedonite, dolomite, limestone, and activated carbon amendments on the content of trace elements in the above-ground parts and roots of L. perenne. The study utilised analysis of variance (ANOVA), principal component analysis (PCA) and Factor Analysis (FA). The content of trace elements in plants, pseudo-total and extracted by 0.01 M CaCl2, were determined using the method of spectrophotometry. All of the investigated element contents in the tested parts of L perenne were significantly different in the case of applying reactive amendments to the soil, as well as increasing concentrations of Pb. The greatest average above-ground biomass was observed when diatomite and chalcedonite were amended into the soil. Activated carbon, limestone and chalcedonite caused significant increases of Pb concentrations in the roots. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study presents results from one of the best-documented long-term monitoring projects in Poland, based on three periods of electrofishing: 1986-88 (TI),1996-98 (T2) and 2011-12 (T3). After decades of severe point-source pollution, water quality has been improving since the early 1990s. However, the recovery of fish assemblages was recorded with a considerable delay, i.e. not in T2 but in T3. Species richness in T3 increased by >= 50% in relation to T2. The recovery process proceeded at a different pace in the upper (section X), middle (section Y) and lower (section Z) river courses. The good status recorded in X in T3 was qualitatively different from the good status observed in TI as migratory and/or lithophilic species were less common. Section X, with relatively clean tributaries, was isolated from the rest of the Warta system by the Jeziorsko Reservoir constructed between X and Y in 1986 (without fish passage). Ichthyofauna in Y was not only in the poorest condition but was also recovering very slowly because of migration barriers and polluted tributaries, resulting in a severe shortage of sources of recolonizers. The quickest positive changes were recorded in Z because of the beneficial role played by certain less degraded tributaries and the direct connection to the recipient Odra River. Significant increases in biomass were recorded in Z for both limnophilic and rheophilic species; the former may be linked to zones of stagnant water existing between groynes and the latter to fast-flowing water near groyne heads.

Life Cycle Assessment of a Commercial-Scale Freshwater Aquaponic System	ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE												Life cycle assessment was used to evaluate environmental impacts of simultaneous fish and plant production through the aquaculture practice of aquaponics. In aquaponics, hydroponic plant production replaces the conventional water treatment processes of microbial nitrification and water exchanges required in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) to maintain water quality. The system expansion method was used to assess potential avoided burdens from coproduction of recovered solids, plant production, and water treatment. Results indicated that electricity and feed were the main contributing factors to environmental impact. Impact assessment results were highly sensitive to changes in electricity inputs, suggesting that a small reduction in electricity could contribute to a correspondingly large change in the environmental impact. Avoided burdens associated with coproducts contributed to a moderate reduction in environmental impact compared to reducing total electricity inputs or sourcing electricity from renewable sources. Of the coproducts considered, avoided water treatment contributed greatest to reductions in environmental impact due to reductions in energy use, water use, and eutrophication potential. The large reduction in water use suggests that plant production can contribute to increased recirculation rates and further reduce water inputs associated with aquaculture. Aquaponics, similar to other RASs, essentially eliminates local ecological impacts at the cost of high energy use and the addition of industrial fish feeds. Development of sustainable land-based aquaculture will encompass many production systems, including aquaponics; however, all systems will benefit from improved energy efficiency, increased accessibility to renewable energy sources, and development of sustainable fish feeds.																	1092-8758	1557-9018				MAY	2017	34	5					299	311		10.1089/ees.2015.0510								WOS:000400894800001

Both global production of chemicals and global water withdrawal grow faster than human population. This implies increased chemical threats to water, and creates a strong driver for mitigation to protect human health, ecosystem integrity and ecosystem services. Here we connect the perspectives of the water cycle and the chemical life cycle and review possible mitigation options. We categorize mitigation options in various stages of the chemicals' life cycle, taking various sectors and environmental pathways into account. More technologically oriented versus other types of mitigation options are discerned, and their relevance on spatial and temporal scale is discussed. We review various water treatment techniques in relation to physical-chemical properties of chemicals. Finally we discuss how a mitigation database can be used to assess the effectiveness of interventions, by coupling them to regional or global hydrological models. A solution-focused and systems-oriented perspective combined with a mitigation database offers a common perspective amongst actors on the effects for water quality of possible mitigation options throughout the chemical's life cycle, in various sectors and at various places in the water system. This can stimulate coherent implementation of effective mitigation options, cross-sectoral learning and further innovations to improve water quality.				van Wezel, Annemarie/N-9758-2013	van Wezel, Annemarie/0000-0002-6875-957X; Posthuma, Leo/0000-0003-0399-5499												2053-1400	2053-1419				MAY 1	2017	3	3					403	414		10.1039/c7ew00077d								WOS:000400932400003

To address this limitation, this study provides a new transient-state operation mode for an MFC sensor, which is proved applicable for three kinds of detections with higher sensitivity. Under the transient-state mode, the sensitivity increases by 50% to 247% when testing organic matter, acidic toxicants and heavy metals, compared to that of an MFC sensor in conventional constant external resistance connected mode. The mechanism for the improvement is analyzed both experimentally and with an equivalent circuit model. To obtain a higher sensitivity, the output signal of Uon (connected to the external resistance) is more adapted for organic matter monitoring with a wider range, while the output signal of Uoff (disconnected to the external resistance) is better for toxicity monitoring.

Water quality and filter performance of nutrient-, oxidant- and media-enhanced drinking water biofilters	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY												Nutrient, oxidant and media enhancement strategies were applied to pilot-scale biofilters with the objective of enhancing biodegradation to improve effluent water quality (e.g., TOC, DOC, SUVA, THMfp, HAAfp) and filter performance (e.g., effluent turbidity and head loss). While some statistically significant (alpha = 0.05) differences in DOC removal and DBPfp were identified as a result of specific enhancement strategies, enhancement strategies did not result in improvements in water quality (as measured by TOC, DOC, SUVA and DBPfp) that could be considered of practical operational importance. Water quality improvements were either operationally inconsistent, small in magnitude and/or within the deviation that would be expected from the biofilters when operated under equivalent ambient (i.e., not enhanced) conditions. With respect to filter performance, enhancement strategies also occasionally resulted in a statistically significant difference in effluent turbidity and head loss. However, when identified, statistically significant mean differences in effluent turbidity were deemed not meaningful given the instrument accuracy (i.e., perpendicular to 0.02 NTU), the relatively small magnitude of the mean differences, or the magnitude of the mean difference observed between biofilters operated under equivalent ambient conditions. With respect to head loss, statistically significant mean differences in head loss that were also considered meaningful given the magnitude of the deviation between ambient biofilters and the accuracy of the pressure transmitters, were largely consistent with the literature; however, the magnitude of the mean differences that showed improvement to head loss were small (10-18 cm), and likely would not be sufficient to substantially extended filter run times to have any practical operational importance.

The present study evaluates for the first time the long-term performance of enhanced-ZVI to remove natural organic matter (NOM), an important water quality parameter in drinking water. Lab-scale flow-through experiments showed that averagely 7-14% dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and 6-15% ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (UV254) reduction could be achieved by enhanced-ZVI in the first 10,000 bed volumes filtration when a 036 or 1.8 mins empty bed contact time (EBCT) was applied. After 10,000-bed volumes, the enhanced-ZVI bed became passivated. However, sulphuric acid was able to regenerate the passivated enhanced-ZVI bed, recover the capacity of enhanced-ZVI in removing NOM, and hence make the best use of the available ZVI. The acidic rinsing solution containing dissolved iron was suitable as a supplemental source of iron for coagulation. In addition, during the long-term experiments, the biofilters following enhanced-ZVI (1.8 min EBCT) removed more NOM than biofilters without any pre-treatment. This could be explained by the formation of biodegradable organic matter (BDOC) during the enhanced-ZVI process and the precipitation of iron in the biofilters. Based on these findings, a novel water treatment train, incorporating enhanced-ZVI with periodical regeneration, biofiltration, and coagulation, was proposed and evaluated. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This keeps the advantages of an automatic irrigation system but avoiding their operational complexity. In the FEADM 's first stage, the Fuzzy Analytical Process weigh five fuzzified environmental inputs used as assessment criteria. These criteria are used by a selective assessment stage, where only the relevant criteria for each alternative are assessed. As result, the best assessments of each alternative and the best assessed alternative are obtained. In the second stage, an output membership function is assigned to every alternative for its forward aggregation and defuzzification. This process reaches a soil moisture estimate. Unlike other models, FEADM allows estimating a quantitative value from a decision making process. Furthermore, its computational cost is lower than conventional fuzzy estimation models due to the selective assessment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Operating conditions such as feed gas quality and especially cooling conditions are of utmost importance. Cooling of ozone generators is absolutely necessary, since ozone destruction reactions increase exponentially with temperature. The most common way to cool an ozone generator is water flowing in close contact to the electrodes. The heat removal out of the discharge gap depends on different parameters. Electrical input power, cooling water flow conditions, electrode geometry and material properties are some of them. Simultaneously lowering cooling water temperature, applied power density and gap width, leads to a lower gas temperature in the discharge gap and thus to increased ozone production efficiency. Minimizing the temperature difference between the cooling water inlet and outlet improves the ozone production efficiency as well. This measure, however, results in high cooling water flows and requires additional cooling water chilling, resulting in higher operational costs and capital expenses. Cooling associated costs rise disproportionally with increasing cooling water flow. Simultaneously, energy consumption of ozone generators decreases as the average cooling water temperature goes down. As a result, there exists an optimum between the operational and capital expenses for the combination of ozone generator and cooling water system related expenses, offering significant cost savings for the customer.																	0191-9512	1547-6545				MAY-JUN	2017	39	3					196	201		10.1080/01919512.2017.1289466								WOS:000399644600006

Currently four of the treatment plants utilize ozone as the primary disinfectant. The Metropolitan ozone contactors are over-under baffled and include 10 chambers, an afterbay, and an effluent channel. Ozone is generally added in either the first countercurrent gas/liquid flow chamber (Chamber 1) or the first and second (co-current gas/liquid flow) chambers. Disinfection credit is received from ozone residuals in Chambers 2 through 6. An ozone destruct system collects and destroys ozone off-gases from Chambers 1 through 9 and an ozone quenching system is used to minimize dissolved ozone from leaving the contactors. Severe drought in California, and resulting water supply limitations, have created significant operational issues ranging from reduced plant flows to source water changes and water quality challenges. The combination of reduced flow and different source water conditions resulted in the ozone systems being operated occasionally under unfamiliar conditions. This article discusses some of the challenges faced in operating the ozone plants at low flows and low ozone production rates. Further, water quality issues required prudent management of operations to meet regulatory requirements. From the lessons learned, several recommendations are offered in preparation for similar conditions in the future.																	0191-9512	1547-6545				MAY-JUN	2017	39	3					202	208		10.1080/01919512.2017.1289467								WOS:000399644600007

Though physically-based hydrodynamic models are the most detailed means to simulate salinity processes, they are commonly restricted by data insufficiency issues both in spatial resolution and temporal lasting. This motivates us to build a statistical model enable simulation and scenario analysis for coastal salinity change with limited observations. A Bayesian neural network (BNN) model is built hereby to simulate salinity. It offers more precise estimation compared with the conventional artificial neural network. Meanwhile, the model gives the uncertainty behaviors of the final salinity simulation which is not available for other methods. Future scenarios of salinity change are constructed and analyzed in different time periods on the basis of the validated BNN model. Results indicate that the water quality over lower Pearl River is degrading along with more significant uncertainties. Further analysis suggests that streamflow alteration has a more direct impact on salinity variations than the sea-level change does. The method allows a profound analysis of the potential influence on water quality degradation in coastal and low-lying regions in support of water management and adaptation toward global climate change.																	1436-3240	1436-3259				MAY	2017	31	4					981	991		10.1007/s00477-017-1399-7								WOS:000399692500010

Assessing Future River Environments in the Seomjin River Basin due to Climate Change	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												Environmental impacts in the Seomjin River Basin were evaluated based on watershed characteristics and climate change using Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios provided by the Korea Meteorological Administration. Future dam and tributary inflow from 2000 to 2100 were estimated using a hydrology model. Dam safety evaluation and downstream flow duration curve analyses were performed using a hydraulic structure operation model based on hydrology model flow results. Water quality trends were analyzed through a seasonal Kendall test method using 19 years of water quality data. Dam discharge, tributary inflow, and water quality estimated by hydrology, hydraulic structure operation, and water quality model were used to analyze future influences on water quality trends. New guidelines for managing river environments and climate change issues are provided, allowing a preemptive response. The inflow increase during the flood season was smaller than that during the dry season because of climate change. Furthermore, the water stage of Seomjin or Juam Dam exceeded the designed flood level. It is therefore necessary to study the long-term effects and changes in water quality with regards to future flow rate changes.

Characterization and Land Application of Hydrodemolition and Diamond Grinding Slurries	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												Hydrodemolition and grinding of highway surfaces create large volumes of a water and concrete slurry that must be safely disposed of or reused. This project evaluated the effect of applying the slurry as a liming agent to vegetated areas. Results of two controlled greenhouse studies documented that the incorporation of concrete slurry at up to twice the recommended liming rate had no detrimental effect on the soils or the germination and establishment of fescue and bahiagrass. Further, surface application of concrete slurry to small field plots at rates recommended to correct low soil pH resulted in no detrimental effect on soils or vegetation including bermudagrass. In addition, the water quality of rainfall runoff from the plots with concrete slurry application was not different than runoff from a plot with no slurry application. Thus, these results showed that the application of hydrodemolition and concrete grinding slurry at rates to correct soil pH had no detrimental effect on the soils, vegetation, or surface runoff monitored in this study.

Nutrient and Sediment Reduction through Upflow Filtration of Stormwater Retention Pond Effluent	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												Wet ponds have often been installed to detain runoff with the intention of mitigating peak flow. However, significant current drivers exist to improve their ability to mitigate pollutants, and simple retrofits to existing ponds could help to meet total maximum daily load regulations. A review of past studies showed that ponds struggle to treat dissolved pollutants, which are often the most bioavailable. The present study evaluated the nutrient and sediment treatment performance of a retrofitted upflow filter (UF) attached to the drawdown orifice of an existing wet retention pond in Durham, North Carolina. The pond was studied during three periods: (1) control, where baseline pond performance was established; (2) after retrofit with floating treatment wetlands (FTWs); and (3) after retrofit with FTWs and an UF on the pond's drawdown orifice. The added UF was unable to improve the pond's retention of nitrogen. Further reduction of the TSS effluent concentrations by the UF may have been hampered by the low effluent concentrations during the FTW period (13 mg/L); however, the variability of TSS effluent concentrations was substantially reduced following UF retrofit. The UF significantly reduced mean effluent concentrations of orthophosphate (OP) to less than 0.01 mg/L. Effluent concentrations of OP and total phosphorus from the UF were similar to those from bioretention systems. Clogging of the filter media occurred in intervals of 5 to 9 months prior to breakthrough of OP. Future designs of UFs should incorporate microscale pretreatment and/or filter media cartridges that (1) are easy to remove and (2) provide a method to flush accumulated sediment from the media.

Specifically, the parameters of sedimentation and filtration effluent quality such as turbidity, color, organic matter [e.g.,dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total organic carbon (TOC)], ultraviolet absorbance at 254nm (UV254), Trihalomethane formation potentials (THMFPs), and metallic elements (e.g., Fe, Al, and Mn) were measured. The experimental results indicate that the continuous direct recycling of the CRS is a feasible method for not only reducing the required coagulant dosage but also improving the contaminant removal efficiency. The coagulant usage was reduced by up to 33.33% at 20 degrees C and 25.00% at 4 degrees C compared to control trials. Over the entire operation period, there was no significant accumulation of contaminants. The temperature exerted a significant impact on the required coagulant dosage and treatment efficiency. Additionally, this study proposes that the continuous operation periods are at the range of 10 to 12days. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Experimental pipe loops with different iron corrosion scales were set up to simulate the actual DWDS. The effects of sulfate levels on heavy metal release were systemically investigated. Heavy metal releases of Mn, Ni, Cu, Pb, Cr and As could be rapidly triggered by sulfate addition but the releases slowly decreased over time. Heavy metal release was more severe in pipes transporting groundwater (GW) than in pipes transporting surface water (SW). There were strong positive correlations (R-2 > 0.8) between the releases of Fe and Mn, Fe and Ni, Fe and Cu, and Fe and Pb. When switching to higher sulfate water, iron corrosion scales in all pipe loops tended to be more stable (especially in pipes transporting GW), with a larger proportion of stable constituents (mainly Fe3O4) and fewer unstable compounds ((beta-FeOOH, gamma-FeOOH, FeCO3 and amorphous iron oxides). The main functional iron reducing bacteria (IRB) communities were favorable for the formation of Fe3O4. The transformation of corrosion scales and the growth of sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) accounted for the gradually reduced heavy metal release with time. The higher metal release in pipes transporting GW could be due to increased Fe-6(OH)(12)CO3 content under higher sulfate concentrations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Water quality effects of intermittent water supply in Arraijan, Panama	WATER RESEARCH												Intermittent drinking water supply is common in low- and middle-income countries throughout the world and can cause water quality to degrade in the distribution system. In this study, we characterized water quality in one study zone with continuous supply and three zones with intermittent supply in the drinking water distribution network in Arraijan, Panama. Low or zero pressures occurred in all zones, and negative pressures occurred in the continuous zone and two of the intermittent zones. Despite hydraulic conditions that created risks for backflow and contaminant intrusion, only four of 423 (0.9%) grab samples collected at random times were positive for total coliform bacteria and only one was positive for E. coli. Only nine of 496 (1.8%) samples had turbidity >1.0 NTU and all samples had >0.2 mg/L free chlorine residual. In contrast, water quality was often degraded during the first-flush period (when supply first returned after an outage). Still, routine and first-flush water quality under intermittent supply was much better in Arraijan than that reported in a previous study conducted in India. Better water quality in Arraijan could be due to better water quality leaving the treatment plant, shorter supply outages, higher supply pressures, a more consistent and higher chlorine residual, and fewer contaminant sources near pipes. The results illustrate that intermittent supply and its effects on water quality can vary greatly between and within distribution networks. The study also demonstrated that monitoring techniques designed specifically for intermittent supply, such as continuous pressure monitoring and sampling the first flush, can detect water quality threats and degradation that would not likely be detected with conventional monitoring.

Toward Nucleating the Concept of the Water Resource Recovery Facility (WRRF): Perspective from the Principal Actors	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Wastewater resource recovery has been advocated for decades; necessary structural pathways were long-ago articulated, and established and emerging technologies exist. Nevertheless, broad wastewater valorization remains elusive. In considering implementation barriers, the argument is made that decision-makers focus on avoiding permit violations and negative publicity by embracing a conservative/safe approach seemingly ignoring research on economic/environmental benefits. Conversely positing that economics is a primary barrier, we investigated, characterized, and described nontechnical socio-political barriers to realizing wastewater resource recovery. Principal actors in the Pacific NW region of the U.S. (representing a progressive populace facing stringent water quality regulations) were interviewed. Results revealed that economics were, indeed, the primary barrier to implementation/expansion of the WRRF concept. Consistent throughout interviews was a prevalent sense that the "cost of doing something (different)" was a principal consideration in resource recovery actions/policies. Moreover, "economics drives decisions," and "95% the bottom line is money. Show return on investment, it will get people's attention." Who pays was also a concern: "Government isn't going to pay. The states and Federal government won't give any grants, and we can't raise rates." Applying business case evaluations was seen as a pathway to actualizing resource recovery. Most encouragingly, the consensus was that resource recovery is a necessary future paradigm, and that real barriers are surmountable.

We investigated the short-term (2 days) vertical and diel variations in bacterial community structure and microbially derived secondary metabolites during a cyanobacterial bloom that emerged in a highly urbanized tropical reservoir. The waterbody was largely dominated by the cyanobacteria Planktothricoides spp., together with the Synechococcus, Pseudanabaena, Prochlorothrix, and Limnothrix. Spatial differences. (i.e., water depth) rather than temporal differences (i.e., day versus night) better-explained the short-term variability in water quality parameters and bacterial community composition. Difference in bacterial structure suggested a resource-driven distribution pattern for the community. We found that the freshwater bacterial community associated with cyanobacterial blooms is largely conserved at the phylum level, with Proteobacteria (beta-proteobateria), Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria as the main taxa despite the cyanobacterial species present and geographical (Asia, Europe, Australia, and North America) or climatic distinctions. Through multivariate statistical analyses of the bacterial community, environmental parameters, and secondary metabolite concentrations, we observed positive relationships between the occurrences of cyanobacterial groups and off-flavor compounds (2-methyisoborneol and beta-ionone), suggesting a cyanobacterial origin. This study demonstrates the potential of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing as a supporting tool in algal bloom monitoring or water-resource management.

In order to increase sediment P retention, we injected dissolved aluminum into the anoxic sediment of a eutrophic semienclosed bay in the Baltic Sea, thereby inhibiting P recycling and further eutrophication (B). The P concentration in the bay remained at half, as did phytoplankton biomass (C), compared to pretreatment conditions and compared to the reference bay. Four years after treatment the water column transparency was increased, allowing submerged vegetation to penetrate deeper, and the habitat suitable for fish and benthic fauna had expanded (D). The lowered P concentration in the bay decreased the P export to the surrounding archipelago. This is the first full-scale marine remediation project using a geo-engineering method that demonstrates a quick recovery. For successful remediation in coastal areas, permanent binding of mobile P in anoxic sediments may be needed together with measures in the catchment area to obtain faster recovery of eutrophicated marine ecosystems.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				APR 18	2017	51	8					4559	4566		10.1021/acs.est.6b06187								WOS:000399859700046	28350961

In this way we can evaluate how these control actions can be combined in order to achieve a global positive effect on the plant operation. Also, this paper proposes an integral indicator for performance evaluation, which takes into account all three indicators mentioned for plant assessment. This indicator has been defined in a manner which tries to capture the overall performance of the plant, without relying on the subjectivity in granting different weights to the constituent elements of the evaluation criteria. The control of nitrate in the second anoxic tank using internal recirculation flow rate and control of the suspended solids concentration in the fifth tank using wastage flow rate offers the best compromise on the three elements considered for performance evaluation of a wastewater treatment plant: water quality, operational cost and CO2 emissions.

J	Kenari, SLD; Barbeau, B				Kenari, Seyedeh Laleh Dashtban; Barbeau, Benoit			Integrated pyrolucite fluidized bed-membrane hybrid process for improved iron and manganese control in drinking water	WATER RESEARCH												Newly developed ceramic membrane technologies offer numerous advantages over the conventional polymeric membranes. This work proposes a new configuration, an integrated pyrolucite fluidized bed (PFB)-ceramic MOH hybrid process, for improved iron and manganese control in drinking water. A pilot-scale study was undertaken to evaluate the performance of this process with respect to iron and manganese control as well as membrane fouling. In addition, the fouling of commercially available ceramic membranes in conventional preoxidation-MF/UF process was compared with the hybrid process configuration. In this regard, a series of experiments were conducted under different influent water quality and operating conditions. Fouling mechanisms and reversibility were analyzed using blocking law and resistance-in-series models. The results evidenced that the flux rate and the concentration of calcium and humic acids in the feed water have a substantial impact on the filtration behavior of both membranes. The model for constant flux compressible cake formation well described the rise in trans membrane pressure. The compressibility of the filter cake substantially increased in the presence of 2 mg/L humic acids. The presence of calcium ions caused significant aggregation of manganese dioxide and humic acid which severely impacted the extent of membrane fouling. The PFB pretreatment properly alleviated membrane fouling by removing more than 75% and 95% of iron and manganese, respectively. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Keupers, I; Willems, P				Keupers, Ingrid; Willems, Patrick			Development and testing of a fast conceptual river water quality model	WATER RESEARCH												Modern, model based river quality management strongly relies on river water quality models to simulate the temporal and spatial evolution of pollutant concentrations in the water body. Such models are typically constructed by extending detailed hydrodynamic models with a component describing the advection-diffusion and water quality transformation processes in a detailed, physically based way. This approach is too computational time demanding, especially when simulating long time periods that are needed for statistical analysis of the results or when model sensitivity analysis, calibration and validation require a large number of model runs. To overcome this problem, a structure identification method to set up a conceptual river water quality model has been developed. Instead of calculating the water quality concentrations at each water level and discharge node, the river branch is divided into conceptual reservoirs based on user information such as location of interest and boundary inputs. These reservoirs are modelled as Plug Flow Reactor (PFR) and Continuously Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) to describe advection and diffusion processes. The same water quality transformation processes as in the detailed models are considered but with adjusted residence times based on the hydrodynamic simulation results and calibrated to the detailed water quality simulation results. The developed approach allows for a much faster calculation time (factor 10(5)) without significant loss of accuracy, making it feasible to perform time demanding scenario runs.

Effect of advanced oxidation on N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) formation and microbial ecology during pilot-scale biological activated carbon filtration	WATER RESEARCH												Water treatment combining advanced oxidative processes with subsequent exposure to biological activated carbon (BAC) holds promise for the attenuation of recalcitrant pollutants. Here we contrast oxidation and subsequent biofiltration of treated wastewater effluent employing either ozone or UV/ H202 followed by BAC during pilot-scale implementation. Both treatment trains largely met target water quality goals by facilitating the removal of a suite of trace organics and bulk water parameters. Nnitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) formation was observed in ozone fed BAC columns during biofiltration and to a lesser extent in UV/H2O2 fed columns and was most pronounced at 20 min of empty bed contact time (EBCT) when compared to shorter EBCTs evaluated. While microbial populations were highly similar in the upper reaches, deeper samples revealed a divergence within and between BAC filtration systems where EBCT was identified to be a significant environmental predictor for shifts in microbial populations. The abundance of Nitrospira in the top samples of both columns provides an explanation for the oxidation of nitrite and corresponding increases in nitrate concentrations during BAC transit and support interplay between nitrogen cycling with nitrosamine formation. The results of this study demonstrate that pretreatments using ozone versus UV/H2O2 impart modest differences to the overall BAC microbial population structural and functional attributes, and further highlight the need to evaluate NDMA formation prior to full-scale implementation of BAC in potable reuse applications.

Flow cytometric bacterial cell counts challenge conventional heterotrophic plate counts for routine microbiological drinking water monitoring	WATER RESEARCH												Drinking water utilities and researchers continue to rely on the century-old heterotrophic plate counts (HPC) method for routine assessment of general microbiological water quality. Bacterial cell counting with flow cytometry (FCM) is one of a number of alternative methods that challenge this status quo and provide an opportunity for improved water quality monitoring. After more than a decade of application in drinking water research, FCM methodology is optimised and established for routine application, supported by a considerable amount of data from multiple full-scale studies. Bacterial cell concentrations obtained by FCM enable quantification of the entire bacterial community instead of the minute fraction of cultivable bacteria detected with HPC (typically < 1% of all bacteria). FCM measurements are reproducible with relative standard deviations below 3% and can be available within 15 min of samples arriving in the laboratory. High throughput sample processing and complete automation are feasible and FCM analysis is arguably less expensive than HPC when measuring more than 15 water samples per day, depending on the laboratory and selected staining procedure(s). Moreover, many studies have shown FCM total (TCC) and intact (ICC) cell concentrations to be reliable and robust process variables, responsive to changes in the bacterial abundance and relevant for characterising and monitoring drinking water treatment and distribution systems. The purpose of this critical review is to initiate a constructive discussion on whether FCM could replace HPC in routine water quality monitoring. We argue that FCM provides a faster, more descriptive and more representative quantification of bacterial abundance in drinking water. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Tang, SY; Zhang, ZH; Zhang, XH				Tang, Shengyin; Zhang, Zhenghua; Zhang, Xihui			New insight into the effect of mixed liquor properties changed by pre-ozonation on ceramic UF membrane fouling in wastewater treatment	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL												The effect of mixed liquor properties changed by ozonation especially with high dosages on membrane fouling is very complex and remains unclear. In this study, the effect of mixed liquor properties changed by ozonation especially with high dosages on ceramic ultrafiltration (UF) membrane fouling in wastewater treatment and the corresponding mechanism were systematically studied by characterization of the mixed liquor properties, hydraulic performance, the fouling layers and modeling at different ozone dosages (0, 2, 5, 10 mg/L). The membrane filterability of the mixed liquor after pre-ozonation (<= 5 mg/ L) was enhanced and the corresponding membrane fouling was mitigated. After pre-ozonation, activated sludge had the better settleability and larger floc size. Meanwhile, there was a remarkable reduction of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), soluble microbial products (SMP) and extractable extra-cellular polymeric substances (EPS) after pre-ozonation and the removed organics were mainly belonged to the high molecular weight (MW) (1-10 kDa) and very high MW (10-200 kDa) substances. Intermediate blocking was the main membrane fouling during the mixed liquor filtration process and the best fouling mitigation performance was achieved for the sample with an intermediate ozone dosage of 5 mg/L (1.7 mg-ozone/g-mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS)). Meanwhile, the water quality of permeate was even better after pre-ozonation (<= 5 mg/L) with the lower DOC and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations. Severe cell lysis occurred with the significant increase of the released organics in the mixed liquor and the activated sludge had smaller floc size and worse settleability when the pre-ozonation dosage was above 10 mg/L, which in turn resulted in the deteriorated membrane fouling control performance.

Reservoirs are suspected to be particularly vulnerable to microplastic pollution. However, very limited information is currently available on pollution characteristics of microplastics in reservoir ecosystems. This work studied the distribution and characteristics of micro plastics in the backwater area of Xiangxi River, a typical tributary of the Three Gorges Reservoir. Microplastics were detected in both surface water and sediment with concentrations ranging from 0.55 X 10(5) to 342 X 10(5) items km(-2) and 80 to 864 items m(-2), respectively. Polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene were identified in surface water, whereas polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyethylene terephthalate, and pigments were observed in sediment. In addition, microplastics were also detected in the digestion tracts of 25.7% of fish samples, and polyethylene and nylon were identified. Redundancy analysis indicates a weak correlation between microplastics and water quality variables but a negative correlation with water level of the reservoir and Secchi depth. Results from this study confirm the presence of high abundance microplastics in reservoir impacted tributaries, and suggest that water level regulated hydrodynamic condition and input of nonpoint sources are important regulators for microplastic accumulation and distribution in the backwater area of reservoir tributaries.

Accordingly, there is constant necessity for treatment technologies and processes to make likely residue to be launched of aquatic system without changing water quality. The use of anaerobic sequential batch reactor (ASBR) for AMD treatment has shown to be a viable alternative, as sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) reduce sulfate ions to sulfide that may precipitate metals presents in solution or oxidize sulfide produced to elemental sulfur. An ASBR with 7 L was operated at 30 degrees C for the treatment of synthetic AMD containing SO4 2-1500 mg/L, with ratio COD/Sulfate equal 1 and ethanol as carbon source for 270 days with 6 phases containing different concentrations of metals (100-400 mg L-1 of Fe2+, 20-40 mg L-1 of Zn2+, 5-10 mg L-1 of Cu2+), based on values with potential toxicity to SRB. During the operation phases the concentration of metals gave an increase in removal SO42-. COD removal ranged from 68.4 to 94.4% and sulfate from 39.1 to 72.8%. The Fe2+ removals were above 99.2%, Zn2+-100% and Cu2+ above 93.3%. Given the high removal metals and SO42-, ASBR characterized a form suitable for the AMD treatment.

Identification and Quantification of Nitrogen in a Reservoir, Jiaodong Peninsula, China	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												Identification of nitrogen (N) sources is important in water quality control and management. Nitrogen pollution can lead to eutrophication of waterbodies and high concentrations of nitrate in drinking water can pose potential health problems. The N-15 isotope and nitrogen fluxes budget approach is useful for determining the source of NO3- to surface waters. In this study, mass balance and N-15 isotope approaches and nitrogen flux budgets were applied to identify total nitrogen (TN) sources and nitrogen transformation processes in the Menlou Reservoir (MR), Jiaodong Peninsula, China. The different fractions of nitrogen and their N-15 isotope signatures were analyzed in the reservoir water, river water, groundwater, soil, and atmospheric precipitation. The results indicate that surface runoff pollution (e.g., fertilizer and animal manure) is the main source of NO3- in MR. High concentrations of TN in MR are caused by low nitrogen self-purification (denitrification) rate, low sediment adsorption capacity, and the influx of NO3- rich groundwater.

DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF A PHYSICALLY BASED MODEL OF STREAMBANK EROSION FOR COUPLING WITH A BASIN-SCALE HYDROLOGIC MODEL SWAT	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												A comprehensive streambank erosion model based on excess shear stress has been developed and incorporated in the hydrological model Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). It takes into account processes such as weathering, vegetative cover, and channel meanders to adjust critical and effective stresses while estimating bank erosion. The streambank erosion model was tested for performance in the Cedar Creek watershed in north-central Texas where streambank erosion rates are high. A Rapid Geomorphic field assessment (RAP-M) of the Cedar Creek watershed was done adopting techniques developed by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), and the stream segments were categorized into various severity classes. Based on the RAP-M field assessment, erosion pin sites were established at seven locations within the severely eroding streambanks of the watershed. A Monte Carlo simulation was carried out to assess the sensitivity of different parameters that control streambank erosion such as critical shear stress, erodibility, weathering depth, and weathering duration. The sensitive parameters were adjusted and the model was calibrated based on the bank erosion severity category identified by the RAP-M field assessment. The average observed erosion rates were in the range 25367 mm year(-1). The SWAT model was able to reasonably predict the bank erosion rates within the range of variability observed in the field (R-2 = 0.90; E = 0.78).

The CN method does not account for the spatial distribution of land cover types, an important factor controlling runoff patterns. The objective of this study was to empirically derive CN values that reflect the strategic placement of native prairie vegetation (NPV) within row crop agricultural landscapes. CNs were derived using precipitation and runoff data from a seven-year period for 14 small watersheds in Iowa. The watersheds were planted with varying amounts of NPV located in different watershed positions. The least squares and asymptotic least squares methods (LSM) were used to derive CNs using an initial abstraction coefficient (lambda) of 0.2 and 0.05. The CNs were verified using leave-one-out cross-validation and adjustment for antecedent moisture conditions (AMC) was tested. The asymptotic method produced CN values for watersheds with NPV treatment that were 8.9 and 14.7% lower than watersheds with 100% row crop at lambda = 0.2 and lambda = 0.05, respectively. The derived CNs produced Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency values ranging from 0.4 to 0.7 during validation. Our analyses show the CNs verified best for the asymptotic LSM, when using lambda of 0.05 and adjusting for AMC. Further, comparison of derived CNs against an area weighted CN indicated that the placement of vegetation does impact the CN value.

EFFECTS OF IMPERVIOUS AREA AND BMP IMPLEMENTATION AND DESIGN ON STORM RUNOFF AND WATER QUALITY IN EIGHT SMALL WATERSHEDS	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												The effects of increases in effective impervious area (EIA) and the implementation of water quality protection designed detention pond best management practices (BMPs) on storm runoff and stormwater quality were assessed in Gwinnett County, Georgia, for the period 2001-2008. Trends among eight small watersheds were compared, using a time trend study design. Significant trends were detected in three storm hydrologic metrics and in five water quality constituents that were adjusted for variability in storm characteristics and climate. Trends in EIA ranged from 0.10 to 1.35, and changes in EIA treated by BMPs ranged from 0.19 to 1.32; both expressed in units of percentage of drainage area per year. Trend relations indicated that for every 1% increase in watershed EIA, about 2.6, 1.1, and 1.5% increases in EIA treated by BMPs would be required to counteract the effects of EIA added to the watersheds on peak streamflow, stormwater yield, and storm streamflow runoff, respectively. Relations between trends in EIA, BMP implementation, and water quality were counterintuitive. This may be the result of (1) changes in constituent inputs in the watersheds, especially downstream of areas treated by BMPs; (2) BMPs may have increased the duration of stormflow that results in downstream channel erosion; and/or (3) spurious relationships between increases in EIA, BMP implementation, and constituent inputs with development rates.

Rainfall effects on inflow and infiltration in wastewater treatment systems in a coastal plain region	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Aging wastewater collection and treatment systems have not received as much attention as other forms of infrastructure, even though they are vital to public health, economic growth, and environmental quality. Inflow and infiltration (I&I) are among potentially widespread problems facing central sewage collection and treatment systems, posing risks of sanitary system overflows (SSOs),system degradation, and water quality impairment, but remain poorly quantified. Whole-system analyses of I& I were conducted by regression analyses of system flow responses to rainfall and temperature for 93 wastewater treatment plants in 23 counties in eastern North Carolina, USA, a coastal plain region with high water tables and generally higher rainfalls than the continental interior. Statistically significant flow responses to rainfall were found in 92% of these systems, with 2-year average I& I values exceeding 10% of rainless system flow in over 40% of them. The effects of rainfall, which can be intense in this coastal region, have region-wide implications for sewer system performance and environmental management. The positive association between rainfall and excessive I& I parallels the effects of storm water runoff on water quality, in that excessive I& I can also drive SSOs, thus confounding water quality protection efforts.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				APR	2017	75	8					1909	1921		10.2166/wst.2017.072								WOS:000400374700017	28452783

A urinary marker is desirable for the control of pool water quality. The widespread consumption of acesulfame-K (ACE), a stable synthetic sweetener, and its complete excretion in urine, makes it an ideal urinary marker. Here we report the occurrence of ACE and its potential application in swimming pools and hot tubs. First, we developed a new method for achieving high-throughput analysis of ACE without preconcentration or large-volume injection. Analysis of more than 250 samples from 31 pools and tubs from two Canadian cities showed ACE in all samples. Concentrations ranged from 30 to 7110 ng/L, up to 570-fold greater than in the input tap water. The level of dissolved organic carbon was significantly greater in all pools and tubs than in the input water. Finally, we determined the levels of ACE over 3 weeks in two pools (110000 and 220000 U.S. gallons) and used the average ACE level to estimate the urine contribution as 30 and 75 L. This study clearly shows the human impact in pools and tubs. This work is useful for future studies of the human contribution to DBP formation, epidemiological assessment of exposure, and adverse health effects in recreational facilities.

Potamogeton crispus L., a species of pondweed, is widely used in such restoration because it can be easily propagated through its turions. However, little is known so far of the growth characteristics of turions growing under limited light or even in total darkness. The growth and physiological responses of plants raised from small, medium, or large turions (categorized on the basis of their weight) and growing in total darkness in an aquarium showed that plants raised from small turions were significantly shorter (33.4 +/- 4.8 cm) than those grown from medium or large turions (49.9 +/- 4.3 cm and 46.9 +/- 7.4 cm, respectively; the difference between the two categories was not significant) when measured on the average of 48th, 62nd and 69th days after planting. Although the plant biomass was significantly different among the three groups of turions, it remained virtually the same within each group throughout. Plants raised from the three categories of turions, however, did not differ significantly either in terms of root length or with respect to soluble protein contents and peroxidase activity; the last parameter increased significantly after 48 days in all the three categories, whereas the activity of superoxide dismutase increased significantly after 62 days. These observations indicate that P. crispus plants growing in total darkness suffer from stress due to antioxidants, especially after 48 days of culture. Therefore, it is recommended that larger turions be chosen for planting and that suitable measures be taken to ensure that at least some light reaches the plants 48 days after planting. Three formulas are presented, depending on the level of turbidity and the weight of turions, to calculate the maximum water depth at which P. crispus could survive for restoration of P. crispus in eutrophic lakes.

J	Ramirez, Y; Cisternas, LA; Kraslawski, A				Ramirez, Yendery; Cisternas, Luis A.; Kraslawski, Andrzej			Application of House of Quality in assessment of seawater pretreatment technologies	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Increasing pressure on water resources is leading to a growing reliance on seawater desalination for the provision of freshwater. Pretreatment of seawater is a major step in seawater desalination, which can mitigate problems with reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. No clearly superior pretreatment technology exists, due to the variation in input water quality, and furthermore, the pretreatment must be designed to be functional with input water quality characteristics that vary considerably over time. The objective of this work is to conduct technology assessment by applying a lissome version of HOQ matrix developed in a case study of dissolved air flotation (DAF) system, which is used as water pretreatment for RO desalination systems. The DAF system technology is compared with other pretreatment processes such as ultrafiltration, sedimentation, and granular media filtration. General analysis provides insight to decision makers to help them improve technologies so that they could meet specific demands. HOQ offers a comparative analysis and identifies specific characteristics that must be improved to develop the chosen technology. The HOQ provides a comprehensive analysis for decision making in management, showing that no pretreatment technologies present a superior performance vis-a-vis all customer attributes, however, it identifies the features of the system, to which efforts should be funneled. For DAF system, these are: water quality changes and energy consumption. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Sources and mechanisms of nitrate and orthophosphate transport in urban stormwater runoff from residential catchments	WATER RESEARCH												Nutrients export from residential catchments contributes to water quality impairment in urban water bodies. We investigated the concentrations, transport mechanisms, and sources of nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) and orthophosphate-phosphorus (PO4-P) in urban stormwater runoff generated in residential catchments in Tampa Bay, Florida, United States. Street runoff samples, collected over 21 storm events, were supplemented with rainfall and roof runoff samples from six representative residential catchments. Samples were analyzed for N and P forms, N and oxygen (O) isotopes of nitrate (delta O-18-NO3- and delta N-15 -NO3-), and delta O-18 and hydrogen (delta D) isotopes of water (H2O). We found that the main NO3-N source in street runoff was atmospheric deposition (range: 35-64%), followed by chemical N fertilizers (range: 1 -39%), and soil and organic N (range: 7-33%), whereas PO4-P in the street runoff likely originated from erosion of soil particles and mineralization from organic materials (leaves, grass clippings). The variability in the sources and concentrations of NO3-N and PO4-P across catchments is attributed to different development designs and patterns, use of various fill materials during land development, and landscaping practices. This data can be useful to develop strategies to offset the impacts of urban development (e.g., designs and patterns resulting in variable impervious areas) and management (e.g., fertilizer use, landscaping practices) on NO3-N and PO4-P transport in urban residential catchments.

THM and HAA formation from NOM in raw and treated surface waters	WATER RESEARCH												The disinfection by-product (DBP) formation potential (FP) of natural organic matter (NOM) in surface water sources has been studied with reference to the key water quality determinants (WQPs) of UV absorption (UV254), colour, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration. The data set used encompassed raw and treated water sampled over a 30-month period from 30 water treatment works (WTWs) across Scotland, all employing conventional clarification. Both trihalomethane (THM) and haloacetic acid (HM) FPs were considered. In addition to the standard bulk WQDs, the DOC content was fractionated and analysed for the hydrophobic (HPO) and hydrophilic (HPI) fractions. Results were quantified in terms of the yield (dDBPFP/dWQD) and the linear regression coefficient R-2 of the yield trend. The NOM in the raw waters was found to comprise 30-84% (average 66%) of the more reactive HPO material, with this proportion falling to 18-63% (average 50%) in the treated water. Results suggested UV254 to be as good an indicator of DBPFP as DOC or HPO for the raw waters, with R-2 values ranging from 0.79 to 0.82 for THMs and from 0.71 to 0.73 for HAAs for these three determinants. For treated waters the corresponding values were significantly lower at 0.52-0.67 and 0.46-0.47 respectively, reflecting the lower HPO concentration and thus UV254 absorption and commensurately reduced precision due to the limit of detection of the analytical instrument. It is concluded that fractionation offers little benefit in attempting to discern or predict chlorinated carbonaceous DBP yield for the waters across the geographical region studied. UV254 offered an adequate estimate of DBPFP based on a mean yield of similar to 2600 and similar to 2800 mu g per cm(-1) absorbance for THMFP for the raw and treated waters respectively and similar to 3800 and similar to 2900 g cm(-1) for HAAFP, albeit with reduced precision for the treated waters.

Rapid gravity filtration operational performance assessment and diagnosis for preventative maintenance from on-line data	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL												Rapid gravity filters, the final particulate barrier in many water treatment systems, are typically monitored using on-line turbidity, flow and head loss instrumentation. Current metrics for assessing filtration performance from on-line turbidity data were critically assessed and observed not to effectively and consistently summarise the important properties of a turbidity distribution and the associated water quality risk. In the absence of a consistent risk function for turbidity in treated water, using on-line turbidity as an indicative rather than a quantitative variable appears to be more practical. Best practice suggests that filtered water turbidity should be maintained below 0.1 NTU, at higher turbidity we can be less confident of an effective particle and pathogen barrier. Based on this simple distinction filtration performance has been described in terms of reliability and resilience by characterising the likelihood, frequency and duration of turbidity spikes greater than 0.1 NTU. This view of filtration performance is then used to frame operational diagnosis of unsatisfactory performance in terms of a machine learning classification problem. Through calculation of operationally relevant predictor variables and application of the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) algorithm the conditions associated with the greatest risk of poor filtration performance can be effectively modelled and communicated in operational terms. This provides a method for an evidence based decision support which can be used to efficiently manage individual pathogen barriers in a multi-barrier system. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been studied for the removal of GSM and MIB. However, in this work, a photo-Fenton treatment was investigated for the first time for the degradation of GSM and MIB in both synthetic and Nak-Dong River water from DWTPs. Synthetic water-based experiments were performed to investigate the optimal operation conditions for the removal of GSM and MIB, and the effects of water quality parameters of the photo-Fenton process, including the Fe(II)/H2O2 concentra tion, reaction time, pH, organic matter, and initial concentration of GSM and MIB. Degradation intermediates of dehydration and ring-opening were obsetved during the photo-Fenton process. The optimal conditions were determined to be 2 mg/L Fe(II) and 20 mg/L H2O2 at pH 5 considering both efficiency and cost. The degradation efficiency was lower than that of DI water, mainly because of the pH (7.2-7.6). Nevertheless, the photo-Fenton process meets the guideline levels (20 ng/L) in South Korea when the initial concentration in the river water is below 50 ng/L. In addition, trihalomethanes (THMs) and microcystin-LR (MC-LR), derived from cyanobacterial blooms and another cause for concern, were degraded effectively using the photo-Fenton process on the river water.

The present work demonstrates the bactericidal effect of chloridized silver wires, where chloridization was achieved through chemical/electrochemical methods. The disinfection kinetics of uncoated and chloridized silver wires immersed in a 100 mL batch reactor were compared for one Gram positive and two Gram negative model bacterial strains, i.e., Bacillus subtilis MTCC 441 and Escherichia coli MTCC 443 and MTCC 739, respectively. Results showed that the chloridized silver wires could achieve better bactericidal effect compared to the uncoated silver wires. Initial cell concentration (N-0) had a significant influence on the time required for complete disinfection which increased by more than 60 fold as N-0 increased from 10(3) to 10(9) CFU/mL. The disinfection kinetics was correlated with release of silver ions from the chloridized surfaces and was affected by changes in water quality and presence of other constituents in water. High alkalinity showed minimal adverse effect whereas high values of hardness and natural organic matter had severe adverse effect on disinfection kinetics and silver release. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This situation makes the application of advanced water treatment technologies compulsory. In this study, applicability of nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) methods was investigated for reuse of industrial wastewater treated with advanced treatment method at organized industrial zone. For this purpose, two NF (HL-GE and DL-GE) and one RO (AG-BWRO) membranes were used at 10 bar of applied pressure. Permeability test revealed that HL membrane exhibited the highest permeability with 7.22 +/- 0.79 L/m(2) h bar of permeability constant followed by AG membrane with a permeability constant of 6.03 +/- 0.25 L/m(2) h bar. Less permeable membrane was DL with a permeability constant of 2.08 +/- 0.11 L/m(2) h bar. In terms of rejection performance, conductivity, salinity, chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC), color, divalent ions (Ca2+, Mg2+ and SO42-) and monovalent ions (Na+, K+, Cl- and HCO3-) were rejected by HL membrane with an average rejection of 37.2 +/- 2.1%, 38.6 +/- 2.5%, 72.5 +/- 5.5%, 79.9 +/- 6.1%, 85.4 +/- 1.2%, 86.0 +/- 0.5%, 88.8 +/- 0.3%, 99.9 +/- 0.0%, 46.0 +/- 0.9%, 27.0 +/- 0.3% 17.9 +/- 1.1%, 64.3 +/- 2.8%, respectively. The respective rejections by DL membrane were 31.1 +/- 0.8%, 31.2 +/- 1.1%, 36.8 +/- 16.4%, 68.2 +/- 7.3%, 81.0 +/- 4.0%, 77.9 +/- 0.7%, 84.7 +/- 07%, 99.9 +/- 0.0%, 41.0 +/- 04%, 18.4 +/- 1.7%, 14.0 +/- 1.3%, and 45.2 +/- 2.7%. On the other hand, higher water quality was obtained with AG-BWRO membrane. AG-BWRO achieved conductivity, salinity, COD, TOC and color rejections of 96.8 +/- 0.2%, 96.9 +/- 0.1%, 74.7 +/- 2.8%, 90.5 +/- 4.8% and 87.6 +/- 1.9%, respectively. Divalent ions and monovalent ions were rejected by AG-BWRO membrane with an average rejection of higher than 94%. In conclusion, AG-BWRO membrane was found to be the best membrane considering both product water quality and quantity. DL membrane was found to be the worst one among the three membranes investigated in this work.

This paper aims at developing an innovative methodology for sustainability assessment of the technologies for groundwater remediation. A total of eight criteria have been used for sustainability assessment of the technologies for groundwater remediation in this study, and they are capital cost, detection and analysis costs, and operation and maintenance costs in economic aspects, effect of secondary pollution environmental aspect, effectiveness for water quality improvement and time for remediation in technological aspect, the effect on public health in social aspect, and policy support belonging to political aspect. The relative priorities of the alternative technologies with respect to each criterion were scored by Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), and it was also employed to calculate the weights of the criteria. After determining the decision-making matrix,ELECTRE was employed to rank the alternatives according to their sustainability performances. An illustrative case has been studied by the proposed method, monitored natural attenuation (MNA) has been recognized as the most sustainable technology for groundwater remediation, followed by pump-treat (1382T) technology, permeable reactive barriers (PRB) and air sparing (AS). Finally, Sensitivity analysis was also carried out to test the robustness of the results. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

An MILP model for optimizing water exchanges in eco-industrial parks considering water quality	RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING												Unlike other resources that may come in multiple energy forms, there is no substitute for freshwater. Therefore, Eco-Industrial Parks (EIPs) have been designed to encourage interplant water exchange networks in order to minimize the consumption of freshwater as well as the generation of wastewater. This study proposes a model that simultaneously minimizes the economic and the environmental objective functions of an EIP through goal programming. The economic costs considered integrates the necessary piping and operating costs together with the freshwater, wastewater, and treatment costs, while the environmental impact considered the volume and the quality of the water used and released by the EIP. Results showed that the considering water volume and quality in minimizing the environmental impact gave better results than considering water volume only. Economic costs and environmental impacts were also found to be dependent on the priorities given to each goal, as well as the treatment quality of the processes.

Contribution of Leaf Litter to Nutrient Export during Winter Months in an Urban Residential Watershed	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Identification of nonpoint sources of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in urban systems is imperative to improving water quality and better managing eutrophication. Winter contributions and sources of annual N and P loads from urban watersheds are poorly characterized in northern cities because monitoring is often limited to warm-weather periods. To determine the winter export of N and P, we monitored stormwater outflow in a residential watershed in Saint Paul, Minnesota during 2012-2014. Our data demonstrate that winter melt events contribute a high percentage of annual N and P export (50%). We hypothesized that overwintering leaf litter that is not removed by fall street sweeping could be an important source to winter'oads of N and P. We estimated contributions of this source by studying decomposition in lawns, street gutters, and catch basins, during two winters. Rates of mass and N loss were negligible during both winters. However, P was quickly solubilized from decomposing leaves. Using mass balances and estimates of P leaching losses, we estimated that leaf litter could contribute 80% of winter total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) loading in this watershed (similar to 40% of annual TDP loading). Our work indicates that urban trees adjacent to streets likely represent a major source of P pollution in northern cities. Management that targets important winter sources such as tree leaves could be highly effective for reducing P loading and may mitigate eutrophication in urban lakes and streams in developed cities.

In this study, the structure and composition of EPS (extracellular polymeric substances) were investigated to elucidate the factors for the anammox aggregation property. Anammox sludge taken from 18 lab-scale and pilot scale reactors treating different types of wastewater was analyzed using EEM-PARAFAC (excitation emission matrix and parallel factor analysis), FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) and real-time PCR combined with multivariate statistical analysis. The results showed that slime and TB-EPS (tightly bound EPS) were closely related with water quality and sludge morphology, and could be used as the indicators for anammox microbial survival ability and microbial aggregate morphology. Furthermore, slime secreted from anammox bacterial cells may be exhibited higher viscosity to the sludge surface and easily formed the gel network to aggregate. Large amounts of hydrophobic groups of protein in TB-EPS promoted the microbial aggregation. The mechanisms of anammox aggregation explored in this study enhanced the understanding of anammox stability in wastewater treatment processes.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				MAR 21	2017	51	6					3260	3268		10.1021/acs.est.6b05761								WOS:000397477900017	28240536

Influence of the Mixing Energy Consumption Affecting Coagulation and Floc Aggregation	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The operational significance of energy-intensive rapid mixing processes remains unaddressed in coagulation and flocculation of insollible precipitates (flocs), which play an important role in the removal of impurities from drinking water supplies. In this study, the influence of rapid mixing and associated mixing energy on floc aggregation was examined for a surface water source characterized by a high fraction of aquatic humic matter. Infrared spectral analyses showed that the colloidal complexes resulting from ligand exchange between iron and dissolved natural organic matter (DOM) were not substantially influenced by the mixing energy input. This signified that DOM removal by coagulation can be achieved at lower mixing intensity, thereby reducing energy consumption. In contrast, macroscopic investigations showed the coagulation mixing energy affected floc size distributions during the slow mixing stage in flocculation and, to some extent, their settling characteristics. The results from analysis of floc properties clearly showed that more mixing energy was expended than necessary in coagulation, which is typically designed at a high mixing intensity range of 600-1000 s(-1) in treatment plants. The key findings from this study have practical implications to water utilities to strategically meet water quality goals while reducing energy demands.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				MAR 21	2017	51	6					3480	3489		10.1021/acs.est.6b06281								WOS:000397477900041	28206742					
J	Mabaya, G; Unami, K; Fujihara, M				Mabaya, Goden; Unami, Koichi; Fujihara, Masayuki			Stochastic optimal control of agrochemical pollutant loads in reservoirs for irrigation	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Agriculture intensification through the use of chemical nitrogen fertilizers is contributing substantially to the tremendous increases in global food production. However, eutrophication of downstream waters associated with excess nitrate pollutant runoff has become a major environmental concern in agricultural areas. Reservoirs used for irrigation are well-positioned to intercept substantial fertilizer runoff from upslope agricultural fields. The authors hypothesized that such reservoirs can be used to influence the quality of downstream surface water. A Markov decision process was formulated to find optimal operating policies for controlling stochastic agrochemical pollutant loads in reservoirs for irrigation. The model was applied to an irrigation reservoir in Japan that is prone to nitrate pollution from upslope green tea plantations. The computational results reveal that, in all nitrate-nitrogen states in which the reservoir storage state is below 10%, the optimal policy is to introduce cleaner water supplements from the upstream reservoir. When the reservoir storage volume exceeds 35% of active capacity and when the nitrate-nitrogen concentration is less than 3 mg/L, the optimal policy would be only to release the irrigation water. When the reservoir storage volume exceeds 35% of active capacity and when the nitrate nitrogen concentration exceeds 5 mg/L, the optimal operation decision is to first release irrigation water from the reservoir before introducing cleaner water supplements. Therefore, the operation of irrigation reservoirs can be optimized to control intercepted agro-fertilizer pollutants from intensive agricultural areas. The developed method for reservoir irrigation operation has the potential to support decision making processes to provide greater protection of the water environment from agrochemical pollution while sustaining the productivity in the intensive agricultural areas.

J	Liu, WF; Antonelli, M; Liu, XC; Yang, H				Liu, Wenfeng; Antonelli, Marta; Liu, Xingcai; Yang, Hong			Towards improvement of grey water footprint assessment: With an illustration for global maize cultivation	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												The grey water footprint refers to the volume of water that is required to assimilate polluted water. It reflects the intensity of water pollution caused by water use for human activities. This study aims to address some major shortcomings associated with grey water footprint accounting in the literature and discuss several ways towards its improvement. Global maize production is used for illustration. The study specifically tackles three issues: the appropriate water quality standards for grey water footprint assessment; grey water footprint for multiple pollutants; and the influence of spatial resolution of the assessment on the level of grey water stress. A biophysical crop model is applied to quantify nitrogen and phosphorus losses to water in maize production on a global scale with a 0.5-degree spatial resolution. The study shows that the grey water footprint calculation is highly Sensitive to the water standards applied. The results also suggest that the grey water footprint relating to nitrogen and phosphorus pollution caused by maize production alone has already exceeded their local water availability in many parts of the world. Grey water stress shows a more critical situation at the grid level than at the watershed level for maize cultivation because the former represents the local concentration whereas the latter gives the average situation of the whole watershed. This study highlights the need for standardizing the setting of water quality standards for a consistent grey water footprint assessment taking into consideration the diverse aquatic ecosystems and ambient water quality requirements across regions, as well as the presence of multiple pollutants in water bodies.

However, the detailed knowledge about the contribution of CWs to methane and nitrous oxide emissions in treating sewage treatment plant effluent are still limited in particular for a better understanding of the sustainability of CWs. The fluxes of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from free water surface (FWS) CWs in northern China were measured continuously using the static-stationary chamber technique from 2012 to 2013. The results showed that CWs were the significant source of CH4 and N2O emissions. Average emission rates of CH4 and N2O ranged from -30.2 mu g m(-2) h(-1) to 450.9 mu g m(-2) h(-1), and -58.8 mu g m(-2) h(-1) to 1251.8 mu g m(-2) h(-1), respectively. Obvious annual and seasonal variations of CH4 and N2O emissions were observed over the 2-year period. In addition, temperatures and plant species had an impact on CH4 and N2O emissions. The obtained results showed that FINS CWs, improving water quality but emitting lower CH4 and N2O, could be the alternative method for sewage treatment plant effluent. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Use of fluorescence spectroscopy to control ozone dosage in recirculating aquaculture systems	WATER RESEARCH												The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of fluorescence spectroscopy to be used as an ozone dosage determination tool in recirculating aquaculture systems (RASs), by studying the relationship between fluorescence intensities and dissolved organic matter (DOM) degradation by ozone, in order to optimise ozonation treatment. Water samples from six different Danish facilities (two rearing units from a commercial trout RAS, a commercial eel RAS, a pilot RAS and two marine water aquariums) were treated with different O-3 dosages (1.0-20.0 mg/L ozone) in bench-scale experiments, following which fluorescence intensity degradation was eventually determined. Ozonation kinetic experiments showed that RAS water contains fluorescent organic matter, which is easily oxidised upon ozonation in relatively low concentrations (0-5 mg O-3/L). Fluorescence spectroscopy has a high level of sensitivity and selectivity in relation to associated fluorophores, and it is able to determine accurately the ozone demand of each system. The findings can potentially be used to design offline or online sensors based on the reduction by ozone of natural fluorescent-dissolved organic matter in RAS. The suggested indirect determination of ozone delivered into water can potentially contribute to a safer and more adequate ozone-based treatment to improve water quality. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Hypothetical scenario exercises to improve planning and readiness for drinking water quality management during extreme weather events	WATER RESEARCH												Two hypothetical scenario exercises were designed and conducted to reflect the increasingly extreme weather-related challenges faced by water utilities as the global climate changes. The first event was based on an extreme flood scenario. The second scenario involved a combination of weather events, including a wild forest fire ('bushfire') followed by runoff due to significant rainfall. For each scenario, a panel of diverse personnel from water utilities and relevant agencies (e.g. health departments) formed a hypothetical water utility and associated regulatory body to manage water quality following the simulated extreme weather event. A larger audience participated by asking questions and contributing key insights. Participants were confronted with unanticipated developments as the simulated scenarios unfolded, introduced by a facilitator. Participants were presented with information that may have challenged their conventional experiences regarding operational procedures in order to identify limitations in current procedures, assumptions, and readily available information. The process worked toward the identification of a list of specific key lessons for each event. At the conclusion of each simulation a facilitated discussion was used to establish key lessons of value to water utilities in preparing them for similar future extreme events. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, the possibility of using pre-ozonation instead of post-ozonation for the removal of micropollutants was explored because of the lower risk of forming carcinogenic bromate. A 1.0 m(3)/h pilot system was utilized to compare the efficacy of pre- and post-ozonation in the removal of bulk organic pollutants as well as micropollutants, including typical odor-causing compounds, pharmaceuticals, and typical pesticides, from one source water (Huangpu River) characterized by the occurrence of various micropollutants. Both pre-ozonation and post-ozonation could achieve similar water purification performance under an ozone dose of 1.5 mg/L, in terms of bulk water quality parameters like CODMn, (66% in combination with biological activated carbon (BAC) treatment, compared to 62% with the pre-ozonation-BAC combination) or micropollutants including 27 pharmaceuticals (85% in combination with BAC compared to 87% with the pre-ozonation-BAC combination) and 25 pesticides (72% in combination with BAC compared to 61% with the preozonation-BAC combination). Pre-ozonation exhibited slightly better odorant removal performance (100% in combination with BAC compared to 92% with the post-ozonation-BAC combination); however, post-ozonation generated approximately 6.0 mu g/L bromate at an ozone dose of 2.0 mg/L, while pre-ozonation did not form bromate even at an ozone dose as high as 3.0 mg/L. So pre-ozonation in combination with BAC might be a solution for the removal of micropollutants from source water with high bromate formation risk. The results of this study will be helpful for the optimization of ozonation processes in the water supply industry. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Microbial source tracking in shellfish harvesting waters in the Gulf of Nicoya, Costa Rica	WATER RESEARCH												Current microbial water quality monitoring is generally limited to culture-based measurements of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB). Given the many possible sources of fecal pollution within a watershed and extra intestinal FIB reservoirs, it is important to determine source(s) of fecal pollution as a means to improve water quality and protect public health. The principal objective of this investigation was to characterize the microbial water quality of shellfish harvesting areas in the Gulf of Nicoya, Costa Rica during 2015. In order to achieve this objective, the specificity and sensitivity of 11 existing microbial source tracking (MST) PCR assays, associated with cows (BacCow), dogs (BacCan, DogBac), domestic wastewater (PMMoV), general avian (GFD), gulls (Gull2), horses (HorseBac, HoF), humans (HF183, HPyV), and pigs (PF), were evaluated using domestic wastewater and animal fecal samples collected from the region. The sensitivity of animal-associated assays ranged from 13 to 100%, while assay specificity ranged from 38 to 100%. The specificity of pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) and human polyomavirus (HPyV) was 100% for domestic wastewater, as compared to 94% specificity of the HF183 Bacteroidales marker. PMMoV was identified as a useful domestic wastewater-associated marker, with concentrations as high as 1.1 x 10(5) copies/ml and 100% sensitivity and specificity. Monthly surface water samples collected from four shellfish harvesting areas were analyzed using culture-based methods for Escherichia coli as well as molecular methods for FIB and a suite of MST markers, which were selected for their specificity in the region. While culturable E. coli results suggested possible fecal pollution during the monitoring period, the absence of human/domestic wastewater-associated markers and low FIB concentrations determined using molecular methods indicated sufficient microbial water quality for shellfish harvesting. This is the first study to our knowledge to test the performance of MST markers in Costa Rica as well as in Central America. Given the lack of wastewater treatment and the presence of secondary sources of FIB, this study highlights the importance of an MST toolbox approach to characterize water quality in tropical regions. Furthermore, it confirms and extends the geographic range of PMMoV as an effective tool for monitoring domestic wastewater pollution. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Evaluation of the dry and wet weather recreational health risks in a semi-enclosed marine embayment in Southern California	WATER RESEARCH												For many coastal regions around the world, recreational beach water quality is assessed using fecal indicator bacteria (FIB). However, the utility of FIB as indicators of recreational water illness (RWI) risk has been questioned, particularly in coastal settings with no obvious sources of human sewage. In this study we employed a source-apportionment quantitative microbial risk assessment (SA-QMRA) to assess RWI risk at a popular semi-enclosed recreational beach in Southern California (Baby Beach, City of Dana Point) with no obvious point sources of human sewage. Our SA-QMRA results suggest that, during dry weather, the median RWI risk at this beach is below the U.S. EPA recreational water quality criteria (RWQC) of 36 illness cases per 1000 bathers. During wet weather, the median RWI risk predicted by SA-QMRA depends on the assumed level of human waste associated with stormwater; the RWI risk is below the EPA RWQC illness risk benchmark 100% of the time provided that <2% of the FIB in stormwater are of human origin. However, these QMRA outcomes contrast strongly with the EPA RWQC for 30-day geometric mean of enterococci bacteria. Our results suggest that SA-QMRA is a useful framework for estimating robust RWI risk that takes into account local information about possible human and non-human sources of FIB.

Methods: A total number of 48 seawater and sediment samples were taken from 8 stations (each site 6 times with an interval time of 2 weeks) between June and September 2014. Seawater and sediment samples were collected from 30 cm under the surface samples and different sediment depths (0, 4, 7, 10, 15, and 20 cm) respectively, along the Persian Gulf in Bushehr coastal areas. Results: Based on the results, the average numbers of bacterial indicators including total coliform, fecal coliform, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as HPC in seawater samples were 1238.13, 150.87, 8.22 MPN/100 ml and 1742.91 CFU/ ml, respectively, and in sediment samples at different depths (from 0-20 cm) varied between 25 x 10(3) to 51.67 x 10(3), 5.63 x 10(3) to 12.46 x 10(3), 17.33 to 65 MPN/100 ml, 36 x 10(3) to 147.5 x 10(3) CFU/ml, respectively. There were no statistically significant relationships between the indicator organism concentration levels with temperature as well as pH value of seawater. A reverse correlation was found between the level of indicator bacteria and salinity of seawater samples. Also results revealed that the sediment texture influenced abundance of indicators bacteria in sediments. As the concentration levels of indicators bacteria were higher in muddy sediments compare with sandy ones. Conclusion: Result conducted Bushehr coastal sediments constitute a reservoir of indicator bacteria, therefore, whole of the indicators determined were distinguished to be present in higher levels in sediments than in the overlying seawater. It was concluded that the concentration levels of microbial indicators decreased with depth in sediments. Except total coliform, the numbers of other bacteria including fecal coliform, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and HPC bacteria significantly declined in the depth between 10 and 15 cm.

Yet understanding the influence of water quality on zooplankton under field-conditions is hindered by traditional labor-intensive approaches that are prone to incomplete or uncertain taxonomic determinations. Here, for the first time, an eco-genomic approach, based on genetic diversity in the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) region of DNA of zooplankton was used to develop a site-specific, water quality criterion (WQC) for ammonia (NH3). Ammonia has been recognized as a primary stressor in the catchment of the large, eutrophic Tai Lake, China. Nutrients, especially NH3 and nitrite (NO3-) had more significant effects on structure of the zooplankton community than did other environmental factors. Abundances of rotifers increased along a gradient of increasing concentrations of total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), while abundances of copepods and cladocera decreased. A novel, rapid, species sensitivity distribution (SSD) approach based on operational taxonomic units (OTUs) was established to develop a WQC for NH3. The WQC based on OTUs was consistent with the WQC based on the traditional morphology taxonomy approach. This genetics-based SSD approach could be a useful tool for monitoring for status and trends in species composition and deriving ecological criteria and an efficient biomonitoring tool to protect local aquatic ecosystems in virtually any aquatic ecosystem.

The study covered the premises of a Logistics Centre with an approximate area of 34 hectares, located in the catchment of the Wedonka stream and in the region of water intake for Krakow at the Rudawa river. In the future, the Centre will comprise nine large warehouses. Road traffic associated with the project will cause potential risks for groundwater and surface water of this protected area. Therefore, the Centre's investor decided to evaporate rainwater from the premises. To establish advisability of this plan, the study team designed and built a unique experimental station consisting of experimental roof, a tank for collecting water for the sprinkler system, system for delivering, distributing and discharging water from the roof, measuring tilt tray, automatic meteorological station, and electronic devices for recording measurement data. The research on the experimental station was carried out from April to October in 2011 and 2012 and included continuous measurements of the volume of water supplied to and discharged from the roof. Moreover, the temperature of the roof and water in the tank and the number of important meteorological parameters were measured. The difference between supplied and discharged water, divided by the wetted surface of the roof, helped to determine thickness of the evaporation layer in millimeters. The study confirmed the possibility of removing potentially contaminated rainwater by evaporating it from roof surfaces of the Logistics Centre located near Krakow at an average rate of 5.9 dm(3).m(-2).d(-1). However, due to high seasonal variability of rainfall and air temperature, it is necessary to temporarily collect water in an expansion tank of suitable capacity.

During a five-year project, from 2008 to 2012, selected chemical parameters in 11 water supply networks of the Siedlce County were studied. Throughout that period drinking water was of satisfactory quality, with only iron and manganese ions exceeding the limits (21 times and 12 times, respectively). In accordance with the results of cluster analysis, all water networks were put into three groups of different water quality. A high concentration of chlorides, sulphates, and manganese and a low concentration of copper and sodium was found in the water of Group 1 supply networks. The water in Group 2 had a high concentration of copper and sodium, and a low concentration of iron and sulphates. The water from Group 3 had a low concentration of chlorides and manganese, but a high concentration of fluorides. Using principal component analysis and cluster analysis, multivariate correlation between the studied parameters was determined, helping to put water supply networks into groups according to similar water quality.

J	Chin, DA				Chin, David A.			Designing Bioretention Areas for Stormwater Management	ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSES-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL												Governing equations for designing bioretention areas for both flood control and water-quality control are developed, and a design protocol for applying these equations is also presented. Factors taken into account include the flood-control return period, the local intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) function, the catchment volumetric runoff coefficient, and the depth and infiltration capacity of the bioretention-area bowl. It is shown that the IDF functions nested within the conventional Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) rainfall distributions can be described by a common functional form, with different parameters for each of the four rainfall types. These extracted IDF functions are used to show that designing bioretention areas for flood control is more feasible in the western part of the United States that have Type I rainfall, compared to other parts of the county that have Types IA, II, and III rainfall. It is demonstrated that practical bioretention areas that are sized for water-quality control can also meet flood-control regulations in some areas. A design example is provided to demonstrate the typical sizing of bioretention areas for both flood control and water-quality control.																	2198-7491	2198-7505				MAR	2017	4	1					1	13		10.1007/s40710-016-0200-0								WOS:000414367200001

Assessment and Prediction of Saline Sea Water Transport in Groundwater Using 3-D Numerical Modelling	ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSES-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL												This paper presents the application of a three-dimensional numerical model to the Al-Raudhatain and Umm A-Aish fresh water aquifers located in north Kuwait. The two aquifers have been polluted by saline sea water imported to extinguish the oil well fires during the Gulf war. A time variant salinity transport model was calibrated simultaneously with the transient groundwater flow system to assess the impact of saline sea water. Variably saturated flow and transport were modelled. The results of the salinity transport model suggest that although the fresh water-saline water interface, as defined by the 1500 mg/L contour, has moved towards the centre of the lens, in some areas up-gradient of the fresh water recharge, the extent of the fresh water lens has actually increased slightly in the down-gradient areas. After 23 years (simulation period 1990-2013), the areal extent of the total dissolved solids plume is estimated at 27 and 29% of the Al-Raudhatain and Umm A-Aish fresh water bodies, respectively. Under the scenarios assumed, there are large masses of salts stored in the soil profile that will leach over time to the water table. The total dissolved solids concentrations are predicted by the model to decrease to 4500 mg/L from 7800 mg/L, after 73 years (simulation period 1990-2063) from the moment the saline sea water was added. The predicted total dissolved solids concentration simulation provides a worst-case scenario of the likely extent of contaminant movement in groundwater in the two fresh water fields. Solute transport modelling has become increasingly important tool for interpreting groundwater quality data and processes relevant to natural and contaminant aquifer systems to a wide range of real-world groundwater quality problems. Further data, from drilling sampling and other testing and experimentations should help clarify the assumptions made and assist in updating the solute transport modelling effort which helps to provide insights into the past and present behavior, and allows to predict water quality management scenarios.																	2198-7491	2198-7505				MAR	2017	4	1					49	73		10.1007/s40710-016-0198-3								WOS:000414367200004

Assessment of seasonal variations in water quality of Brahmani river using PCA	ADVANCES IN ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL												Assessment of seasonal changes in surface water quality is an important aspect for evaluating temporal variations of river pollution due to natural or anthropogenic inputs of point and non-point sources. In this study, surface water quality data for 15 physico-chemical parameters collected from 7 monitoring stations in a river during the years from 2014 to 2016 were analyzed. The principal component analysis technique was employed to evaluate the seasonal correlations of water quality parameters, while the principal factor analysis technique was used to extract the parameters that are most important in assessing seasonal variations of river water quality. Analysis shows that a parameter that is most important in contributing to water quality variation for one season may not be important for another season except alkalinity, which is always the most important parameters in contributing to water quality variations for all three seasons.																	2234-1722	2234-1730				MAR	2017	6	1					53	65		10.12989/aer.2017.6.1.053								WOS:000406901400005

Partitioning and Transport Behavior of Pathogen Indicator Organisms at Four Cold Region Solid Waste Sites	JOURNAL OF COLD REGIONS ENGINEERING												Freshwater resources in rural Alaska communities, especially those underlain by permafrost, are particularly vulnerable to impacts from nearby waste facilities. The authors investigated the connection between rural solid waste facilities and transmission of pathogenic organisms into nearby water resources by evaluating the (1)prevalence of pathogen indicators E. coli and Enterococcus sp. proximal to cold region waste facilities, and (2)partitioning behavior of both organisms in a controlled snowmelt lysimeter test. Results reveal that E. coli and Enterococcus sp. preferentially attach to and migrate with soil particles in surface waters and are transported off-site during snowmelt runoff. Enterococcus sp. had higher and more sustained viability in cold environmental conditions than E. coli. E. coli and Enterococcus sp. were found in surface waters and soils in the concentration range of 0.7-3.5mean log most probably number (MPN)/100mLH2O. All microbial samples indicated strong site-specific variability.																	0887-381X	1943-5495				MAR	2017	31	1							04016005	10.1061/(ASCE)CR.1943-5495.0000111								WOS:000395523500001

Conventional treatment processes such as neutralization, clariflocculation, and biological processes are used to clean the effluent before feeding to the PAC and UF combined RO system. The efficiency of the combined system was evaluated using the chemical oxygen demand Mn (CODMn), color, pH, turbidity, total nitrogen, total phosphate, and conductivity. The PAC was effective in greatly reducing the CODMn and color. The turbidity and silt density index of the UF permeate satisfied the water quality indices required for the RO feed. The RO system was constantly maintained at approximately 75% RO recovery, and the RO permeate satisfied the water quality requirements for reusing the processed water. Therefore, the PAC-UF combined RO system can be used to process effluent discharged from tannery wastewater treatment plants for reuse.																	2220-1319					MAR	2017	7	1					97	102		10.2166/wrd.2016.001								WOS:000398026700011

Specifically, we develop a possible probabilistic model of sensor measurement error and the measurement error model is embedded into a simulation model of a river system. An optimization algorithm is used to find the optimal sensor locations that minimize the expected time until a spill detection in the presence of a constraint on the probability of detecting a spill. The experimental results show that the optimal sensor locations are highly sensitive to the variability of measurement error and false alarm rates are often unacceptably high. An SPC method is useful in finding thresholds that guarantee a false alarm rate no more than a pre-specified target level, and an optimization algorithm combined with the thresholds finds a robust sensor network.

A commonly used water quality simulation model, Qual2K, was linked to a Genetic Algorithm optimization model for exploration of relevant fuzzy objective-function formulations for addressing imprecision and conflicting goals of pollution control agencies and various dischargers. Results showed a dynamic flow dependence of optimal wastewater loading with good convergence to near global optimum. Explicit considerations of real-world technological limitations, which were developed here in a new S-O framework, led to better compromise solutions between conflicting goals than those identified within traditional S-O frameworks. The newly developed framework, in addition to being more technologically realistic, is also less complicated and converges on solutions more rapidly than traditional frameworks. This technique marks a significant step forward for development of holistic, riverscape-based approaches that balance the conflicting needs of the stakeholders.				jaafarzadeh, neemat/M-1190-2017	jaafarzadeh, neemat/0000-0003-2516-2340; Destouni, Georgia/0000-0001-9408-4425												1061-4303	1554-7531				MAR 1	2017	89	3					211	220		10.2175/106143017X14839994523866								WOS:000397300200002	28236817

The integrated WASP and WQI(5) tool was field- tested to assess pollutant loadings and their impacts on river environment. Suspended solid (SS) and electric conductivity (EC) correlation equations and the WQI(5) calculation tool were included in the water quality model and direct WQI(5) calculation. The SS concentration, which was influenced by river flows, had crucial effects on river water quality and WQI(5) values. EC value was controlled by dissolution of soil minerals, which was affected by the watershed drainage area and surface runoff. The integrated system could establish a direct correlation for river water quality, river flow, and WQI(5).																	1061-4303	1554-7531				MAR 1	2017	89	3					260	273		10.2175/106143016X14798353399584								WOS:000397300200007	28236820

Water quality and antifungal susceptibility of opportunistic yeast pathogens from rivers	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Yeasts from water sources have been associated with diseases ranging from superficial mucosal infections to life threatening diseases. The aim of this study was to determine the water quality as well as diversity and antifungal susceptibility of yeasts from two rivers. Yeast levels and physicochemical parameter data were analyzed by principal component analysis to determine correlations between physico-chemical data and yeast levels. Yeast morphotypes were identified by biochemical tests and 26S rRNA gene sequencing. Disk diffusion antifungal susceptibility tests were conducted. Physico-chemical parameters of the water were within target water quality range (TWQR) for livestock farming. For irrigational use, total dissolved solids and nitrates were not within the TWQR. Yeast levels ranged between 27 +/- 10 and 2,573 +/- 306 cfu/L. Only non-pigmented, ascomycetous yeasts were isolated. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida glabrata were most frequently isolated. Several other opportunistic pathogens were also isolated. A large number of isolates were resistant to azoles, especially fluconazole, but also to other antifungal classes. Candida species were resistant to almost all the antifungal classes. These water sources are used for recreation and religious as well as for watering livestock and irrigation. Of particular concern is the direct contact of individuals with opportunistic yeast, especially the immune-compromised. Resistance of these yeast species to antifungal agents is a further health concern.

Minimization of total treatment and penalty costs and minimization of biological oxygen demand violation of standards at the check point are considered as the main objectives of this study. At first, the water quality along the river was simulated using the Streeter-Phelps (S-P) equation coupled with the MOPSO model. Thereby a trade-off curve between the objectives is obtained and a set of non-dominated solutions is selected. In the next step, the best alternative is chosen using MCDM techniques and the GMCRII DSS package and non-cooperative stability definitions. The applicability and efficiency of the methodology are examined in a real-world case study of the Sefidrud River in the northern part of Iran.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				MAR	2017	75	6					1512	1522		10.2166/wst.2016.429								WOS:000397590800025	28333067

Investigation and control of seawater intrusion in the Eastern Nile Delta aquifer considering climate change	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												Seawater intrusion is considered one of the main processes that degrade water quality by raising salinity. Over-pumping and decreasing recharge are considered the main causes of saltwater intrusion. Moreover, climate change and sea-level rise accelerate saltwater intrusion. In this paper SEAWAT code was used to study groundwater flow and seawater intrusion in the Eastern Nile Delta aquifer considering four scenarios of climate change including sea-level rise, increasing abstraction, decreasing recharge and the combination of these scenarios. The results showed that decreasing recharge has a significant effect on seawater intrusion. However, the combinations of these scenarios resulted in harmful intrusion and loss of groundwater. The soil salinity increased, which decreased agricultural production. The control of seawater intrusion and protection of groundwater resources and soil is very important. Different scenarios were implemented to protect the aquifer from seawater intrusion including decreasing abstraction, increasing recharge, abstracting brackish water and the combination of these three scenarios. The abstraction of brackish water gave a higher reduction of seawater intrusion and decreased groundwater table in the aquifer near the shore line, which protected the soil from salinity and increased agricultural production. However, the combination of these three scenarios gave the highest reduction of seawater intrusion.																	1606-9749					MAR	2017	17	2					311	323		10.2166/ws.2016.129								WOS:000398000000001

Despite the substantial resources invested to provide safe water, there is a significant number of water points that are non-functional. Knowledge of the degree of sustainability and the contributing factors for rural water supply projects is limited. This study employs the fuzzy set concept to assess the degree of sustainability of water points in seven Local Government Authorities (LGAs) of Dodoma region in Tanzania. Dodoma region lies in the semi-arid area of Tanzania where boreholes are the major sources of water supply. Due to limited information, four dimensions of sustainability of water projects were used in this study. These include water quantity from the water sources, water quality, institution setting with regard to community participation in meetings, and financing of the projects for operation and maintenance. The multidimensional sustainability indices of water points were determined. The results indicate that only two LGAs, of Bahi and Kondoa, have sustainable water points with sustainability indices of 0.86 and 0.83, respectively. Kongwa has the lowest sustainability index of 0.17 due to poor water quality and inadequate quantity of water from the boreholes.																	1606-9749					MAR	2017	17	2					372	380		10.2166/ws.2016.141								WOS:000398000000006

Implementing tactical plans to improve water-energy loss management	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												Water utilities are aware of the water-energy loss relevance in supply systems. However, they still mainly focus on daily water loss control (real and apparent losses), without considering the impact on embedded energy. Moreover, they are mostly concerned with the economic dimension and, in most cases, tend to disregard the impact that water-energy loss may have on the quality of service, communication with the consumers, social awareness, water quality and environment. This paper focuses on the application of the developed and tested AWARE-P infrastructure asset management (IAM) methodology to improve water-energy loss management in water supply systems, while demonstrating the main benefits from implementing an integrated approach for water losses and related energy assessment.

The results indicate that preventive or remediation actions are necessary to improve its water quality. Water samples were collected between 2012 and 2013 at five sampling stations at the Mopanshan Reservoir, and analyzed for CODMn and total nitrogen (TN). SPSS software was used to carry out analysis of variance and correlation analysis. Spatially, CODMn and TN exhibited a rather small distinction in the horizontal direction, but there was a significant difference regarding TN in the vertical orientation. The concentration of TN also increased with the increase in sampling depth. Seasonally, the concentration of CODMn and TN showed a pronounced seasonal pattern and was divided into four periods. CODMn reached a maximum in September and was at a minimum in June. And TN reached a maximum in June and was at a minimum in November or December. The use of correlation analysis shows that the regular variations of TN were primarily affected by temperature. The main form of nitrogen in the Mopanshan Reservoir is NO3-N, and the change of TN is consistent with that of NO3-N. By Pearson correlation coefficient, the seasonal variability of CODMn correlated to changes in the reservoir's water level. The results showed that the concentration of TN exceeded the guideline values in most months and CODMn was slightly over the standard limit. Thus, it is urgent that preventive actions and remediation processes are developed to improve the water quality in this reservoir.																	1606-9749					MAR	2017	17	2					389	398		10.2166/ws.2016.118								WOS:000398000000008

Islamabad is the capital city, located at the foot of the Margallah Hills, whereas Rawalpindi lies in the Potohar Plateau. Both cities are located in the semi-arid region of Pakistan, where the residents meet their basic need of water through groundwater resources. For the lastmany years, the quantity and quality of groundwater in these cities has been deteriorating very rapidly. In this study, the foremost recharge source for these cities was identified using tritium and major ion chemistry, and different physiochemical parameters were studied to find out the facts behind the quality deterioration of the groundwater. Tritiumvalues and chemical data suggested that aquifers located in the territory of Islamabad were mainly recharged by upland areas (theMargalla Hills), which accounts for their low electrical conductivity and total dissolved solids contents. A higher sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) suggested an alteration in recharge patterns through soil compaction and cementation (from increased construction activity) that reduced the recharge inputs. The high SAR also disturbs the recharge pattern and had disturbed the natural equilibrium of the groundwater system, deteriorating the quality of the water.																	1606-9749					MAR	2017	17	2					433	451		10.2166/ws.2016.149								WOS:000398000000012

A serious shortcoming of the debate is that there are differences in the design and management of rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems. This study is based on the performance of two RWH systems that are used for drinking purposes at a kindergarten and a primary school in Cu Khe, Vietnam. Each system comprised a painted galvanized iron roof, a first-flush diverter, two stainless steel tanks connected in series, a calmed inlet, mosquito screens on open holes, PVC pipelines, filter cartridges, and a UV sterilizer. During 18 months, stored rainwater was sampled five times, and treated rainwater was sampled four times. Twenty-three water quality parameters were analyzed, including pH, total dissolved solids, turbidity, nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, hardness, arsenic, iron, cadmium, nickel, chromium, manganese, mercury, selenium, lead, zinc, Escherichia coli, and total coliform. It was found that all the physicochemical qualities of the stored rainwater, prior to treatment, satisfied the World Health Organization (WHO) drinking water guidelines. After physical filtration and UV sterilization, all parameters, including microbiological indicators, satisfied the WHO drinking water guidelines. Further management strategies to stabilize water quality were discussed.																	1606-9749					MAR	2017	17	2					452	460		10.2166/ws.2016.154								WOS:000398000000013

A case assessment in China	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												The overall purpose was to assess the feasibilities of recycling filter backwash water (FBWW) and combined filter backwash water (CFBWW) in a drinking water treatment plant in south China. The variations of regular water-quality indexes, metal indexes (Al, Mn and Cd), polyacrylamide and disinfection by-product indexes (trihalomethanes and their formation potentials) along with the treatment and the recycling processes were monitored. Results showed the recycling procedure caused increases of turbidity, total solids, ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), permanganate index (CODMn), and dissolved organic carbon, Al, Mn and Cd concentrations in a mixture of raw water and FBWW or CFBWW compared to those in raw water. However, the recycling procedure had negligible impacts on the qualities of settled water and filtered water because most of the contaminants could be effectively removed by the conventional water treatment process. Although recycling did cause slight increases of NH3-N and CODMn levels in settled water and filtered water, the quality of finished water always conformed to Chinese standards for drinking water quality according to the surveyed indexes in the present study. Thus, it is appropriate to recycle waste streams in water-stressed areas if the source water is well managed and the water treatment processes are carefully conducted.

F. bay) considering maximum-monitoring-information and minimum-data-lost criteria. Due to cost concerns, it is necessary to design the optimal salinity monitoring network with a minimal number of sampling stations to provide reliable data. The monthly data recorded from January 1995 to December 2014 were obtained over 37 active stations located in S. F. bay and is applied in the research. Transinformation entropy in discrete mode is used to calculate the stations' optimum distance. The discrete approach uses the frequency table to calculate transinformation measures. After calculating these measures, a transinformation-distance (T-D) curve is developed. Then, the optimum distance between salinity monitoring stations is elicited from the curve. The study shows that the S. F. bay salinity monitoring stations provide redundant information and the existing stations can be reduced to 21 with an approximate distance of 7.5 km. The coverage of the proposed monitoring network by using the optimum distance is complete and the system does not generate redundant data. The results of this research indicate that transinformation entropy is a promising method for the design of monitoring networks in bays such as those found in San Francisco bay.																	1606-9749					MAR	2017	17	2					606	612		10.2166/ws.2016.110								WOS:000398000000029

In this study, several online real-time sensors were utilized to monitor effluent from a wastewater fed laboratory-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) under natural and simulated failure conditions. These simulated failures included adding reactor mixed liquor to emulate a membrane breach, and spiking MS2 bacteriophage into the reactor to create a high viral load, which might be observed during an outbreak. The CANARY event detection software was used to analyze sensor data and report changes in water quality that might be indicative of poor system behavior. During simulated failure conditions, CANARY reported 20 alarms, accurately detecting each failure. During natural operating conditions, 219 alarms were produced and 189 were attributed to known events (e.g., system and sensor maintenance). The remaining alarms (23) during natural operating conditions were considered to have an unknown cause. However, 13 of those had signal deviations similar to known events, but could not be definitively linked to a source. The results of this study suggest that real-time monitoring in conjunction with CANARY analysis may be useful as an early warning system for monitoring the effluent of water reuse systems, and may help to quickly identify treatment malfunctions or other abnormal conditions.

Lessons and guidance for the management of safe drinking water during extreme weather events	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY												Extreme weather events have presented significant challenges to drinking water quality managers in Australia and elsewhere. Examples of extreme weather events include droughts, floods, cyclones, and wildfires. With global climate change, an increased frequency and severity of diverse extreme weather events is projected for many parts of the world. As such, the need to effectively prepare for and manage these types of extreme events is increasing. Previous experience with managing water supplies before, during and after extreme weather events can provide valuable lessons to aid planning for future events. By surveying Australian water utilities, detailed experiences and lessons from ten case studies of the management of extreme weather events was compiled. The weather events and their impacts to water quality management are described. The lessons learned from these events were used to establish a series of recommendations intended to be used as guidance for future management of extreme events. An important finding was the need to lead change and coordinate effort by the development of a formal whole-of-organisation strategy for building resilience to extreme events. Effective components of such a strategy include the implementation of a water quality management system and the development of specific incident response plans. The development and maintenance of inter-agency relationships was also found to be important and the use of inter-agency hypothetical scenario testing was identified as an effective way to support this. Strategies identified to assist in maintaining operations during and immediately following extreme weather events include the enactment of incident response plans, effective communication and, where possible, the implementation of short-term risk management controls. Post-event activities were also identified, including event recovery, learning from experiences and knowledge dissemination. The guidance presented in this paper will be of value to water quality managers throughout the world as they plan to enhance resilience within their organisations and services.

Water treatment process evaluation of wildfire-affected sediment leachates	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY												The recent increase in wildfire activity has raised concerns among many water utilities that rely on forested watersheds susceptible to wildfire for drinking water supplies. An understanding of post-fire treatment challenges, and guidance on how water providers can prepare is needed. In this study, dark, charred, river-bank sediment deposits were collected from the High Park fire burn area in northern Colorado, USA and leached in the laboratory to simulate the impact of post-fire runoff on source water quality. A comparison of the sediment leachates to post-fire river samples collected during flow events indicated the turbidity, phosphorus, nitrogen and dissolved organic carbon concentrations were similar, although the leachates do not reflect extreme concentrations observed in the field. The treatability of the leachates was evaluated with conventional coagulation and additional unit processes (pre-oxidation, powdered activated carbon, biofiltration), and samples were analyzed for disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation. Material leached from the sediments was enriched in haloacetonitrile (HAN) and chloropicrin precursors compared to baseline organic material of source waters, whereas total trihalomethane and haloacetic acid precursor reactivity were not statistically different from baseline source waters. Sediment leachates were amenable to conventional coagulation (25 mg L-1 aluminum sulfate), but may require additional treatment to meet DBP maximum contaminant levels. Enhanced coagulation (50 mg L-1) or pre-ozonation followed by conventional treatment are recommended as the best options for reducing carbonaceous DBP formation. Pre-ozonation/coagulation/biofiltration resulted in the lowest HAN and chloropicrin formation of the sediment leachates.

J	Bueno, PD; Gillerman, L; Gehr, R; Oron, G				Bueno, Patricia De la Cueva; Gillerman, Leonid; Gehr, Ronald; Oron, Gideon			Nanotechnology for sustainable wastewater treatment and use for agricultural production: A comparative long-term study	WATER RESEARCH												Nanotechnology applications can be used for filtering low quality waters, allowing under given conditions, the removal of salts and other micropollutants from these waters. A long-term field experiment, implementing nanotechnology in the form of UltraFiltration (UF) and Reverse Osmosis (RO) for salt removal from treated wastewater, was conducted with secondary effluents, aiming to prove the sustainability of agricultural production using irrigation with treated wastewater. Six outdoor field treatments, each under four replications, were conducted for examining the salt accumulation effects on the soil and the crops. The field experiments proved that crop development is correlated with the water quality as achieved from the wastewater filtration capability of the hybrid nanotechnology system. The key goal was to maintain sustainable food production, despite the low quality of the waters. Of the six treatment methods tested, irrigation with RO-treated effluent produced the best results in terms of its effect on soil salinity and crop yield. Nevertheless, it must be kept in mind that this process is not only costly, but it also removes all organic matter content from the irrigation water, requiring the addition of fertilizers to the effluent.

Samuel; von Gunten, Urs			Formation and reactivity of inorganic and organic chloramines and bromamines during oxidative water treatment	WATER RESEARCH												The formation and further reactions of halamines during oxidative water treatment can be relevant for water quality. In this study, we investigated the formation and reactivity of several inorganic and organic halamines (monochloramine, N-chloromethylamine, N-chlorodimethylamine, monobromamine, dibromamine, N-bromomethylamine, N,N-dibromomethylamine, and N-bromodimethylamine) by kinetic experiments, transformation product analysis, and quantum chemical computations. Kinetic model simulations were conducted to evaluate the relevance of halamines for various water treatment scenarios. Halamines were quickly formed from the reaction of chlorine and bromine with ammonia or organic amines. Species-specific second-order rate constants for the reaction of chlorine and bromine with ammonia, methyl- and dimethylamine were in the order of 10(6)-10(8) M(-1)s(-1). The formed halamines were found to be reactive towards phenolic compounds, forming halogenated phenols via electrophilic aromatic substitution (phenol and resorcinol) or quinones via electron transfer (catechol and hydroquinone). At near neutral pH, apparent second-order rate constants for these reactions were in the order of 10(-4)-10(-1) M(-1)s(-1) for chloramines and 10(1)-10(2) M(-1)s(-1) for bromamines. Quantum chemical computations were used to determine previously unknown aqueous pK(a) values, gas phase bond dissociation energies (BDE) and partial atomic charges of the halamines, allowing a better understanding of their reactivities. Kinetic model simulations, based on the results of this study, showed that during zhlorination inorganic and organic chloramines are the main halamines formed. However, their further reactions with organic matter are outcompeted kinetically by chlorine. During ozonation, mainly inorganic bromamines are formed, since ozone quickly oxidizes organic amines. The further reactions of bromamine are typically outcompeted by ozone and thus generally of minor importance. The use of peracetic acid for saline ballast water treatment can result in the formation of substantial amounts of bromamines, which can react with dissolved organic matter and contribute to the formation of brominated products.

J	Housh, M; Ohar, Z				Housh, Mashor; Ohar, Ziv			Integrating physically based simulators with Event Detection Systems: Multi-site detection approach	WATER RESEARCH												The Fault Detection (FD) Problem in control theory concerns of monitoring a system to identify when a fault has occurred. Two approaches can be distinguished for the FD: Signal processing based FD and Model-based FD. The former concerns of developing algorithms to directly infer faults from sensors' readings, while the latter uses a simulation model of the real-system to analyze the discrepancy between sensors' readings and expected values from the simulation model. Most contamination Event Detection Systems (EDSs) for water distribution systems have followed the signal processing based FD, which relies on analyzing the signals from monitoring stations independently of each other, rather than evaluating all stations simultaneously within an integrated network. In this study, we show that a model-based EDS which utilizes a physically based water quality and hydraulics simulation models, can outperform the signal processing based EDS. We also show that the model-based EDS can facilitate the development of a Multi-Site EDS (MSEDS), which analyzes the data from all the monitoring stations simultaneously within an integrated network. The advantage of the joint analysis in the MSEDS is expressed by increased detection accuracy (higher true positive alarms and fewer false alarms) and shorter detection time. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Challenges with secondary use of multi-source water-quality data in the United States	WATER RESEARCH												Combining water-quality data from multiple sources can help counterbalance diminishing resources for stream monitoring in the United States and lead to important regional and national insights that would not otherwise be possible. Individual monitoring organizations understand their own data very well, but issues can arise when their data are combined with data from other organizations that have used different methods for reporting the same common metadata elements. Such use of multi-source data is termed "secondary use"-the use of data beyond the original intent determined by the organization that collected the data. In this study, we surveyed more than 25 million nutrient records collected by 488 organizations in the United States since 1899 to identify major inconsistencies in metadata elements that limit the secondary use of multi-source data. Nearly 14.5 million of these records had missing or ambiguous information for one or more key metadata elements, including (in decreasing order of records affected) sample fraction, chemical form, parameter name, units of measurement, precise numerical value, and remark codes. As a result, metadata harmonization to make secondary use of these multi source data will be time consuming, expensive, and inexact. Different data users may make different assumptions about the same ambiguous data, potentially resulting in different conclusions about important environmental issues. The value of these ambiguous data is estimated at $US12 billion, a substantial collective investment by water-resource organizations in the United States. By comparison, the value of unambiguous data is estimated at $US8.2 billion. The ambiguous data could be preserved for uses beyond the original intent by developing and implementing standardized metadata practices for future and legacy water-quality data throughout the United States.

Effects of nitrate addition on water column methylmercury in Occoquan Reservoir, Virginia, USA	WATER RESEARCH												Mercury bioaccumulation in aquatic biota poses a widespread threat to human and environmental health. Methylmercury (MeHg), the toxic form of mercury, tends to build up under anaerobic conditions in the profundal zones of lakes. In this study we performed a two-year assessment of spatial and temporal patterns of dissolved oxygen, nitrate, MeHg, manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe) in Occoquan Reservoir, a large run-of-the-river drinking water reservoir in Virginia, USA. A tributary to the reservoir receives input of nitrate-rich tertiary-treated wastewater that enhances the oxidant capacity of bottom water. Multiple lines of evidence supported the hypothesis that the presences of nitrate and/or oxygen in bottom water correlated with low MeHg in bottom water. Bottom water MeHg was significantly lower in a nitrate-rich tributary (annual mean of 0.05 ng/L in both 2012 and 2013) compared to a nitrate-poor tributary (annual mean of 0.58 ng/L in 2012 and 0.21 ng/L in 2013). The presence of nitrate and oxygen in bottom water corresponded with significantly lower bottom water MeHg at an upstream station in the main reservoir (0.05 versus 0.11 ng/L in 2013). In 2012 the reservoir exhibited a longitudinal gradient with nitrate and oxygen decreasing and MeHg and Mn increasing downstream. In both study years, there was a clear threshold of oxygen equivalent (3-5 mg/L), a metric that combines the oxidant capacity of nitrate and oxygen, above which MeHg (<0.05 ng/L), Mn (<0.3 mg/L) and Fe (<0.5 mg/L) were low. Results indicated that the addition of nitrate-rich tertiary-treated wastewater to the bottom of anaerobic reservoirs can reduce MeHg concentrations, and potentially decrease mercury bioaccumulation, while increasing the safe water yield for potable use.

J	Al-Isawi, R; Ray, S; Scholz, M				Al-Isawi, Rawaa; Ray, Sanak; Scholz, Miklis			Comparative study of domestic wastewater treatment by mature vertical-flow constructed wetlands and artificial ponds	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												This study compares the performance, design and operation variables of two wetland technologies treating domestic wastewater: an experimental artificial pond system and a mature experimental vertical-flow constructed wetland system. The wetland system planted with Phragmites australis (Cay.) Trin. ex Steud. (common reeds) was operated between June 2011 and October 2015, while the pond system was only operated between July 2015 and October 2015. Three different types of ponds were compared: ponds with wastewater; ponds with wastewater and reeds; and ponds with wastewater, reeds and aeration. Findings regarding the performances of mature wetlands showed that the wetland systems improved the water quality except for ortho-phosphate-phosphorus (PO4-P), where the treatment performance reduced slightly over time. In general, the aerated pond systems showed better treatment performances in terms of ammonia-nitrogen (NH4-N) and PO4-P. Both systems were linked with medium to high levels of five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) removal. The highest COD and SS removals were observed for wetlands in comparison to ponds. Moreover, mature wetlands were better in removing NH4-N and PO4-P than ponds unless the ponds were aerated. The nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) concentration increased in the aerated ponds reflecting the high oxygen availability. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Our goal is to make a forecast of this parameter in Central Europe's most important river with the use of other, easily measurable water quality parameters (pH, temperature, electrical conductivity and runoff) with the use of linear and nonlinear models. We adapt four models for forecasting dissolved oxygen concentration, namely a Multivariate Linear Regression model, a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network, a Radial Basis Function Neural Network and a General Regression Neural Network model. Data is available for Hungarian sampling locations on River Danube (Mohacs, Fajsz and Gyorzamoly) for the period of 1998-2003. The analysis was performed with four alternative combinations, the models were formulated using data from the period 1998-2002 and a dissolved oxygen forecast was made for 2003. Evaluating model performance with various statistical measures (root mean square error, mean absolute error, coefficient of determination, and Willmott's index of agreement), we found that nonlinear models gave better results than linear models. In two cases the General Regression Neural Network provided the best performance, in two other cases the Radial Basis Function Neural Network gave the best results. A further goal was to conduct a sensitivity analysis in order to identify the parameter with the highest influence on the performance of the created models. Sensitivity analysis was performed for the combination of all three sampling locations (4th combination) and it was found that for all three neural network models sensitivity analyses showed that pH has the most important role in estimating dissolved oxygen content.

J	Richards, PJ; Williams, NSG; Fletcher, TD; Farrell, C				Richards, Paul J.; Williams, Nicholas S. G.; Fletcher, Tim D.; Farrell, Claire			Can raingardens produce food and retain stormwater? Effects of substrates and stormwater application method on plant water use, stormwater retention and yield	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Raingardens capture and filter urban stormwater using sandy soils and drought-tolerant plants. An emerging question is whether raingardens can also be used as vegetable gardens, potentially increasing their popularity and implementation. A successful vegetable raingarden Will need to both retain stormwater and produce vegetables, despite potential water deficits between rainfall events. To determine whether raingardens can provide this dual functionality, we undertook a greenhouse pot experiment using two different substrates (loamy sand raingarden substrate and potting mix typical of containerised vegetable growing) and two methods of stormwater application ('sub-surface' and 'surface' watering) with the water quantity at each application determined by average Melbourne summer rainfall. Overall, potting mix produced bigger plants (biomass and leaf area) and greater yield than did the loamy sand. Yield effects were variable: tomato yield was unaffected by treatment, bean yield was greatest in potting mix, beetroot yield was greatest with sub-surface watering and parsley yield was greatest with surface watering. Bigger plants also had greater transpiration, which meant that stormwater retention was greatest for parsley and tomato plants growing in potting mix with surface watering. Although, a raingarden with potting mix and surface application of stormwater was optimal for producing food and retaining stormwater under our rainfall regime, potting mix could be problematic due to higher nutrient leaching and breakdown over time. Therefore, we recommend using a mix of loamy sand and potting mix. However, the choice of substrate and watering treatment require trade-offs between yield, stormwater retention and potential implications for water quality and long-term stability of hydraulic properties.

The experiment was performed for 73 days and two treatments were evaluated: plants and control (without plants), with four replicates. Each experimental unit consisted of an 800 L tank, a 40 L conical bottom settling chamber, and a hydroponic bench with 0.4 m(2) of planting area and a capacity for 40 plants. The water from the shrimp tank was pumped continuously to the settling chamber and the overflow was distributed to the channels to irrigate the plants, then returned to the tank by gravity. Tanks were stocked with 250 shrimp m(-3) (1.4 +/- 0.0 g). Shrimp were fed a commercial diet containing 35% crude protein, four times per day. At the end of the experiment, total nitrogen was determined in the shrimp, the plants and the ration, as well as antioxidant activity and total phenolic compounds in Sarcocornia. The water quality remained within the acceptable limits for the culture of marine shrimp. No significant differences were observed in the performance of L. vannamei. The final biomass of shrimp was 2.1 +/- 0.1 kg m(-3), with a survival rate of 73.5 +/- 1.9%, a final average weight of 11.7 +/- 0.4 g, and a feed conversion ratio of 1.7 +/- 0.1. The production of plants was 8.2 +/- 0.3 kg m(-2). The antioxidant activity in S. ambigua was 38.3 +/- 1.3 mu mol TEAC 100 g(-1) FM, which characterizes this species as a functional food. The recovery of nitrogen supplied to the system through the ration was higher in the plants treatment (39.3%) than in the control (31.4%). In the proposed aquaponic system it was possible to produce 2 kg of plants for each kilogram of shrimp, integrating the production of L. vannamei and S. ambigua, and thus improve the use of nutrients in the culture.

J	Zhou, SB; He, YX; Yuan, XZ; Peng, SC; Yue, JS				Zhou, Shangbo; He, Yixin; Yuan, Xingzhong; Peng, Shuchan; Yue, Junsheng			Greenhouse gas emissions from different land-use areas in the Littoral Zone of the Three Gorges Reservoir, China	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												A series of ecological projects, including forest and dike-pond projects, were constructed in the littoral zone of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) to maintain the ecological safety of this area. Previous ecological designs mainly focused on the functions of ecological engineering for environmental purification, economic value and increased biodiversity. However, the variations in land-use may alter the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), which were ignored in our previous design. In this paper, the carbon sequestration benefits of ecological engineering were evaluated after dynamically monitoring the GHG emissions from different land-use sites during the growing (April-September) and submerged (October-March) seasons. The results showed that CH4 fluxes in the dike-ponds (3.76 CH4-mg m(-2) h(-1)) and rice paddies (6.09 +/- 1.60 mg-CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) were significantly higher than those in the natural littoral zone (0.77 +/- 0.27 mg-CH4 m(-2) mg-CH(4)m(-2) h(-1)) and forest project (0.57 +/- 0.31 mg-CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) during the growing season. There were no significant differences in the CO2 fluxes from different land-use sites. The emission of N2O from different land-use sites was low and ranged from -0.02 to 0.07 mg-N2O m(-2) h(-1). The growing season contributed to more than 76% of the cumulative annual GHG emissions. Direct GHG emissions and the carbon sequestration ability of species determined the net carbon sinks in the littoral zone. Net carbon sinks in the forest projects with different understory plant communities showed a small variation, with a range of -2.58 to 3.40 t-CO2 ha(-1) year(-1), but the design of the dike-pond projects should favor species that are positive net carbon sinks, e.g., Sagittaria (19.76 t-CO2 ha(-1) y(-1)) and Canna generalis (16.79 t-CO2 ha(-1) y(-1)), rather than those that are negative net carbon sinks, e.g., Trapa natans (-11.79 t-CO2 ha(-1) y(-1)).

J	Migheli, M				Migheli, Matteo			Land ownership and use of pesticides. Evidence from the Mekong Delta	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Massive use of pesticides is one of the major environmental problems in developing countries. I analyse the correlation between land ownership and use of pesticides in the Mekong Delta. Landowners may either use more or less pesticides than renters do. Indeed, pesticides increase land productivity in the short run, while decrease it in the long run. Therefore landowners trade-off immediate and future profits, which include also the value of the land that depends on its productivity. Differently from the extant literature this paper does not consider simply land ownership, but the share of the total land cultivated by the household that the household itself owns. Using data from the World Bank covering 603 farmer households in the Mekong Delta, this paper shows that as the share of cultivated land owned increases, so does the quantity of pesticides used. Policy recommendations may be derived: the governments of developing countries should strengthen their efforts to sensitise and to educate the owners of small farms to use agrochemicals correctly.

New Insights on the Nitrogen Footprint of a Coastal Megalopolis from Coral-Hosted Symbiodinium delta N-15	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The development of megalopolises in coastal areas is often linked with severe eutrophication, requiring mitigation of anthropogenic dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) pollution. Yet, identifying the DIN-sources responsible for eutrophication is challenging, hampering mitigation efforts. Here, we utilize the stable nitrogen isotope ratio of endosymbiotic dinoflagellate Symbiodinium spp. (delta N-15(sym)) associated with the hard coral Porites to trace DIN sources in one of the most urbanized areas of the planet: the Pearl River Delta (PRD). The mean delta N-15(sym) value found in the coastal waters of Hong Kong (HK), located on the eastern edge of the PRD, (7.4 parts per thousand +/- 1.2 parts per thousand) was +2.7 parts per thousand higher than at Dongsha Atoll, a reference site unaffected by anthropogenic-DIN (4.7 parts per thousand +/- 0.4 parts per thousand). The isotopic enrichment suggested a consistent dominance of DIN deriving from local and regional sewage discharges on the eastern edge of HK. Furthermore, the strong depletion of the summer delta N-15(sym) value (-1.6 parts per thousand) observed in southern HK revealed that the Pearl River plume strongly modulates the coastal DIN pool. Our results revealed the value of benthic marine organisms' delta N-15 for deciphering the complex dynamics of coastal eutrophication and highlighted the pivotal role of transboundary coordination in DIN-pollution mitigation.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				FEB 21	2017	51	4					1981	1987		10.1021/acs.est.6b03407								WOS:000394724300010	28085273

Newly isolated Enterococci faecalis bacterial strains AIM06 (DSM100702) and SR14 (DSM100701) demonstrated 100% specificity and 90% sensitivity to human sewage without detecting 68 animal manure pooled samples of cats, chickens, cows, dogs, ducks, pigs, and pigeons. AIM06 and SR14 bacteriophages were present in human sewage at 2-4 orders of magnitude. A principal component analysis confirmed the importance of both phages as main water quality parameters. The phages presented only in the polluted water, as classified by a cluster analysis, and at median concentrations of 1.71 X 10(2) and 4.27 X 10(2) PFU/100 mL, respectively, higher than nonhost specific RYC2056 phages and sewage-specific KS148 phages (p < 0.05). Interestingly, AIM06 and SR14 phages exhibited significant correlations with each other and with total coliforms, E. coli, enterococci, biochemical oxygen demand (Kendall's tau = 0.348 to 0.605, p < 0.05), a result supporting their roles as water quality indicators. This research demonstrates the multiregional applicability of enterococci hosts in MST application and highlights the significance of multivariate analysis with nondetects in evaluating the performance of new MST host strains.

Three ponds replenished with RW in three cities in China were chosen to investigate 22 indexes of water quality in five categories. This was achieved by comparing three pairs of ponds in the three different cities, where one pond in each pair was replenished with RW and the other with surface water (SW). The nutrients condition, heavy metal concentration and ecotoxicity did not differ significantly between RW- and SW-replenished ponds. By contrast, significant differences were observed in algal growth and pathogen risk. RW ponds presented a Cyanophyta-Chlorophyta-Bacillariophyta type with high algal diversity while SW ponds presented a Cyanophyta type with low diversity. Regrowth of bacterial pathogens and especially survival of viral pathogens in RW, was the main driver behind the higher risk for RW ponds compared with SW ones. The duration of RW replenishment was proved to have a marked impact on the algal growth and pathogen risk. With continued RW replenishment, non dominant algal species subjected to decrease while dominant species were enhanced resulting in the biomass increasing but diversity declining, and the risk posed by viral pathogens might become greater.

As of now, there is no globally consistent information available on concentrations of dissolved POPs in water bodies. The advance of passive sampling techniques has made it possible to establish a global monitoring program for these compounds in the waters of the world, which we call the Aquatic Global Passive Sampling (AQUA-GAPS) network. A recent expert meeting discussed the background, motivations, and strategic approaches of AQUA-GAPS, and its implementation as a network of networks for monitoring organic contaminants (e.g., POPs and others contaminants of concern). Initially, AQUA-GAPS will demonstrate its operating principle via two proof-of-concept studies focused on the detection of legacy and emerging POPs in freshwater and coastal marine sites using both polyethylene and silicone passive samplers. AQUA-GAPS is set up as a decentralized network, which is open to other participants from around the world to participate in deployments and to initiate new studies. In particular, participants are sought to initiate deployments and studies investigating the presence of legacy and emerging POPs in Africa, Central, and South America.

Source Apportionment of Atmospheric Polychlorinated Biphenyls in New Jersey 1997-2011	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the Delaware River currently exceed the Water Quality Criteria of 16 pg/L for the sum of PCBs due in part to atmospheric deposition. The purpose of this work was to use a source apportionment tool called Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) to identify the sources of PCBs to the atmosphere in this area and determine whether their concentrations are declining over time. The data set was compiled by the Delaware Atmospheric Deposition Network (DADN) from samples taken in Camden, NJ from 1999 to 2011 and New Brunswick, NJ from 1997 to 2011. The PMF analysis revealed four resolved factors at each site. The factors that dominate the PCB burden in the atmosphere at both Camden and New Brunswick resemble Aroclor 1242. These factors declined in concentration during some portions of the monitoring period, but this decline slowed or stopped during 2003-2011. None of the factors displayed consistent declines in concentration throughout the monitoring periods, and some factors actually increased in concentration during some periods. This suggests natural attenuation alone will not control atmospheric PCB concentrations, and additional efforts are needed to control PCB atmospheric emissions as well as the numerous other sources of PCBs to the estuary.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				FEB 7	2017	51	3					1195	1202		10.1021/acs.est.6b04572								WOS:000393738700024	28051297

Spatial Models of Sewer Pipe Leakage Predict the Occurrence of Wastewater Indicators in Shallow Urban Groundwater	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Twentieth century municipal wastewater infrastructure greatly improved U.S. urban public health and water quality. However, sewer pipes deteriorate, and their accumulated structural defects may release untreated wastewater to the environment via acute breaks or insidious exfiltration. Exfiltrated wastewater constitutes a loss of potentially reusable water and delivers a complex and variable mix of contaminants to urban shallow groundwater. Yet, predicting where deteriorated sewers impinge on shallow groundwater has been challenging. Here we develop and test a spatially explicit model of exfiltration probability based on pipe attributes and groundwater elevation without prior knowledge of exfiltrating defect locations. We find that models of exfiltration probability can predict the probable occurrence in underlying shallow groundwater of established wastewater indicators including the artificial sweetener acesulfame, tryptophan-like fluorescent dissolved organic matter, nitrate, and a stable isotope of water (delta O-18). The strength of the association between exfiltration probability and indicators of wastewater increased when multiple pipe attributes, distance weighting, and groundwater flow direction were considered in the model. The results prove that available sanitary sewer databases and groundwater digital elevation data can be analyzed to predict where pipes are likely leaking and contaminating groundwater. Such understanding could direct sewer infrastructure reinvestment toward water resource protection.

ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Systemic neonicotinoid insecticides are increasingly used as a crop protection measure to suppress insect pests on trees. However, senescent foliage falling from treated trees represents a rarely studied pathway through which neonicotinoids may enter nontarget environments, e.g., surface waters. To estimate risk posed by this pathway, neonicotinoid residues were analyzed in foliage from black alder trees treated with one of three neonicotinoid insecticides (imidacloprid, thiacloprid, or acetamiprid) at five concentrations, each ranging from 0.0375-9.6 g active ingredient/cm trunk diameter at breast height (n = 3). Foliar residues measured at the time of leaf fall were used as input parameters for a model predicting imidacloprid water concentrations over a 100-m-long stream stretch as a consequence of remobilization from introduced foliage (input: 600 g foliage/m(2) containing 80 mu g imidacloprid/g). The water concentration (up to,similar to 250 mu g/L) predicted by the model exceeded the recently proposed Maximum Permissible Concentration of 8.3 mu g/L for 15.5 days. Moreover, dietary uptake was identified as an additional exposure route for aquatic organisms. The alternative pathway (i.e., introduction via leaf fall) and exposure route (i.e., dietary uptake) associated with the systemic nature of neonicotinoids should be accounted for during their registration process in order to safeguard ecosystem integrity.

Evidence of Sulfate-Dependent Anaerobic Methane Oxidation within an Area Impacted by Coalbed Methane-Related Gas Migration	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												We evaluated water quality characteristics in the northern Raton Basin of Colorado and documented the response of the Poison Canyon aquifer system several years after upward migration of methane gas occurred from the deeper Vermejo Formation coalbed production zone. Results show persistent secondary water quality impacts related to the biodegradation of methane. We identify four distinct characteristics of groundwater- methane attenuation in the Poison Canyon aquifer: (i) consumption of methane and sulfate and production of sulfide and bicarbonate, (ii) methane loss coupled to production of higher molecular weight (C2+) gaseous hydrocarbons, (iii) patterns of C-13 enrichment and depletion in methane an\d dissolved inorganic carbon, and (iv) a systematic shift in sulfur and oxygen isotope ratios of sulfate, indicative of microbial sulfate reduction. We also show that the biogeochemical response of the aquifer system has not mobilized naturally occurring trace metals, including arsenic, chromium, cobalt, nickel, and lead, likely due to the microbial production of hydrogen sulfide which favors stabilization of metals in aquifer solids.

Occurrence of UV filters, fragrances and organophosphate flame retardants in municipal WWTP effluents and their removal during membrane post-treatment	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS					14th International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology (CEST)	SEP 03-05, 2015	Rhodes, GREECE					Membrane filtration using ultrafiltration (UF), nanofiltration (NF) or reverse osmosis (RO) membranes was evaluated as an efficient effluent polishing step at municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) for the removal of selected contaminants of emerging concern and for improvement of water quality according to water reuse requirements. In samples collected at two largest WWTPs in Norway, 12 out of 14 selected personal care products and organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) were found above analytical detection limit. The highest concentrations were observed for BP3, OC (UV filters), HHCB, AHTN (fragrances), TCPP and TBP (OPFRs), exceeding the predicted no-effect concentration for BP3 in one sample and AHTN in five samples. Independently of the membrane type used, membrane filtration effectively (>60%) removed BP3, UV-329, OC, HHCB, AHTN and DBPP. However, UF was insufficient (<20%) for removal of DEET, TCPP and TCEP. UF was sufficient to remove 30-50% of COD, 80-95% of TP, up to 30% of TN and NH4, and a min of 2 log reduction of E. coli. Water quality improved further with application of NF and RO. The results indicate that membrane filtration can be effective post-treatment to improve overall water quality and a measure to reduce potential risk in the receiving aquatic environment.

Novel pre-treatments to control bromate formation during ozonation	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS					14th International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology (CEST)	SEP 03-05, 2015	Rhodes, GREECE					Worldwide water shortage increase and water quality depletion from microbial and chemical compounds, pose significant challenges for today's water treatment industry. Both the development of new advanced oxidation technologies, but also the enhancement of existing conventional technologies is of high interest. This study tested improvements to conventional ozonation that reduce the formation of the oxidation-by-product bromate, while maintaining the effectiveness for removal emerging contaminants (atrazine). MnO4-, ClO2-, ClO2, ClO-, CH3COOO-, HSO5- or S2O5-2 with NH4+ were tested as pre-treatments to ozonation of ground water. Each oxidant and NH4+ were added in a single stage or separately prior to zonation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that has tested all the above-mentioned oxidants for the same water matrix. Based on our results, the most promising pre-treatments were MnO4- NH4+, ClO2- NH4+ and ClO2 NH4+. MnO4- NH4+ was the only pretreatment that did not inhibit atrazine removal. When compared with the previously proposed Cl-2/NH4+ pre-treatment, MnO4- + NH4+ was found as effective for preventing BrO3- formation, while atrazine removal was higher. In addition, MnO4- +NH4+ can be added in a single stage (compared to the 2 stage addition of Cl-2/NH4+) without causing the formation of potentially harmful chlorination-by-products.

J	Wu, YH; Han, R; Yang, XN; Zhang, YK; Zhang, RD				Wu, Yinghai; Han, Rui; Yang, Xunan; Zhang, Yukui; Zhang, Renduo			Long-term performance of an integrated constructed wetland for advanced treatment of mixed wastewater	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												The aim of this study was to investigate long-term performance of a full-scale integrated constructed wetland (CW) system for advanced treatment of sanitary and industrial mixed wastewater. The system consisted of a vertical subsurface flow (VSF) CW, a free water surface (FWS) CW, and a horizontal subsurface flow (HSF) CW in series. Results from six-year operation showed that the system resulted in average removal efficiencies of 70%, 70%, 34%, 52%, 45%, 74%, 21%, 43%, and 98% for COD, NH4-N, NO3-N, TN, TP, TSS, F-, Ni, and E. coli, respectively. Especially, NH4-N was effectively removed by the VSF CW. With relatively high hydraulic loading rates (18.0-43.6 cm d(-1)) and short hydraulic retention times (1.04-2.51 d), the removal efficiencies of the system were quite stable for most of the water quality parameters, while the removal efficiency of TN increased from 49% to 60% during the six years. The removal efficiencies of the system were generally stable with the change of seasons. This study demonstrates that the VSF + FWS + HSF CW system can be a valuable approach for advanced wastewater treatment to meet the more stringent discharge requirement. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Hence it is important to develop an eco-friendly and cost effective technology to treat the dyes contaminated wastewater. In this research, laccase enzyme mediated biodegradation of toxic textile dyes such as congo red and gentian violet was investigated using novel, newly isolated laccase producing Pseudomonas stutzeri MN1 and Acinetobacter baumannii MN3. Response surface methodology (RSM) with full factorial central composite design (CCD) was applied to optimize pH (pH 6.0-10.0), starch (1-3%) and yeast extract (0.1-0.3%). The RSM results show that a maximum of 29.41 U/mL and 41.76 U/mL laccase activity was achieved by MN1 and MN3, respectively under optimum conditions (pH 8.0, 2% starch and 0.2% yeast extract). The congo red decolorization studies by MN1, MN3 and mixed consortia (MN1 + MN3) showed 84%, 89% and 97% decolourization efficiency, respectively. The gentian violet was decolorized up to 83%, 90% and 95% by MN1, MN3 and mixed consortia (MN1 + MN3), respectively. Phytotoxicity assay showed100% germination of Vigna radiata in presence of decolorized synthetic congo red and gentian violet. Crude extract of laccase decolorized congo red and gentian violet up to 70% and 84% respectively within 24 h. The laccase producing MN1 and MN3 strains can be used to decolorize and detoxify the textile effluents and assist in wastewater treatment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Peng, RC; Yu, P; Luo, YB				Peng, Ruichao; Yu, Ping; Luo, Yunbai			Coke Plant Wastewater Posttreatment by Fenton and Electro-Fenton Processes	ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE												After conventional biological treatment processes, effluents of the coking industry contain high concentration of nonbiodegradable and refractory organic matters, which should be treated to satisfy the discharge water quality standards (chemical oxygen demand [COD] < 150 mg/L, NH3-N< 25 mg/L). In this study, post-treatment of coke plant wastewater was treated by the direct Fenton and anodic electro-Fenton (EF-Feox) methods. COD and total organic carbon (TOC) values were selected as the target parameters. COD and TOC removal efficiency was investigated through changing some operating parameters such as initial pH, initial H2O2 concentration, and current density. Under the optimum operating conditions of each progress, COD and TOC were removed more efficiently in the EF-Feox system (90% and 84.4%) compared with that in the Fenton method (61.96% and 48.12%). Influence of H2O2 feeding on removal efficiency was also investigated in this study. Results indicated that gradual addition of H2O2 instead of initial addition was a simple and convenient means of removing COD and TOC effectively. Furthermore, settling characteristics of waste sludge under different operating conditions was studied. In general, the EF-Feox process can be a promising and reasonable method in the post-treatment of coking wastewater.																	1092-8758	1557-9018				FEB	2017	34	2					89	95		10.1089/ees.2015.0520								WOS:000394186600004

A formal Bayesian approach is adopted for the calibration and the uncertainty analysis of a commonly used wash-off model under (1) the unverified assumption of homoscedastic, independent, and normally distributed residuals; and (2) using a more correct heteroscedastic and autoregressive error model. The results obtained for each of these approaches are compared, and the uncertainty associated with water quality modeling is later propagated through a conceptual best management practices (BMP) model for various stormwater management scenarios so as to assess the effect of this uncertainty for BMP modeling and clarify the benefits of a robust description of error structure. This study indicates that the violation of the statistical assumptions about the residuals may result in unreliable estimation of model parameters and total predictive uncertainty. However, the effect of the uncertainty in the intraevent variability of concentrations in runoff is found to have only a limited effect on the outputs of the BMP model, regardless of the error model adopted for calibration.

Using a High-Capacity Chemically Activated Cow Bone to Remove Fluoride: Field-Scale Column Tests and Laboratory Regeneration Studies	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												In this study, a novel material, chemically activated cow bone (CAB), was further evaluated for fluoride removal via laboratory batch and field column studies using fluoride-impacted groundwaters in the Rift Valley of Ethiopia. Regeneration of the exhausted CAB was evaluated using 0.05 M NaOH and 0.01 M Ca(OH)(2) solutions. Water-quality parameters were analyzed to ensure that the CAB-treated water is safe for human consumption. The study indicated that the CAB produced in the laboratory and field showed fourfold improvement in fluoride removal capacity as compared to thermally activated cow bone (commonly known as bone char). The study also showed that more than 92% adsorption capacity of the exhausted CAB media can be regained using 0.05 M NaOH and 0.01 M Ca(OH)(2) solutions. The water-quality analysis conducted on the highly fluoride-impacted drinking waters treated using CAB media were found to be safe for public consumption. Therefore, these results further reinforce that CAB media can be used to provide access to safe drinking water for communities living in highly fluoride-impacted areas in developing countries and beyond.

Two SWAT models were created over two discrete time periods (1981-1990 and 2005-2014) for each watershed. National Land Cover Datasets 1992 and 2011 were, respectively, ingested into 1981-1990 and 2005-2014 models, along with corresponding weather data, to enable comparison of annual and seasonal runoff, soil water content, evapotranspiration (ET), water yield, and percolation between these two decades. Simulation results based on the calibrated models showed that surface runoff, soil water content, water yield, and percolation increased in all three watersheds. Elevated ET was also apparent, except in Skunk Creek watershed. Differences in annual water balance components appeared to follow changes in land use more closely than variation in precipitation amounts, although seasonal variation in precipitation was reflected in seasonal surface runoff. Subbasin-scale spatial analyses revealed noticeable increases in water balance components mostly in downstream parts of Bad River and Skunk Creek watersheds, and the western part of Upper Big Sioux River watershed. Results presented in this study provide some insight into recent changes in hydrological processes in South Dakota watersheds.

The PRISM data resulted in a better fit to the calibration data (Nash Sutcliffe efficiency [NSE]=0.64, Kling-Gupta efficiency [KGE]=0.74, p-factor=0.84, and r-factor=0.43) than the CFSR data (NSE=0.47, KGE=0.53, p-factor=0.67, and r-factor=0.39). Validation results were similar. Sensitive parameters were similar in both the PRISM and CFSR models, but fitted values indicated more rapid groundwater flow to the streams with the PRISM data. The same comparison was made in the Big Creek watershed located approximately 1,000km away, in central Louisiana. Results were similar with a more responsive groundwater system indicating PRISM data may produce better predictions of streamflow because of a more accurate estimate of rainfall within a watershed or because of a denser grid. Our study implies PRISM is providing a better estimate than CFSR of precipitation within a watershed when rain gauge data are not available, resulting in more accurate simulations of streamflows at the watershed outlet.

Testing of the Modified Streambank Erosion and Instream Phosphorus Routines for the SWAT Model	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												In some watersheds, streambanks are a source of two major pollutants, phosphorus (P) and sediment. P originating from both uplands and streambanks can be transported and stored indefinitely on floodplains, streambanks, and in closed depressions near the stream. The objectives of this study were to (1) test the modified streambank erosion and instream P routines for the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model in the Barren Fork Creek watershed in northeast Oklahoma, (2) predict P in the watershed with and without streambank-derived P, and (3) determine the significance of streambank erosion P relative to overland P sources. Measured streambank and channel parameters were incorporated into a flow-calibrated SWAT model and used to estimate streambank erosion and P for the Barren Fork Creek using modified streambank erosion and instream P routines. The predicted reach-weighted streambank erosion was 40kg/m vs. the measured 42kg/m. Streambank erosion contributed 47% of the total P to the Barren Fork Creek and improved P predictions compared to observed data, especially during the high-flow events. Of the total P entering the stream system, approximately 65% was removed via the watershed outlet and 35% was stored in the floodplain and stream system. This study successfully applied the SWAT model's modified streambank erosion and instream P routines and demonstrated that streambank-derived P can improve P modeling at the watershed scale.

It is expected to improve code development and maintenance; support data availability, analysis, and visualization; and enhance the model's capabilities in terms of the spatial representation of elements and processes within watersheds. The most important change is the implementation of landscape units and flow and pollutant routing across the landscape. Also, SWAT+ offers more flexibility than SWAT in defining management schedules, routing constituents, and connecting managed flow systems to the natural stream network. To test the basic hydrologic function of SWAT+, it was applied to the Little River Experimental Watershed (Georgia) without enhanced overland routing and compared with previous models. SWAT+ gave similar results and inaccuracies as these models did for streamflow and water balance. Taking full advantage of the new capabilities of SWAT+ regarding watershed discretization and landscape and river interactions is expected to improve simulations in future studies. While many capabilities of SWAT have already been enhanced in SWAT+ and new capabilities have been added, the model will continue to evolve in response to advancements in scientific knowledge and the demands of the growing worldwide user community.

Estimation of Catchment Nutrient Loads in New Zealand Using Monthly Water Quality Monitoring Data	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Causes of variation between loads estimated using alternative calculation methods and their repeatability were investigated using 20years of daily flow and monthly concentration samples for 77 rivers in New Zealand. Loads of dissolved and total nitrogen and phosphorus were calculated using the Ratio, L5, and L7 methods. Estimates of loads and their precision associated with short-term records of 5, 10, and 15years were simulated by subsampling. The representativeness of the short-term loads was quantified as the standard deviation of the 20 realizations. The L7 method generally produced more realistic loads with the highest precision and representativeness. Differences between load estimates were shown to be associated with poor agreement between the data and the underlying model. The best method was shown to depend on the match between the model and functional and distributional characteristics of the data, rather than on the contaminant. Short-term load estimates poorly represented the long-term load estimate, and deviations frequently exceeded estimated imprecision. The results highlight there is no single preferred load calculation method, the inadvisability of unsupervised load estimation and the importance of inspecting concentration-flow, unit load-flow plots and regression residuals. Regulatory authorities should be aware that the precision of loads estimated from monthly data are likely to be optimistic with respect to the actual repeatability of load estimates.																	1093-474X	1752-1688				FEB	2017	53	1					158	178		10.1111/1752-1688.12492								WOS:000394779000013

Numerical and Qualitative Contrasts of Two Statistical Models for Water Quality Change in Tidal Waters	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Two statistical approaches, weighted regression on time, discharge, and season and generalized additive models, have recently been used to evaluate water quality trends in estuaries. Both models have been used in similar contexts despite differences in statistical foundations and products. This study provided an empirical and qualitative comparison of both models using 29years of data for two discrete time series of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) in the Patuxent River estuary. Empirical descriptions of each model were based on predictive performance against the observed data, ability to reproduce flow-normalized trends with simulated data, and comparisons of performance with validation datasets. Between-model differences were apparent but minor and both models had comparable abilities to remove flow effects from simulated time series. Both models similarly predicted observations for missing data with different characteristics. Trends from each model revealed distinct mainstem influences of the Chesapeake Bay with both models predicting a roughly 65% increase in chl-a over time in the lower estuary, whereas flow-normalized predictions for the upper estuary showed a more dynamic pattern, with a nearly 100% increase in chl-a in the last 10years. Qualitative comparisons highlighted important differences in the statistical structure, available products, and characteristics of the data and desired analysis.

Multi-Year Microbial Source Tracking Study Characterizing Fecal Contamination in an Urban Watershed	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												Microbiological and hydrological data were used to rank tributary stream contributions of bacteria to the Little Blue River in Independence, Missouri. Concentrations, loadings and yields of E. coli and microbial source tracking (MST) markers, were characterized during base flow and storm events in five subbasins within Independence, as well as sources entering and leaving the city through the river. The E. coli water quality threshold was exceeded in 29% of base-flow and 89% of storm-event samples. The total contribution of E. coli and MST markers from tributaries within Independence to the Little Blue River, regardless of streamflow, did not significantly increase the median concentrations leaving the city. Daily loads and yields of E. coli and MST markers were used to rank the subbasins according to their contribution of each constituent to the river. The ranking methodology used in this study may prove useful in prioritizing remediation in the different subbasins.

Chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC), and fluorescence spectroscopy are also capable of quantifying organic content, although the mechanisms of quantification and the organic fractions targeted differ for each test. This study explores correlations between BOD5 and these alternate test procedures using facility influent, primary effluent, and facility effluent samples from a full-scale water resource recovery facility. Relative reductions of the water quality parameters proved to be strong indicators of their suitability as surrogates for BOD5. Suitable correlations were generally limited to the combined datasets for the three sampling locations or the facility effluent alone. COD exhibited relatively strong linear correlations with BOD5 when considering the three sample points (r = 0.985) and the facility effluent alone (r = 0.914), while TOC exhibited a suitable linear correlation with BOD5 in the facility effluent (r = 0.902). Exponential regressions proved to be useful for estimating BOD5 based on TOC or fluorescence (r > 0.95).																	1061-4303	1554-7531				FEB 1	2017	89	2					168	177		10.2175/106143016X14504669768976								WOS:000397280800007	27074790					
J	Shi, W; Xia, J				Shi, Wei; Xia, Jun			Combined risk assessment of nonstationary monthly water quality based on Markov chain and time-varying copula	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Water quality risk management is a global hot research linkage with the sustainable water resource development. Ammonium nitrogen (NH3-N) and permanganate index (CODMn) as the focus indicators in Huai River Basin, are selected to reveal their joint transition laws based on Markov theory. The time-varying moments model with either time or land cover index as explanatory variables is applied to build the time-varying marginal distributions of water quality time series. Time-varying copula model, which takes the non-stationarity in the marginal distribution and/or the time variation in dependence structure between water quality series into consideration, is constructed to describe a bivariate frequency analysis for NH3-N and CODMn series at the same monitoring gauge. The larger first-order Markov joint transition probability indicates water quality state Class V-w, Class IV and Class III will occur easily in the water body of Bengbu Sluice. Both marginal distribution and copula models are nonstationary, and the explanatory variable time yields better performance than land cover index in describing the non-stationarities in the marginal distributions. In modelling the dependence structure changes, time-varying copula has a better fitting performance than the copula with the constant or the time-trend dependence parameter. The largest synchronous encounter risk probability of NH3-N and CODMn simultaneously reaching Class V is 50.61%, while the asynchronous encounter risk probability is largest when NH3-N and CODMn is inferior to class V and class IV water quality standards, respectively.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				FEB	2017	75	3					693	704		10.2166/wst.2016.553								WOS:000394350100021	28192363

Therefore, a combination of principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of a data set and artificial neural networks (ANNs) for forecasting purposes was used. The results obtained were compared with those obtained by using discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The proposed methodology was applied to four absorbance time series data sets composed by a total number of 5705 UV-Vis spectra. Absolute percentage errors obtained by applying the proposed PCA/ANN methodology vary between 10% and 13% for all four study sites. In general terms, the results obtained were hardly generalizable, as they appeared to be highly dependent on specific dynamics of the water system; however, some trends can be outlined. PCA/ANN methodology gives better results than PCA/DFT forecasting procedure by using a specific spectra range for the following conditions: (i) for Salitre wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) (first hour) and Graz West R05 (first 18 min), from the last part of UV range to all visible range; (ii) for Gibraltar pumping station (first 6 min) for all UV-Vis absorbance spectra; and (iii) for San Fernando WWTP (first 24 min) for all of UV range to middle part of visible range.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				FEB	2017	75	4					765	774		10.2166/wst.2016.524								WOS:000395820000002	28234277

Performance evaluation of 388 full-scale waste stabilization pond systems with seven different configurations	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Waste stabilization ponds (WSPs) and their variants are one the most widely used wastewater treatment systems in the world. However, the scarcity of systematic performance data from fullscale plants has led to challenges associated with their design. The objective of this research was to assess the performance of 388 full-scale WSP systems located in Brazil, Ecuador, Bolivia and the United States through the statistical analysis of available monitoring data. Descriptive statistics were calculated of the influent and effluent concentrations and the removal efficiencies for 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), total suspended solids (TSS), ammonia nitrogen (N-Ammonia), and either thermotolerant coliforms (TTC) or Escherichia coli for each WSP system, leading to a broad characterization of actual treatment performance. Compliance with different water quality and system performance goals was also evaluated. The treatment plants were subdivided into seven different categories, according to their units and flowsheet. The median influent concentrations of BOD5 and TSS were 431 mg/L and 397 mg/L and the effluent concentrations varied from technology to technology, but median values were 50 mg/L and 47 mg/L, respectively. The median removal efficiencies were 85% for BOD5 and 75% for TSS. The overall removals of TTC and E. coli were 1.74 and 1.63 log10 units, respectively. Future research is needed to better understand the influence of design, operational and environmental factors on WSP system performance.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				FEB	2017	75	4					916	927		10.2166/wst.2016.532								WOS:000395820000017	28234292

This study investigated the use of information on ionic composition as a fingerprint to identify the source land-use of stormwater runoff. We used 12 ionic species in stormwater runoff monitored for a total of 20 storm events at five sites with different land-use compositions during the 2012-2014 wet seasons. A stepwise forward discriminant function analysis (DFA) with the jack-knifed cross validation approach was used to select ionic species that better discriminate the land-use of its source. Of the 12 ionic species, 9 species (K+, Mg2+, Na+, NH4+, Br-, Cl-, F-, NO2-, and SO42-) were selected for better performance of the DFA. The DFA successfully differentiated stormwater samples from urban, rural, and construction sites using concentrations of the ionic species (70%, 95%, and 91% of correct classification, respectively). Over 80% of the new data cases were correctly classified by the trained DFA model. When applied to data cases from a mixed land-use catchment and downstream, the DFA model showed the greater impact of urban areas and rural areas respectively in the earlier and later parts of a storm event.

Evaluation of leached metals in recovered aluminum coagulants from water treatment slurry	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The water treatment industry consumes large quantities of coagulant and produces huge amounts of slurry. The cost of alum used in water treatment, stringent regulations and negative impacts of sludge disposal are the motive to do integrated research studies on the technical feasibility of aluminum coagulant recovery from sludge using acidification. This work studied the leaching of iron, manganese, and chromium as the most extracted metals with aluminum during sludge acidification; furthermore, these metals have a great impact on the recovered coagulants' efficiency and treated water quality. The sludge used was collected from El-Sheikh Zayd water treatment plant in Egypt, then dried and ground; afterward, the effect of acid concentration, sludge mass, temperature, mixing speed and mixing time was studied. In addition, it was noticeable that the efficiency of sulfuric acid in leaching iron, manganese and chromium is higher than that of hydrochloric acid. Also, higher leaching for the three metals was obtained in all the experiments using higher acid concentration, elevated temperature, and rotational speed. Finally, the leached metals in recovered aluminum coagulants will not limit its application to water and wastewater treatment, as their concentrations are still very low if compared with aluminum, even with the highest leaching efficiency.

In this study, the effect of hybrid membrane-activated carbon processes on the performance of nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) membrane systems treating mixed oil and gas field produced water was investigated. Different pre-treatment alternatives including combinations of microfiltration unit and powdered activated carbon (PAC) or granular activated carbon (GAC) systems were applied prior to nanofiltration and reverse osmosis processes. RESULTS: The activated carbon process increased chemical oxygen demand (COD) and conductivity removal efficiencies due to the organic matter and ion adsorption capacity of activated carbon. PAC addition gave the best removal efficiencies for COD, whereas highest conductivity removals were obtained in studies with GAC addition. CONCLUSION: Differences obtained in the performance of different pre-treatment alternatives based on targeted pollutants and membrane characteristics confirmed synergetic/antagonistic effects between pre- and final membrane treatment.

In this study, surface water from different sources (e.g. pond, canal, lake and river) treated with combined Moringa seed powder, and scallop powder (MOSP) at a ratio of 2:1 for 10 minutes showed a clear water layer at the top and a sediment layer at the bottom. The clear water was then passed through an eight-fold sari cloth and/or natural bio-sand filtration and the resulting water was found drinkable. The microbiological and physico-chemical quality of this water showed non-significant differences compared to the US EPA drinking water quality parameters. Moreover, no cytotoxic effect of MOSP with BHK-21 and HeLa cells, nor any bacterial endotoxins were observed, indicating use of MOSP does not pose any adverse health effect. Furthermore, the quality of 6 months stored water at room temperature was found acceptable, indicating the usefulness of this technology for drinking water purposes. On the other hand, the sediment or sludge produced in this process could be used in agricultural fields after proper composting. Therefore, this simple, inexpensive and ecofriendly method could be used in drinking water scarcity areas of the world.																	1606-9749					FEB	2017	17	1					125	137		10.2166/ws.2016.111								WOS:000394582100013

Routine culture-based methods of identifying bacterial pathogens in water sources are laborious and time-consuming. Recently, the use of molecular techniques such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has provided rapid and highly promising detection methods. In this study, we developed two multiplex PCR assays for simultaneous detection of six water-borne bacteria. Two triplex PCR protocols were developed to detect six target genes. The first protocol targets uidA (Escherichia coli), int (Shigella spp.), and gyrB (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) genes, while invA (Salmonella spp.), ompW (Vibrio cholera), and lacZ (coliforms) were amplified by the second protocol. Specificity testing was carried out for 12 reference strains. Furthermore, the applicability of the multiplex PCR assays for detection of these bacteria was investigated for 52 surface water samples. The results indicated that all primer pairs showed specificities only for their corresponding target organisms. The detection sensitivity of both multiplex PCR assays was 3 x 10(2) 3 x 10(3) colony forming units. The developed assays represent simple and efficient diagnostic procedures for co-detection of water-borne bacteria and have the potential to provide earlier warnings of possible public health threats and more accurate surveillance of these organisms.

Yet the comprehensive performance in response to complex environmental conditions remains unclear. We investigated biofilm formation and distributed water quality under various nutrients, including chlorine concentrations and hydrodynamic conditions. Results showed that environmental fluctuations collectively induced changes in microbial propagation, which were mostly associated with turbidity variations, concentrations of total organic carbon, NH4+-N and soluble phosphorus compared to the other parameters. Fuzzy pattern recognition analysis integrating multiple water quality indicators revealed that low nutrient availability and addition of mild chlorine at 0.50 mg/L at 0.50 m/s flow velocity were the most favorable conditions screened for optimized comprehensive performance, while nutrient supplements yielded significant performance deterioration. These quantitative estimations offer new insights into advanced understanding of the system performance responding to often complex environmental fluctuations, essential for optimized design and practical functioning of DWDSs.																	1606-9749					FEB	2017	17	1					267	278		10.2166/ws.2016.134								WOS:000394582100028						
J	Sousa, VS; Corniciuc, C; Teixeira, MR				Sousa, Vania Serrao; Corniciuc, Claudia; Teixeira, Margarida Ribau			The effect of TiO2 nanoparticles removal on drinking water quality produced by conventional treatment C/F/S	WATER RESEARCH												Nanoparticles, namely titanium dioxide (TiO2), are emerging contaminants widely used to commercial and industrial applications, are a potential hazard and can cause damage to environment and human health due to their toxicity. Therefore, their removal from the water is urgent to minimize or eliminate the adverse environmental and human effects. This work, investigates the efficiency of conventional coagulation/flocculation/sedimentation (C/F/S) from drinking water treatment to remove TiO2 nano particles (NPs) from surface waters, and pretends to understand if the removal of TiO2 NPs affects the ability of C/F/S to remove natural organic matter (NOM) and turbidity, and consequently affects the quality of the treated water. Results show that TiO2 NPs removal is high (>90%) for all the waters studied (hydrophobic and hydrophilic waters) and the treated water quality is not compromised (turbidity, Ti and Al concentrations, pH and conductivity are below the national and international guidelines). In addition, TiO2 initial concentrations, ranging between 0.2 and 10 mg/L, have not a significant impact on NPs removal by C/F/S. Therefore, the widely used polyaluminium based coagulants are effective in the removal of TiO2 NPs by conventional C/F/S treatment, but removal is strongly influenced by the water characteristics. Hydrophobic waters need a higher coagulant dose than hydrophilic waters to achieve the same TiO2 NPs removals, as well as water with higher UV254nm values. The principal mechanism involved in TiO2 NPs removal is charge neutralisation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Iron and manganese removal: Recent advances in modelling treatment efficiency by rapid sand filtration	WATER RESEARCH												A model has been developed that takes into account the main characteristics of (submerged) rapid filtration: the water quality parameters of the influent water, notably pH, iron(II) and manganese(II) concentrations, homogeneous oxidation in the supernatant layer, surface sorption and heterogeneous oxidation kinetics in the filter, and filter media adsorption characteristics. Simplifying assumptions are made to enable validation in practice, while maintaining the main mechanisms involved in iron(II) and manganese(II) removal. Adsorption isotherm data collected from different Dutch treatment sites show that Fe(II)/Mn(II) adsorption may vary substantially between them, but generally increases with higher pH. The model is sensitive to (experimentally) determined adsorption parameters and the heterogeneous oxidation rate. Model results coincide with experimental values when the heterogeneous rate constants are calibrated. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Photocatalytic reduction of nitrate to molecular nitrogen presents a promising approach to remove nitrate from drinking water sources. However, harmful intermediates like NO2-, NO, NO2 and N2O are usually formed, and metal loading or hole scavengers are generally needed to reduce the recombination of photo generated electrons and holes, which will cause secondary pollution to drinking water. In this work, an efficient, selective and sustainable bioelectro-photocatalytic nitrate-reducing system by utilizing commercial TiO2 nanoparticles P25 as the photocatalyst and bio-electrons from microbial metabolism as the hole scavenger is reported. In this system, bio-electrons extracted from organic substrates in bio-anode are transferred to the photocathode through an external circuit for hole quenching. With the utilization of the residual photogenerated electrons, nitrate is completely reduced to nitrogen without accumulation of harmful nitrite or ammonium. The experimental results and the mechanistic analysis using the first-principles density functional theory calculations demonstrate that toxic by-products like nitrite or ammonium will not be accumulated in this system. Thus, this approach has a great potential for sustainable remediation of nitrate-contaminated drinking water sources. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Overall, harvested rainwater is of good quality, falling within the Malaysian recreational water quality Class BB standards with exceptions for pH (18/92), ammonia (1/92), phosphates (3/92), and total coliforms (8/92). A large number of samples tested positive for Escherichia coli (22/92), total coliforms (64/92) and Chromobacterium violaceum (7/92), showing that disinfection of harvested rainwater is mandatory prior to reuse. 2/37 harvested rainwater samples exceeded lead limits in Malaysian drinking water standards, showing that consuming rainwater without additional treatment may pose a health risk. Mixing harvested rainwater with groundwater resulted in higher phosphates and total coliforms. Rainwater collected during the wet seasons have higher concentrations of suspended solids, turbidity, and Escherichia coli than dry seasons due to the antecedent dry period. Last but not least, both principal component analysis and positive matrix factorisation were conducted on 37 samples to apportion pollutant sources in harvested rainwater. 7 principal components were identified, namely: industrial dust, steel, roadside dust, faeces, organic decay, fertilisers, and plumbing. The results from principal component analysis and positive matrix factorisation were in agreement, although the latter identified mains water top-up as an additional factor responsible for dissolved solids. Both techniques are effective at apportioning pollutant sources in harvested rainwater, and show that a rainwater harvesting system should be designed carefully to reduce contributions from steel, plumbing, organic decay, bird faeces, industrial dust and roadside dust.

The results of characteristic analyses and a mobile factor calculation show that the bonding patterns of heavy metals in DS were stable and had low bioavailability and mobility. DS can effectively adsorb ammonia and phosphate according to the pseudo second-order kinetics model. The adsorption isotherm for ammonia can be described by the Langmuir model. Both the Langmuir and Freundlich models can be used for phosphate adsorption isotherm evaluation. Ammonia adsorption involved physical adsorption, and the mechanisms for phosphate removal included adsorption and chemical precipitation. The adsorption of ammonia by DS was a non-spontaneous endothermic process, and the adsorption of phosphate was a spontaneous exothermic process. The results from excitation emission fluorescence matrix analysis show that the organic substances in the fish pond with DS addition included a soluble microbial product, protein-like substance, and humic acid-like substance. This indicates that algal growth and biomass accumulation could be enhanced by DS addition because the released trace elements and hydroxide ions from DS are beneficial to algal growth. Using DS as an amendment and construction material for the fish pond would increase the water alkalinity and prevent acidification of pond water. The results indicate that DS can be used in the aquacultural industry as construction material as well as for pH control and algal growth enhancement. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Jones, TG; Willis, N; Gough, R; Freeman, C				Jones, Timothy G.; Willis, Naomi; Gough, Rachel; Freeman, Chris			An experimental use of floating treatment wetlands (FTWs) to reduce phytoplankton growth in freshwaters	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Eutrophication and the formation of phytoplankton blooms in freshwaters can be detrimental to water quality and biological health and produce organic matter that can be difficult to remove during water treatment processes. With the frequency of phytoplankton blooms increasing, remediation solutions are becoming increasingly popular. This study investigated the use of a peat-based floating treatment wetland (FTW) for reducing phytoplankton growth in eutrophic waters. Over a four-week period, the FTWs were able to reduce chlorophyll a concentrations by 80%, through sequestration of nitrate and phosphate and possibly due to the direct inhibitory properties of phenolic compounds. Although there are concerns about the leaching of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from the FTWs, this may be more than offset by the beneficial suppression of phytoplankton growth and the resulting reduced input of `untreatable' low molecular weight DOC.

Ryan			Nitrogen and phosphorus mass balance, retention and uptake in six plant species grown in stormwater bioretention microcosms	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Stormwater runoff contains high levels of nutrients, and is regulated by the Federal National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) to protect surface water quality. Stormwater bioretention (BR) systems are increasingly used to address these regulations. Planted BR systems remove significantly more pollutants than unplanted systems, but most studies do not attempt to verify a pollutant mass balance and seldom evaluate differences in nutrient uptake among species. This greenhouse experiment proved that an overall 98% recovery of Total Phosphorus (TP) mass over the study period was feasible for six plant species, ensuring accuracy of measurements and analyses. Additionally, it was found that Phragmites australis, Carex praegracilis, and Carex microptera uptake significantly more TP and Total Nitrogen (TN) mass into harvestable tissue than Typha latifolia, Scirpus validus, and Scirpus acutus. These results confirm that species selection can optimize nutrient retention and recovery from stormwater and decrease pollutant discharge to surface waters. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Dai, XY; Zhou, YQ; Ma, WC; Zhou, LG				Dai, Xiaoyan; Zhou, Yuanqing; Ma, Weichun; Zhou, Liguo			Influence of spatial variation in land-use patterns and topography on water quality of the rivers inflowing to Fuxian Lake, a large deep lake in the plateau of southwestern China	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												With the development of agriculture, industry and urbanization, land-use and land-cover (LULC) change has resulted in significant deterioration of water quality and severe eutrophication in most of the lakes in China. Plateau lake ecosystem in China is very vulnerable and especially sensitive to environmental change and human disturbance, due to its strong closeness, species simplification, oligotrophy and simple food chain. This research focuses on evaluating the quantitative and spatial relationships of land use pattern and water quality of rivers inflowing to Fuxian Lake, Chinas largest deep freshwater lake in plateau. To investigate the influence of spatial variation in land-use structures and topography on rivers water quality, the distributions of land-use types in the lakes drainage basin were obtained from satellite images, and the correlations between land-use types and inflow water quality indicators were examined by applying statistical analysis and spatial analytical function of Geographic Information System. Subarea-level analysis reveals that a land-use type could exert different effects on water quality in plains and mountains, and the effects had a connection with topographic and hydrologic factors, its mixture with other land-use types, weather conditions during field measurements, as well as its scale. In addition, a comparison of correlation coefficient data for buffer regions of different scales indicated that the effect of land-use type on inflow water quality peaked in buffer regions with a radius between 100 and 200 m. On the whole, the regions within 200 m of river banks were the key regions that affected river water quality, and thus the construction and preservation of a riparian buffer zone in these regions can provide considerable protection from the inputs of non-point source pollutants and nutrients, and important function such as water and soil conservation. Based on these, a pollution control zoning was constructed from two key pollution control zones in the north and south, a phosphate rock pollution control zone in the northeast, a water loss and soil erosion control zone in the east, and a tourism pollution control zone in the west. This research also offers valuable insights into how to carry out subarea-level prevention and control of water pollution and regional development, according to natural environment, land use pattern and characteristics of pollution sources in different pollution control zones.

From this perspective, the sustainability of a water system and its supply to end users may be classified according to the products, services, and energy necessary for its operation, which are incorporated from the corresponding socioeconomic system and form an important aspect of its evaluation. In the present study, the development of a geoinformatics tool with an emergy accounting approach and its corresponding methodology are described, focusing on a spatial-temporal analysis of water resources and their allocation to domestic, industrial, and agricultural uses. In addition, different water provision scenarios that involve several levels of infrastructure in the basin of the Upper Course of the Lerma River (UCLR) are evaluated, and existing water deficits are considered in order to assess their economic impact and offer a perspective on regional environmental sustainability. To achieve this, the water supply processes with the greatest relevance for the UCLR basin are evaluated, which include the extraction of groundwater and the treatment of surface and wastewater for subsequent use. The evaluation of the proposed scenarios indicates that the water supply system where treated water is recycled for agricultural, industrial, and urban uses (with restrictions) has the highest value according to the environmental sustainability index. Beyond this, it is possible to establish a series of strategies to transition from the current scenario where the water supply largely comes from an overexploited aquifer, to one where wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) are capable of implementing additional units in their processes to achieve drinking water quality. Finally, the proposed methodology and the geoinformatics tool developed in this study showed their effectiveness as instruments for achieving an integrated management of water resources, which would facilitate a more objective decision making process based on current and projected scenarios.

Impacts of the long-term presence of buried crude oil on salt marsh soil denitrification in Barataria Bay, Louisiana	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Denitrification is typically the dominant process of nitrate removal in coastal wetlands, converting bioavailable N in surface waters into gases released to the atmosphere through microbial respiration. This critical function and valuable ecosystem service performed by soil microbes in coastal wetlands improves water quality and benefits the surrounding ecosystem. Five years after the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, a layer of crude oil was found similar to 5 cm beneath the wetland soil surface in Bay Jimmy, LA. While previous research found potential denitrification in coastal wetland soils was significantly reduced immediately following oil exposure, this study sought to investigate the effects of the long-term presence of spilled crude oil on nitrate removal. Intact soil cores were collected from a salt marsh heavily oiled by the DWH spill, and a nearby, non-oiled site in Barataria Bay, LA. The presence of a layer of buried oil increased nitrate removal from the overlying water column, a proxy measure of denitrification, by 31.8% in intact cores compared to non-oiled cores. However, when the oil was thoroughly mixed through the surface soil intervals, there was an 1853% decrease in the rate of denitrification. This seemingly contradictory result demonstrates that oil buried 5 cm below the surface, and not in contact with the newly accreted soil, did not negatively affect areal denitrification rates. However, when oil was in direct contact and well mixed in the soil, denitrifiers in that part of the soil profile are still negatively affected. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, the performance of phytoremediation by Salvinia molesta macrophytes on treated Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME) is investigated. The objectives of the study are to determine the nutrient uptake by S. molesta from treated POME and its effect towards the biomass and biochemical content. The water quality after phytoremediation were monitored. The wastewater phytoremediation by S. molesta was conducted outdoor for 16 days in a raceway pond rig. The results showed that S. molesta achieved 95% phosphate removal efficiency from the wastewater, lowering concentration to 0.17 mg/1. Nitrate concentration was determined to be at 0.50 mg/1 at the end of the experiment. Ammonia concentration showed a dynamic fluctuation trend with average value of 2.62 mg/1. For water quality assessment, turbidity decreased from 7.56 NTU to 0.94 NTU in just 2 days' time. MLVSS analysis was significantly low by day 2 of experiment. COD removal efficiency was determined at 39%. All six water quality assay met their respective statutory discharge limit. The S. molesta cultivated in the raceway pond rig also showed increment toward the biomass gain, carbohydrate and protein at the end of the experiment. This study indicates that S. molesta plants have the potential to be used in the phytoremediation of treated POME and showed a superior biochemical composition. 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Chen, Z; Wu, QY; Wu, GX; Hu, HY				Chen, Zhuo; Wu, Qianyuan; Wu, Guangxue; Hu, Hong-Ying			Centralized water reuse system with multiple applications in urban areas: Lessons from China's experience	RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING												In the context of rapid urbanization and water shortage, many cities of the world, especially megacities in rapidly developing zones, have urgent needs in improving their sustainable water management without compromising the local socioeconomic development. Water reuse has been increasingly recognized as a sustainable water management strategy. The results of this paper have shown that the development of water reuse in China is found to have positive correlations to local water resource availability and GDP levels, and the water reuse rate in some megacities has already reached 35-60%. Centralized water reuse systems have widely gained favor. Thus, a centralized water reuse framework with three utilization patterns is proposed. Particularly, a multiple-utilization model that applies a hierarchical use structure is found to be viable for meeting multiple water quality requirements. Other patterns address environmental and cascading ways in maximizing the value of reclaimed water use. A case study in a Chinese megacity, Tianjin, is demonstrated where a large-scale centralized water reuse project with a multiple barrier treatment approach and a hierarchical distribution and use structure has contributed to water reuse development in a safe, reliable and economical manner. This paper can be beneficial to water authorities and practitioners for long-term urban water management in other rapidly developing cities and regions that have encountered similar water-related problems.

There are very few studies about lake nutrient criteria and water body classification system, which may cause difficulties in nutrient level assessment and management. This paper reviewed WQS system in the US, EU, and Japan, and then presented the development procedures for revising surface WQS in different periods in China. The amendment includes indicators, standard values, and framework of the standard system. However, current WQS set in light of the criteria and standards of the US and Europe couldn't adapt to the natural conditions of lakes in China. Therefore, by learning from the water quality criteria setting method of USA and taking the regional differences into consideration, a methodology of combining structure equation model and expert elicitation was recommended for setting WQS. Furthermore, it considered to investigate the differences (climate, elevation and geographical condition, etc.) in each region, and set lake nutrient criteria and standards on regional scale. Consequently, the proposed methodology for setting standards could be applied to each region in China. Yungui ecoregion was taken as an example for setting up the lake nutrient standards with considering TP, Chl-a, TN and CODMn, four influence factors for designated use attainment, and a suitable TP standard 0.02 mg/L was recommended by using the proposed methods.

The determined practical concentrations of the Fenton reagents were 5 mg/L Fe(II) and 5 mg/L H2O2, respectively. The Fenton process is a fast reaction, completed within 5-30 min (Fe(II), H2O2 = 0.2-10 mg/L; MC-LR0 = 200 mu g/L). The degradation intermediates of MC-LR by the Fenton process were firstly reported as in/z 1029.5,1011.5, 835.5, 795.4, and 783.4, associated with the diene bond in the Adda chain, then alleviate their toxicity. The effects of organic matter were examined in the range of Nak-Dong River water, as a drinking water source, monitored for six months in 2015. Fulvic acid was affected more than humic acid and natural organic matter (NOM). The degradation efficiency in the raw water was lower than that of distilled water because of the competing effect of NOM, geosmin, and 2-methylisoborneol, and the higher pH (7.64), furthermore, dissolved organic matter, geosmin, and 2-methylisoborneol was removed 7.39%, 4.28% and 12.30% after the Fenton process in the river water. The final concentration of MC-LR after treatment was under the drinking water guideline level with initial MC-LR concentration of 2 mu g/L. No acute toxicity was observed to Daphnia magna (TU = 0) after the Fenton process. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Evidence from major Japanese cities	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												This study investigates whether income inequality affects environmental degradation. We use city-level data in Japan, where local governments have limited authority and often use voluntary agreements with private firms. We test the hypothesis that inequality weakens residents' bargaining power over polluters and has a negative effect on environmental quality. Our results show that inequality negatively affected air quality in residential and commercial areas during the 1990s but not in industrial areas. This evidence suggests that the inequality-pollution relationship is not just a correlation but reflects a causal effect of residents' bargaining power on environmental quality. This implies that equal communities can pressure firms into accepting pollution prevention agreements. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The case of the Cleaner Production Center at the University of Cienfuegos in Cuba, a country in transition	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Universities are key stakeholders in teaching, researching and supporting the implementation of cleaner production activities. This case study discusses the experience of establishing and operating the Cleaner Production Center at the University of Cienfuegos (Cuba). Establishing, starting-up and running the center during its first four years of activity was supported by two projects targeted to inter-university cooperation. The collaboration allowed to establish a master program on cleaner production which acts as a bridge between the university, and the production industry and the services sector in the province of Cienfuegos. Currently 32 students from the first two promotions graduated and the program of two other promotions is ongoing. The master thesis research works are defined improving the environmental performance of the companies or organizations the student originate from. This results in a measurable improvement of the air and surface water quality in Cienfuegos city. An estimated yearly reduction of the emission of 60,000 ton of carbon dioxide equivalents and of 400 MWh at a cement plant have been realized. Research activities currently target the pollution inventory of Cienfuegos, energy production from local biomass, and establishing indicators for sustainable development for Cienfuegos. The inter-university collaboration resulted in several publications in international peer reviewed journals. The successful inter-university North South collaboration between Cuba and Belgium, targeted at capacity building, transfer of experience and expertise, proved to be most crucial during these first years the center was active. It allowed generating the necessary funds which are often difficult to raise in developing countries. Therefore this is a unique case of building academic experience on cleaner production.

J	Chrispim, MC; Nolasco, MA				Chrispim, Mariana Cardoso; Nolasco, Marcelo Antunes			Greywater treatment using a moving bed biofilm reactor at a university campus in Brazil	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Water reuse can contribute as an important approach and practice to the reduction of the pressures on water resources lowering the demand for potable water for purposes that do not require water's high quality. However the greywater reuse has been rarely applied in Brazil. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to evaluate a greywater collection and treatment system from lavatories, showers and washing machine aiming the non-potable reuse. The objectives were to characterize the quality and quantity of greywater from different sources, to monitor a pilot system for synthetic greywater treatment and to analyze the quality of the effluent after treatment. The pilot system implemented in a building at University of Sao Paulo allowed to segregate greywater collection and characterization. To evaluate the greywater production water flow meters were installed in the water inlet of each greywater source. The treatment system included a moving bed biofilm reactor and a settling tank at pilot scale. The evaluation of greywater treatment was conducted based on the monitoring of physicochemical and microbiological water quality parameters during the operation of the experimental system. Based on the results, amongst the three greywater sources, the water from showers had the highest E. coli concentration while the lavatories water had the highest total coliforms concentration. The removal efficiencies of BOD and COD were 59% e 70% respectively. The phosphorus removal during the experimental period was low. Nevertheless the water quality produced is viable to be applied for outdoor purposes- landscape and garden irrigation in household, commercial and institutional buildings and the results were satisfactory according to Brazilian standard. The treatment showed stability and reliability ensuring the potential for a safe reuse if appropriate operation and monitoring of the treatment system is performed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Pedersen, LF; Henriksen, NH				Pedersen, Lars-Flemming; Henriksen, Niels Henrik			Semi-continuously addition of peracetic acid to a flow-through fish farm	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Seasonal occurrence of skin and gill parasites in fish ponds can substantially affect fish performance by reduced growth and increased mortality and hence the economic returns of aquaculture systems. To minimize loss of fish, preventive and curative water treatments are typically applied by adding sodium chloride and/or formalin into the ponds. This note from the field describes a simple alternative method to improve water quality in a Danish flow through fish farm. Instead of periodic formalin baths/flushes in all ponds, peracetic acid (PAA) was continuously added from a mixing tank to the common water inlet during daytime throughout the spring and summer season. The method was tested on a commercial organic flow through trout farm, and included verification of PAA residuals and distribution in the makeup water, within ponds and in the effluent from the fish farm. PAA was found to be evenly distributed to the ponds, achieved and maintained at concentrations around 0.10-0.15 mg PAA/1 corresponding to aimed values. PAA degraded within the fish ponds and negligible amounts of PAA were measured in the discharge.

Molecular and Spectroscopic Characterization of Water Extractable Organic Matter from Thermally Altered Soils Reveal Insight into Disinfection Byproduct Precursors	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												To characterize the effects of thermal-alteration on water extractable organic matter (WEOM),-Soil samples were heated in a laboratory at 225, 350, and 500 degrees C. Next, heated and unheated soils were leached, filtered, and analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, optical properties, molecular size distribution, molecular composition, and disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation following the addition of chlorine. The soils heated to 225 degrees C leached the greatest DOC and had the highest C- andi N-DBP precursor reactivity per unit carbon compared to the unheated material or soils heated to 350 or 500 degrees C. The molecular weight of the soluble compounds decreased with increasing heating temperature. Compared to the unheated soil leachates, all DBP yields were higher for the leachates of soils heated to 225 degrees C. However, only haloacetonitrile yields (mu g/mg(C)) were higher for leachates of the soils heated to 350 degrees C, whereas trihalomethane, haloacetic acid and chloropicrin yields were lower compared to Unheated soil leachates.: Soluble N-containing compounds comprised a high number of molecular formulas for leachates of heated soils, which may explain the higher yield of haloacetonitriles for heated soil leachates. Overall, heating soils altered the quantity, quality, and reactivity, of the WEOM pool. These results May be useful for inferring how thermal alteration of soil by wildfire can affect water quality.

Membranes that have the ability to self-heal would recover their original rejection levels autonomously, bypassing the need for costly integrity monitoring and membrane replacement practices. Herein, we fabricated hydrogel pore-filled membranes via in situ graft polymerization of 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid (AMPS) onto microporous poly(ether sulfone) (PES) substrates and successfully demonstrated their self-healing ability. Covalent attachment of the hydrogel to the substrate was essential for stable membrane performance. The membranes autonomously restore their particle rejection up to 99% from rejection levels as low as 30% after being physically damaged. We attribute the observed self-healing property to swelling of the pore-filling hydrogel into the damage site, strong hydrogen bonding, and molecular interdiffusion. The results of this study show that hydrogel pore-filled membranes are a promising new class of materials for fabricating self-healing membranes.

Bioadsorbents from peat, coconut shell, fruit stones and oil palm biomass have been produced but the bioadsorbent ability in removing pollutants from biologically treated palm oil mill effluent final discharge is scarcely reported. This research attempts to treat biologically treated palm oil mill effluent final discharge using steam activated oil palm mesocarp fiber bioadsorbent without the use of chemicals as activating agents. Oil palm mesocarp fiber was carbonised at 600 degrees C for 30 min and later activated using steam at same temperature for another 30 min. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of the bioadsorbent was found to be 494 m(2)/g. Bioadsorbent produced was then used to treat biologically treated palm oil mill final discharge by mixing both bioadsorbent and the wastewater into a conical flask and shaken at 150 rpm for 24 h. At 10 g/L dosage, the bioadsorbent reduced the chemical oxygen demand and suspended solid of biologically treated palm oil mill effluent final discharge from 395 mg/L and 117 mg/L down to 303 mg/L and 14 mg/L, respectively. Consecutive treatments at 10 g/L dosage resulted in higher removal of the chemical oxygen demand and suspended solids up to 122 mg/L and 7 mg/L, respectively, which meets the river water quality, making the final wastewater suitable as recycled water for the zero-emission system in the palm oil mill.

The results based on the data on fauna and flora gathered before (in 2003, T+0) and after (in T+2, T+6 and T+11) the reclamation showed that the river canalization and oxbow lake dredging can significantly disturb the ecology of water bodies adjacent to the river. Observations of the oxbow lake (OLS5), showed the decrease in the number of macrophyte phytocenoses from 11 before the dredging to 6 very valuable Potametea phytocenoses, after wards. The development of common pleustonic phytocenoses of Lemnetea minoris and the massive development of green algae resulted from the bottom sediment removal. In the case of population, Stratiotes aloides was rebuilt after elimination during dredging already in T+2. Before hydrotechnical works, the oxbow lake was characterized by 12 invertebrate taxa inhabiting S. aloides, whereas only 9 were found first period after the dredging, 15 taxa in second period and 23 in a recent study. During both observation periods, dominated by Chironomidae larvae (T+0), Trichoptera larvae (T+2 and T+6) and again Chironomidae larvae (T+11). The hydrotechnical activities significantly altered in the first period the structure of fauna and flora inhabiting the water body. Such radical interference in natural values of oxbow lakes is un-suitable for the preservation of ecosystems due to the significant decrease in their biodiversity. Achieved on a similar or higher level of macrophytes diversity and epiphytic invertebrates was noticeable ten years after the dredging of a water body.																	2267-1242						2017	17								UNSP 00005	10.1051/e3sconf/20171700005								WOS:000437167900005

The authors analyzed anaerobic co-digestion of sludge from both water treatment plant and sewage treatment plant. Water sludge is produced during coagulation, ozonation and backwashing of rapid anthracite filters. Its characteristic and properties depend on a raw water quality, treatment methods as well as types of chemicals used and their doses. According to the Polish Act of 4 December 2012 (Journal of Laws from 2013, item 21) the water sludge should be treated as hazardous waste. An alternative way to dispose water sludge and reduce its volume may be sludge reuse. The authors suggested a research methodology and analyzed the preliminary results, which showed that co-digestion of sewage and water sludge enhanced biogas production. The authors assume that the results of the study will provide a basis for development of methodology for sludge control and disposal.																	2267-1242						2017	17								UNSP 00025	10.1051/e3sconf/20171700025								WOS:000437167900025

The protective cement linings are also commonly used for old water pipe renovation. In both cases, the cement lining is an excellent anticorrosion protection of the pipelines, effectively separating the pipe wall from the flowing water. Moreover, cement linings protect the pipelines not only by a mechanical barrier, but also by a chemical barrier creating a highly alkaline environment in water contact with the metal pipe wall. In addition, cement coatings have an ability for so-called self-regeneration and provide the improvement of hydraulic conditions inside the pipelines. In turn, the differences between the analysed cement coatings mainly depend on the types of cements used and techniques of cement mortar spraying. As was expected, they influence the quality of water having contact with the coating. A comparison of the impact of cement coatings manufactured in factories and sprayed on building sites during the renovation on drinking water quality parameters was performed in the study. The experiments were conducted in laboratory conditions, using the test stands prepared for this purpose. The results include analysis of selected water quality parameters for the samples contacting with cement mortar and collected during the investigation.																	2267-1242						2017	17								UNSP 00061	10.1051/e3sconf/20171700061								WOS:000437167900061

Derived dependences allow to calculate values for these indicators using only the absorbance measurement, which could be easily on-line monitored. This approach make possible to reduce number of performed laboratory analyzes, used for the efficient controlling of water purification process. Identified relations are not universally applicable even for individual specific water source. These could be described with sufficient precise only for water samples from particular treatment step. Presented methodology can be helpful for exploitation of real water treatment systems to quick and efficient evaluation of individual purifying processes.																	2267-1242						2017	17								UNSP 00091	10.1051/e3sconf/20171700091								WOS:000437167900091

This is associated with the imperfection of purification processes, or secondary water pollution. Not only it results in the deterioration of water quality parameters, but it also increases threat of epidemiological problems. The water that is biologically unstable creates ideal conditions for colonization of the microorganisms to the inner surface of pipelines which may form biofilm. The key issue, enabling prevention and control of the impact of the development of biofilms, is to assess the biodiversity of microbiocenosis. In order to obtain comprehensive characteristics of microorganisms communities on a particular substrate, it is necessary to combine several techniques. Further analysis using molecular biology methods are usually after traditional methods of assessing the microbiological quality of water. Standard methods do not reflect the actual species composition, because they are targeted at the bacteria that can be isolated and cultured in the laboratory. Conventional methods are capable of detecting less than 10% of the organisms in the sample. In order to study the biodiversity of organisms inhabiting a biofilm (apart from the conventional methods) analyses of the diversity of nucleic acids should be used. The first method could be the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Another way may be fluorescence in situ hybridization, which allows to detect determined DNA sequence using specially labeled oligonucleotide probes. Visualization of the material is performed using a fluorescence microscope. The main purpose of this article is to present rapid and precise identification groups of microorganisms in their natural habitat in biofilm using fluorescent in situ hybridization method (FISH). FISH method can be successfully used to visualize these microorganisms, which show difficulties in culturing, as well as to provide knowledge on the phylogenetic structure in different habitats. FISH technique allows the quantitative description of environmental samples.																	2267-1242						2017	17								UNSP 00098	10.1051/e3sconf/20171700098								WOS:000437167900098

So, it is indispensable for real-time monitoring and early warning. The monitoring strategy used now relies on the deployment of sensors in large scale. Thus reducing the cost and size of the sensors is of great importance. In this paper, a solid state miniature pH sensor, consisting of an iridium oxide film based pH electrode and a solid state reference electrode, was developed for water quality detection. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation indicated that the iridium oxide nanoparticles were deposited on the surface of Pt electrode. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) survey illustrated that the atomic ratio of Ir (III) to Ir (IV) is about 1.38. The pH electrode exhibited a good linearity with the high sensitivity of -75.8 mV/pH. The characterization result of the on-chip reference electrode indicated that the proposed reference electrode has a good potential stability. The sensor could be fabricated in batches, thus the cost could be controlled to be acceptable for the use in large numbers.																			978-3-11-051662-3				2017							543	553		10.1515/9783110516623-053								WOS:000432429000053

The biostability is a useful approach to study the two competing affections that determine bacterial regrowth in a distribution system, inactivation because of the presence of a disinfectant and growth because of the presence of a substrate. This paper presents a research method for determining biostability, related water quality indexes, and limited factors on bacteria regrowth, therefore this will enable water plants to incorporate this approach for water quality safe needs. Using data from sampling sites, AOC and residual chlorine were applicable to control regrowth of HPC in chlorinated systems where AOC and phosphorus are the growth limiting substrate.																			978-3-11-051662-3				2017							1113	1124		10.1515/9783110516623-110								WOS:000432429000110

Application of DHS-USB System and Ozone in Recirculating Freshwater Aquaria Towards Zero Water Exchange Aquaria	FRONTIERS IN WASTEWATER TREATMENT AND MODELLING, FICWTM 2017	Lecture Notes in Civil Engineering				Frontiers International Conference on Wastewater Treatment (FICWTM)	MAY 21-24, 2017	Univ Palermo, Palermo, ITALY	Int Water Assoc	Univ Palermo			In recirculating aquaria system (RAS), partial water exchange was performed regularly as a part of aquaria maintenance for maintaining water quality and aesthetic beauty. To reduce large consumption of water during maintenance, this study proposed a biological nitrogen removal system consisted of down-flow hanging sponge (DHS) and an up-flow sludge blanket (USB) system with combination of ozone (O-3) to simultaneously maintain nitrogen compounds concentration and remove yellow substances that implicate color in aquaria without performing water exchange. The performance of the system was evaluated using on site freshwater aquaria at ambient temperature (20-34 degrees C). NH3, NO2-, and NO3- concentration detected was 0.10 +/- 0.12, 0.03 +/- 0.13 and 6.40 +/- 7.46 mg N L-1 respectively. Color were maintained at 6 color units at phase 2 and 4 when O-3 was applied continuously for 8 h per day. In addition, 16S rRNA gene of microorganisms from the bioreactors were sequenced to identify the microbial communities present. The analysis revealed that ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA) such as Ca. Nitrososphaera played important role in nitrification and Thauera played important role in denitrification. Fish survived throughout the study despite no water exchange was performed for 425 days. The application of O-3 in combination with DHS-USB system appeared to be a promising technology towards less-maintenance aquaria.																	2366-2557		978-3-319-58421-8; 978-3-319-58420-1				2017	4						43	49		10.1007/978-3-319-58421-8_7								WOS:000430181700007
