J	Pennesi, C; Danovaro, R				Pennesi, Chiara; Danovaro, Roberto			Assessing marine environmental status through microphytobenthos assemblages colonizing the Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structures (ARMS) and their potential in coastal marine restoration	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Microphytobenthos is potentially highly sensitive to environmental alterations, but has been rarely utilized in monitoring studies. Here we investigated the use of microphytobenthos colonizing Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structures (ARMS) to assess the marine environmental quality. We analysed microphytobenthic assemblages in terms of abundance, biomass and species composition on ARMS deployed in northern Adriatic Sea along a gradient of increasing impacts. We show that microphytobenthic variables changed significantly across sites, with lowest abundance and biodiversity in the highly impacted site. Moreover, the specific analysis of Diatoms revealed that genera like Entomoneis and Cylindrotheca could be used as indicators of nutrient enriched and stressed conditions. We provide evidence that the analysis of microphytobenthos colonizing artificial substrates could be used as a tool for detecting altered environmental characteristics. We also show that the ARMS, recreating hot spots of microphytobenthic biodiversity, and protect them from grazing, could be potentially utilized to restore degraded hard substrates. Our result indicates that microphytobenthos can be easily incorporated in future monitoring and restoration programmes to assess and improve marine environmental health.

Effects of suspended sediments and nutrient enrichment on juvenile corals	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Three to six-month-old juveniles of Acropora tennis, A. millepora and Pocillopora acute were experimentally co-exposed to nutrient enrichment and suspended sediments (without light attenuation or sediment deposition) for 40 days. Suspended sediments reduced survivorship of A. millepora strongly, proportional to the sediment concentration, but not in A. tennis or P. acuta juveniles. However, juvenile growth of the latter two species was reduced to less than half or to zero, respectively. Additionally, suspended sediments increased effective quantum yields of symbionts associated with A. millepora and A. tennis, but not those associated with P. acuta. Nutrient enrichment did not significantly affect juvenile survivorship, growth or photophysiology for any of the three species, either as a sole stressor or in combination with suspended sediments. Our results indicate that exposure to suspended sediments can be energetically costly for juveniles of some coral species, implying detrimental longer-term but species-specific repercussions for populations and coral cover.					de Beer, Dirk/0000-0001-5274-1781												0025-326X	1879-3363				DEC 15	2017	125	1-2					166	175		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.08.003								WOS:000418727000031

The results, spatialized in ArcGIS software, show: while the comprehensive ecological health index is 0.62, the ecological environmental quality in the Laizhou Bay is in a sub healthy state; the unhealthy area is mainly concentrated in southwestern inshore region, and impacted by serious environmental problems, such as water eutrophication and heavy metal pollution; the northwestern and southeastern inshore regions are in a sub-healthy state, while the eastern inshore and northern areas are in the healthiest state. The land-based pollutants that discharge into the sea may be the leading factors that are causing ecological environment deterioration in the Laizhou Bay, and the reclamation work ongoing around the port has exacerbated the ecological risk.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				DEC 15	2017	125	1-2					242	249		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.08.027								WOS:000418727000038	28823550

Daily relative dog abundance, fecal density, and loading rates on intensively and minimally managed dog-friendly beaches in central California	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Due to increased concerns regarding fecal pollution at marine recreational beaches, daily relative dog abundance and fecal density were estimated on an intensively managed (Beach 1) and a minimally managed (Beach 2) dog beach in Monterey County, California. Fecal loading and factors predictive of fecal deposition also were assessed. After standardizing for beach area, daily beach use and fecal densities did not differ between beaches and yearly fecal loading estimates revealed that unrecovered dog feces likely contributes significantly to fecal contamination (1.4 and 0.2 metric tonnes/beach). Detection of feces was significantly associated with beach management type, transect position relative to mean low tideline, presence of beach wrack, distance to the nearest beach entrance, and season. Methodologies outlined in this study can augment monitoring programs at coastal beaches to optimize management, assess visitor compliance, and improve coastal water quality.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				DEC 15	2017	125	1-2					451	458		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.10.062								WOS:000418727000061	29100633

The surficial sediments were mainly composed of clayey silt and the TOC content in sediments decreased from the river to the shelf. The surficial sediments experienced Pb pollution; Cr only showed a certain level of pollution in the coastal area of the estuary but not in other areas, and Ni, Cu, Zn, and Cd showed no pollution. The heavy metals mainly originated from natural weathering and erosion of rocks and soils in the catchment and enriched near the river mouth. Total organic carbon can promote the enrichment of heavy metals in sediments.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				DEC 15	2017	125	1-2					492	500		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.08.010								WOS:000418727000066	28807422

Recreating the shading effects of ship wake induced turbidity to test acclimation responses in the seagrass Thalassia hemprichii	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Elevated sediment delivery and resuspension in coastal waters from human activities such as shipping can have detrimental effects on seagrass health by limiting light penetration. Managing seagrasses requires knowledge of their light acclamatory abilities so guidelines for coastal activities (e.g. ship movements) that influence sediment dynamics can be created. Guidelines typically focus on ensuring that seagrasses are able to meet their minimal light requirements (MLR). MLRs can be achieved by different light regimes, but it remains unknown whether a chronically low yet stable light regime is less or more detrimental than a highly variable regime with periods of extreme low to no light. To test this, we compared the physiological and morphological responses of Thalassia hemprichii among three light regimes: an open control (30-40% ambient light), a shaded control with (11-15% ambient light), and a fluctuating shade (4-30% ambient light). The MLR for the T. hemprichii we studied was lower (4-10% ambient light) than previous reports (mean = 18%) illustrating enhanced light acclimation in Singapore's chronically turbid waters. Seagrass shoots in the shaded control, however, exhibited significantly more morphological stress symptoms, with reduced shoot growth and lower below ground biomass. These data suggest that for seagrass exposed to periods of acute light stress, energetic costs associated with photo-acclimation to more variable light regimes can be offset If the plant can meet its daily light requirements during periods of high light. Management of seagrass beds should incorporate regular light monitoring and move towards an adaptive feedback-based approach to ensure the long-term viability of these vulnerable ecosystems.

Umbrellas can work under water: Using threatened species as indicator and management surrogates can improve coastal conservation	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Species surrogates, the use of particular species to index habitat condition or to represent ecological assemblages are commonly identified in many ecosystems, but are less tested, and therefore less employed in estuaries. Estuaries provide important ecosystem goods (e.g. harvestable species) and services (e.g. carbon processing, coastal armouring), but require protection from multiple human activities, meaning that finding surrogates for estuarine condition or faunal assemblages is a significant knowledge gap. In this study, we test the efficacy of the threatened estuary ray Hemitrygon fluviorum, as a suitable indicator of ecosystem condition and management umbrella surrogate species for conservation prioritisation and monitoring purposes within estuaries. We surveyed fish assemblages and ray presence at ten sites within each of 22 estuaries in southeast Queensland, Australia, using one hour deployments of baited video arrays. We then tested for correlations between ray presence, a series of environmental variables considered important to ecosystem management within estuaries (i.e. testing rays as indicator species), and the co-occurring fish species (i.e. testing rays as umbrella species). Estuary rays function as both umbrella species and ecological indicators of habitat status in subtropical Australian estuaries. As umbrellas, ray occurrence concords with elevated species richness. As ecological indicators, ray distribution concords with habitats of good water quality (especially low turbidity) and more natural vegetation remaining in the catchment. These results highlight the potential for other threatened aquatic vertebrates that are both readily detectable and that are reliable proxies for ecosystems status to be become useful management tools in estuaries. The protection of such large, threatened species in coastal seascapes allows managers to address multiple targets for conservation, especially; (1) protecting species of conservation concern; (2) maintaining diversity; and (3) protecting optimal habitats by better placing reserves.

In this study, the environmental dynamics, phytoplankton community structure, and N uptake rates were investigated in two tropical reservoirs. Phytoplankton ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-) acquisition was assessed through N-15 addition experiments over 2 years. We found that changes in ambient nutrient concentrations and temperature influenced different phytoplankton groups, which tended to have different N uptake strategies. The preferred N-source by Cyanobacteria was NH4+ while Dinophyceae and other groups seemed adapted to also take up NO3-, possibly due to competition. Potential uptake rates (maximum of 8.5 mu M-N hr(-1) for NH4+ and 1.3 mu M-N hr(-1) for NO3-) were high in comparison to previous reports from temperate freshwater or marine systems, likely due to elevated algal biomass and temperature. When normalized to biomass as chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), specific uptake rates varied between 0.01-3.4 mu mol-N mu gChl-a(-1) day(-1) for NH4+ and <0.01-0.8 mu mol-N mu gChl-a(-1) day(-1) for NO3- and were comparable to those reported for other eutrophic and hypereutrophic aquatic systems. In addition, higher temperatures favored Cyanobacteria (e.g., Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii and Microcystis aeruginosa), while a more diverse community was found during colder months. Results highlight how high loading of reduced forms of nitrogen and high temperatures can exacerbate harmful Cyanobacteria blooms in tropical reservoirs and be a concern for drinking water quality.

Spatial differences in mesozooplankton seasonality were recognized, both within and between estuaries, related to differences between sites in hydrodynamic features and anthropogenic nutrient enrichment that drive phytoplankton biomass seasonal cycles. The within estuary seasonal differences in mesozooplankton community were mainly shown through seaward time-advances in the seasonal peak from summer to spring along the salinity gradient, linked to differences in phytoplankton availability during the summer, in turn, related to nutrient availability. These differences were most marked in the estuary of Urdaibai, where zooplankton seasonal pattern at 35 salinity (high tidal flushing) resembled that of shelf waters, while at 35 of the estuary of Bilbao zooplankton showed an estuarine seasonal pattern due to the influence of the estuarine plume. Cirripede larvae contributed most to the mesozooplankton seasonal variability, except at the outer estuary of Bilbao, where cladocerans and fish eggs and larvae were the major contributors, and the inner estuary of Urdaibai, where gastropod larvae contributed most. Total mesozooplankton increased at 30 salinity of the estuary of Bilbao and 35 salinity of the estuary of Urdaibai. Interannual variability of mesozooplankton at the lowest salinity of the estuary of Bilbao was mainly accounted for by copepods due to the introduction of non indigenous species during estuarine rehabilitation from intense pollution. However, bivalve larvae and gastropod larvae showed the highest contributions at 35 salinity of the estuary of Urdaibai. At the rest of sites, the opposite interannual trends of polychaete larvae and hydromedusae generally made the highest contribution.

Freshwater inflow from watershed management is affecting this region and has deeply modified the salinity gradient. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes were used to trace specific sources of organic matter and the influence of these sources of carbon on the diet of the eastern oyster in the Greater Everglades. Oysters, as well as particulate organic matter (POM) and benthic microalgae (BMA) were sampled in three bays at three different stations from upstream to downstream during both wet and dry seasons. Significant salinity differences were observed in all estuaries between summer (wet) and winter (dry) seasons and were linked to freshwater inputs into the bays. Temperature followed a typical seasonal trend. Oysters were enriched in delta N-15 compared with POM and BMA, and similarly or slightly enriched in delta C-13 for both seasons. Lighter delta C-13 values in the upper stations in the estuaries suggest input of organic matter from terrestrial sources. Stable isotopes showed that oysters fed more on POM than on BMA. Condition index of oysters varied between stations and seasons in the three estuaries. Because the quality of organic matter consumed by oysters ultimately impacts the health of the oyster, changes in water quality and quantity of freshwater entering estuaries will have implications for future management of the habitat for this ecologically and economically important species.

J	Lapointe, BE; Herren, LW; Paule, AL				Lapointe, Brian E.; Herren, Laura W.; Paule, Armelle L.			Septic systems contribute to nutrient pollution and harmful algal blooms in the St. Lucie Estuary, Southeast Florida, USA	HARMFUL ALGAE												Nutrient enrichment is a significant global-scale driver of change in coastal waters, contributing to an array of problems in coastal ecosystems. The St. Lucie Estuary (SLE) in southeast Florida has received national attention as a result of its poor water quality (elevated nutrient concentrations and fecal bacteria counts), recurring toxic Microcystis aeruginosa blooms, and its proximity to the northern boundary of tropical coral species in the United States. The SLE has an artificially large watershed comprised of a network of drainage canals, one of which (C-44) is used to lower the water level in Lake Okeechobee. Public attention has primarily been directed at nutrient inputs originating from the lake, but recent concern over the importance of local watershed impacts prompted a one-year watershed study designed to investigate the interactions between on-site sewage treatment and disposal systems (OSTDS or septic systems), groundwaters, and surface waters in the SLE and nearshore reefs. Results provided multiple lines of evidence of OSTDS contamination of the SLE and its watershed: 1) dissolved nutrients in groundwaters and surface waters were most concentrated adjacent to two older (pre-1978) residential communities and the primary canals, and 2) sucralose was present in groundwater at residential sites (up to 32.0 mu g/L) and adjacent surface waters (up to 5.5 mu g/L), and 3) delta N-15 values in surface water (+7.5 parts per thousand), macroalgae (+4.4 parts per thousand) and phytoplankton (+5.0 parts per thousand) were within the published range (>+3 parts per thousand) for sewage N and similar to values in OSTDS-contaminated groundwaters. Measured 815N values in M. aeruginosa became increasingly enriched during transport from the C-44 canal (similar to 5.8 parts per thousand) into the mid estuary (similar to 8.0 parts per thousand), indicating uptake and growth on sewage N sources within the urbanized estuary. Consequently, there is a need to reduce N and P loading, as well as fecal loading, from the SLE watershed via septic-to-sewer conversion projects and to minimize the frequency and intensity of the releases from Lake Okeechobee to the SLE via additional water storage north of the lake. These enhancements would improve water quality in both the SLE and Lake Okeechobee, reduce the occurrence of toxic harmful algal blooms in the linked systems, and improve overall ecosystem health in the SLE and downstream reefs.

J	Humphrey, CP; Iverson, G; O'Driscoll, M				Humphrey, Charles P., Jr.; Iverson, Guy; O'Driscoll, Michael			Nitrogen Treatment Efficiency of a Large Onsite Wastewater System in Relation to Water Table Dynamics	CLEAN-SOIL AIR WATER												The objective of this study is to determine if the nitrogen treatment efficiency of a large onsite wastewater system (OSW) in the coastal plain of North Carolina is influenced by changes in the elevation of the water table. Groundwater readings including depth to water, pH, temperature, specific conductance, and dissolved oxygen are recorded eight times over a 15-month period (May 2013-August 2014) encompassing typically "wet" (two sampling events) and "dry" (three sampling events) seasons, and a water table fluctuation of 1.7 m. Groundwater from piezometers (n = 7) near the OSW and septic tank effluent samples are collected for analyses of total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) during each field visit to determine if the TDN treatment efficiency is influenced by the water table elevation. The treatment efficiency of the OSW is directly correlated with wastewater strength (r = 0.882; p = 0.004) and inversely correlated to water table elevation (r = -0.754; p = 0.031). The TDN treatment efficiency at this site decreases with increases in water table elevation, and groundwater TDN concentrations beneath the OSW are typically higher when wastewater concentrations of TDN are higher. Sea level rise and climate change are projected to increase groundwater levels and therefore may have negative effects on water quality adjacent to OSW. Ensuring that OSW are installed with the maximum practical vertical separation to groundwater and setback distances to surface waters, designed with long trenches and oriented perpendicular to the dominant groundwater flow direction will help to maximize TDN treatment.																	1863-0650	1863-0669				DEC	2017	45	12							1700551	10.1002/clen.201700551								WOS:000417491100004

In our field experiment, we deployed four kinds of artificial substrates (two inorganic ones - glass and ceramic, and two organic ones - willow and yew wooden tiles) for the development of periphyton in an urban reservoir referred to as Lake Savsko (Belgrade, Serbia). We comparatively investigated the structure, colonization process, diversity and successional trajectories of periphyton. We also assessed the relationship between the dynamics of algae growth forms (ecological groups) on different substrates and selected abiotic limnological factors. Our objective was to determine whether the type of substrate affects periphyton characteristics at various levels and whether an artificial substrate potentially affects the bioindication capacity of ecological groups. We concluded that all substrates behave similarly at the level of structure and colonization phases, but when considering diversity and successional trajectories, the substrate specificity was demonstrated. Our results suggest that communities developed on inert substrates (glass and ceramic) could provide more realistic insight into complex environmental changes.

Characterization of the effects of binary metal mixtures on short-term uptake of Cd, Pb, and Zn by rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)	AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY												Biotic Ligand Models (BLMs) for individual metals improve our ability to regulate metals in the aquatic environment by considering the effects of water quality parameters (ionic composition, pH, DOC) on metal bioavailability. However, in natural aquatic systems, organisms are often simultaneously exposed to multiple metals and these interactions are not currently considered in BLMs or most environmental regulations, Recently, several different mixture BLMs (mBLMs) have been developed to begin assessing this issue. Some of these models assume competitive interactions between all metals, while others assume only metals with similar modes of action (e.g., Na+ or Ca2+ antagonists) will competitively interact. In this study, we used standard in vivo 3-h gill metal binding assays to characterize the uptake of Cd, Pb, and Zn individually and in binary mixtures with Ag, Cd, Cu, Pb, Ni, and Zn across a range of concentrations that encompassed the 96-h LC50 for each metal. Inhibition of Cd, Pb, and Zn uptake at the gill by introduction of a second metal was consistent with mode of action in some cases, but not others. Further, contrary to expectations, inhibition was always either non-competitive or could not be defined statistically. We also observed one example of stimulated metal uptake (Ni stimulated Zn uptake). Consistent with our previous experiments on Ag, Cu, and Ni, these studies suggest that current mBLM frameworks will need revision to better reflect the mechanisms underlying metal mixture interactions.																	0166-445X	1879-1514				DEC	2017	193						217	227		10.1016/j.aquatox.2017.10.015								WOS:000417658800024	29100104

A shoreline divided: Twelve-year water quality and land cover trends in Lake Ontario coastal wetlands	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Water quality in Great Lakes coastal wetlands has been studied for decades, but few studies look at water quality changes in multiple sites over many years and relate that to land cover. In this study, water quality at 22 sites in two regions along the north shore of Lake Ontario (Bay of Quinte in the east and Durham Region in the west) was compared over a period of 12 years (2003-2014) and related to land cover data from two time periods (1999-2002 and 2009-2011) at four spatial scales; 500 m, 1000 m, 2000 m wetland buffers, and the quaternary watershed. Water Quality Index (WQI) scores significantly increased over time in both regions, and turbidity and pH both significantly decreased over time in both regions. Land cover data showed regional differences between east and west, with the western sites having higher percentage of urban land at all scales. There were significant relationships between land cover (% Natural and % Urban) and WQI score at several scales, but the relationships were strongest at the watershed scale. We found that sites in the western region showed a greater amount of change in land cover between the two time periods, compared to the eastern sites. The results of this study provide some key insights on the impact of urbanization on Great Lakes coastal wetlands, and on how they can be managed in the future.

The contribution of double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) to silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) DNA loads in the Chicago Area Waterway System	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Waterfowl and colonial waterbirds can have significant impacts on water quality in lakes and reservoirs by depositing feces that contribute to nitrogen and phosphorus loads. Piscivorous birds can also contribute the DNA of prey species to a water body. Here, we develop and apply a loading model to estimate the number of silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) DNA target marker copies that are potentially deposited by nesting double crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) in the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS). The model assumes a conservative breeding population estimate ranging between 6000 and 8000 cormorants distributed among three large colonies in the Chicago metropolitan area. The model also assumes that cormorants are distributing feces randomly throughout the CAWS in proportion to the amount of time spent at each location. Results show that cormorants may be contributing 2.6 to 113 target marker copies/m(2)/day if birds are spending 22% of their time on open water and 6.4 to 291 target marker copies/m2/day if birds are spending 56% of their time on open water. Over the entire CAWS, cormorants may contribute tens of millions to billions of silver carp DNA copies each day. These target marker loads may be contributing to positive detections of silver carp environmental DNA (eDNA) in the CAWS. This study does not address other potential sources of silver carp genetic material in the CAWS, including live fish, and provides no indication as to whether or not the loads attributed to cormorants are large or small in relation to these other potential sources.

Flooding drives a macroinvertebrate biomass boom in ephemeral floodplain wetlands	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Despite broad recognition of the importance of the Flood Pulse Concept to large river ecology, few studies have provided empirical evidence to support a number of its arguments. We compared and contrasted the responses of water quality, nutrients, and the macroinvertebrates of ephemeral and permanent wetlands to a 22-wk managed inundation. We hypothesized that inundation of ephemeral wetlands would mobilize higher concentrations of nutrients from floodplain sediments and C from organic matter, which would, in turn, fuel greater abundance and biomass of aquatic macroinvertebrates than in permanent wetlands. The response of ephemeral wetlands to flooding contrasted very strongly with that of permanent wetlands. Freshly inundated ephemeral wetlands had significantly higher dissolved nutrient and organic C concentrations than permanent wetlands and supported different aquatic macroinvertebrate communities. Macroinvertebrate diversity was higher in permanent wetlands, but ephemeral wetlands supported much greater macroinvertebrate abundance and biomass. Differences between macroinvertebrate communities in ephemeral and reference wetlands were driven primarily by Chironomidae. Chironomus tepperi was the dominant taxon among ephemeral wetlands, both numerically and by biomass. Early-colonizing Coleoptera contributed strongly to taxonomic richness among ephemeral wetlands. Analysis of functional feeding groups (FFGs) indicated that ephemeral wetlands contained a higher proportion of detritus-feeding collector-gatherers compared to permanent wetlands, suggesting an increased reliance on heterotrophic energy pathways. We showed that a managed flood pulse can mobilize latent terrestrial energy sources within ephemeral floodplain wetlands and support a boom of aquatic invertebrate biomass, with important implications for both terrestrial and aquatic food webs.

The invertebrates that inhabit them, and zooplankton specifically, play important roles in these wetlands. We compared the ability of taxon- and size-based analyses of the zooplankton community to predict the influence of environmental variables. We sampled environmental variables and zooplankton at 7 Mediterranean wetlands in the Iberian Peninsula (southern Spain) monthly along 1 hydroperiod cycle (2009-2010). We used 3 arrays for classifying the zooplankton community: 1) species occurring in >5% of the samples, 2) coarse-level taxa easily identified by a nonexpert (large branchiopods, small branchiopods, calanoid copepods, cyclopoid copepods, and harpacticoid copepods), and 3) 4 body-size classes (<1, 1-2.5, 2.5-10, and >10 mm in length). We used permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to test our hypotheses. Communities differed significantly among wetlands, and body size (55.8% of explained variance) was more useful than taxonomic composition (common taxa: 24.4%, coarse-level taxa: 26.5% of explained variance) for rapid assessment of the influence of the environmental variables on zooplankton community in temporary wetlands.

J	Turner, RE				Turner, R. Eugene			The mineral sediment loading of the modern Mississippi River Delta: what is the restoration baseline?	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												A restoration baseline for river deltas establishes a framework for achieving goals that can be thwarted by choosing an improper historical background. The problem addressed here is identify the size of the modern Mississippi River delta that restoration should use as that baseline. The sediment loading to the Mississippi River main stem delta fluctuated over the last 160 years with a consequential dependent plasticity in delta size. A visual time series of the delta size is presented, and the area: sediment loading ratio is calculated. This ratio ranged from 1.8 to 3.9 km(2) per Mmt sediment y(-1) during the pre-European colonization of the watershed in the 1800s, a maximum size in the 1930s, and then lower after soil conservation and dam construction decades later. This land building rate is similar to the 1.3 to 3.7 km(2) per Mmt sediment y(-1) for the Wax Lake and Atchafalaya sub-deltas located to the west, which receives some of the Mississippi River sediment and water from the main channel below St. Francisville, LA. The significance to restoration of delta land lost since the 1930s is that the baseline for the 1930s was conditioned on previous sediment loading that has since declined. Most sediment is trapped in the delta, and so the existing situation is close to a zero-sum land balance. The restoration potential should be based on the delta land area that could be built from the current sediment loading, not from those of the era during peak agricultural expansion and soil erosion in the watershed. Sediment diversions upstream will, therefore, deplete sediment supply downstream where delta land will be lost. The choice of which baseline is used can be seen as a choice between unrealistic perceptions that leads to unachievable goals and agency failures, or, the realism of a delta size limited by current sediment loading.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				DEC	2017	21	6					867	872		10.1007/s11852-017-0547-z								WOS:000416870600012

Estimation of potential zones for offshore mariculture in the Indian Sea using geographical information system as a management tool	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												Coastal mariculture is now facing tremendous pressures, especially from the anthropogenic activities, variable environment, and multi-user conflict. Hence, offshore mariculture is envisioned to enhance the production by promoting the commercial farming (floating cages) of cobia (Rachycentron canadum) and other fin fishes. Essential environmental parameters for mariculture have been selected and converted into thematic layers using Geographical Information System (GIS) tool. Weights of relative importance were assigned to each layer and integrated together through overlay analysis to provide a final model suggesting possible offshore floating marine fish cage deployment sites. In the present study, it is estimated that from 368,009 km(2) area within 100 m depth of Indian Exclusive Economic Zone available for mariculture activities, about 161,188 km(2) area is appropriate for deploying cages. There are 76,396 km(2) of highly suitable and approximately 84,792 km(2) of suitable areas available for mariculture in India including Andaman & Nicobar and Lakshadweep Islands. Analysis of variance (ANOVA-one way) showed significant (p < 0.05) spatial variation for sea surface current, total suspended matter, and chlorophyll-a. This study is an attempt to integrate the weighing criteria and GIS to derive a suitable criterion for deployment of floating cages in the offshore environment, which could serve as a model for similar cases, particularly in the maritime nations for sustainable mariculture.

The in-situ data of water nutrient concentration was collected during the period 2002-2010 by COMAPS from the coastal waters of Gujarat and Maharashtra for the development of algorithms as a part of the application of remote sensing for biochemical cycling in the ocean. Multiple regression analysis was used to develop models for the nutrients and suspended sediments and the results showed the strong correlation between the water nutrients under study and suspended sediment variables with the remote sensing data, having the validated R-2 value of 0.7472 (Total Nitrogen),0.8744 (Total Phosphorus) and 0.971 (Suspended Sediment) respectively in marine waters. The models helped understand the seasonal variability and were also applied to one of the latest sensor VIIRS, which came up with the same results as those derived from MODIS. Thus the models can be used for the real time monitoring of water quality and for the development of an alert system using remote sensing data from both MODIS and VIIRS sensor systems.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				DEC	2017	21	6					917	927		10.1007/s11852-017-0561-1								WOS:000416870600017

Evaluation of water quality is normally based on time consuming and expensive in situ measurements. Remotely sensed data is an efficient alternative for field monitoring because of its spatial and temporal coverage. In this study, remote sensing imagery combined with in situ measurements of water quality were used to estimate an empirical relationship between water surface reflectance and water quality parameters including water turbidity and Total Suspended Sediment (TSS). Surface reflectance values is obtained from MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard the Aqua satellite. The empirical equations were derived from data over summers 2011-13 and show high correlation coefficients of equal to 0.83 and 0.87 for TSS and turbidity respectively. The validity of the proposed equations was tested for summer 2014 data. The NRMSE for prediction of measured data by the proposed equations are 0.36 and 0.3 for TSS and turbidity. Remotely sensed data was also used to produce water quality maps to improve our understanding of the spatiotemporal variations of Fox River turbid plume. The proposed approach can be extended to other coastal regions of Great Lakes and provide a framework to study pollution transportation in coastal areas.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				DEC	2017	21	6					939	950		10.1007/s11852-017-0564-y								WOS:000416870600019

Record flooding of the Illinois River, Illinois, in 2013 reconnected two floodplain preserves under restoration that had been disconnected from the river by levees for > 80 years. Differences in hydrological connections between sites created a natural experiment where field-based data collection could be employed to document flood effects. Levee failure and subsequent river connection at Merwin Preserve increased nutrient capture and floodwater retention, shifted microbial and invertebrate communities, increased fish species richness, spawning and nursery habitat, and stimulated production of moist-soil plant communities during summer drawdown that provided foraging habitat for spring-migrating waterfowl. However, increased hydrologic connectivity during the growing season resulted in loss of submersed vegetation and habitat for autumn-migrating waterfowl. In contrast, river water overtopped the levee at Emiquon Preserve during a 6-day event that resulted in marginal changes in the bacterial community and negligible changes in water quality and community diversity. Tradeoffs among ecological services should be carefully considered when reconnection of highly altered rivers to restored lakes and wetlands is proposed.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				DEC	2017	804	1					151	175		10.1007/s10750-017-3220-5								WOS:000414375700010

Rapid fluctuations in the northern Baltic Sea H2S layer	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is linked to water quality deterioration in the Baltic Sea, with widespread seafloor hypoxia. We examined the vertical and temporal variability of in situ [H2S], oxygen concentration ([O-2]), temperature (T) and pH at weekly, hourly and minute intervals at 13 locations in the western Gulf of Finland in 2013-2014. The main target was the 60-100 m water depth range, containing 3.2-290 mu M O-2 and 6.3-22.6 mu M H2S. Where gas was detected by acoustic surveys, the structure of the H2S layer was more complex compared to stations devoid of gas. Local minima and maxima in pH frequently occurred near the H2S upper boundary (redox transition zone). Except for the homogeneous, tranquil zone above the seafloor at some stations, substantial rapid changes in hydrographic conditions were common. Typically, a layer of marked temporal T variability was present atop or within the topmost H2S layers. The largest temporal changes over a weekly period were - 0.44 degrees C/-10.8 mu M H2S/-0.12 pH units (at seafloor level), + 0.18 degrees C/+7.9 mu M H2S between casts (1 h) and + 0.03 degrees C/-2.5 mu M H2S per minute (high resolution logging). Abrupt [H2S] changes were recorded at two stations with sediments containing free gas. The T and [H2S] changes were synchronous at several layers, reflecting water movement. We conclude that rapid changes occur in hydrographic conditions in the near-bottom H2S layer in the northern Baltic Sea, especially at locations where free gas is present in the underlying sediments.

Abalones (shell length: 41.39 +/- 2.85 mm, body weight: 8.19 +/- 0.66 g) were cultured at three flow velocities; high-velocity (400 L/h), medium-velocity (300 L/h), and low-velocity (200 L/h) during the course of the experiment. Four repeats of each flow velocity were conducted over an experimental cycle of 90 days. Results showed that the survival and specific growth rate of abalones in the 200 L/h group were significantly lower than in any other group at the end of the experiment, while total ammonia nitrogen and NO2-N concentration in the water was significantly higher than that in any other group (P < 0.05). Food intake, food conversion efficiency, protein content, pepsin, and a-amylase activity of abalones in the 300 L/h group were significantly higher than in the 200 and 400 L/h groups (P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference identified between 200 and 400 L/h groups (P > 0.05). Although no significant difference was identified between 300 and 400 L/h groups with respect to cellulase activity or the expression levels of Hdaly, both were significantly higher than in the 200 L/h group (P < 0.05). In the 400 L/h group, hexokinase and pyruvate kinase activity, and lactic acid content were significantly higher compared with in the 300 L/h group (P < 0.05). The ash and fat contents of abalones in the 200 L/h group were significantly lower than in any other group, but moisture content was significantly higher (P < 0.05). At Day 90, the expression levels of Hdamyl, Hdlam, and Hdcel in the 300 L/h group were significantly higher than in any other group (P < 0.05), and compared with Day 45, the expression levels of were Hdamyl significantly increased (P < 0.05). Although no significant difference was identified between 200 and 400 L/h groups with respect to the expression levels of Mn-SOD and CAT, both were significantly higher than those in the 300 L/h group (P < 0.05). Therefore, control of flow velocity at 300 L/h will not only stimulate the food intake and growth of abalones, but also reduce energy consumption to resist against water flow impact and avoid oxidative damage due to water quality deterioration. This will be beneficial for abalone health and will improve aquaculture production.																	0044-8486	1873-5622				DEC 1	2017	481						48	57		10.1016/j.aquaculture.2017.08.023								WOS:000411453300006

Influence of feeding, periphyton and compost application on the performances of striped grey mullet (Mugil cephalus L.) fingerlings in fertilized brackishwater ponds	AQUACULTURE												To evaluate the effects of different management systems on performances of grey mullet (Mugil cephalus L.) fingerlings, a 120-day experimental trial was conducted in twelve brackishwater ponds (600 m(2) each). Rearing management systems assessed were: fertilization alone (FR), combined fertilization-feeding (FF), fertilizationperiphyton (FP) and fertilization-compost application (FC) in triplicate ponds. Soaked mustard cake was used as a fertilizer @ 100 kg ha-1 at 15-day intervals in all the treatment ponds. Formulated crumble diet containing 29.7% protein and 4.9% lipid was used as a supplementary feed in FF. Bamboo poles were used as substrates (equivalent to 10% of pond surface area) to facilitate periphyton growth in FP and composted aquatic weed was applied @ 500 kg ha(-1) in FC at monthly intervals. Ponds were stocked with grey mullet fry (3.36 +/- 0.32 g/63.70 +/- 4.61 mm) at 30,000 number ha(-1). The experiment revealed significant differences in most of the water quality parameters among the four treatments. In FP ponds, a significant reduction (P < 0.05) in inorganic nitrogen and phosphorous, chlorophyll-a contents, and plankton population was observed. The highest fish growth (28.39 +/- 1.94 g) and survival (94.3 +/- 4.2%) were recorded in FP followed by in FF, FC and FR (P < 0.05). A significantly higher total fish biomass (P < 0.05) was obtained in FP (803 +/- 29 kg ha(-1)) followed by in FF (730 +/- 37), FC (507 +/- 33) and FR (362 +/- 22). Condition factor (K) and isometric exponent (b) of length-weight relationship indicated that fingerlings were in better condition with isometric growth (K=1.37 +/- 0.13; b = 3.01 +/- 0.12) in FP. Inferior condition with allometric growth was observed in FR, FF and FC systems. These results suggest that periphyton based system can be an appropriate rearing technique for grey mullet fingerling production in brackishwater fertilized ponds as an environment-friendly and sustainable practice.																	0044-8486	1873-5622				DEC 1	2017	481						64	71		10.1016/j.aquaculture.2017.08.026								WOS:000411453300008

Oxidative balance of fish transported for 3, 6, 12, and 24 h in normoxic (NX), moderate hyperoxia (MH), and severe hyperoxia (SH) was evaluated. For this, it was determined the total antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals (ACAP) and lipid peroxidation levels (TBARS) in liver, gills, muscle, and brain. After 24 h and, regardless of water quality, dissolved oxygen concentrations, and duration of transport, no mortality occurred for any of the treatments. The antioxidant competence of P. oligospila in the different organs remained high, except for some occasional decrements. Because of this, TBARS concentration remained low in the different organs, irrespective of transport time or initial oxygen concentrations. According to the results, P. oligospila antioxidant system was efficient enough for the prevention and/ or suppression of products derived from lipid peroxidation. Therefore, the oxidative status was not severely affected in the assessed organs over transport time in hyperoxic conditions. Furthermore, Peckoltia oligospila can be safely transported in plastic bags without an extra supply of oxygen for up to 24 h, since survival was not affected.

Limited knowledge of the species' requirements under intense recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) culture conditions has motivated this study to focus on the effect of elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) levels on pikeperch metabolism. The trial was conducted in a recirculating aquaculture respirometer system with pikeperch (average body weight 251.9 g) and three hypercapnia regimes over 58 feeding days. Food grade CO2 gas was gradually added to the medium (15 mg L-1) and high (30 mg L-1) treatments while no gas was added to the low treatment (hence 4 mg L-1). Fish were fed daily for 10 min with a commercial diet (ALLER Metabolica). O-2, T, pH, CO2 were measured individually for each tank and logged every 2 h to calculate oxygen consumption rates of each treatment. Total Ammonia-Nitrogen was measured monthly for individual tanks and used to calculate TAN excretion. Results showed a linear decrease of 6% in final body weight with increasing CO2 levels between the low and the high CO2 treatment. Feed intake was linearly increased after four weeks of the experiment from 0.97 +/- 0.07% in the low CO2 treatment to 0.86 +/- 0.03% in the high CO2 treatment but the effect faded after eight weeks, indicating a habituation to the hypercapnia conditions. High levels of CO2 were associated with reductions in haematocrit and metabolic oxygen consumption. The results suggest that adult pikeperch can survive carbon dioxide concentrations of up to 30 mg L-1 when other water quality parameters are in acceptable levels but will be affected in metabolism already at moderate CO2 levels of 15 mg L-1.

Causes and consequences of spatial links between sea cage aquaculture and coral reefs in Vietnam	AQUACULTURE												A majority of the sea cage farms in South East Asia are located close to coral reefs. This causes a conflict between conservation and food production since sea cage aquaculture has a number of negative impacts on coral reefs. The aim of this investigation was to assess the drivers causing the sea cage farmers to place their farms close to reefs and to examine some potential farming effects in detail i.e. usage of coral reef fish for grow out farming and feed. For some 3500 Vietnamese fish and lobster farms, we measured; the distance to the closest coastal city (proxy for infrastructure access), satellite derived Chl a (proxy for water quality), wind fetch, and the adjacent coastal slope and elevation. We also performed 159 semi-structured interviews with fish and lobster cage farmers from three regions in Vietnam. The interviews revealed that the choice of farming site is mainly determined by access to infrastructure, wind and wave shelter, and water quality. Although the farmers used coral reef services, e.g. coral reef derived seedlings, they were in general not aware of coral reef presence or did not find it important for selection of site. Both coral reefs and sea cage farms were found close to steep rocky coasts, which are favorable for corals, and provide sufficient depth for sea cages. Sea cages were always found on the leeward side of the coast where the wind fetch is low enough for the floating farms and their inhabitants. Most of the farms were located within 20 km from a coastal city confirming the importance of access to infrastructure. With few exceptions, sea cage farms were located in areas with good water quality, where also coral reefs are present. The study showed that several of the coral associated species groups farmed were dependent on wild caught seedlings and that 22% of the feed used at farms was "trashfish" of coral reef associated species. We consider the spatial correlation between sea cage farms and coral reefs as circumstantial and suggest that shared environmental preferences explain the farm distribution pattern, rather than access to ecosystem services provided by the nearby reef itself. We found no evidence that it is necessary for sea cage farms to be located near coral reefs and strongly recommend that sea cages are moved further away from coral reefs, but to areas still providing clear water, shelter and access to infrastructure.

Predicting criteria continuous concentrations of metals or metalloids for protecting marine life by use of quantitative ion characteristic-activity relationships-species sensitivity distributions (QICAR-SSD)	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN					8th International Conference on Marine Pollution and Ecotoxicology (ICMPE)	JUN 20-24, 2016	Hong Kong, HONG KONG					Marine pollution by metals has been a major challenge for ecological systems; however, water quality criteria (WQC) for metals in saltwater is still lacking. Especially from a regulatory perspective, chronic effects of metals on marine organisms should receive more attention. A quantitative ion characteristic-activity relationships-species sensitivity distributions (QICAR-SSD) model, based on chronic toxicities for eight marine organisms, was established to predict the criteria continuous concentrations (CCCs) of 21 metals. The results showed that the chronic toxicities of various metals had good relationships with their physicochemical properties. Predicted CCCs of six metals (Hg2+, Cu2+, Pb2+, Cd2+, Ni2+ and Zn2+) were in accordance with the values recommended by the U.S. EPA, with prediction errors being less than an order of magnitude. The QICAR-SSD approach provides an alternative tool to empirical methods and can be useful for deriving scientifically defensible WQC for metals for marine organisms and conducting ecological risk assessments.

The bleaching affected eight species of corals with different growth forms. Bleaching at seven of the eight study sites was minor, affecting only 0.4-5.2% colonies and 0.8-10.0% coral-covered area. Sharp Island East, however, suffered from a moderate level of bleaching, with 13.1% colonies and 30.1% coral-covered area affected. Examination of the government's environmental monitoring data indicated abnormal water quality conditions preceding and during the bleaching event. Follow-up field surveys of tagged colonies showed that 76% of them had fully recovered, 12% partially recovered, and 12% suffered from mortality. These results indicate that the subtropical corals of Hong Kong are not immune to bleaching, and there is a need to study their responses under climate change scenarios. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Taiwanese marine microbenthic algal communities remain similar yet chlorophyll a concentrations rise in mesocosms with elevated CO2 and temperature	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN					8th International Conference on Marine Pollution and Ecotoxicology (ICMPE)	JUN 20-24, 2016	Hong Kong, HONG KONG					The effects of increasing CO2 concentrations and temperature on microalgal assemblages were examined in Taiwan using mesocosms that simulate coral reef ecosystem. We assessed changes in abundance and diversity of benthic algae grown at 25 degrees C and 28 degrees C, under ambient (similar to 400 mu atm) and at high CO2 conditions (800-1000 mu atm). Total alkalinity, pCO(2), and the aragonite saturation state, were all significantly different between control and high CO2 treatments in both temperature treatments. Chl a concentration increased significantly in CO2-treated groups at 25 degrees C, but benthic microalgal abundance was not significantly different. The number of microalgal species and the microalgal community structure did not differ between control and CO2-treated groups at both temperatures. Our results suggest that increasing CO2 may boost benthic microalgal primary productivity if sufficient nutrients are available, although site-specific responses are difficult to predict.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				NOV 30	2017	124	2			SI		929	937		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.06.050								WOS:000417964500045	28669477

Water quality was monitored at each site to evaluate the environmental impact caused by the resulting oil spills. The results show that the PAHs, turbidity, and other nutrients increased shortly after oil spill, however levels of these parameters eventually returned to baseline levels. On the other hand, DO saturation, pH and chl a decreased initially, reached maxima after 10 days, and returned to the baseline levels after 14 days. The chl a concentration, pH and DO saturation fluctuated in a similar pattern at both sites during the oil spills, likely driven by algal blooms. In this study, we documented a full environmental recovery at coastal areas before, during and after the oil spills. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We performed a vegetation survey and measured water depth and water velocity from May to September, 2014-2015. Averaged water quality data from the Ministry of Environment's national water quality measurement network from January 2012 to October 2015 were used for modeling. Potential habitats of M. spicatum were linked with chlorophyll a, nitrate nitrogen, suspended solids, water temperature, water depth, and water velocity (deviance explained = 28.7%, accuracy = 74%). In the case of H. verticillata, electrical conductivity and suspended solids were key habitat factors (deviance explained = 23.4%, accuracy = 75%). Model results were highly consistent with observations and field data. Model performances were evaluated by the accuracy rate, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, the kappa value, and field verification, and were in generally good agreement. Few studies have evaluated the developed models using the independent field data. By understanding the environmental factors that characterize the habitats for submerged macrophytes, our results contribute to the development of conservation and management strategies for river ecosystems.																	1961-9502					NOV 27	2017		418							58	10.1051/kmae/2017044								WOS:000416259600001

To this end, the Locmariaquer site, where Crassostrea gigas is extensively cultivated, was selected to perform a one-year follow-up of tissular glutathione S-transferase and acetylcholinesterase specific activities in this filter feeder organism. Calculation of an integrated index, corresponding to the ratio of the two enzymes activities, allowed to discriminate from the environmental noise, several clusters which could be representative environmental stress, potentially latent pollution. Moreover, the estrogenic activity was assessed in water samples collected at Locmariaquer and other strategic sites of the gulf. The results evidenced a low estrogenic-disrupting compound contamination of waters. Overall, this methodology produced an accurate outlook of a basal state for the gulf and could be developed in the context of a chronic monitoring of this site.

Bloom dynamics and hydrographical conditions were examined by field survey. The bloom initially developed in the eastern area of Imari Bay, subsequently after rainfall during the neap tides, cell density exceeded over 10,000 cells ml. Vertical distribution of K. mikimotoi was primarily controlled by the light intensity and secondarily by the water quality during the daytime. Almost all cell-density maxima occurred in depths with weak daytime light intensities of < 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). In some cases of weak light intensity, cell-density maxima occurred in depths with favorable hydrodynamic conditions for the growth. Spatially classified areas were identified by cluster analysis using the growth rate calculated from seawater temperature and salinity. This study quantitatively evaluated the environmental factors of the eastern area, where the bloom initially occurred, during the development of the bloom.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				NOV 15	2017	124	1					130	138		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.07.019								WOS:000415391200028	28712772

Metals can be either toxic or beneficial to health, inducing many different responses. The response mechanism depends on the class of metals to which organisms are exposed: essential, nonessential, and borderline. To analyze the influence of metals from different classes on the protective mechanisms of an ascidian, we investigated the production of nitric oxide (NO) after exposure to various concentrations of Mg, Mn and Pb over different time periods. We also determined the amounts of each metal in the hemocytes. Our results indicated that especially Pb could stimulate NO production. Although Pb induced the highest NO production, cell viability was not severely altered in all Pb concentrations and time periods. Ascidians might serve as biomonitor for Pb, since their vanadocytes accumulate Pb.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				NOV 15	2017	124	1					441	448		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.06.043								WOS:000415391200061	28779885

This study investigates diet dissolved oxygen (DO) dynamics in one of these typical urbanised wetlands, in tropical North Queensland, Australia. High frequency data loggers (DO, temperature, depth) were deployed for several days over the summer months in different tidal pools and channels that fish use as temporal or permanent refuges. DO was extremely variable over a 24 h cycle, and across the small-scale wetland. The high spatial and temporal DO variability measured was affected by time of day and tidal factors, namely water depth, tidal range and tidal direction (flood vs ebb). For the duration of the logging time, DO was mainly above the adopted threshold for hypoxia (50% saturation), however, for around 11% of the time, and on almost every logging day, DO values fell below the threshold, including a severe hypoxic event (<5% saturation) that continued for several hours. Fish still use this wetland intensively, so must be able to cope with low DO periods. Despite the ability of fish to tolerate extreme conditions, continuing urban expansion is likely to lead to further water quality degradation and so potential loss of nursery ground value. There is a substantial discontinuity between the recommended DO values in the Australian and New Zealand Guidelines for Fresh and Marine Water Quality and the values observed in this wetland, highlighting the limited value of these guidelines for management purposes. Local and regional high frequency data monitoring programs, in conjunction with local exposure risk studies are needed to underpin the development of the management that will ensure the sustainability of coastal wetlands.

In this paper our main objective is to share the lessons learned from the innovative methodology used throughout the project. To achieve the proposed objectives, the multi-disciplinary scientific knowledge in the project team was combined and integrated with the knowledge and views of local stakeholders of four selected European coastal lagoons, using a three step participatory approach. With this innovative approach, which included the usage of eco-hydrological and water quality-modelling tools, the team developed and analyzed integrated scenarios of possible economic development and environmental impacts in four European lagoons and their catchments. These scenarios were presented and discussed with stakeholders, giving rise to management recommendations for each case study lagoon. Results show that some management options might be transferrable to other European lagoons having similar climatic, geophysical and socio-economic settings. In management terms, the project output provides a set of policy guidelines derived from the different analyses conducted and proposes initiatives concerning management implementation in a local-regional-national European setting.

We aimed to reveal potential impacts of the North American crayfish Orconectes limosus on river assessment in the Neman River basin (southeastern Baltic Sea). A laboratory experiment using identical macroinvertebrate assemblages was conducted to compare feeding selectivity and effects between O. limosus and the European Astacus leptodactylus. Field experiments were conducted to evaluate potential impacts of O. limosus on disturbed and undisturbed crayfish-free macroinvertebrate assemblages: one dominated by Oligochaeta vs. one co-dominated by Ephemeroptera-Plecoptera-Trichoptera and Mollusca (EPT-codominated). In the laboratory experiment, both crayfish species preferred feeding on Diptera (mostly chironomids), but O. limosus also selected Trichoptera and Ephemeroptera. Family richness did not change, but both species inflated the Shannon Diversity index by reducing Diptera domination. Astacus leptodactylus treatments had higher Shannon Diversity and percentage of EPT abundance compared to O. limosus treatments. Field experiments indicated (1) negative, (2) assemblage-specific, or (3) no effects of O. limosus on macroinvertebrate metrics. A negative effect, especially in the undisturbed assemblage, was observed on simple additive metrics based on taxa presence data, such as total or EPT family richness, or BMWP (Biological Monitoring Working Party) score. Assemblage-specific effects were indicated for some metrics based on relative abundances. In the Oligochaeta-dominated assemblage, Shannon Diversity was inflated and the percentage of Oligochaeta abundance was reduced. In the EPT-codominated assemblage Shannon Diversity was deflated while the relative abundance of Oligochaeta was not affected. No effects were observed when using the ASPT (Average BMWP Score Per Taxon) or percentage of EPT abundance. We conclude that O. limosus may have a more diverse predatory diet than A. leptodactylus, and thus can have a stronger effect on macroinvertebrate taxa sensitive to disturbances. Therefore, the invasion of O. limosus can alter macroinvertebrate assemblages and compromise conventional ecological assessment, even when it displaces resident Astacus species.																	1798-6540	1818-5487				NOV	2017	12	4					523	540		10.3391/ai.2017.12.4.09								WOS:000418011300009

Differential environmental responses of tropical phytoplankton community in the southwest coast of India	REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE												Phytoplankton characteristics (biomass, primary productivity, species composition and community structure) were studied in a tropical estuary (Cochin estuary) and adjacent coastal marine region for understanding the factors controlling their productivity patterns and community dynamics. The Cochin estuary (CE) sustained a high level of inorganic nutrients supporting very high phytoplankton biomass, productivity, and abundance. Though the CE exhibited a 2-3 fold increase in the annual mean of chlorophyll a (14.6 +/- 8.5 mg m(-3)) and primary production (1288 +/- 999 mgC m(-3)d(-1)) than the coastal waters, both regions sustained a substantial dominance of small-sized phytoplankton, in particular nanoplankton (2-20 mu m), which apparently contributed > 70% of total chlorophyll a and primary production. Diatoms were the dominant phytoplankton functional group (> 75% of total abundance) prevailed over both sampling locations almost throughout the year. However, the sporadic dominance of certain species of dinoflagellates (during premonsoon) and green and blue-green algae (during monsoon) were also encountered in the estuary. The SIMPER analysis, based on phytoplankton species abundance data, revealed the presence of certain characterizing species exclusive for both estuary and coastal waters, and most of them belonged to smaller diatoms e. g., Skeletonema costatum, Thalassiosira subtilis, Nitzschia longissima, Cylindrotheca closterium etc. The incessant proliferation of these small sized diatoms, especially in the CE, can be considered as a potential source of consistently higher phytoplankton biomass and primary productivity, and which can even survive in the recurring short-term (tides) and long-term (seasonal) hydrographic changes of the Cochin estuary.

Environmental forcing of intertidal benthic macrofauna of Bodo Creek, Nigeria: Preliminary index to evaluate cleanup of Ogoniland	REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE												Pristine and before-disturbance baseline data are essential tools in monitoring and measurement of progress and net success or otherwise of restoration of degraded ecosystems. These are usually lacking in regions such as the Niger Delta where demands for such data is pressing due to impending pollution. We present a rare case of available pre-spill data of how distribution and abundance of macrobenthic infauna were structured by some physical and chemical variables of interstitial water in Bodo Creek, lower eastern Niger Delta, Nigeria, before two major oil spills impacted the creek in 2008. Monthly composite samples of macrobenthos and interstitial water in four soft-bottom unvegetated intertidal flats were analysed for one year. Thirty six taxa, twenty-two families and four classes of macrozoobenthos were recorded. The bivalves Lorepis aberrans, Macoma innominata, Senilia senilis, and polychaetes Nereis diversicolor, N. virens, N. pelagic and Clymenella torquata were eurizonal in distribution and abundant, attaining sub-dominant and dominant status at the sites. The observed pattern of reduction in rainy season macrofauna abundance in some river systems of the Niger Delta due to sediment instability was counterbalanced by increased recruitment of the dominant taxa. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) showed the explanatory (physicochemical) variables only accounted for 31.8% of variation in the species data. The species-environmental correlations were: 0.64, 0.74 and 0.72 for the first, second and third axes, respectively. Plans for cleanup, remediation and 'restoration' of Bodo Creek, have reached implementation stage as the Federal Government of Nigeria flagged off cleanup of Ogoniland on June 2, 2016. The usefulness of these data as potential template for monitoring and evaluation of water quality response to the proposed cleanup and restoration is highlighted. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Variability of marine macrofouling assemblages in a marina and a mariculture centre in Bahrain, Arabian Gulf	REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE												Marine biofouling has significant environmental and industrial impacts. Biofouling is considered a specific problem for a wide range of coastal and marine industries, including aquaculture, shipping activities and ports. Colonization and growth of biofouling depend on the complex interactions of biological, physical and chemical factors. Anthropogenic disturbances from coastal modification and water pollution can affect biofouling communities. The coastline of the Arabian Gulf is influenced by marine pollution from a variety of land-based activities. This study investigated spatial and temporal aspects of macrofouling assemblages using experimental panels in a marina and a mariculture centre in Bahrain for a period of one year (2014). Macrofouling assemblages of the two sites differed distinctly in species richness and composition. A total of 38 species was recorded in the mariculture centre compared to eleven species in the marina. Assemblages in the mariculture centre were dominated by hydrozoans, actinozoans, ascidians and sponges, while those in the marina were dominated by tubeworms and barnacles. Different successional patterns were observed in the sampling sites. The sequence of species replacements started by green algae and hydrozoans, followed by actinozoans, ascidians and sponges in the mariculture centre. Brown and green algae, tubeworms and hydrozoans were the earliest successional groups followed by barnacles in the marina. The study provided an initial characterization for the variability of macrofouling assemblages in the naturally and anthropogenically stressed marine environment of the Arabian Gulf.

Effects of bacilli, molasses, and reducing feeding rate on biofloc formation, growth, and gene expression in Litopenaeus vannamei cultured with zero water exchange	LATIN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC RESEARCH												The effects of reducing feeding rate and molasses on water quality, growth, and gene expression of Litopenaeus vannamei were evaluated in a super intensive system with zero water exchange. A bioassay of 35 days (0,75 +/- 0,22 g, 36 shrimp tank(-1), 450 shrimp m(-3)) with treatments in triplicate was performed: I) 100% commercial feed (control group) with water exchange; II) 100% commercial feed without water exchange; III) 100% commercial feed + Bacillus licheniformis BCR 4-3 + molasses without water exchange; IV) 90% commercial feed + B. licheniformis BCR 4-3 + molasses without water exchange, and V) 80% commercial feed + B. licheniformis BCR 4-3 + molasses without water exchange. Shrimp survival, weight, nitrogenous wastes, settleable solids (SS), and the relative expression (RT-qPCR) of stress and digestive genes were determined. Shrimp survival was 100% in all treatments. The reduced diet, bioflocs, and bacilli did not affect shrimp growth. The culture conditions reduced nitrogenous wastes and modulated mRNA expression of trypsin, chymotrypsin, and heat shock protein 70. Reduced feed ration can help to maintain water quality and lower costs in intensive shrimp cultures with bioflocs.																	0718-560X	0717-7178				NOV	2017	45	5					900	907		10.3856/vol45-issue5-fulltext-4								WOS:000416813500004

The experiment, conducted in twenty-one plastic tanks (750 L) was set up to evaluate water quality, growth; production and survival of shrimp, tilapia, and snapper, for 60 days. Three replicates were assigned to seven treatments: After 30 day, initial densities were unfolded (shrimp = 50 ind m(-3), tilapia = 16 ind m(-3) and red snapper = 8 ind m(-3)). Feeding rate was adjusted at 5 and 10% of body weight d(-1) for shrimp and fish, respectively. The shrimp-tilapia mix cultures produced the higher nitrogen and phosphorus in water concentrations. Significant lower survival values were obtained for shrimp (60.0 +/- 0.6%) cultured with snapper and for tilapia (79.0 +/- 3.1%) reared with shrimp. Mean final biomass for shrimp, tilapia and snapper were higher for the mix-cultures (2.04, 7.7 and 2.9 fold increase, respectively) with respect to their initial biomass. The mix culture system allowed an increase in total production with lower feed conversion ratios, thus contributing with the system sustainability.

In Brazil, the major volume of commercialized freshwater ornamental fish is originated from fish farms managed by small and midsized farmers. The aim of this study was to characterize the metazoan parasitic fauna associated with the main freshwater ornamental fish farmed in Southern Brazil. Between July 2014 and January 2015, 423 fishes belonging to nine freshwater species were examined: angelfish Pterophylum scalare, siamese fighting fish Betta splendens, telescope and comet goldfish Carassius auratus, zebrafish Danio rerio, blood red swordtail Xiphophorus helleri, caramel and wagtail platy fish Xiphophorus maculatus, black molly Poecilia sphenops, white cloud mountain minnow Tanichthys albonubes and goldfinned barb Puntius sachsii. Water quality was measured in fishponds from each facility. Specimens were obtained from three ornamental fish farms located in three micro-regions in the State of Santa Catarina (Biguacu, Camboriu e Joinville). Parasitological indexes were obtained after parasitological analysis of mucus, gills, and eyes. Trichodinids, Piscinoodinium pillulare, and Ichthyophthirius multifiliis were found in all fish farms analyzed. However, P. pillulare showed the greatest prevalence and mean intensity, compared to the other protozoa analyzed. 75% prevalence and mean intensity 57.5 were observed in the gills of P. scalare from fish farm Araquari. This study showed that fish farm Biguacu, was the facility presenting the greatest parasite diversity. P. scalare and C. auratus were the most parasitized fish species presenting the higher richness when compared to another species. These ornamental species are widely traded and require greater care in cultivation because it is essential to produce healthy fish with attractive features accepted by the market.																	0718-560X	0717-7178				NOV	2017	45	5					948	956		10.3856/vol45-issue5-fulltext-10								WOS:000416813500010

Variable silver nanoparticle toxicity to Daphnia in boreal lakes	AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY												Variable sensitivity of organisms to silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) caused by changes in physico-chemical variables in aquatic ecosystems is receiving increasing attention. Variables such as dissolved organic carbon, pH, light, the presence of algae and bacteria, dissolved oxygen and different ions have all been studied individually, but it is still unclear how these variables in combination alter AgNP toxicity in natural ecosystems. Here we examined AgNP toxicity on survival of wild-caught Daphnia using AgNP suspensions placed in water from several different lakes at the IISD-Experimental Lakes Area, which span a gradient of water quality parameters. The partitioning of AgNPs between particulate and dissolved organic matter fractions was also assessed due to the potential for algal sequestration and detoxification of AgNPs. We found that toxicity varied between lakes with LC50 values ranging between 34 and 292 mu g Ag L-1. Time of year in terms of days since ice-off and carbon to nitrogen ratios of particulate matter were the major predictors of toxicity between ecosystems. Total dissolved phosphorus, dissolved organic carbon, and particulate carbon to phosphorus ratios also played minor roles in influencing survival of Daphnia between water types. We found variable partitioning of silver into the particulate fraction within lakes and no significant differences between lakes. Silver associated with particulate organic matter increased with increasing concentrations of AgNPs in the ecosystem. Overall, we found strong evidence that AgNP toxicity is highly context dependent in natural lake ecosystems.																	0166-445X	1879-1514				NOV	2017	192						1	6		10.1016/j.aquatox.2017.09.004								WOS:000415768700001	28898784

Jasim			Experimentally derived acute and chronic copper Biotic Ligand Models for rainbow trout	AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY												We evaluated the effects of varying water chemistry ([Ca2+] = 0.2-3 mM, [Mg2+] = 0.05-3 mM, dissolved organic matter (DOM, natural, from maple leaves) = 0.3-10 mg of C L-1, pH = 5.0-8.5) on the acute (96-h, unfed fish) and chronic (30-d, fed fish) toxicity of waterborne Cu to juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) exposed in flow-through conditions. Acute and chronic Biotic Ligand Models (BLMs) were developed from the obtained toxicity data-sets, using the Visual MINTEQ software. Our results indicate that Cu is predominantly an acute toxicant to rainbow trout, as there were no observable growth effects and the 96-h and 30-d LC50 values were similar, with mortality mostly occurring within the first few days of exposure. Calcium and DOM were greatly protective against both acute and chronic Cu toxicity, but Mg seemed to only protect against chronic toxicity. Additional protection by pH 5.0 in acute exposure and by pH 8.5 in chronic exposure occurred. In the range of conditions tested, the observed 96-h LC50 and 30-d LC20 values varied by a factor of 39 and 27 respectively. The newly developed acute and chronic BLMs explained these variations reasonably well (i.e. within a 2-fold error), except at pH >= 8 where the high observed acute toxicity could not be explained, even by considering an equal contribution of CuOH and Cu2+ to the overall Cu toxicity. The 96-h LC50 values of 59% of 90 toxicity tests from 19 independent studies in the literature were reasonably well predicted by the new acute BLM. The LC20 predictions from the new chronic BLM were reasonable for 7 out of 14 toxicity tests from 6 independent chronic studies (with variable exposure durations). The observed deviations from BLM predictions may be due to uncertainties in the water chemistry in these literature studies and/or to differences in fish sensitivity. A residual pH effect was also observed for both the acute and the chronic data-sets, as the ratio of predicted vs. observed LC values generally increased with the pH. Additional mechanistic studies are required to understand the influence of pH, Na, and Mg on Cu toxicity to trout. The present study presents the first experimentally developed chronic Cu BLM for the rainbow trout. To the best of our knowledge, it also presents the first acute Cu BLM that is based on a published data-set for trout. These newly developed BLMs should contribute to improving the risk assessment of Cu to fish in freshwater.

When the 10- to 30-day-ahead predicted concentrations of cyanobacteria cells or cyanotoxins exceed pre-defined limit values, an early warning automatically activates an action plan considering in-lake control, e.g. intermittent mixing and ad hoc water treatment in water works, respectively. Case studies of the sub-tropical Lake Wivenhoe (Australia) and the Mediterranean Vaal Reservoir (South Africa) demonstrate that ensembles of inferential models developed by the hybrid evolutionary algorithm HEA are capable of up to 30 days forecasts of cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins using data collected in situ. The resulting models for Dolicospermum circinale displayed validity for up to 10 days ahead, whilst concentrations of Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii and microcystins were successfully predicted up to 30 days ahead. Implementing the proposed scheme for drinking water reservoirs enhances current water quality monitoring practices by solely utilising in situ monitoring data, in addition to cyanobacteria and cyanotoxin measurements. Access to routinely measured cyanotoxin data allows for development of models that predict explicitly cyanotoxin concentrations that avoid to inadvertently model and predict non-toxic cyanobacterial strains.

This review discusses key factors affecting the flocculation efficiency, based on results obtained in studies of the mechanisms underlying interactions between clay particles and HAB organisms. It further elaborates clay surface modification theory and methods for improving removal efficiency of HAB cells, followed by descriptions of various modified clays successfully prepared with removal efficiencies of HAB cells that are up to hundreds of times greater than natural clays and have lower dosing requirements of 4-10 t/km(2). Presently, modified clays are the most widely used method for the mitigation of HAB in the field in China. This review also evaluates potential ecological effects of modified clay disposal on water quality, typical aquatic organisms, benthic environments, and ecosystems. Both laboratory and field results have demonstrated that modified clays markedly can actually improve water quality after treatment and pose no negative effects on aquatic ecosystems.

Mitigation of acidified salmon rivers - effects of liming on young brown trout Salmo trutta	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												In southern Norway, 22 acidified rivers supporting anadromous salmonids were mitigated with lime to improve water quality and restore fish populations. In 13 of these rivers, effects on Salmo trutta and Salmo salar densities were monitored over 10-12years, grouped into age 0 and age1year fish. These rivers had a mean annual discharge of between 49 and 855m(3)s(-1), and six of them were regulated for hydro-power production. Salmo salar were lost in six of these rivers prior to liming, and highly reduced in the remaining seven rivers. Post-liming, S. salar became re-established in all six rivers with lost populations, and recovered in the seven other rivers. Salmo trutta occurred in all 13 study rivers prior to liming. Despite the improved water quality, both age 0 and age1year S. trutta densities decreased as S. salar density increased, with an average reduction of >50% after 10years of liming. For age 0year S. trutta this effect was less strong in rivers where S. salar were present prior to liming. In contrast, densities of S. trutta increased in unlimed streams above the anadromous stretches in two of the rivers following improved water quality due to natural recovery. Density increases of both age 0 and age1year S. salar showed a positive effect of river discharge. The results suggest that the decline in S. trutta density after liming is related to interspecific resource competition due to the recovery of S. salar. Thus, improved water quality through liming may not only sustain susceptible species, but can have a negative effect on species that are more tolerant prior to the treatment, such as S. trutta.

H.; Bruun, Hans Henrik			Recovery of lake vegetation following reduced eutrophication and acidification	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. In recent decades, many aquatic ecosystems in Europe and North America have experienced reduced inputs of nutrients and acidifying substances because of improved sewage treatment and reduced emission of sulphur oxides. We evaluated the consequences of these efforts to changes in water chemistry, species richness and community composition of aquatic macrophytes in 56 lakes in Denmark around 1990 and again around 2010. 2. Reductions in lake water concentrations of phosphorus and nitrogen were strongest in eutrophic and hypertrophic lakes, for example, lakes which had been heavily affected by domestic sewage. These changes translated into decreased algal biomass in the most eutrophied lakes. Oligo- and mesotrophic lakes did not change significantly in terms of nutrients or algal biomass. Water clarity increased across all lakes but not significantly in specific trophic lake groups. Alkalinity and pH increased significantly (up to 2pH-units) in low-alkaline lakes, while well-buffered high-alkaline lakes (>0.5meq/L) did not show any change. 3. Macrophyte species richness per lake increased, on average, by 13% during the 20-year study period. The increase was strongest in species preferring nutrient-rich conditions and could be directly attributed to reductions in phytoplankton biomass in lakes of medium water clarity. The similarity among all lakes in terms of species composition increased over the study period. This development was closely related to higher average species richness and was mainly caused by recolonisation of lakes, recovering from past eutrophication, by relatively common species (e.g., Lemna trisulca, Sparganium emersum and Potamogeton berchtoldii). Higher pH in low-alkaline lakes was accompanied by a shift from acid-tolerant to more acid-sensitive species. 4. Our results demonstrate that investment in pollution control has been successful in terms of markedly improving water quality of lakes and, with a time lag, macrophyte species richness. Although relatively common species have spread across lakes and resulted in homogenised macrophyte communities, continued efforts to reduce pollution could ensure the survival of rare specialist species and perhaps even increase their abundance in the future.

J	Eriander, L				Eriander, Louise			Light requirements for successful restoration of eelgrass (Zostera marina L.) in a high latitude environment - Acclimatization, growth and carbohydrate storage	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												The short growth season in high latitude environments pose challenges for eelgrass restoration, particularly in areas that receive little light due to e.g. depth or reduced water quality conditions. In order to improve our understanding of the acclimatization potential of eelgrass to low light and the light requirement for successful restoration of eelgrass, an indoor mesocosm study was performed assessing three light (3, 5 and 10 mol photons m(- 2) day(-1)) and two temperature conditions (12 and 20 degrees C). The aim of the study was to determine if eelgrass transplants originating from a shallow donor meadow with high light could acclimatize to low light conditions and how different light conditions affect growth characteristics and carbohydrate storage of transplants. A second aim was to investigate how eelgrass grown under different light conditions cope during severe shading (zero light) under the two temperature conditions, and how severe shading affect the carbohydrate stock of transplants. The results demonstrate that eelgrass can acclimatize to light levels from 10 down to 3 mol photons m(-2) day(-1) by adjustments in morphology, pigmentation and growth strategy, but with a significant reduction in the production of lateral branches below 5 mol photons m(-2) day(-1). Temperature had a strong positive effect on shoot morphology and above ground biomass production independent of light treatment, but less effect on branching. Furthermore, the study shows that acclimatized eelgrass transplants can store carbohydrates at light levels down to 3 mol photons m(-2) day(-1), but that losses occur in relation to the transplantation process and as a result of severe shading. Survival of transplants during severe shading conditions demonstrated large temperature dependent effects, with no effects of previous light conditions. The results from this study provide important insight into the phenotypic response by eelgrass to environmental conditions and could have important implications for management and restoration of eelgrass in high latitude environments with respect to acclimatization potential and the minimum light requirement for successful restoration.																	0022-0981	1879-1697				NOV	2017	496						37	48		10.1016/j.jembe.2017.07.010								WOS:000412252700006						
J	Tas, S; Lundholm, N				Tas, Seyfettin; Lundholm, Nina			Temporal and spatial variability of the potentially toxic Pseudo-nitzschia spp. in a eutrophic estuary (Sea of Marmara)	JOURNAL OF THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM												Spatial and temporal variability and bloom formation of the potentially toxic diatom Pseudo-nitzschia spp. was investigated weekly to monthly from October 2009 to October 2010 in a eutrophic estuary, the Golden Horn. Pseudo-nitzschia spp. were detected in 195 of 512 samples (38%) collected throughout the year. Two species, P. calliantha and P. pungens, were identified based on the SEM examination. Blooms of Pseudo-nitzschia occurred in the lower and middle estuary in January and May. The bloom in January mainly comprised P. calliantha. In the bloom in early May, P. calliantha made up 72% of the Pseudo-nitzschia cells and P. pungens 28%. However, the contribution of P. pungens increased to 83% in late May. The Pseudo-nitzschia blooms occurred at low temperature (9-15 degrees C) and moderate salinity (17-18), and for P. calliantha a significant negative correlation was found with temperature and a significant positive correlation with salinity. The percentage of Pseudo-nitzschia cells decreased gradually from lower to upper estuary (59-14%), correlating with a decrease in Secchi depth (5.5-0.5 m). Principal components analyses (PCA) were used to explore the spatial and temporal variability of environmental factors in relation to Pseudo-nitzschia abundances, and showed that NH4, pH, Secchi depth and DO values were the most important factors reflecting spatial differences, while temperature, salinity, Chl-a and Si:N were more important factors showing temporal differences. High abundances of P. pungens correlated mainly with pH, Secchi depth and DO values, whereas P. calliantha also correlated with NO3 + NO2. Low light availability due to high concentrations of suspended material and very variable environmental conditions (e.g. pH, DO and NH4) may have limited growth of Pseudo-nitzschia in the upper estuary. Regular monitoring of Pseudo-nitzschia is important for improving the understanding of the influence of environmental parameters on bloom dynamics in the study area.

The study was started in June 2014 and water samples were taken from three stations for 12 months. In total, 21 physicochemical parameters and 7 heavy metals were investigated to determine the water quality. Such a detailed study has been done firstly in this pond used for irrigation purpose. As a result of performing analyses, it was found that the water quality was suitable for both the Alpsari Pond hosting aquatic animals and aquatic life. According to the SWQMR, the actual water quality was detected as a level Class (I-III-IV). The result is that the pond is under pollution pressure due to domestic and animal wastes.																	1303-2712					NOV	2017	17	6					1231	1243		10.4194/1303-2712-v17_6_16								WOS:000409436300016						
J	Butler, MJ; Dolan, TW				Butler, Mark J.; Dolan, Thomas W., III			Potential Impacts of Everglades Restoration on Lobster and Hard Bottom Communities in the Florida Keys, FL (USA)	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) is intended to restore the Everglades ecosystem (FL, USA) by altering its hydrology, with likely consequences for "downstream" estuarine and marine communities in Florida Bay and the Florida Keys. Spiny lobsters (Panulirus argus) are among several species of special concern with respect to CERP because they are of economic and ecological importance and because their nursery habitat may be impacted. We used agent-based, spatially explicit modeling to evaluate the possible impacts of changing water quality (temperature, salinity, harmful algal blooms (HABs)) on spiny lobsters and sponges, the latter of which provide shelter for juvenile lobsters. In our simulations, lobster abundance declined 6-24% in scenarios where salinity either decreased alone or in combination with HABs that kill sponges and are associated with changing water quality. The most severe decline in lobsters occurred when salinity was lowest and HABs occurred annually. One third of this decline was attributable to decreased salinity that increased lobster mortality and movement. However, the greatest impacts on lobsters were indirect. CERP-associated changes in salinity along with HABs caused a die-off of large sponges, resulting in higher predatory mortality on lobsters that depend on sponges for shelter in hard bottom nursery habitats. Sponges declined by similar to 50% in simulations with HABs, whereas decreased salinity alone led to sponge mortality of 9-18%. In contrast, higher temperatures increased juvenile lobster growth and eventual recruitment by approximately 7%. Our results suggest that returning Florida Bay to more estuarine, pre-development conditions is likely to result in an ecosystem reversal that is detrimental to stenohaline marine taxa, a scenario with significant socioeconomic implications.																	1559-2723	1559-2731				NOV	2017	40	6					1523	1539		10.1007/s12237-017-0256-8								WOS:000411505400001

Interactive Effects of Physical and Biogeochemical Feedback Processes in a Large Submersed Plant Bed	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Submersed plants are sensitive to nutrient loading because excess algal growth creates light-limiting conditions. However, submersed plant beds can also modify nutrient cycling through feedback loops whereby algal growth is limited and plant growth is enhanced. Whereas most studies on the effect of submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV) beds on nutrient cycling concentrate on either biogeochemical or physical controlling mechanisms, we use a holistic approach that analyzes how these processes interact. We measured a suite of physical and biological processes in a large SAV bed and developed a simple, 1-dimensional reactive transport model to investigate the mechanisms underlying SAV bed effects on nutrient cycling. We observed lower water column concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus (DIN and DIP) inside relative to outside the SAV bed during the summer. Sediment denitrification (mean N-2-N flux in August = 46 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)) and plant nutrient assimilation (August rates = 385 mu mol N and 25 mu mol P m(-2) h(-1)) were mechanisms of nutrient removal. We also found that the physical structure of the bed decreased advection and tidal dispersion, resulting in increased water residence time that enhanced biologically mediated nutrient loss. These processes create conditions that enable SAV to outcompete other primary producers, as water column nutrient concentrations were low enough to limit algal growth and associated light attenuation, while sediment pore water concentrations were sufficient to satisfy SAV nutrient demand. These findings suggest that interactions between physical and biological feedback processes in SAV beds can play a key role in structuring shallow aquatic ecosystems.

Effects of mechanical aeration in the waste-treatment cells of split-pond aquaculture systems on water quality	AQUACULTURE												Split-pond systems divide a traditional pond into a 1: 4 relationship where 20% of the water surface area is designated to fish production and 80% is designated to waste-treatment. Water passes from the fish cell to the waste cell for water quality improvement and flows back to the fish cell. The present study was conducted on a commercial catfish farm in west Alabama that has eight split-ponds, each with a fish-holding section of about 8000 m(2). Two, 10-hp floating, electric paddlewheel aerators were placed in the waste cells of each of four ponds -treatment ponds; while four ponds - the controls - had un-aerated waste cells. Analyses were made for pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, Secchi disk visibility, chlorophyll a, total ammonia nitrogen (TAN; nitrogen in NH3 + NH4+), ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N), nitrite-nitrogen, nitrate-nitrogen, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, soluble reactive phosphorus, chemical oxygen demand (total and soluble), biological oxygen demand, and acidification potential. In Year 1 (2014) ammonia-nitrogen was greater in treatment ponds than control ponds. In Year 2 (2015), greater concentrations for control than treatment ponds were found for TAN, ammonia-nitrogen, total nitrogen, chemical oxygen demand (soluble and total). In Year 3 (2016), greater concentrations were found for control ponds than treatment ponds for TAN, ammonia-nitrogen, total phosphorus, and soluble chemical oxygen demand. Nevertheless, no differences were found between treatments and control ponds for production, yield, and feed conversion ratio (FCR). Best management practices that could help the farmer minimize fish mortality and improve production from previous research are discussed.																	0044-8486	1873-5622				NOV 1	2017	480						32	41		10.1016/j.aquaculture.2017.08.001								WOS:000411904700005

This is to improve water quality, and to maintain a hygienic environment for the wellbeing of aquatic organisms. However, chlorination can result in formation of regulated disinfection byproducts (DBPs) that can be carcinogenic and toxic. This study aims to evaluate if an optimal balance can be achieved between minimal regulated DBP formation and effective microbial inactivation with either chlorination or monochloramination for application in the Red Sea aquaculture waters. Upon chlorination, the concentration of total trihalomethanes (THMs), primarily bromoform, exceeded the regulatory limit of 80 mu g/L even at the lowest tested concentration of chlorine (1 mg/L) and contact time (1 h). Comparatively, regulated THMs concentration was only detectable at 30 mu g/L level in one of the three sets of monochloraminated marine aquaculture waters. The average log reduction of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) by chlorine ranged from 2.3-log to 3.2-log with different contact time. The average log reduction of ARB by monochloramine was comparatively lower at 1.9 to 2.9-log. Although viable Staphylococcus aureus was recovered from monochloraminated samples as opposed to chlorinated samples, the abundance of S. aureus was not high enough to result in any significant microbial risks. Both chlorination and monochloramination did not provide any significant improvement in the reduction of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). This study demonstrates that a systematic evaluation is needed to determine the optimal disinfectant required to balance both microbial and chemical risks. Compared to chlorine, monochloramine may be a more appropriate disinfection strategy for the treatment of aquaculture effluents prior to discharge or for recirculatory use in the aquaculture facility.																	0044-8486	1873-5622				NOV 1	2017	480						94	102		10.1016/j.aquaculture.2017.08.014								WOS:000411904700014

Prolonged transport of rainbow trout fingerlings in plastic bags: Optimization of hauling conditions based on survival and water chemistry	AQUACULTURE												Breeding and seed production of rainbow trout is limited to government operated hatcheries in India, which often necessitates the transport of stock size fish to geographically distant farm units. Therefore, the present field study was carried out to derive suitable conditions for prolonged transport of rainbow trout fingerlings in plastic bags. Critical factors such as starvation period (24 vs. 72 h), loading density (13.3, 26.7 and 40 g/L), addition of salt (0, 3 and 6 g/L) and mild sedation with clove oil (0, 10, 20 and 40 mu L/L) were evaluated based on fish survival and changes in total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), un-ionized ammonia (NH3-N), CO2 and pH of the transport water. The experimental fish (mean weight 4 +/- 2 g and mean total length 5.5 +/- 1.5 cm) were packed in plastic bags containing 6 L of stream water and 12 L of pressurized oxygen atmosphere, and transported by road in a refrigerated truck, at a constant temperature of 13 degrees C. The total distance covered and duration taken was 750 km and 40 h, respectively. On the basis of zero fish mortality and least adverse water quality after transport, we suggest that a starvation period of 72 h, loading density of 26.7 g/L and light sedation of fish with 40 mu L/L clove oil prior to packing is suitable for transporting rainbow trout juveniles in plastic bags up to 40 h. To ascertain the benefit of adding salt to the transport medium, we need to further investigate the aspects of delayed mortality and long term fish welfare.																	0044-8486	1873-5622				NOV 1	2017	480						103	107		10.1016/j.aquaculture.2017.08.012								WOS:000411904700015

We tracked changes in metal content in the seagrass Posidonia oceanica, along the NW Mediterranean from 2003 to 2010. While Cu, Cd and Ni showed a large inter-site variation, likely due to local factors, Fe, Mn and Pb showed little local variation and synchronous interannual variability across sites, most likely due to large-scale sources. Zn showed equal importance of local and large-scale sources of variation. Temporal trends of Ni, Zn, Cd, Cu remained almost stable. In contrast, Fe, Mn and Pb slightly increased in the last decade. These trends suggest that metals like Cu, Cd, Ni can be effectively managed at local scale. Whereas, elements like Fe, Mn and Pb have an important large-scale component that needs to be managed across the frontiers of national jurisdictions.

We conducted dilute-acid extractions and standard elutriate tests to investigate the potential of this exploitation to (1) create a new seafloor with elevated trace metal content, (2) mobilise trace metals during iron sand extraction and, (3) enrich the returning process seawater, which feeds iron sand through mills, with trace metals. We found that recruits of freshly uncovered sediment may encounter higher-than-natural concentrations of cadmium, nickel and chromium (but not of copper, lead, and zinc) and propose to investigate the bioavailability of these metals. Elutriate test with raw and milled iron sand revealed that, for nickel and copper, dilution of the process seawater may be required to meet the local water quality guideline. We argue that this dilution can be achieved by adjustment of the mass and seawater balance of the offshore extraction process.

In this study, the Bay of Izmir (in the eastern Aegean Sea), which is a critical area because of its relationship with marine transportation and industrial and commercial activities, was evaluated for its microbiological and physicochemical parameters through a monitoring program. The data were obtained from seasonally assembled surface seawater samples from 2015 to 2017 at 23 sampling stations. Bacteriological investigations were performed by membrane filtration technique. During the monitoring period, for stations at the inner and middle-outer part, it was found that the inner part is exposed to more number of fecal coliforms (8.8 x 10(2) cfu/100 mL) and fecal streptococci (1.1 x 10(3) cfu/100 mL). The monitoring analysis performed in this study showed that there was negative correlation between physicochemical parameters and the level of fecal bacteria, but no significance was recorded by the Pearson correlation test. Fecal contamination parameters should be routinely monitored for improving the environmental conditions of coastal cities.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				OCT 15	2017	123	1-2					400	403		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.08.052								WOS:000415776600059	28863975

Observations in recent years suggest that this resistance may be weakening, shown by: significant increases of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) and decreases of dissolved oxygen (DO), common occurrences of phytoplankton taxa that can form Harmful Algal Blooms (HAB), and algal toxins in water and mussels reaching levels of concern. As a result, managers now ask: what levels of chl-a in SFB constitute tipping points of phytoplankton biomass beyond which water quality will become degraded, requiring significant nutrient reductions to avoid impairments? We analyzed data for DO, phytoplankton species composition, chl-a, and algal toxins to derive quantitative relationships between three indicators (HAB abundance, toxin concentrations, DO) and chl-a. Quantile regressions relating HAB abundance and DO to chl-a were significant, indicating SFB is at increased risk of adverse HAB and low DO levels if chl-a continues to increase. Conditional probability analysis (CPA) showed chl-a of 13 mg m(-3) as a "protective" threshold below which probabilities for exceeding alert levels for HAB abundance and toxins were reduced. This threshold was similar to chl-a of 13-16 mg m(-3) that would meet a SFB-wide 80% saturation Water Quality Criterion (WQC) for DO. Higher "at risk" chl-a thresholds from 25 to 40 mg m(-3) corresponded to 0.5 probability of exceeding alert levels for HAB abundance, and for DO below a WQC of 5.0 mg L-1 designated for lower South Bay (LSB) and South Bay (SB). We submit these thresholds as a basis to assess eutrophication status of SFB and to inform nutrient management actions. This approach is transferrable to other estuaries to derive chl-a thresholds protective against eutrophication. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Mattone, C; Sheaves, M				Mattone, Carlo; Sheaves, Marcus			Patterns, drivers and implications of dissolved oxygen dynamics in tropical mangrove forests	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Estuarine mangrove forests regulate and facilitate many ecological processes, and provide nursery ground for many commercially important species. However, mangroves grow in sediments with high carbon loading and high respiration rates which can potentially influencing the dissolved oxygen (DO) dynamics of tidal water flowing into mangrove forests, as bacteria strip DO from the incoming water to carry out metabolic functions. In turn this is likely to influence the way nekton and other aquatic organisms utilize mangrove forests. Despite these possibilities, previous work has focused on looking at DO dynamics within mangrove creeks, with little research focusing on understanding DO dynamics within the mangrove forests themselves during tidal inundation or of DO levels of pools within the forest remaining once the tide has ebbed. The present study investigates the pattern in DO at various distances within an estuarine Rhizophora stylosa forest in tropical north Queensland. DO levels were recorded at 5 min interval over 2 days and multiple tidal cycles, data were collected between 2013 and 2014 for a total of 32 tidal cycles encompassing multiples seasons and tidal amplitudes. There were substantial fluctuations in DO, often varying from normoxic to hypoxic within the same tidal cycle. A range of factors influenced DO dynamics, in particular: tidal height, amount of sunlight, tidal phase, and distance from the outer edge of the mangrove forest. In fact, spring tides tend to have high DO saturation, particularly during the flooding phase, however as the tide starts ebbing, DO depletes rapidly especially in areas further inside the forest. Moreover during tidal disconnection the remnant pools within the forest quickly became anoxic. These variations in DO suggest that the use of mangrove forests by animals is likely to be constrained by their ability to withstand low DO levels, and provides a plausible explanation for the apparent paucity of benthic organism observed inside similar mangrove forest in previous studies of South Pacific mangroves. Low DO levels coupled with low densities of benthic prey also provides a likely explanation for the limited utilisation of landwards areas of these forests by fish and other nekton.

Long-term acoustic monitoring of fish calling provides baseline estimates of reproductive time-lines in the May River estuary, southeastern USA	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												In this study, our goal was to perform acoustic monitoring of the May River, South Carolina (USA), for a 9 mo period and estimate reproductive timelines for a community of soniferous fishes. Acoustic recorders were deployed to collect sound samples for 2 min, every 20 min at 4 stations from the source to the mouth from February to November 2013. We detected the acoustic presence of 6 fish species: Atlantic croaker Micropogonias undulatus, black drum Pogonias cromis, silver perch Bairdiella chrysoura, oyster toadfish Opsanus tau, spotted sea trout Cynoscion nebulosus, and red drum Sciaenops ocellatus. Acoustic detection rates and diversity of soniferous fish were higher near the mouth and de creased towards the source, suggesting a selection of deeper water and/or more stable water quality conditions for spawning. We estimated the start and end dates of the spawning season and calculated the total hours of chorusing for silver perch, oyster toadfish, spotted seatrout, and red drum. Each species followed a specific seasonal and daily pattern of calling, and we observed synchrony of these calling patterns among stations. For silver perch, oyster toadfish, black drum, and spotted seatrout, a negative tem perature anomaly correlated with decreased calling intensity, while a positive anomaly increased sound production. For oyster toadfish and spotted seatrout, the lunar phase significantly influenced calling. These data serve as a foundation for future studies that are investigating how climate variability may affect seasonal spawning timelines and year class strength of fish populations using passive acoustic monitoring.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				OCT 13	2017	581						1	19		10.3354/meps12322								WOS:000414582700001

The creation of such marine parks must be accompanied by careful measures to guarantee the coexistence of natural biota and human activities in these systems. The State Marine Park of Laje de Santos (SMPLS) is so close to an industrial pole and urban area that its creation and maintenance is an example for humanity. However, no program has yet been installed for the monitoring of its biotic and abiotic water parameters. Thus, the objective of this study is to provide hydrological and hydrochemical parameters with emphasis on dissolved nutrients to establish a starting point for the monitoring of these waters. The presence of the South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) in the marine park during the spring and summer sampling periods was evidenced by the observation of low temperatures (<17 degrees C) associated with salinity around 35 at the bottom of the water column, indicating a thermohaline feature. The dissolved oxygen presented high values, with few data below 4 mL L-1 occurring at the bottom of the water column. The pH was always in accordance with marine values (similar to 8). Dissolved silicate and phosphate presented high values associated with inputs from the SACW intrusion, continental runoff and bottom resuspension processes, reaching maximum values of 15.86 and 1.23 mu mol L-1, respectively. Nitrogen compounds were also associated with a natural fertilization process by the presence of the SACW at the bottom of the water column, as evidenced by the high nitrate concentrations (> 7.00 mu mol L-1), while the concentration of N-ammonium (maximum 9.86 mu mol L-1) demonstrated a rapid regeneration of the organic matter, mainly in the euphotic zone. Analysis of the data from summer periods revealed an annual difference, showing January 2014 to be drier than January 2015, which influenced the availability of some nutrients and the standard distribution of hydrochemical parameters in this region. The results of the distribution of hydrochemical parameters in the marine park confirms the preserved conditions of the seawater around the Laje de Santos, demonstrated by the excellent water quality, concluding the need to implant monitoring actions based on these reference data to preserve this important reserve of marine life.																	1679-8759	1982-436X				OCT-DEC	2017	65	4					628	643		10.1590/S1679-87592017136806504								WOS:000426905100008

The breakdown of this organic detritus is a key process for its remobilization into the trophic chains. Our objective was to describe the temporal dynamics of leaf breakdown in a tropical stream with a riparian canopy degraded by the extraction of palm trees. The vertical input of leaves was collected monthly in a natural stream and incubated for 30 days in a stream with a degraded canopy. Leaf breakdown rates (k), and leaf associated microbial biomass, fungal sporulation and invertebrate community were estimated. Higher values of k were observed in summer most likely due to high temperatures (increased metabolic activity) and rainfall (higher physical abrasion). Aquatic invertebrates (mainly shredders) and total microorganisms showed no overall influence on leaf breakdown rates. Therefore, in this large temporal sampling, water flow, temperature and precipitation were the factors controlling k in this stream. There were no observed changes in k compared to natural environments, most likely because the canopy degradation is a structural modification and does not represent a source of pollution.

J	Lupon, A; Sabater, F; Bernal, S				Lupon, Anna; Sabater, Francesc; Bernal, Susana			The influence of Mediterranean riparian forests on stream nitrogen dynamics: a review from a catchment perspective	LIMNETICA					18th Congress of the Iberian-Association-of-Limnology	JUL 04-08, 2016	Tortosa, SPAIN	Iberian Assoc Limnol				Riparian zones are considered natural filters of nitrogen (N) within catchments because they can substantially diminish the exports of N from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems. However, understanding the influence of riparian zones on regulating N exports at the catchment scale still remains a big challenge in ecology, mainly because upscaling plot scale results is difficult, as it is disentangling the effects of riparian, upland, and in-stream processes on stream water chemistry. In this review, we summarize previous studies examining key hydrological and biogeochemical processes by which Mediterranean riparian zones regulate catchment water and N exports. We focus on Mediterranean regions because they experience a marked climatic seasonality that facilitates disentangling the close link between climate, riparian hydrology, and stream N exports. We show that Mediterranean riparian soils can be hot spots of N mineralization and nitrification within catchments given their relatively moist conditions and large stocks of N-rich leaf litter. Extremely large nitrification rates can occur during short-time periods (i.e. hot moments) and lead to increases in stream N loads, suggesting that riparian soils can be a potential source of N to adjacent aquatic systems. Moreover, riparian trees can contribute to decrease riparian groundwater level during the vegetative period, and promote reverse fluxes from the stream to the riparian zone. During periods of high hydrological retention, stream water exports to downstream ecosystem decrease, while stream water chemistry is mostly determined by in-stream processes. Riparian tree phenology can also affect catchment N exports by shaping the temporal pattern of both light and litter inputs into the stream. In spring, light enhances in-stream photoautotrophic N uptake before riparian leaf-out, while riparian leaf litter inputs promote in-stream N mineralization in summer and fall. Finally, we illustrate that the impact of Mediterranean riparian zones on stream hydrology and biogeochemistry increases along the stream continuum, and can ultimately influence catchment N exports to downstream ecosystems. Overall, findings gathered in this review question the well-established idea that riparian zones are efficient N buffers, at least for Mediterranean regions, and stress that an integrated view of upland, riparian, and stream ecosystems is essential for advancing our understanding of catchment hydrology and biogeochemistry.

Here we use sharp microelectrode measurements to obtain ECG characteristics in adult zebra fish and analyze the effects of cadmium chloride (CdCl2) on the heart. We observe the overall changes of ECG parameters in different treatments (0.1 TU, 0.5 TU and 1.0 TU CdCl2), including P wave, Q wave, R wave, S wave, T wave, PR interval (atrial contraction), QRS complex (ventricular depolarization), ST segment, and QT interval (ventricular repolarization). The trends of the ECG parameters showed some responses to the concentration and exposure time of CdCl2\, but it was difficult to obtain more information about the useful indicators in water quality assessment depending on tendency analysis alone. A self-organizing map (SOM) showed that P values, R values, and T values were similar; R wave and T wave amplitude were similar; and most important, QRS value was similar to the CdCl2 stress according to the classified data patterns including CdCl2 stress (E) and ECG components based on the Ward linkage. It suggested that the duration of QRS complex was related to environmental stress E directly. The specification and evaluation of ECG parameters in Cd2+ pollution suggested that there is a markedly significant correlation between QRS complex and CdCl2 stress with the highest r (0.729) and the smallestp (0.002) among all ECG characteristics. In this case, it is concluded that QRS complex can be used as an indicator in the CdCl2 stress assessment due to the lowest AIC data abased on the linear regression model between the CdCl2 stress and ECG parameters.																	0166-445X	1879-1514				OCT	2017	191						236	244		10.1016/j.aquatox.2017.08.015								WOS:000411848700024	28869925

We tested how excavation (maintenance) of agricultural drains (ditches) altered fish assemblages. Uncertainty regarding the effects of drain maintenance on fish assemblages has been a source of tension between landowners, drain superintendents, and fishery managers. Fish assemblages in eight southwestern Ontario drains were sampled repeatedly from before to 2 years after drain maintenance using a replicated before-after, control-impact (BACI) design. Relative to reference sites, we found no evidence for short-or long-term decreases in the number of species and total abundance of fishes following drain maintenance, nor any consistent change in assemblage composition, despite clear changes in physical habitat. The fish assemblages in drains were resilient to drain maintenance and did not show changes expected to concern fishery managers. Our findings provide fishery managers with the information needed to manage drain maintenance more effectively under the Fish Protection Program of the Fisheries Act and to develop drain maintenance practices that balance the needs of agriculture with the protection of fish biodiversity.																	0706-652X	1205-7533				OCT	2017	74	10					1538	1548		10.1139/cjfas-2016-0361								WOS:000411897600005

The present study showed that values of temperature (T), electrical conductivity (EC), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), chloride, phosphate, sulfate, fecal coliform, Streptococcus, Salmonella spp., and Enterococci were significantly higher in the dry season compared to samples taken in the wet season. Concurrently, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), turbidity, suspended matter (SM), NH4+ presented values significantly lower in dry season than surveys in rainy season. The following parameters BOD5, COD, SO42-, Cl-, SM, Salmonella spp. did not meet the Tunisian standard NT 106 for surface water quality. Analysis of pollutant concentrations via PCA showed that the two first components accounted for 87.34 and 93.17% of the total variance for dry and rainy season sampling, respectively. The first component included T, pH, EC, SM, SO42-, Cl-, NH4+, turbidity, COD, BOD, PO43-, Enterococci, fecal coliform and streptococcus, Salmonella spp., and total bacteria. The second included DO and NO3-. Cluster analysis identified the five sampling sites into three groups in the rainy and dry season based on seasonal differences and various pollution levels caused by physicochemical and bacteriological properties. The results suggest that future monitoring can include fewer sampling sites, and stratified random sampling plans can save time and resources.

Future Scenarios Modeling of Urban Stormwater Management Response to Impacts of Climate Change and Urbanization	CLEAN-SOIL AIR WATER												Future scenarios modeling is used to investigate the effectiveness of the urban stormwater infrastructure and its response to potential future changes. The changes of urban stormwater, both in-flow quantity and water quality, in response to climate change and urbanization are examined and tested in two highly developed urban catchments using the US Environmental Protection Agency's Storm Water Management Model. Similar responses are observed in the two catchments, despite their differences in size and land use. Flow quantity and water quality appears to be more sensitive to urbanization factors than to climatic change. With respect to factors attributable to urbanization, urban intensification (land use plus population density) has more of an effect than land-use changes alone. Low-impact development, as a key adaptation measure, could be effective in mitigating the adverse impacts of future changes on urban stormwater. The methodology developed in this study may be useful for urban stormwater planning and testing such plans against future urbanization and climate change scenarios.																	1863-0650	1863-0669				OCT	2017	45	10							1700111	10.1002/clen.201700111								WOS:000412916700006

Trophic state indicators are a better predictor of Florida bass condition compared to temperature in Florida's freshwater bodies	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Forecasted increases in global temperatures will likely have profound effects on freshwater fishes. Overlaid on increasing global temperatures, human populations are expected to grow, which will increase anthropogenic nutrient enrichment in freshwater ecosystems. Florida (US) represents the equatorial range limit for many freshwater fishes, thus these species are potentially at risk to climate warming. Likewise, Florida's population is expected to aggressively expand, increasing risk for nutrient enrichment. In this study, we examined whether maximum water temperatures or trophic state indicators (a proxy for nutrient enrichment) better explains variation in Florida Bass (Micropterus salmoides floridanus) condition across 23 different Florida freshwater bodies distributed throughout the state. Florida Bass lengths and weights, temperature, and chlorophyll-alpha, total phosphorous (TP), and total nitrogen (TN) measures were collected in the late summer and fall from 2010 to 2012. We described relationships between bass relative condition and environmental measurements (temperature, and trophic state indicators) across these lake-year combinations using linear and non-linear regressions. We found no significant relationship between temperature and bass condition (r(2) = 0.01). However, we found that trophic state indicators did predict bass condition (r(2) = 0.39-0.50). Though research is needed to more rigorously assess the effects of rising temperature on bass condition, our results may suggest that lake productivity is currently an influential driver on Florida Bass. As such, management efforts should continue to closely monitor and manage water quality and potential nutrient enrichment in Florida's freshwater waters, as bass condition appears to be closely tied to lake productivity.																	0378-1909	1573-5133				OCT	2017	100	10					1181	1192		10.1007/s10641-017-0635-9								WOS:000412840700003

Loudoun reservoir, Tennessee (USA)	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Following water quality and minimum flow improvements to the impounded Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers, juvenile lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) have been restocked annually since 2000. Our goal was to seasonally assess foraging mode of this recovering population in Ft. Loudoun Reservoir in the Upper Tennessee River. During 2014-15, individuals were captured using trot-lines in a 13-km reach that supports the greatest density of lake sturgeon. We used colonic flushing and gastric lavage techniques to obtain diet. We took systematic benthic sediment grabs along multiple transects throughout the reach and opportunistically deployed rock cages filled with hard substrates to assess potential prey that colonize hard surfaces. Foraging modes of lake sturgeon were determined by comparing relative abundances of invertebrate taxa in the gut contents (6581 invertebrates) of 28 fish to the relative abundances of the same invertebrate taxa collected from the resource base (1667 invertebrates). Proportional similarity, Levin's niche breadth, and Manly's index were used to assess the degree of prey selectivity. Lake sturgeon fed selectively on a narrow range of available prey consisting mostly of larval chironomids (93% composition by number during warm season, 96% during cool season), some genera of which they prey upon selectively, primarily Chironomus sp., but to a lesser extent Procladius, Ablabesmyia, Coelotanypus, and Cryptochironomus spp. Meanwhile, other abundant taxa in the resource base were avoided, such as Oligochaetes, Hexagenia mayflies, and the chironomid Glyptotendipes. Our results illustrate that assessing seasonally available prey from habitat utilized by lake sturgeon is important when investigating diet preference.																	0378-1909	1573-5133				OCT	2017	100	10					1301	1314		10.1007/s10641-017-0643-9								WOS:000412840700011

The present study is conducted to assess spatio-temporal pattern of phytoplankton assemblage in the southern parts of the Caspian Sea (CS) which in turn can serve as an ecological health indicator in this region. Among 64 identified phytoplankton species, diatoms (37 species and 66.2%) and Dinophyceae (11 species and 18.2%) were dominant. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) were employed to reveal Spatial and temporal distributions of phytoplankton assemblages. Four groups were established using hierarchical clustering based on species richness similarities which were absolutely represented the four seasons. The summer and spring samples were highly separated from the winter and autumn samples. The Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) model showed that temporal patterns of phytoplankton assemblages were mostly explained by chemical factors (silicate, phosphate, and nitrite) and temperature. In conclusion, results of this study suggested that spatio-temporal patterns of phytoplankton in the southern part of the CS are closely associated with seasonal variations in river flow and temperature. The temporal patterns are apparently dominant in this area and water nutrients are mainly responsible for seasonal changes.

Assessing condition of macroinvertebrate communities and bed sediment toxicity in the Rochester Embayment Area of Concern, New York, USA	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The United States and Canada agreed to restore the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Great Lakes ecosystem under the first Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement in 1972. The lowest reach of the Genesee River and the Rochester Embayment on Lake Ontario between Bogus Point and Nine Mile Point, including Braddock Bay, were designated as an Area of Concern (AOC) due to effects of contaminated sediments and physical disturbance on several beneficial uses. Following sediment remedial efforts and with conditions improving in the AOC, the present study was conducted to reevaluate the status of the benthic macroinvertebrate (benthos) beneficial use impairment (BUI). Benthic macroinvertebrate community assessments and 10-day Chironomus dilutus bioassays were used to test the hypotheses that sediments within the AOC were no more toxic than sediments from surrounding reference areas. The study was separated into three discrete systems (Genesee River, Lake Ontario, and Braddock Bay) and non-parametric analyses determined that a multimetric index of benthic macroinvertebrate community integrity was significantly higher at AOC sites compared to reference sites on the Genesee River and in Braddock Bay while AOC and reference sites on Lake Ontario did not differ significantly. Survival and growth of C. dilutus were also similar between AOC and reference sites for each system with the exception of significantly higher growth at reference sites on Lake Ontario. Results generally indicated that the condition of benthos and toxicity of sediment of the Rochester Embayment AOC are similar to or better than that in the surrounding area.

J	Howell, ET; Dove, A				Howell, E. Todd; Dove, Alice			Chronic nutrient loading from Lake Erie affecting water quality and nuisance algae on the St. Catharines shores of Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Water quality and lake circulation in the nearshore of Lake Ontario bordering the city of St. Catharines were examined from May to October 2013 to interpret factors impacting water resources and contributing to nuisance algae. Our findings suggest that loadings from eastern Lake Erie via Twelve Mile Creek and the Welland Canal are a primary driver of variability in nearshore water quality, creating mixing areas enriched in particulate and dissolved phosphorus and turbidity. Impingement of the Niagara River plume and regional lake circulation also impact water quality conditions. Quantitative benthic sampling revealed that Cladophora was abundant to lake depths of about six meters, which is shallower than other nearshore areas of Lake Ontario. Estimates of PAR intensity at the lakebed interpolated over the study area suggest that light limitation counteracts the stimulation of Cladophora growth attributable to elevated dissolved phosphorus over the discharge mixing areas. No evidence was found that the chronic loading of phosphorus in the area resulted in a higher prevalence of Cladophora compared with other areas of the lake. The abundance of dreissenid mussels, reaching 4760 individuals/m(2), was not correlated with water chemistry features or biomass of Cladophora. Interactions between dreissenids and Cladophora may be muted in the area due to overriding physical factors which appear to limit Cladophora to shallow depths and mussels to deeper waters.

Long-term decline in stream total phosphorus concentrations: A pervasive pattern in all watershed types in Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Cultural eutrophication of the Great Lakes resulted in actions to reduce phosphorus loading beginning in the 1970's. Despite these measures, a resurgence of harmful algae blooms began in the 1990s. Non-point sources and changing agricultural practices are frequently cited as contributing to this resurgence. We examined changes in total phosphorus concentrations ([TP]) and several other water quality parameters from April through November from 1979 to 2011 using 56 streams throughout Ontario, including agricultural, undeveloped, urban, and mixed-use watersheds. Growing season median [TP] was not significantly different among stream types, but decreased in 32 of the 56 sites; only one urban site increased. There were weak differences among land uses; mixed sites typically had the highest [TP] and steepest declines. Soluble reactive P concentration [SRP] decreased at 12 sites, and increased at one agricultural and three urban sites. Where trends were significant, suspended solids typically decreased, while [Cl-] and alkalinity typically increased. As adequate winter data were not available and there may have been changes in the seasonal distribution of high flow during the period we studied, the changes we observed in median growing season [TP] may not reflect changes in loading. However, seasonal discharge trends were not significant except for one site with a decreasing trend in spring discharge. Possible mechanisms for pervasive downward trends in TP include improved rural and urban land use practices, reduced acid precipitation, increased nitrogen availability in terrestrial ecosystems, and ongoing forest regrowth after initial clear-cutting.

Influence of land use and lithology on sources and ages of nutritional resources for stream macroinvertebrates: a multi-isotopic approach	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Terrestrially-derived carbon (C) and organic matter (OM)-often of significant age-dominate in many streams and rivers, yet little is known about their potential nutritional contributions to aquatic macroinvertebrate consumers. Impacts of watershed characteristics (e.g., land use and lithology) on the sources and ages of C and OM utilized by aquatic consumers are also poorly understood. To assess these factors, macroinvertebrates were collected from six headwater streams having different watershed lithologies and land uses in the Hudson-Mohawk River system (New York, USA) and analyzed for natural delta C-13, delta N-15, delta H-2, and a dagger C-14. A Bayesian stable isotopic mixing model revealed that autochthonous primary production dominated (62-92%) the biomass of all functional feeding groups (FFGs) across all sites, with allochthonous sources being of secondary but still significant (21-31%) importance. Macroinvertebrates collected from streams in watersheds having low vs. high agricultural land use were estimated to assimilate 0-13 and 4-31% soil-derived C and OM, respectively. a dagger C-14 values and apparent ages of macroinvertebrates from shale-rich and shale-poor sites were also significantly different (mean a dagger C-14 = -75 and -34aEuro degrees; equivalent C-14 ages = 630 and 280 years B.P., respectively). Inclusion of a dagger C-14 data in mixing models confirmed the importance of autochthonous primary production, and also demonstrated indirect lithological control of nutritional resource utilization by influencing stream substrate type and potential retention of allochthonous C and OM. Findings from this study further showed that the relative magnitudes of autochthonous vs. allochthonous contributions to macroinvertebrates were dependent on FFG, land use type, and lithology.																	1015-1621	1420-9055				OCT	2017	79	4					925	939		10.1007/s00027-017-0542-3								WOS:000410781000011

Hydroperiod, inundation length, has been well studied in these systems that cycle between aquatic and terrestrial phases, but species' responses to other ecological processes are still poorly known. For example, temporal (plant thatch from the previous terrestrial phase) and spatial (nutrient runoff) factors may have strong effects on emergence and population densities during the aquatic phase. We examined the effects of hydroperiod stability, thatch, and nutrients on the emergence and density of 4 vernal pool endemic species: Branchinecta lynchi (Anostraca), Linderiella occidentalis (Anostraca), Lepidurus packardi (Notostraca), and Cyzicus californicus (Spinicaudata). A full factorial mesocosm experiment was conducted which measured species densities, along with water quality variables. Hydroperiod and thatch differentially affected 3 of the 4 species based on emergence timing and life cycle. Treatments had effects on many water quality variables, and these variables were correlated with densities. These results highlight how hydroperiod stability along with other processes can affect large branchiopod species in temporary freshwater ecosystems. California vernal pools are a greatly reduced habitat rich in endemic and endangered species (including Branchinecta lynchi and Lepidurus packardi), and therefore, these results have implications for conservation and management.

The experiment was performed for 120 days in 0.66 ha pond with and without addition of substrate i.e. treatment (periphyton based) and control pond (feed based), respectively having a stocking density of 20 m(-2) (PL 15). The significant (P < 0.05) reduction in concentration of total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), nitrite-N, and biological oxygen demand (BOD) were found in substrate treated pond when compared with the control. About 39 genera of phytoplankton belonging to Bacillariophyceae (14 genera), Chlorophyceae (12 genera), Cyanophyceae (10 genera) and Euglenophyceae (3 genera) were found adhered on aquamat. Significant (P < 0.05) improvement in the growth parameters of L. vannamei and feed utilization (FCR = 1.02) were recorded in the substrate treated pond when compared to control (FCR = 1.31). At the end of the experiment, a significant reduction (12%) in the concentration of nitrogen present in the effluents (output water) was estimated in substrate treated pond. Significantly low level of nitrogen content was estimated in the sediment of substrate treated pond when compared with the control. Nitrogenous waste generated for producing one ton of shrimp, got reduced by 25% in the periphyton based aquaculture pond. Moreover, a significantly (P < 0.05) low total Vibrios counts (1.14 x 10(3) CFU mL(-1)) were enumerated when compared with the control pond (1.53 x 10(3) CFU mL(-1)) and ratio of total Vibrios counts (TVC) to total heterotrophic bacteria (THB) in the water of substrate treated pond and control was found to be 10.56 and 28.39, respectively. Higher survival rate (93%) of L. vannamei was recorded in the substrate treated pond in comparison to the control (84.4%). In general, addition of substrate to obtain periphyton significantly reduced nitrogenous waste in the effluent, by converting it into heterotrophic bacterial and algal biomass, improved the culture water quality and growth parameters and survival of the shrimp in comparison to the normal feed based aquaculture system.

Seaweeds were cultivated for 35 days in sterilized seawater enriched with 50% von Stosch solution (VS - v/v), 25% BFT effluent (BFT - v/v), or pulse-fed AMPEP (at 0.1 g L-1 for 30 min), and combinations of VS and AMPEP (VS + AMPEP) and BFT and AMPEP (BFT + AMPEP). As control, seedlings cultivated in sterilized seawater were used. K. alvarezii from VS and BFT showed significant higher growth rates, i.e., 1.70 +/- 0.14% day(-1) and 1.56 +/- 0.08% day(-1), respectively, while control (0.51 +/- 0.05% day(-1)) and AMPEP (0.57% +/- 0.07% day(-1)) showed lower growth rates. However, in all treatments, "ice-ice" disease was observed in some parts of the thalli. Total phenolic content (92.2 +/- 22.4 mu g g(-1)) and flavonoids (18.8 +/- 0.6 mu g g(-1)) were higher in BFT, and seedlings cultivated in BFT + AMPEP showed higher carotenoid content (239.3 +/- 9.3 mu g g(-1)). Higher DPPH radical inhibition was observed in VS (13.4 +/- 1.5%) and VS + AMPEP (13.4 +/- 0.6%). Results showed that all treatments affected K. alvarezii growth and secondary metabolism, particularly BFT, which could be consider as a good fertilizer of this species improving also the add-value, because of the increase of phenolics, flavonoids and carotenoids.

Use of environmental DNA (eDNA) and water quality data to predict protozoan parasites outbreaks in fish farms	AQUACULTURE												Globally, disease accounts for around 40% of lost aquaculture production. Commonly, disease occurs due to an inability of farm managers to accurately quantify disease risk due to the abundance of the pathogenic agent in their production systems, along with a poor understanding of how outbreaks are linked to changes in water quality parameters. Environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling methodology associated with molecular techniques is suited to rapidly assess the background presence of pathogens in fish farms, thereby providing managers with critical information that can be used to mitigate disease threats. Adopting the ciliate protozoan Chilodonella hexasticha as a model, this study examined the relationship between environmental DNA of C. hexasticha, critical water parameters and the occurrence of disease outbreaks on a commercial barramundi Lates calcarifer farm, where water was sampled monthly over a 1 year timeframe. A qPCR assay based on the small subunit ribosomal DNA gene was used to monitor the abundance of C. hexasticha in pond water (SSU-rDNA copies/mu L). Increased C. hexasticha eDNA levels were found to be highly correlated with occurrence of later fish mortality events (r = 0.402; P < 0.001) and also with size of fish (r = - 0.189; P < 0.05); smaller fish were more prone to being impacted by an epizootic of the parasite. However, no correlations were found between any of the water quality parameters measured (rainfall, water temperature and dissolved oxygen) and abundance of this parasite, although there were significantly more fish mortalities observed during the warmer, wetter monsoonal season compared to the cooler, dry season (1280 vs. 135 mortalities, respectively; P < 0.05). This study highlights the potential of an eDNA approach as a management tool to quickly assess parasite loads in water and minimise the risk of disease outbreaks in aquaculture systems.

Influence of stocking density and exposure to white spot syndrome virus in biological performance, metabolic, immune, and bioenergetics response of whiteleg shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei	AQUACULTURE												The risk of disease in shrimp farming has been suggested to increase with stocking density, although it is not clear if this is related to an increased susceptibility to pathogens based on poor physiological condition or a lower capacity of immune response. This study analyzed the influence of stocking density on the metabolic and immune response to exposure to white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) on whiteleg shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei. Juvenile shrimp were submitted to two stocking densities (20 and 100 shrimp m(2)) for eight weeks; water quality, growth, and survival were recorded. Then, some shrimp were sampled for determining biochemical composition, adenylic nucleotides, arginine phosphate (Arg-P), total hemocyte count (THC), and clotting time to determine baseline values. Other shrimp were challenged with WSSV for 24 h and then analyzed for the same variables. Concentration of nitrogenous compounds and phosphorus were significantly higher in tanks with the higher shrimp density. Growth and survival were significantly lower by 42% and 18%, respectively, under high density conditions. No outstanding effect of stocking density on biochemical and immunological variables were observed, except for higher levels of hemocyanin in hemolymph and lactate in muscle in shrimp under low density conditions. In contrast, the WSSV challenge induced several metabolic disruptions, including a higher adenylic energy charge (AEC) in the hepatopancreas and higher content of Arg-P in muscle, higher content of triglycerides in hemolymph, hepatopancreas, and muscle, and higher content of glucose, protein, hemocyanin, and cholesterol in hemolymph. These responses correspond an increased energy demand caused by exposure to virus and/or a phase of metabolic depression. Conditions of high stocking apparently do not increase the susceptibility of shrimp to WSSV since no differences were observed in the severity of infection and THC. However clotting time, glucose, lactate and triglycerides were more importantly affected by WSSV in shrimp coming from the high density condition, suggesting a "dual stress" effect that could in turn affect susceptibility to pathogens.

Considering the potential of these systems for the production of tilapia, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different moments of the transfer of Nile tilapia fingerlings to the biofloc system. For this study, 1400 Nile tilapia fingerlings weighing 1.40 +/- 0.04 g were distributed into 20 rectangular 150 L tanks in a completely randomized design with five treatments (Control - clear water, T1 - transition on day 1, T2 - transition on day 15, T3 - transition on day 30, and T4 transition on day 45) and four replications. The study lasted 76 days, and the animals remained under the same control conditions until the time of transition into the biofloc system. The data obtained were subjected to analysis of variance, and the means were compared with the Student-Newman- Keuls test (p < 0.05). The average data of final weight (46.16 g), daily weight gain (0.59 g) and feed conversion rate (1.08) did not differ (p > 0.05) between treatments. The final density was higher in the control treatment (17.44 kg m(-3)). The densities in the T1, T2, T3 and T4 treatments were 10.20, 12.47, 12.68 and 11.49 kg m(-3), respectively. Survival did not differ according to the Kruskal-Wallis test (p < 0.05); however, the body composition was affected by the biofloc system, with a greater deposition of lipids in T1. The water quality parameters varied over time, with N-NO2- peaks in the treatments transitioned to the biofloc system regardless of the time of transition. The results suggest that Nile tilapia fingerlings should be transitioned to the biofloc system at a weight of 1.4 g and that they do not require prior cultivation in another type of system. Statement of relevance: Considering the potential of biofloc systems for the production of tilapia, this study evaluated the effect of different transition times of juvenile Nile tilapia (O. niloticus) to this systems showing that this species did not require prior cultivation in another type of system after masculinization.

In this study, we investigated the use of poly-beta-hydroxybutyric (PHB) and polycaprolactone (PCL) as carbon sources to support a limited discharge tilapia aquaculture system conveniently. The water was not changed for 120 days. No significant differences in the final biomass were observed between the PHB group (37.93 +/- 8.87 kg m(-3)) and the PCL group (34.29 +/- 9.29 kg m(-3)) or between the PHB group and the group with glucose as an external carbohydrate (44.14 +/- 10.51 kg m(-3)). NH4+-N and nitrite nitrogen (NO2--N) were < 3.0 mg L-1 and 0.8 mg L-1 at steady state, respectively. The assimilation of NH4+-N and nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N), nitrification and denitrification were observed in the batch tests of the bioflocs taken from the fish tank. No significant differences were detected in the bioflocs' crude protein content (31-39%) between the PCL group and the PHB group or between the PHB group and the glucose group. Microbial analysis, assessed by high-throughput sequencing, revealed that the bacterial community was similar between the three groups. Although not every parameter was better than glucose, PHB or PCL was still considered preferable to glucose because of greater convenience. Collectively, our results showed that both PHB and PCL are favorable and convenient external carbohydrates for biofloc-based tilapia aquaculture systems.																	0044-8486	1873-5622				OCT 1	2017	479						732	741		10.1016/j.aquaculture.2017.07.017								WOS:000408034700090

Zoea-2 syndrome of Penaeus vannamei in shrimp hatcheries	AQUACULTURE												Mortalities of Pacific white shrimp, Penaeus vannamei during zoea stages were investigated in fifteen Indian shrimp hatcheries located on the east coast of India. Popularly known as zoea-2 syndrome, is characterized by reduction in feeding rate of late zoea 1 and early zoea 2 stage larvae, impairment in metamorphosis followed by high mortalities. Microscopic studies revealed systemic abnormalities in affected larvae and pathological manifestation in hepatopancreas and intestine. Microbiological screening revealed the predominance of Vibrio alginolyticus in majority of the hatcheries (nine) affected by zoea-2 syndrome. Histological examination on the hepatopancreas and intestine revealed vacuolization, sloughing of epithelial cells and disintegration of peritrophic membrane of intestinal epithelium. OIE listed viral pathogens of shrimp were absent in affected larvae as confirmed by OIE polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocols. Ultrastructural observation of the pathological manifestation in hepatopancreas and intestine could not reveal presence of any pathogens. Data on the water quality parameters were in the normal ranges and did not seem to have any bearing on the outbreak of zoea-2 syndrome in the hatcheries. Feeding schedules (Skeletonema, Chaetoceros, Thalassia) were uniform throughout the larval cycles and found to be not associated with the zoea-2 syndrome. Pathological manifestations of hepatopancreas and intestine indicated impairment of capacity of digestion and absorption resulting in delayed moulting and subsequent death of larvae in a gradual, progressive manner with cumulative mortality reaching of 30-100% at zoea II stage. Continuous stocking of nauplii over three to four days within the same hatchery larval rearing unit was found to exacerbate the incidence in the nine affected hatcheries (OR-48, CI 2.5-932.9). It could be construed from our studies that aetiology of zoea syndrome may not be due to known infectious agents.

The macro-tidal Gironde Estuary is characterized by a highly concentrated turbidity maximum zone (TMZ). Field observations show that hypoxia occurs in summer in the TMZ at low river flow and a few days after the spring tide peak. In situ data highlight lower dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations around the city of Bordeaux, located in the upper estuary. Interactions between multiple factors limit the understanding of the processes controlling the dynamics of hypoxia. A 3D biogeochemical model was developed, coupled with hydrodynamics and a sediment transport model, to assess the contribution of the TMZ and the impact of urban effluents through wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and sewage overflows (SOS) on hypoxia. Our model describes the transport of solutes and suspended material and the biogeochemical mechanisms impacting oxygen: primary production, degradation of all organic matter (i.e. including phytoplankton respiration, degradation of river and urban watershed matter), nitrification and gas exchange. The composition and the degradation rates of each variable were characterized by in situ measurements and experimental data from the study area. The DO model was validated against observations in Bordeaux City. The simulated DO concentrations show good agreement with field observations and satisfactorily reproduce the seasonal and neap-spring time scale variations around the city of Bordeaux. Simulations show a spatial and temporal correlation between the formation of summer hypoxia and the location of the TMZ, with minimum DO centered in the vicinity of Bordeaux. To understand the contribution of the urban watershed forcing, different simulations with the presence or absence of urban effluents were compared. Our results show that in summer, a reduction of POC from SO would increase the DO minimum in the vicinity of Bordeaux by 3% of saturation. Omitting discharge from SO and WWTPs, DO would improve by 10% of saturation and mitigate hypoxic events. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The main assumptions tested in the present study are that (i) phytoplankton structure in these waterbodies is strongly dependent on the transportation with the river waters flowing through them and (ii) the importance of this stochastic transportation is decreasing as the connectivity with the river decreases allowing environmental filters to shape phytoplankton structure. The multivariate analysis showed that although phytoplankton was inoculated largely by Pearl River water inputs and inflow among the system, the hydraulic architecture of the reservoir network shaped and modulated the composition and abundance of phytoplankton.

The Kinneret Sustainability Index (KSI) provides a quantitative indication of how similar the current ecosystem is in relation to a reference state that managers are striving to achieve and sustain once accomplished. As Lake Kinneret is the only freshwater lake in Israel, it is vital to sustain the lake ecosystem over time. The KSI provides lake managers with a means for assessing the state of the lake. The KSI is based on nine ecosystem variables and provides information on each variable and the combined index. We present examples of application of the KSI to lake management and conduct a sensitivity analysis of the underlying assumptions demonstrating its robustness to the assumptions. While the index presented here is specific to Lake Kinneret, it is a general approach that can be readily applied to lakes worldwide and can assist, for example, in achievement of the required good status for European lakes.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				OCT	2017	800	1					207	223		10.1007/s10750-017-3269-1								WOS:000406385800015

About 7 indicators are considered, including ecological degradation intensity (EDI), hydrodynamic disturbance (IHD), engineering types, water quality, economic investment, population growth, and reclaimed land area. Meanwhile, an integrated framework enhanced methods in terms of (a) measuring intensity of ecological degradation process under multi-scale impact, (b) developing the indicator system of CRI, and discussing the driving forces and trends of coastal reclamation, (c) determining fuzzy preference relations of weight and calculating the specific value of CRI with the case study areas of Yellow River estuary from 2000 to 2015. As the result, the CRI has been expanded unceasingly in recent years. The total growth rate from 2000 to 2015 is about 37.97%. It is concluded that CRI has climbed to a higher intensity level in resent 15 years.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				SEP 15	2017	122	1-2					27	37		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.05.065								WOS:000408076900015	28633950

The lagoons have similar physical and hydrological characteristics, but differ substantially in the degree of watershed urban development and nutrient loading rates. In total the lagoons experienced 22 storm events during the period studied. Specifically, we examine (1) whether there are influences on water quality in the lagoons from watershed development, (2) whether there are influences on water quality in the lagoons from storm activity, and (3) whether water quality is affected to a greater degree by watershed development versus storm activity. The two urbanized lagoons typically showed higher water-column nitrate, dissolved organic nitrogen, and phosphate compared with the non-urbanized lagoon. One of the urbanized lagoons had higher water-column chlorophyll a concentrations than the other two lagoons on most sampling dates, and higher light extinction coefficients on some sampling dates. The non-urbanized lagoon had higher water-column dissolved oxygen concentrations than other lagoons on many sampling dates. Our results suggest long-term influences of watershed development on coastal water quality. We also found some evidence of significant storm effects on water quality, such as increased nitrate, phosphate, and dissolved oxygen, and decreased salinity and water temperature. However, the influences of watershed development on water quality were greater. These results suggest that changes in water quality induced by human watershed development pervade despite the storm effects. These findings may be useful for environmental management since they suggest that storms do not profoundly alter long-term changes in water quality that resulted from human development of watersheds.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				SEP 15	2017	122	1-2					207	216		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.06.038								WOS:000408076900033	28662980

Elucidation of seasonal variations of physicochemical and biological parameters with statistical analysis methods in Puducherry coastal waters	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												The present investigation aimed to study the effect of monsoonal and anthropogenic influences on the water quality parameters of Puducherry coastal waters. Surface water sampling was performed at three fixed stations in four distinct seasons during 2011. Physical water quality parameters such as salinity and TSM showed strong seasonal and spatial variability. Evaporation and monsoonal runoff seem to be the major controlling forces for these parameters in the coastal waters. Seasonal distribution of the parameters showed a random pattern for nitrate and a well-defined pattern for silicate. Chl-alpha was minimum during monsoon when high TSM was encountered in the system. Moreover, factors that regulated the phytoplankton biomass varied with seasons. Moreover, TSM was strongly correlated with silicate. The relationship between Chl-alpha and nutrients were more consistent throughout the year, and much weaker correlations were noticed between Chl-alpha and TSM. Cluster analysis depicted the existence of a marked seasonal heterogeneity.

The results show that while salinity has undergone several shifts, seawater temperature exhibited a steady increasing trend since the 1980s. The observed salinity shows strong correlation with Shatt Al-Arab River discharge indicating primary contribution of freshwater to salinity among other factors (evaporation and desalination effluent). Recent data show that salinity is at its highest level in the last 30 years with less pronounced seasonal variability in response to severe decline in the freshwater runoff into the northwestern Arabian Gulf. The changes in hydrographic conditions may have significant implications on hydrodynamics, water quality, and ecosystems in the Gulf. Thus, cooperation among the concerned countries - both coastal and riparian nations - would be essential for prevention of further major changes in the Gulf.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				SEP 15	2017	122	1-2					488	499		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.06.056								WOS:000408076900069	28697945

Integration of Tidal Prism Model and HSPF for simulating indicator bacteria in coastal watersheds	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Coastal water quality is strongly influenced by tidal fluctuations and water chemistry. There is a need for rigorous models that are not computationally or economically prohibitive, but still allow simulation of the hydrodynamics and bacteria sources for coastal, tidally influenced streams and bayous. This paper presents a modeling approach that links a Tidal Prism Model (TPM) implemented in an Excel-based modeling environment with a watershed runoff model (Hydrologic Simulation Program FORTRAN, HSPF) for such watersheds. The TPM is a one-dimensional mass balance approach that accounts for loading from tidal exchange, runoff, point sources and bacteria die-off at an hourly time step resolution. The novel use of equal high-resolution time steps in this study allowed seamless integration of the TPM and HSPF. The linked model was calibrated to flow and E. Coli data (for HSPF), and salinity and enterococci data (for the TPM) for a coastal stream in Texas. Sensitivity analyses showed the TPM to be most influenced by changes in net decay rates followed by tidal and runoff loads, respectively. Management scenarios were evaluated with the developed linked models to assess the impact of runoff load reductions and improved wastewater treatment plant quality and to determine the areas of critical need for such reductions. Achieving water quality standards for bacteria required load reductions that ranged from zero to 90% for the modeled coastal stream. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

On the outflow of Lake Maracaibo, Venezuela	REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE												Lake Maracaibo, an important wet coastal area located in the Caribbean Sea, is connected to the Gulf of Venezuela by a narrow, shallow channel known as Barra de Maracaibo. The water quality of this is poor owing to the very low water rate exchange with the Gulf. The authors make use of sea surface temperature (SST) satellite imagery and numerical modelling to study the conditions of the outflow of Lake Maracaibo. The lake is found to be fully driven by the circulation out of the lake. Three different situations are considered: upwelling, no upwelling, and the transient state between them. The authors propose conceptual and numerical models to explain the conditions for outflow. Moreover, it is found that outflow is possible only when the tradewinds stop and before the warmer waters of the Caribbean have reached the Colombian coasts. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V.

In this article, we pioneered the use of RLQ and Fourth-Corner methods that establish in a quantitative way the link between macrophyte traits, macrophyte community and water quality in a eutrophic shallow lake, eastern China. A total of 9 environmental variables and 11 macrophyte traits were included in the analysis. We found that total phosphorus in water (25.7%, the contribution to total inertia in RLQ analysis), suspended solids (20.7%), water transparency (17.1%) and Chlorophyll a (14.0%) were the main environmental variables that were associated the macrophyte traits matrix. Among macrophyte traits, life form (15.7%), responded to the environmental conditions the most, followed by leaf nitrogen (13.8%) and specific leaf area (13.6%). The correlation between macrophyte traits and environmental gradients showed that macrophytes with higher leaf nitrogen and higher specific leaf area grew at locations with clear water condition, better water transparency and with less total phosphorus, Chlorophyll a and suspended solids in this shallow eutrophic lake. The results suggested that the leaf nitrogen and specific leaf area of macrophytes had a trend to decrease with the increasing environmental stresses caused by eutrophication. Moreover, we highlighted that total phosphorus in water should be prior considered for the future macrophyte conservation and restoration in this lake.

M.; Specken, Bart; Ottburg, Fabrice			Impact of invasive crayfish on water quality and aquatic macrophytes in the Netherlands	AQUATIC INVASIONS												Several species of invasive crayfish have become established in the Netherlands, the most recent addition being Orconectes virilis. Since crayfish are known to impact water quality and aquatic macrophytes in areas they invade, this study investigated whether this was also the case for this species under Dutch conditions and if so, whether a crayfish density producing "no effects" could be established. We focussed on the potential impact of O. virilis on water quality variables (pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen and turbidity), as well as their impact on submerged and emergent macrophytes. In a compartment experiment with different densities of O. virilis, statistically significant effects were observed at crayfish densities of 1.25 crayfish/m(2) on electrical conductivity, turbidity, submersed macrophyte biomass, and the emergent plant Sagittaria sagittifolia, due to crayfish actively severing plants and physically disturbing the sediment. No statistically significant differences with controls were observed at a density of 0.63 crayfish/m(2). Since densities of 0.03 to 5 crayfish/m(2) have been found in different water types in the Netherlands, this indicates that the water quality and macrophyte biomass in Dutch waters are being negatively impacted by invasive crayfish. As a consequence, attempts to reach a good ecological status as required in the Water Framework Directive will be frustrated by the presence of this invader.																	1798-6540	1818-5487				SEP	2017	12	3			SI		397	404		10.3391/ai.2017.12.3.12								WOS:000413823900012

Over the past decade, significant investment has upgraded wastewater treatment from secondary treatment to water-quality based limits (i.e. tertiary treatment) in an effort to control coastal eutrophication in this system. The goal of this study was to improve the understanding of multi-year macroalgal bloom dynamics through intensive aerial and ground surveys conducted monthly to bimonthly during low tides in May-October 2006-2013 in NB. Aerial surveys provided a rapid characterization of macroalgal densities across a large area, while ground surveys provided high resolution measurements of macroalgal identity, percent cover, and biomass. Macroalgal blooms in NB are dominated by Ulva and Gracilaria spp. regardless of year or month, although all three clades of macroalgae were documented. Chlorophyta cover and nutrient concentrations were highest in the middle and upper bay. Rhodophyta cover was highest in the middle and lower bay, while drifting Phaeophyceae cover was patchy. Macroalgal blooms of >1000 g fresh mass (gfm)/m(2) (max = 3510 gfm/m(2)) in the intertidal zone and >3000 gfm/m(3) (max = 8555 gfm/m(3)) in the subtidal zone were observed within a heavily impacted embayment (Greenwich Bay). Macroalgal percent cover (intertidal), biomass (subtidal), and diversity varied significantly between year, month-group, site, and even within sites, with the highest species diversity at sites outside of Greenwich Bay. Total intertidal macroalgal percent cover, as well as subtidal Ulva biomass, were positively correlated with temperature. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations were correlated with the total biomass of macroalgae and the subtidal biomass of Gracilaria spp. but not the biomass of Ulva spp. Despite seasonal reductions in the nutrient output of wastewater treatment facilities emptying into upper Narragansett Bay in recent years, macroalgal blooms still persist. Continued long-term monitoring of water quality, macroalgal blooms, and ecological indicators is essential to understand the changes in macroalgal bloom dynamics that occur after nutrient reductions from management efforts.

Controlling harmful cyanobacterial blooms in a climatically more extreme world: management options and research needs	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Cyanobacteria have a long evolutionary history that has been instrumental in allowing them to adapt to long-term geochemical and climatic changes, as well as current human and climatic alterations of aquatic ecosystems; e.g. nutrient over-enrichment, hydrologic modifications and warming. Harmful (toxic, hypoxia-generating, food web altering) cyanobacterial bloom (CyanoHAB) genera are particularly adept at taking advantage of these changes and perturbations. In addition, they have developed numerous mutualistic and symbiotic associations with other microbes and higher flora and fauna, and they modulate positive biogeochemical feedbacks, instrumental in their survival and dominance in diverse ecosystems. CyanoHABs are controlled by the combined and often synergistic effects of nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) inputs, light, temperature, water residence/flushing times, and biotic interactions. Accordingly, mitigation strategies are oriented towards manipulating these dynamic factors. Physical, chemical (nutrient) and biological manipulations can be effective in reducing CyanoHABs. However, these manipulations should also be accompanied by nutrient (both nitrogen and phosphorus in most cases) input reductions to ensure long-term success and sustainability. A major research and management goal for long-term control of CyanoHABs is to develop strategies that are adaptive to climatic variability and change, because nutrient-CyanoHAB thresholds are likely to be altered in a climatically more extreme world.																	0142-7873	1464-3774				SEP-OCT	2017	39	5					763	771		10.1093/plankt/fbx042								WOS:000412300100001

Phytoplankton dynamics in relation to physicochemical conditions in large, stratified Lake Charzykowskie (Northern Poland)	OCEANOLOGICAL AND HYDROBIOLOGICAL STUDIES												The comparison of the latest and previous data on the structure of phytoplankton and chlorophyll a concentration in Lake Charzykowskie indicated long-term changes and fluctuations. The main objective of this study was to assess the phytoplankton communities in the lake with reference to hydrochemical conditions. Detailed hydrobiological studies were carried out in 2014-2015 to explain the improvement in the trophic status of the lake observed in 2008-2009. The research has shown that the phytoplankton community structure does not change significantly during the limnological cycle. The spring/autumn season is characterized by the highest contribution of diatoms and cryptophytes. Massive development of dinoflagellates was observed during the summer. Relative abundance of cyanobacteria (Aphanizomenon, Dolichospermum and Microcystis) was significantly lower compared to the previous years. In August 2014, cyanobacteria accounted for 100% of the total phytoplankton at site 2. In the following year, cyanobacteria represented only 13% in the summer phytoplankton. The current research has confirmed the favorable trophic changes in the phytoplankton of the lake. Unfortunately, very poor oxygen conditions will continue to affect the trophic status of the lake through mobilization of the internal nutrient supply. The current conditions of the lake require further monitoring of changes in the ecosystem.																	1730-413X	1897-3191				SEP	2017	46	3					260	270		10.1515/ohs-2017-0028								WOS:000412129200002

The aim of this study was to verify the presence of emerging pollutants in the IguaScu River, from source to mouth, such as: pharmaceuticals, including acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), salicylic acid, ketoprofen (KET), naproxen (NAP), gemfibrozil and fenofibrate; female sex hormones, including estradiol (E1), ethinylestradiol (EET) and estrone (E2); UV filters, including 4-methylbenzylidene camphor and octylmethoxycinnamate; and caffeine (CAF). The extracted pollutants were purified using solid phase extraction and then analyzed by liquid chromatography with diode array detection and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. All analyzed compounds were detected in at least one site in one sample. The analysis revealed maximum concentrations of 27.0 mu g L-1 CAF, 5.17 mu g L-1 ASA, 0.34 mu g L-1 NAP, 0.62 mu g L-1 KET, 1.42 mu g L-1 E1, 1.48 mu g L-1 EET, and 0.94 mu g L-1 E2. The results indicated that IguaScu river water is contaminated with emerging pollutants and nutrients and that this may be due to domestic sewage and water from tributary rivers mixing with IguaScu river water. Statistical analysis demonstrated that the study of emerging environmental contaminants is a useful tool to determine if contamination is due to domestic sewage input once traditional physical, chemical and spectroscopic analyses have been insufficient to prove an anthropogenic influence.

Local environment and connectivity are the main drivers of diatom species composition and trait variation in a set of tropical reservoirs	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. A metacommunity is defined as a set of local communities that are connected by dispersal and are controlled by environmental drivers operating at different spatial and temporal scales. Although diatom ecology has been studied extensively in temperate and lotic ecosystems, knowledge of tropical lentic systems is more limited. 2. We evaluated how planktonic and surface-sediment diatom communities, including trait-based communities, were structured by environmental, spatial and land-use variables in tropical reservoirs. Diatoms were sampled in seven reservoirs (31 sites in total) in south-east Brazil, from the surface sediment and the plankton in summer and winter. 3. Diatom communities responded primarily to a trophic gradient and secondarily to a light-availability gradient. Connectivity was also a strong predictor, whereas land use had a weaker influence on community variation. Our results further suggested that surface-sediment and planktonic diatom groups were structured by similar environmental variables. Trait-based analysis also indicated that these communities were related to environmental and spatial factors. 4. We conclude that (1) trophic state, light availability and connectivity were the main drivers of diatoms in this set of tropical reservoirs, resulting in spatially structured communities; (2) patterns for surface-sediment diatoms resembled both summer and winter diatom communities in the plankton; and (3) the effects of the explanatory variables (local environment, connectivity and land use) varied among the different biological datasets (i.e. when organised taxonomically, or according to growth morphology, cell size or trophic preference). We emphasize that studies in tropical reservoirs should take spatial variables into account, due to the connectivity of the sites.

The RDA analysis of environmental parameters showed that the system is mostly temperature-driven. The phytoplankton community was mainly composed of diatoms and less with dinoflagellates. Pseudo-nitzschia was the dominant diatom, present in 88.40 % of samples, with a maximum (of 1.85 x 10(5) cells/l). Among toxic dinoflagellates, frequent were Dinophysis acuminata (with frequency of 33.33%), D. fortii (with frequency of 23.19%) and Prorocentrum cordatum (with frequency of 21.74%). The RDA analysis showed that diatoms correlated slightly positively with nutrients and negative correlation was recorded with temperature and salinity. Dinoflagellates showed strong positive association, indicating a positive correlation with oxygen concentration, chl a, SiO4- and NO3- concentrations and negative correlation with temperature and salinity.																	1303-2712					SEP	2017	17	5					885	900		10.4194/1303-2712-v17_5_05								WOS:000406777500005

Effects of landuse intensification on stream basal resources and invertebrate communities	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Human population growth and development have degraded freshwater ecosystems through direct negative effects on basal resources and higher trophic levels. Knowledge of how basal resources are influenced by anthropogenic activities is needed to examine foodweb responses and to evaluate negative effects of human disturbance. We combined quantitative sampling of all putative resources and consumers and naturally occurring stable isotopes of resource C and N to investigate how land use influences characteristics of basal resources (leaf litter, fine particulate organic matter [FPOM] suspended in water, FPOM deposited in pools, and epilithon) and the invertebrate communities in 9 streams of British Columbia (Canada) on a seasonal basis. Study streams were grouped as forest, cropland, and urban, based on percentages of land use in their catchments. We tested for seasonal and spatial differences in biomass, isotopic variability, and overlap of different basal resources and their relationships with invertebrate communities. Our results show that landuse intensification promotes wholesale degradation, which includes deterioration of water quality, changes to the quantity and quality of basal resources, and shifts in community structure of benthic invertebrates. Stream basal resources showed large variations in isotopic signatures caused by landuse changes, with the largest isotopic variability observed in cropland streams and the smallest in urban streams. Invertebrate communities had fewer taxa and reduced functional diversity in impaired streams (i.e., cropland and urban) via simplification of feeding styles of consumers, probably because of bottom-up controls. Our study highlights the importance of quantifying the isotopic variability of basal resources to estimate effects on food webs over time and along landuse intensification gradients.																	2161-9549	2161-9565				SEP	2017	36	3					609	625		10.1086/693457								WOS:000407373600013

Assessing the expansion of wadeable benthic macroinvertebrate collection methods in large semiwadeable rivers	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Benthic macroinvertebrates are used commonly as water-quality indicators in wadeable streams and rivers. However, increased depth and overall complexity of large rivers may cause inaccessibility or unacceptable index and metric variability when attempting a single wadeable method. Significant increases in sampling effort and time expenditure have been recommended to compensate for the increased variability when assessing large rivers. However, the transition between wadeable streams and nonwadeable rivers is not well defined, especially for free-flowing systems. We evaluated the utility of a modified wadeable-stream collection method for sampling large and complex semiwadeable rivers. Our results suggest that water-quality measurements across the width of a river can be used to identify influences of multiple water sources. This spatial information and a single-habitat (e.g., riffle-run) approach could be used with a modest increase in sampling effort to reduce metric variability and provide important source-tracking information. These supplementary data and a grasp of the complex ecological processes that exist in large rivers are essential for recognizing why biological communities differ among sites and for using macroinvertebrates to assess large river systems.																	2161-9549	2161-9565				SEP	2017	36	3					683	691		10.1086/692942								WOS:000407373600018

Palaeoecological records of coral community development on a turbid, nearshore reef complex: baselines for assessing ecological change	CORAL REEFS												Understanding past coral community development and reef growth is crucial for placing contemporary ecological and environmental change within appropriate reef-building timescales. On Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR), coral reefs situated within coastal inner-shelf zones are a particular priority. This is due to their close proximity to river point sources, and therefore susceptibility to reduced water quality discharged from coastal catchments, many of which have been modified following European settlement (ca. 1850 AD). However, the extent of water quality decline and its impacts on the GBR's inner-shelf reefs remain contentious. In this study, palaeoecological coral assemblage records were developed for five proximal coral reefs situated within a nearshore turbid-zone reef complex on the central GBR. A total of 29 genera of Scleractinia were identified from the palaeoecological inventory of the reef complex, with key contributions to reef-building made by Acropora, Montipora, and Turbinaria. Discrete intervals pre- and post-dating European settlement, but associated with equivalent water depths, were identified using Bayesian age depth modelling, enabling investigation of competing ideas of the main drivers of nearshore coral assemblage change. Specifically, we tested the hypotheses that changes in the composition of nearshore coral assemblages are: (1) intrinsically driven and linked to vertical reef development towards sea level, and (2) the result of changes in water quality associated with coastal river catchment modification. Our records found no discernible evidence of change in the generic composition of coral assemblages relative to European settlement. Instead, two distinctive depth-stratified assemblages were identified. This study demonstrates the robust nature of nearshore coral communities under reported water-quality decline and provides a useful context for the monitoring and assessment of ecological change on reefs located within the most nearshore turbid zone environments of the central GBR.

However, the nutrient and sediment reduction efficiencies of these novel designs are virtually unknown, and the possibility of increasing riverine flow in the Chesapeake Bay watershed associated with climate change this century necessitates an evaluation of their performance to develop and utilize those that optimize reductions in nutrient and sediment fluxes. We compare pre- and post-construction loads (total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and total suspended solids (TSS)) from RSCs (i.e., upland BMPs) and a SWC (i.e., stream restoration) constructed at the outflow of a highly developed watershed in the Coastal Plain physiographic province of Maryland. The largest of the two RSCs performed best in relation to expected nutrient and sediment reductions because of superior water retention capability. By the length of river reach restored, the SWC attained from 79 to 88% of its N reduction TMDL goal, but only 19 to 23 and 2.7 to 3.1% for TP and TSS, respectively; by watershed area, % attainments of TMDL goals were much lower. Results indicate that SWCs have the potential to curtail N loading from developed catchments, but additional water quality benefits may be limited. Climate change projections indicate that there will be an increased frequency of larger-volume storms that will result in an increase in stormflow runoff from urban areas, and increased pollutant loads will likely curtail potential gains made by efforts to achieve TMDL goals. Given the large-scale implementation of BMPs currently underway to accommodate the Chesapeake Bay TMDL, the restoration community needs to adopt a concerted strategy of building climate resilience into many types of urban BMPs to help attain and maintain loads at TMDL levels in anticipation of a progressively wetter climate throughout this century.																	1559-2723	1559-2731				SEP	2017	40	5					1227	1246		10.1007/s12237-017-0226-1								WOS:000406333700002

This research used stream mesocosms to evaluate the effects of MgCl2 road deicer to a Rocky Mountain stream benthic community in Colorado, USA. Measured responses included macroinvertebrate drift, community composition metrics, and macroinvertebrate biomass after a 10-day exposure. Natural benthic communities were exposed to concentrations of liquid MgCl2 road deicer that bracketed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) surface water chronic chloride 'aquatic life criteria' (230 mg Cl-/l). Results showed no effects on macroinvertebrate drift, but significant reductions in abundance, taxa richness, and community biomass. Specifically, stonefly (Plecoptera) and mayfly (Ephemeroptera) abundance decreased at Cl- concentrations below the U.S. EPA chronic chloride water quality standard, and at concentrations substantially lower than those generated from traditional laboratory toxicity tests. However, caddisflies (Trichoptera), midges (Chironomidae) and other dipterans were tolerant to all MgCl2 treatments. We conclude that MgCl2 road deicer has the potential to impair montane stream benthic communities at relatively low ionic concentrations, and regulatory agencies should manage for and establish regionally appropriate application rates for this stressor.

We used multivariate analyses to study the influence of selected environmental factors (water quality, basin characteristics, and subcatchment surficial geology) on the recent diatom assemblages across this steep local nutrient gradient. In addition to the spatial analysis of surface sediment diatom assemblages from 51 sampling sites (48 lakes), temporal changes in the total phosphorus (TP) concentrations of one Iisalmi Route lake (Lake Kirmanjarvi) were analyzed using weighted averaging partial least squares regression and 27 fossil diatom samples. Both TP and electrical conductivity (EC) showed statistically significant independent signals in the modern diatom data. The TP gradient was related to till grain size variation suggesting that geological factors affect the spatial TP variation directly or indirectly through differences in land use. Based on the temporal study, the direct effect of geology is most likely behind the steep nutrient gradient in the area because Lake Kirmanjarvi was found to be naturally eutrophic. EC, on the other hand, seems related to anthropogenic disturbance. Our study highlights the importance of taking the local geology into account when assessing past or present water quality or planning for lake management.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	2017	799	1					309	325		10.1007/s10750-017-3229-9								WOS:000405720000021

HYDROBIOLOGIA					10th International Symposium on Cladocera	SEP 28-OCT 03, 2014	Lednice, CZECH REPUBLIC	Charles Univ, Dept Ecol				We investigated the relative importance of flood defenses and other environmental variables for the cladoceran and copepod communities in floodplain water bodies in Southeastern Norway. The water bodies covered gradients of size, distance to the river and water chemistry, and half of them were located behind flood defenses. The effects of environmental variables on the communities were analyzed using redundancy analysis. The set of environmental variables accounted for more of the explained variation in the cladoceran community than in the copepod community. Water quality was much more important than flooding-related variables for both communities. Although cladoceran species richness was slightly higher in water bodies outside flood defenses, total nitrogen, total organic carbon (TOC), and water body area were the most important factors for the cladocerans. Macrophyte coverage was the most important variable for both species richness and community structure of copepods. Although our results show that water quality and spatial/structural variables are more important than flood defenses in structuring the communities, the effect of TOC on the cladoceran community could likely be mediated through effects of flood defense on TOC. Prospects for a continued anthropogenic pressure on river floodplains raise concern for the future of these unique ecosystems.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	2017	798	1					45	60		10.1007/s10750-015-2350-x								WOS:000404686800006

This study investigated the effect of transport stress on the muscular chemical composition and flesh quality of channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus fingerlings. Fish were divided into two groups, the control group and the treatment group. The fish in the treatment group were exposed to the transportation process (3.5 h), while the control fish were kept under the normal aquaculture conditions (not-transport). Samples of muscle were collected for assay at several time intervals: before the experiment (basal level), and at 0, 24, 72 and 168 h after transportation process. The obtained results indicated serum cortisol and glucose levels significantly increased in the transported fish compared to non-transported fish directly after transport Transportation caused significant decrease in water, fat and energy contents of muscle after 24 h compared to other time intervals and non-transported fish. Muscle pH and shearing force significantly decreased at time 0 h, and then augmented after 24 h thereafter reduced again after 72 h and again improved at 168 h after transportation. Compared to the control group, transported fish exhibited the highest values in drip loss, stored loss, and frozen leakage rate. It is concluded that the transportation process results in marked changes in muscular chemical composition and reduces the flesh quality of I. punctatus fingerlings. A recovery period of 168 his recommended to reduce the consequences of the transportation stress. Statement of relevance: This work would tell us the effect of transport on muscular biochemical profiles and flesh quality of catfish, and help us to determine the duration that the fish needs to recover from the transportation stress.

J	Packett, R				Packett, Robert			Rainfall contributes similar to 30% of the dissolved inorganic nitrogen exported from a southern Great Barrier Reef river basin	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												A study was conducted to estimate how much of the annual load of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) from Great Barrier Reef (GBR) river basins could come from rainfall. Results suggest rainfall contributed similar to 37% of the average annual DIN load from the Fitzroy Basin over three wet seasons. Rainfall DIN contribution at plot to sub-catchment scale ranged from 5 to > 100% for study sites in the Fitzroy and Pioneer Basins. An estimate using measured and modelled data indicates similar to 28% of the longer-term average annual DIN load from the entire GBR catchment may originate from rainfall. These estimates may affect current GBR management and water quality targets. Numerous studies predict increases in atmospheric nitrogen pollution from Asia via fossil fuel combustion and more frequent severe La Nina events via global warming. Future GBR rainfall chemistry data may be required for assessing catchment management outcomes and regional trends in atmospheric DIN deposition.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				AUG 15	2017	121	1-2					16	31		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.05.008								WOS:000407529200014	28521935

This is the fifth time that this study has been conducted as an initiative of the European Sea Ports Organisation (ESPO). The data and results are derived from the Self-Diagnosis Method (SDM), a concise checklist against which port managers can self-assess the environmental management of their port in relation to the performance of the EcoPorts membership. The SDM tool was developed in the framework of the ECOPORTS project (2002-2005) and it is managed by ESPO. A total number of 91 ports from 20 different European Maritime States contributed to this evaluation. The main results are that air quality remains as the top environmental priority of the respondent ports, followed by energy consumption and noise. In terms of environmental management, the study confirms that key components are commonly implemented in the majority of European ports. 94% of contributing ports have a designated environmental manager, 92% own an environmental policy and 82% implement an environmental monitoring program. Waste is identified as the most monitored issue in ports (80%), followed by energy consumption (73%) and water quality (70%).

Significance of beach geomorphology on fecal indicator bacteria levels	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Large databases of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) measurements are available for coastal waters. With the assistance of satellite imagery, we illustrated the power of assessing data for many sites by evaluating beach features such as geomorphology, distance from rivers and canals, presence of piers and causeways, and degree of urbanization coupled with the enterococci FIB database for the state of Florida. We found that beach geomorphology was the primary characteristic associated with enterococci levels that exceeded regulatory guidelines. Beaches in close proximity to marshes or within bays had higher enterococci exceedances in comparison to open coast beaches. For open coast beaches, greater enterococci exceedances were associated with nearby rivers and higher levels of urbanization.

J	Karbassi, AR; Marefat, A				Karbassi, Abdolreza R.; Marefat, Ali			The impact of increased oxygen conditions on heavy metal flocculation in the Sefidrud estuary	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Similar to natural filters, estuaries are capable of removing considerable amounts of heavy metal from rivers that flow into saline water environments by turning the metal into flocs. The research objective was to investigate the self-purification potential of estuaries in removal of metal by flocculation processes. Hence, flocculation of metal was Studied experimentally in 5 aquaria with varying salinity levels. Subsequently, experiment was repeated while dissolved oxygen increased. Results indicated that at higher dissolved oxygen, the flocculation rates of Mn, Ni, and Pb increased by 9%, 20%, and 26%, respectively. However, Zn and Cu showed 23% and 26% of decrease in flocculation rate, respectively. In the analysis of the relationship between oxidation reduction potential and estuarine water quality it was found that ORP escalated with an increase in the dissolved oxygen. This finding suggests that ORP can be used to govern the potential of flocculation processes at estuarine zone.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				AUG 15	2017	121	1-2					168	175		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.06.011								WOS:000407529200030	28601438

Effect of nutrient pollution on dinoflagellate cyst assemblages across estuaries of the NW Atlantic	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												We analyzed surface sediments from 23 northeast USA estuaries, from Maine to Delaware, and nine estuaries from Prince Edward Island (PEI, Canada), to determine how dinoflagellate cyst assemblages varied with nutrient loading. Overall the abundance of cysts of heterotrophic dinoflagellates correlates with modeled nitrogen loading, but there were also regional signals. On PEI cysts of Gymnodiniwn microreticulatum characterized estuaries with high nitrogen loading while the sediments of eutrophic Boston Harbor were characterized by high abundances of Spinifentes spp. In Delaware Bay and the Delaware Inland Bays Polysphaeridiwn zohatyi correlated with higher temperatures and nutrient loading. This is the first study to document the dinoflagellate cyst eutrophication signal at such a large geographic scale in estuaries, thus confirming their value as indicators of water quality change and anthropogenic impact.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				AUG 15	2017	121	1-2					339	351		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.06.024								WOS:000407529200049	28633948

The heterogeneity of the tropic-functional pattern of protozoan communities and its environmental drivers were studied in coastal waters of the Yellow Sea during a 1-year cycle. Samples were collected using the glass slide method at four stations within a water pollution gradient. A second-stage matrix-based analysis was used to summarize spatial variation in the annual pattern of the functional structure. A clustering analysis revealed significant variability in the trophic-functional pattern among the four stations during the 1-year cycle. The heterogeneity in the trophic-functional pattern of the communities was significantly related to changes in environmental variables, particularly ammonium-nitrogen and nitrates, alone or in combination with dissolved oxygen. These results suggest that the heterogeneity in annual patterns of protozoan trophic-functional structure may reflect water quality status in coastal ecosystems.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				AUG 15	2017	121	1-2					400	403		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.06.012								WOS:000407529200056	28624358

In this study, ten areas located along the western coast of the Korean Peninsula are investigated with respect to remotely sensed water quality indicators derived from NASA MODIS aboard of the satellite Aqua. We found that there was a strong seasonal trend with spatial heterogeneity. In specific, a strong six-month phase-lag was found between chlorophyll-a and total suspended solid owing to their inversed seasonality, which could be explained by different dynamics and environmental settings. Chlorophyll-a concentration seemed to be dominantly influenced by temperature, while total suspended solid was largely governed by local tidal forcing and bottom topography. This study demonstrated the potential and applicability of satellite products in coastal management, and highlighted find that remote-sensing would be a promising tool in resolving orthogonality of large spatio-temporal scale variabilities when combining with proper time series analyses.

Habitat change mediates the response of coral reef fish populations to terrestrial run-off	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Coastal fish populations are typically threatened by multiple human activities, including fishing pressure and run-off of terrestrial pollution. Linking multiple threats to their impacts on fish populations is challenging because the threats may influence a species directly, or indirectly, via its habitats and its interactions with other species. Here we examine spatial variation in abundance of coral reef fish across gradients of fishing pressure and turbidity in Fiji. We explicitly account for multiple pathways of influence to test the alternative hypotheses that (1) habitat moderates predation by providing shelter, so habitat loss only affects prey fish populations if there are abundant predators, (2) habitat change co-drives biomass of both prey and predator functional groups. We examined responses of 7 fish functional groups and found that habitat change co-drives both predator and prey responses to turbidity. Abundances of all functional groups were associated with changes in habitat cover; however, the responses of their habitats to turbidity were mixed. Planktivore and piscivore abundance were lower in areas of high turbidity, because cover of their preferred habitats was lower. Invertivore, browser and grazer abundance did not change strongly over the turbidity gradient, because different components of their habitats exhibited both increases and decreases with turbidity. The effects of turbidity on fish populations were minor in areas where fish populations were already depleted by fishing. These findings suggest that terrestrial run-off modifies the composition of reef fish communities indirectly by affecting the benthic habitats that reef fish use.

The pollution tolerance index (PTI) and saprobic index (SI) use diatoms to assess the health of aquatic ecosystems. We collected epilithic diatoms from the Pazarsuyu Stream located in the Turkish province of Giresun between June 2014 and May 2015 to assess the water quality using the four types of diatom indices which consist of BDI, TDI, PTI, SI. A total of 49 taxa were identified as belonging to the class of Bacillariophyceae. The reference site affected by domestic waste contained Ulnaria ulna (Nitzsch) Compere, Navicula radiosa Kutzing and Encyonerna niinuturn (Hilse) D.G.Mann. The water quality of the site had average BDI values ranging between 14.2 and 14.5 and average TDI values between 50 and 54.7, both of which indicate the existence of a mesotrophic environment. However, according to the value of the SI, the studied site was moderately polluted (beta-mesosaprobity), whereas PTI values showed that the site was heavily polluted (alpha-mesosaprobic).																	1863-9135					AUG	2017	190	3					189	197		10.1127/fal/2017/0991								WOS:000412040000003						
J	Tsuji, Y; Montani, S				Tsuji, Yasuyo; Montani, Shigeru			Spatial variability in an estuarine phytoplankton and suspended microphytobenthos community	PLANKTON & BENTHOS RESEARCH												Estuarine material circulation depends on the presence of both phytoplankton and suspended microphytobenthos in the water column. However, the spatial distribution of suspended microphytobenthos and phytoplankton in estuaries is poorly understood. In this study, the abundance of suspended microphytobenthos and phytoplankton in the water column was determined along the salinity gradient in Lake Furen, Japan, from April to October 2015. Throughout the study period, surface and bottom salinity changed horizontally from <10 to >30. Phytoplankton was the main contributor to spatial increases in total cell abundance in mesohaline water as a result of the lake's hydro graphic characteristics and water quality. The suspended microphytobenthos cell abundance in the surface and bottom water decreased with increasing salinity and was affected by the depth gradient. Suspended microphytobenthos cell abundances increased with depth (similar to 10 and 20% of total cell abundance in the surface and bottom water, respectively), which indicated that they were derived from microphytobenthos on the seafloor. The dominant suspended microphytobenthos taxa (Cocconeis spp. and Melosira varians) were mainly distributed in oligo-and mesohaline water, with peaks in mesohaline bottom water. In contrast, the dominant phytoplankton taxa (Skeletonema spp., Heterocapsa triquetra, and Prorocentrum spp.) were abundant at different salinity levels. The spatial distribution of dominant benthic and planktonic species in the water column was influenced by their tolerance to salinity. Our results suggest that suspended microphytobenthos contribute to microalgal communities in estuaries, especially those in bottom waters. Quantification of phytoplankton and suspended microphytobenthos will allow a better understanding of the effects of their spatial distribution on estuarine material circulation.																	1880-8247					AUG	2017	12	3					190	200		10.3800/pbr.12.190								WOS:000409395600006

Small, off-channel dams are generally ignored in impact assessments owing to limited information and spatial resolution issues. Previous research on South African rivers showed correlative links between high density of small dams and associated reductions in low flows, poorer water quality, and impoverished aquatic macroinvertebrate communities that were dominated by opportunistic taxa instead of specialist groups. 2 .Since small dams are usually associated with catchment transformation (for example, vineyards, stock farming and exotic timber plantations), they are convenient surrogates of the impacts of catchment transformation on river functionality. Here, an index of cumulative small dams for South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland is presented and evaluated. 3.Fifty-two per cent of the water management catchments in the study region exceeded the threshold for the cumulative small dams density (SDD) index above which river functionality is compromised. This estimate of potentially affected catchments is considered to be conservative for reasons discussed. 4.The index results are compared with a recent systematic biodiversity planning exercise for setting biodiversity targets for freshwater areas of South Africa. Although the systematic planning included in-stream small dams within 50m of a river, analysis showed that 36% of all quaternaries that have high SDD score overlap with river reaches classified as natural' or largely natural'. 5.Disregarding dams outside the 50m buffer area equates to ignoring the majority of small dams (94%) in South Africa, and it is recommended that aquatic conservation assessments include the SDD index as a cost layer for prioritizing rivers for rehabilitation and conservation.

Hepatic transcriptomic profiles from barramundi, Lates calcarifer, as a means of assessing organism health and identifying stressors in rivers in northern Queensland	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Resource managers need to differentiate between sites with and without contaminants and those where contaminants cause impacts. Potentially, transcriptomes could be used to evaluate sites where contaminant-induced effects may occur, to identify causative stressors of effects and potential adverse outcomes. To test this hypothesis, the hepatic transcriptomes in Barramundi, a perciforme teleost fish, (Lates calcarifer) from two reference sites, two agriculturally impacted sites sampled during the dry season, and an impacted site sampled during the wet season were compared. The hepatic transcriptome was profiled using RNA-Seq. Multivariate analysis showed that transcriptomes were clustered based on site and by inference water quality, but not sampling time. The largest differences in transcriptomic profile were between reference sites and a site sampled during high run-off, showing that impacted sites can be identified via RNA-Seq. Transcripts with altered abundance were linked to xenobiotic metabolism, peroxisome proliferation and stress responses, indicating putative stressors with the potential for adverse outcomes in barramundi.

Efficacy and residual toxicity of a sodium hydroxide based ballast water treatment system for freshwater bulk freighters	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The efficacy and residual toxicity of a sodium hydroxide (NaOH) based ballast water treatment system (BWTS) were tested aboard the Great Lakes carrier M/V American Spirit in 1000 L mesocosms containing water from the ship's ballast tanks. NaOH was added to elevate the pH to 11.5 or 11.7 for 48 h, after which pH was reduced to <9 before discharge by sparging with carbon dioxide to form sodium bicarbonate. In 4 trials, pH 11.7 NaOH BW was highly effective in reducing the densities of organisms relative to uptake water and met the ballast water discharge standards of the US Coast Guard (USCG), the US Environmental Protection Agency vessel general permit (USEPA VGP) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) G8 for the classes of regulated organisms: >= 50 mu m, >= 10 mu m to <50 mu m and indicator bacteria <10 mu m. In addition, densities of heterotrophic bacteria were reduced >96% in pH 11.7 treated discharge water relative to uptake densities. Seven day whole effluent toxicity tests indicated pH 11.7 NaOH BW met the USEPA VGP daily maximum criteria for residual toxicity. Organism densities in uptake water did not meet the minimum densities for IMO G8 shipboard test validity in 2 of 4 trials for organisms >= 10 mu m to <50 mu m or in any trials for the <10 mu m size class. The high efficacy and low residual toxicity observed indicates that a NaOH BWTS has great potential for successfully treating large volumes of ballast water released into freshwater systems.

In the laboratory, feeding fish (approximately 50 g) with feed containing viable B. pumilus at concentrations of 1 x 10(7)-10(9) colony forming units (CFU)/kg elevated fish immune responses, as indicated by their phagooytic activity and superoxide anion levels, and led to more effective disease resistance against Streptococcus agalactiae. However, when these concentrations were applied to Nile tilapia cultures growing in cage culture systems, only B. pumilus AQAHBS01 at concentrations of 1 x 10(8) and 10(9) CFU/kg diet could effectively enhance disease resistance against S. agalactiae during the critical period of early to middle April when the temperature reached 33 degrees C, whereas control fish and fish that consumed B. pumilus AQAHBS01 at concentrations of 1 x 10(7) CFU/kg showed very rapid streptococcosis-induced mortality. However, in late April, massive levels of organic matter-containing water flowed into the culture areas, causing all fish groups to become infected with Flavobacterium columnare. Moreover, the dissolved oxygen levels in the river declined to critical levels of approximately 1.0-1.5 mg/L, causing anorectic effects in fish for long periods of time. This effect may have also gradually killed the cultured fish until the end of the experiment. This information strongly demonstrates the effective application of B. pumilus as a probiotic for streptococcosis resistance in both laboratory and field culture conditions. For on-farm cage culture practices, however, fluctuations in water quality remain a significant constraint for probiotic application, as they usually induce negative effects on fish health. This decline in health makes fish more fragile and more susceptible to problems from both infectious and non-infectious diseases, which farmers must consider carefully. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The ornamental fish trade is estimated to handle up to 15 billion fishes. Transportation and handling of fishes imposes a range of stressors that can result in mortality at rates of up to 73%. These rates vary hugely, however, and can be as low as 2%, because they are generally estimated rather than based on experimental work. Given the numbers of ornamental fishes traded, any of the estimated mortality rates potentially incur significant financial losses and serious welfare issues. Industry bodies, such as the Ornamental Aquatic Trade Association (OATA), have established standards and codes of best practice for handling fishes, but little scientific research has been conducted to understand the links between stress, health and welfare in ornamental species. In aquaculture, many of the same stressors occur as those in the ornamental trade, including poor water quality, handling, transportation, confinement, poor social and physical environment and disease and in this sector directed research and some resulting interventions have resulted in improved welfare standards. This review considers the concept of welfare in fishes and evaluates reported rates of mortality in the ornamental trade. It assesses how the stress response can be quantified and used as a welfare indicator in fishes. It then analyses whether lessons from aquaculture can be usefully applied to the ornamental fish industry to improve welfare. Finally, this analysis is used to suggest how future research might be directed to help improve welfare in the ornamental trade.

J	Allin, A; Schernewski, G; Friedland, R; Neumann, T; Radtke, H				Allin, Alexander; Schernewski, Gerald; Friedland, Rene; Neumann, Thomas; Radtke, Hagen			Climate change effects on denitrification and associated avoidance costs in three Baltic river basin - coastal sea systems	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												To fight ongoing eutrophication of the Baltic Sea, major international directives and agreements, like the EU Water Framework Directive or the Helcom Baltic Sea Action Plan, aim at a reduction of nutrient loads to the Baltic Sea. These external nutrient load reductions interact with retention and removal processes (ecosystem services) in coastal and marine waters. Beside sedimentation, denitrification is the most important regulation ecosystem service provided by the sea, because it removes nitrogen (N) to the atmosphere and controls eutrophication. Denitrification is a spatially and temporally highly variable process and largely depends on temperature and N concentrations in the water. Climate change will have strong effects on denitrification. Increasing temperatures favour denitrification and changes in precipitation and discharge will alter the availability of N, with strong differences between river basins. We combine a 3D-ecosystem model of the Baltic Sea with economic marginal cost functions for three major Baltic river basins: Odra, Vistula and Neva. Objective is to calculate the monetary consequences of climate change (scenario A1B) for the implementation of water quality objectives, taking into account both, spatial changes in N loads and denitrification. In all regions over 90% of the entering N loads are subject to denitrification mainly in coastal waters. For the climate change scenario (A1B), our approach suggests reduced riverine N-loads of 7690 t/a (Odra), 6410 t/a (Vistula) and increased loads of 3200 t/a for the Neva. At the same time our model results suggest an increased denitrification of N-loads by 9.1% (Odra) and 9.9% (Neva) and minor changes with respect to the Vistula loads. In combination, in all three regions climate change helps to reach policy targets (lower N concentrations in the sea) at lower costs. The monetary benefit of load reduction measures that do not have to be implemented because of climate change are 11,270 million (sic)/a (Odra), 2000 million (sic)/a (Vistula) and 92 million (sic)/a (Neva). The valuations strongly depend on the assumed climate change scenario and the economic approach, but indicate that climate change effects differ much between river basins and should be taken into account in nutrient load reduction management plans.

Potential distribution of endangered Mexican golden trout (Oncorhynchus chrysogaster) in the Rio Sinaloa and Rio Culiacan basins (Sierra Madre Occidental) based on landscape characterization and species distribution models	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												The Mexican Golden Trout (Oncorhynchus chrysogaster) is a threatened native species inhabiting three river basins in the Sierra Madre Occidental. Despite some efforts from science groups to obtain information about this trout, the Rio Sinaloa and Rio Culiacan basins, to the south, remain the least studied area, compared to the Rio Fuerte basin. To overcome this gap, a survey (2014 to 2015) was undertaken to obtain new records and confirm the presence for historic records in both watersheds. After filtering records for this species, eighteen locations were used to model potential distribution, using the GARP and MaxEnt, including landscape characterization based on hydrologic analysis and satellite imagery classification. Coincidence between models was >85% for a potential distribution area of 4300 km(2), defined by six bioclimatic and physiographic variables, with the hydrologic network covering 3000 km. To avoid overestimation, the final distribution area included only the 100 m fringe surrounding the drainage network and its associated landscape features. Jackknife resampling was used to validate both the models, successfully predicting more than 80% of the locations (p < 0.001). The estimated area covers 275 km2, mainly defined by second- and third-order streams, at altitudes >2000 m, high water quality (transparent, dissolved oxygen >5 mg L-1; temperature < 26 degrees C), and was part of amatrix of undisturbed forests. This study provides new findings about this endangered species and new elements for designing appropriate monitoring programs supporting trout conservation and management.

Direct and indirect effects of predatory young-of-year fishes in a dryland river food web	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Young-of-year (YOY) fishes are sometimes numerically dominant vertebrate consumers in many large river systems, but their effects as predators are not as well understood as those of adult fishes. We predicted that YOY fishes influence community composition and abundance of invertebrate prey. Predation effects could be especially important in recruitment-driven dryland river systems, where YOY fishes seasonally comprise a large portion of overall fish biomass. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to quantify effects of YOY fishes on trophic dynamics and interactions with environmental factors in a dryland river food web. We manipulated presence of YOY fishes (an assemblage of cypriniform species) and supplemental allochthonous carbon (LEAF treatments) in 24 mesocosms, and measured invertebrate abundance and diversity over 6weeks. Experimental conditions mimicked a seasonal river drying regime that occurs during YOY fish growth. Seasonal drying in the Rio Grande frequently results in isolated pools with altered habitat complexity and riparian connectivity. Fishes exerted direct top-down control of invertebrate assemblage composition through differential prey selection, and indirect control mediated by non-lethal responses of invertebrates to predatory fishes. We observed enhanced water clarity in LEAF treatments associated with greater prey selectivity in fishes, presumably through enhanced visual feeding. Stable isotope analysis (C and N) was used to measure indirect impacts of YOY fishes on invertebrate prey items. YOY fishes caused a significant decrease in isotopic niche breadth among invertebrate taxa, suggesting that fish predators limit foraging opportunities for these consumers. However, allochthonous carbon sources were predominant in invertebrate diets in all LEAF treatments, suggesting consumer access to more biologically available autochthonous production is limited by factors other than fish predation. Although the roles of abiotic drivers and adult fishes in determining food web structure have received more attention, our results indicate that YOY fishes exert biologically relevant top-down control of invertebrate assemblage composition and trophic complexity in dryland river ecosystems against a backdrop of substantial changes in carbon availability and abiotic conditions (e.g. water quality and habitat volume) over the growing season.																	0046-5070	1365-2427				AUG	2017	62	8					1410	1421		10.1111/fwb.12954								WOS:000405074600009

Identifying the spatial scale that most influences the species-environment relationships is a major goal of community ecology. We evaluated the importance of catchment and site scales and associated environmental variables in shaping Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) assemblages in Neotropical savanna headwater streams. Sampling sites were associated with 20 catchment-scale variables that depicted land cover and land use as well as natural geophysical variables such as altitude and climate. Site-scale habitat was characterised by 55 variables that described habitat hydromorphology, substrate, flow, canopy, in-stream cover and water quality. EPT traits were assessed using 28 categories of 7 biological traits, which represented the best available current knowledge for EPT in Neotropical savanna streams. We analysed the relationships between the catchment- and site-scale habitat variables and the taxonomic and trait composition of insect assemblages using 1,760 samples collected in 160 stream sites. Catchment- and site-scale variables both explained significant variation in EPT taxon and trait composition. Substrate, habitat hydromorphology and land use most influenced variation in taxonomic composition, whereas trait composition was mainly affected by land use. Catchment geographic position explained less assemblage variation. To our knowledge, this study is the first assessment of the impact of catchment- and site-scale variables on the trait and taxon composition of stream insect assemblages in Neotropical savanna streams. It highlights the need for better regional biological knowledge of invertebrates to generate more general trait-based approaches in freshwater ecosystem conservation.

J	Tanaka, MO; dos Santos, BG				Tanaka, Marcel Okamoto; dos Santos, Bianca Goncalves			Influence of discharge patterns on temporal variation of macroinvertebrate communities in forested and deforested streams in a tropical agricultural landscape	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Deforestation of riparian forests can directly influence stream macroinvertebrate communities, through changes in resource availability, habitat quality, and hydrological alterations. Here we evaluated whether mean discharge and discharge coefficient of variation (CV), estimated over a 15-month study, influenced forested and deforested stream macroinvertebrate communities. Higher diversity and mean discharge were recorded in deforested streams, and community composition was strongly related to mean discharge. Streams formed a gradient of both mean discharges and discharge CV, which both influenced patterns of diversity. Discharge CV negatively influenced diversity in a nonlinear model, whereas both mean discharge and discharge CV influenced differentiation of macroinvertebrate communities among five sampling occasions. Similarity among sampling times within each stream estimated by the Morisita-Horn index decreased with increasing mean discharge, whereas response to CV was quadratic, with higher similarity at intermediate values and lower similarity at more extreme values. These results suggest that stability of stream macroinvertebrate communities display different responses to mean discharge and discharge CV, and that hydrological alterations can interact with land use changes to determine community dynamics at local scales.

Higher counts were observed in treatment 4, followed by treatments 3, 2 and 1 showing significant differences with higher counts in the surface waters. The species diversity indices were more in the third and fourth treatments with higher diversity at the surface levels. The dominance of Bacillariophyceae in the surface waters was distinct (45.9-60.6%) attributing to the higher nutrient availability on mineralization of the easily decomposable substrate. Water quality parameters in all the four treatments were in the normal ranges. The representations of both Bacillariophyceae and Chlorophyceae were similar in the subsurface waters (36.6-50.8% and 28.2-36.4%). There was increase in the percentage composition of protozoans in the surface waters in the slurryapplied ponds (0.6-3.3%). Variations in rotifers were moderate, the respective representation ranges being 0.9-3.4%, 2.2-5.3% in the two levels and cladocerans in subsurface waters were higher with means of 10.7, 4.3, 4.9 and 4.7. Copepods were the dominant group in the animal assemblages at the surface level with the means of 3.0%, 2.3%, 4.0% and 5.0%. The variations in the different groups presented a vertical distribution pattern in the colonization of the periphytic communities.																	0990-7440	1765-2952				JUL 27	2017	30								25	10.1051/alr/2017026								WOS:000406774700001

Life and death of a sewage treatment plant recorded in a coral skeleton delta N-15 record	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												We investigated the potential of coral skeleton delta N-15 (CS-delta N-15) records for tracking anthropogenic-N sources in coral reef ecosystems. We produced a 56 yr-long CS-delta N-15 record (1958-2014) from a reef flat in Guam that has been exposed to varying 1) levels of sewage treatment 2) population density, and 3) land use. Increasing population density (from < 30 to 300 ind.km(-2)) and land use changes in the watershed resulted in a similar to 1 parts per thousand enrichment of the CS-delta N-15 record until a sewage treatment plant (STP) started operation in 1975. Then, CS-delta N-15 stabilized, despite continued population density and land use changes. Based on population and other considerations, a continued increase in the sewage footprint might have been expected over this time. The stability of CS-delta N-15, either contradicts this expectation, or indicates that the impacts on the outer reef at the coring site were buffered by the mixing of reef water with the open ocean.

The oil spills are recovered from various water areas of Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah (East Malaysia). The study approach used six sigma methodologies that effectively serve as the problem solving in oil classification extracted from the complex mixtures of oil spilled dataset. The analysis of six sigma link with the quality engineering improved the organizational performance to achieve its objectivity of the environmental forensics. The study reveals that oil spills are discriminated into four groups' viz. diesel, hydrocarbon fuel oil (HFO), mixture oil lubricant and fuel oil (MOLFO) and waste oil (WO) according to the similarity of the intrinsic chemical properties. Through the validation, it confirmed that four discriminant component, diesel, hydrocarbon fuel oil (HFO), mixture oil lubricant and fuel oil (MOLFO) and waste oil (WO) dominate the oil types with a total variance of 99.51% with ANOVA giving F-stat > F-critical at 95% confidence level and a Chi Square goodness test of 74.87. Results obtained from this study reveals that by employing six-sigma approach in a data-driven problem such as in the case of oil spill classification, good decision making can be expedited.

However, in Europe, only the microbiological parameters are to be accomplished. Recent research has focused on chemical indicators that can determine human fecal contaminants in water. Therefore, the suitability of caffeine as a chemical marker of seawater pollution in the north Portuguese coastal area in the Atlantic Ocean during the bathing season was assessed in this study. The quality of water from the coasts of five cities was monitored. 101 seawater samples were collected from 14 beaches, and their water quality was classified as sufficient, good, and excellent. Caffeine was detected in all samples in concentration range of 18 to 525 ng/L. The highest average concentration of caffeine was found in seawater samples collected in July from beaches classified as having sufficient water quality, which were located in cities with high population density and high tourist affluence.

Effects of environmental and water quality parameters on the functioning of copepod assemblages in tropical estuaries	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												We examined changes in the functioning of copepod assemblages with increasing pollution in estuaries, using sampling standardization of the salinity range to enable comparisons. Copepod assemblages were analyzed in four southeast Brazilian estuaries with different water quality levels and hydrodynamic characteristics over two years. We obtained mesozooplankton samples together with environmental and water quality parameters in the estuaries, every two months under predetermined salinities ranging from 15 to 25. The values of parameters, except species size, associated with the functioning of the copepod assemblages (biomass, productivity, and turnover rate) did not differ among estuaries. However, in the more polluted estuaries, the biomass and productivity of copepod assemblages of mesozooplankton were negatively correlated with concentration of pollution indicator parameters. Conversely, in the less polluted estuaries some degree of enrichment still seems to increase the system biomass and productivity, as these parameters were inversely related to indicators of improved water quality. The pollution level of estuaries distorted the relationship between temperature and the efficiency of converting energy to organic matter. In the less polluted estuaries, the relationship between turnover rate and temperature was over 70%, while in the most polluted estuaries, this relationship was only approximately 50%. Our results demonstrated that the functioning of assemblages in the estuaries was affected differently by increasing pollution depending on the water quality level of the system. Thus, investigating the functioning of assemblages can be a useful tool for the analysis of estuarine conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Epilithic algae and water samples were taken from four stations (one in the channel, others in the lake), between June 2012-May 2013 seasonally. Totally 51 taxa were observed belonging to the groups Bacillariophyta (37), Chlorophyta (8), Charophyta (4) and Cyanobacteria (2), respectively. The stations were clustered into main two groups based on UPGMA. The highest similarity value was determined between third and fourth station (94%). Saprobic Index (SI) was applied in order to determine biological water quality. Physicochemical parameters have been evaluated according to the Klee's method and Regulation on the Management of Surface Water Quality in Turkish (RMSWQ). According to the Klee's method, water quality was found unpolluted in Kovada Lake, and its channel while it was found as polluted based on RMSWQ. Biological water quality values indicated Lake Kovada as poorly polluted, but its channel as polluted. According to CCA, 84.6% of the variance was described by the first four axes of the relations of species and environmental variables (r=0.963), and pH, conductivity and Cl- were found to be the most influential variables on distribution of dominant taxa.																	1303-2712					JUL	2017	17	4					701	711		10.4194/1303-2712-v17_4_06								WOS:000403575500006

It is considered as a hypertrophic environment that receives daily high loads of domestic sewage without treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the spatial and temporal variation of phytoplankton community and its relationship with environmental parameters. Bi-monthly sampling campaigns were carried out at six fixed sites between 2012 and 2013. Physical-chemical and biological parameters were collected (chlorophyll a, phytoplankton composition and abundance) to perform the statistical correlations. The results indicate that phytoplankton community is mostly represented by diatoms, with Skeletonema costatum being the dominant species responsible for bloom in April and June of 2012. The dominance of this species is related to the high silicate concentrations, pH and turbidity. Other blooms events as well as the Euglena gracilis and Chlamydomonas sp. were recorded in February 2013, when the total phosphorus concentrations were high and the dissolved oxygen concentrations were higher. Dinoflagellates, cyanobacteria and diatom Thallassiosira sp. were widely distributed in the dry period and highly correlated with salinity, water transparency and nutrients. Hence, the distribution of phytoplankton community is more defined seasonally, rather than spatially.																	1679-8759	1982-436X				JUL-SEP	2017	65	3					356	372		10.1590/S1679-87592017134406503								WOS:000414698600003

Samples were taken before (BD) and; 1 day (1 PD) 5 days (5 PD), 10 days (10 PD), 20 days (20 PD) and 30 days (30 PD) after the effluents discharge. Some water quality parameters were affected by the effluents discharge; however, these changes were restricted to a distance of 20 m from the effluent discharge channel for a period of 5 days. The microbial community was dominated by chlorophyceae, followed by diatoms, cyanobacteria and ciliates. There was an increase in the abundance of different groups on the 1 PD sampling compared to BD. The zooplankton abundance was low in practically all sites, except for 30 PD sampling. The meso-zooplanktonic organisms were represented by copepods, mostly Acartia tonsa. Despite some effects on water quality and phytoplankton and protozooplankton abundance until 5 PD sampling, these alterations dissipated in a short period of time. We conclude that the environment quickly assimilated the effluents discharge, and the water quality parameters remained within the limits stipulated by standard guidelines.

Estuarine retention and production of striped bass larvae: a mark-recapture experiment	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Mark-recapture experiments were conducted in the tidal Nanticoke River (Chesapeake Bay) to determine how the salt front retains striped bass larvae and controls nursery production. During two spring spawning seasons, 25.1 million hatchery-produced, first-feeding larvae (5-12 days post-hatch) were released with chemically marked otoliths at selected locations and times. Surveys tracked the spatial and demographic fates of released and naturally spawned larvae. Released larvae dispersed rapidly within the freshwater tidal portion of the estuary and were retained above the salt front. Their distributions overlapped with natural larvae. Growth and mortality rates did not differ with respect to release location, but did vary with day of release, influenced by storm events and seasonal changes in temperature. In 1993, a group released during a storm event did not yield any recaptured larvae. Zooplankton concentrations in both years were likely sufficient for successful larval feeding. In spring 1993, a season of relatively high freshwater flow, nursery volume was 2.1-fold larger and juvenile production from larval releases was fourfold higher than in 1992. We propose that increased nursery volume reduces variance in water quality, enhances retention of larvae within the nursery, thus increasing production of larval striped bass.																	1054-3139	1095-9289				JUL-AUG	2017	74	6					1735	1748		10.1093/icesjms/fsw245								WOS:000406598500024

We investigated the effect of sediment resuspension on benthic fluxes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), metals (Fe, Mn), and nutrients (N, P) in three drinking water reservoirs using sediment core incubations. Measurement of Fe and Mn fluxes, and of microbial potentials to degrade organic substrates (Biolog EcoPlates T) were employed to understand mechanisms regulating DOC exchange after sediment resuspension. Single sediment resuspension events resulted in DOC fluxes [-104 (into sediment) to 46 (release) mmol m(-2) event(-1)] equal to 9-17 days of diffusive fluxes, making them a relevant process. Shallow reservoir sites were more likely to immobilize DOC after resuspension than deep sites. Sediment resuspension under anoxia always led to increases of DOC and metals in the overlying water. Resuspension did not necessarily mobilize nitrate or phosphorus even under anoxia, while ammonium was released after resuspension. Sediment resuspension increased hypolimnetic microbial potentials to utilize organic substrates in both spring and summer. However microbial cells counts and biomass either remained constant or decreased in summer. Adsorption to Fe minerals seemed to play a role in DOC immobilization as evidenced by a decrease in DOC: Fe molar ratios after resuspension in Fe limited sites and constant ratios in Fe rich sites. The results demonstrate a potential for DOC immobilization mainly by Fe minerals and to some extent by benthic microbes. Therefore, sediment resuspension can be beneficial for water quality in low nutrient, iron rich systems.

Effort-based predictors of headwater stream conditions: comparing the proximity of land use pressures and instream stressors on macroinvertebrate assemblages	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Environmental agencies are often faced with resource and time constraints in assessing waterbody health. We compared the strengths of varying levels of effort (field measures, laboratory chemistry, land use, and multiple combinations of these) to explain macroinvertebrate assemblage response along a gradient of urban land use intensity among 30 headwater streams in northern West Virginia. Because the spatial arrangement of human disturbance can govern biotic response, land use effects were analyzed at five spatial scales (whole catchment, and 100 m buffer zone at three fixed upstream distances and total stream network upstream of site); instream ecological measures included physical habitat, algal concentrations and water chemistry. Of the five spatial scales, we predicted that riparian land use nearest the site would explain the most variation but that instream measures would be the overall driver of the macroinvertebrate assemblages. Regression analysis evaluated the strength of single and multiple variables in explaining macroinvertebrate multimetric index (MMI) and ordination patterns, and revealed that assemblages were highly responsive to numerous stressors. In contrast to predictions, total upstream network riparian forest cover explained the most variation overall (83%) while specific conductance was the single best instream measure (64%). Stepwise regression models using combinations of field, laboratory, and land use variables all performed reasonably well but we found that a 3-variable model [% forest (catchment), road density, and specific conductance] that minimized colinearity and cost/effort explained 90% of the variation in the MMI. Validation and spatial autocorrelation results suggest that this model could potentially be used to forecast stream condition for prioritizing conservation and remediation efforts in headwaters within the ecoregion, and our general approach would be broadly applicable in other settings.																	1015-1621	1420-9055				JUL	2017	79	3					765	781		10.1007/s00027-017-0534-3								WOS:000405798900025

Linking the biological impacts of ocean acidification on oysters to changes in ecosystem services: A review	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Continued anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions are acidifying our oceans, and hydrogen ion concentrations in surface oceans are predicted to increase 150% by 2100. Ocean acidification (OA) is changing ocean carbonate chemistry, including causing rapid reductions in calcium carbonate availability with implications for many marine organisms, including biogenic reefs formed by oysters. The impacts of OA are marked. Adult oysters display both decreased growth and calcification rates, while larval oysters show stunted growth, developmental abnormalities, and increased mortality. These physiological impacts are affecting ecosystem functioning and the provision of ecosystem services by oyster reefs. Oysters are ecologically and economically important, providing a wide range of ecosystem services, such as improved water quality, coastlines protection, and food provision. OA has the potential to alter the delivery and the quality of the ecosystem services associated with oyster reefs, with significant ecological and economic losses. This review provides a summary of current knowledge of OA on oyster biology, but then links these impacts to potential changes to the provision of ecosystem services associated with healthy oyster reefs.

One component of monitoring is measuring the phytoplankton community composition and detecting whether that has changed. From April to October 2012, by using ships-of-opportunity (SOOP), we collected simultaneous samples from 15 stations in the Gulf of Finland and the Baltic Proper to study the spatial variability in the phytoplankton species composition and biomass throughout the growing season. The analysis was performed with 10 dominant taxa constituting 83-97% of the total phytoplankton biomass. We set the criterion of the statistically significant (p < 0.05) Bray-Curtis similarity for the station pairs to be mutually representative according to the species composition and biomass. Our results indicated that in areas of similar hydrological conditions, it is sufficient to have sampling stations in 50-65 km distance between one another, but in the areas with varying hydrographical conditions, i.e. coastal areas, higher spatial coverage may be needed. Whenever possible, it is recommended to combine monitoring efforts between the Baltic Sea countries in the offshore areas, including SOOP. The need for further harmonization of phytoplankton analysis between countries is addressed in order to have comparable data sets by different countries. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

As part of a risk-spreading strategy, only a fraction of the egg bank hatches during a single inundation. Besides this dispersal in time, resistant dormant eggs also disperse in space via vectors including wind, water and animals. The structure and functioning of the dormant egg bank has important consequences for (meta) population and (meta) community structure and dynamics. Here, we merge empirical and theoretical data into a conceptual framework for the study of population and community responses in temporary ponds along a gradient in hydrological disturbance. Overall, we conclude that changes in hydrological disturbance may compromise both the abiotic (i.e. water quality) and biotic (i.e. population and community processes) integrity of temporary pools which is especially relevant in light of ongoing anthropogenic alterations in the hydrology of inland waters.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL	2017	796	1					201	222		10.1007/s10750-016-3006-1								WOS:000403357600017

However, the influence of additional drivers is more difficult to identify. The implementation of long-term monitoring and the development of reliable tools can help to reveal fine local drivers structuring fish populations in contrasted flow regimes. This study used data series for nine reaches monitored for nine to nineteen years in four French salmonid streams. Study reaches were within five bypassed sections influenced by instream flow. A deterministic trout population dynamics model was applied on each reach, with calibration and validation procedures. Results revealed that biological drivers structured all reaches similarly. In addition, seven other drivers were identified. Among these additional drivers, hydrology mainly explained temporal fluctuations in trout density, regardless of reach. Three drivers independent of hydrology were also revealed: poor water quality, limited spawning area and the effect of power plant operations (overtopping, flushing or plant shutdown). All drivers influenced the whole bypassed section and were never limited to the scale of the reach (sampling area). Further analyses of each driver are now needed, to regionalise and quantify their respective impact precisely.

The aim of this study was to investigate the critical swimming capacity and metabolism of the eastern mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki, focusing on sex and size effects, to evaluate the influence of water flow on its invasive success. Specimens of mosquitofish were captured from the Ter Vell lagoon (L'Estartit, north-eastern Spain) in July 2014, and we measured the critical swimming speed (U-crit) and oxygen consumption of individual fish (30 females and 30 males) using a mini swim tunnel. The mean U-crit of this poeciliid fish was estimated at 14.11cms(-1) (range=4.85-22.26), which is lower than that of many other fishes of similar size and confirms that this species is limnophilic and its invasive success might be partially explained by hydrologic alterations. However, the U-crit and maximal metabolic rate vary markedly with fish size and sex, with males having much higher values for the same body mass, and thus probably being more resistant to strong water flows. Multiple regression models illustrate that multivariate analyses might increase the predictive power and understanding of swimming performance and metabolic traits, compared to results from conventional simple regressions.

This Himalayan geothermal region encompassed hot springs ranging in temperature from 60 to 95 degrees C, in pH from 6.2 to 9.4, and in mineralogy from bicarbonates (Tato Field), sulfates (Tatta Pani) to mixed type (Murtazaabad). Microbial community structures in these geothermal springs remained largely unexplored to date. In this study, we report a comprehensive, culture-independent survey of microbial communities in nine samples from these geothermal fields by employing a bar-coded pyrosequencing technique. The bacterial phyla Proteobacteria and Chloroflexi were dominant in all samples from Tato Field, Tatta Pani, and Murtazaabad. The community structures however depended on temperature, pH, and physicochemical parameters of the geothermal sites. The Murtazaabad hot springs with relatively higher temperature (90-95 degrees C) favored the growth of phylum Thermotogae, whereas the Tatta Pani thermal spring site TP-H3-b (60 degrees C) favored the phylum Proteobacteria. At sites with low silica and high temperature, OTUs belonging to phylum Chloroflexi were dominant. Deep water areas of the Murtazaabad hot springs favored the sulfur-reducing bacteria. About 40% of the total OTUs obtained from these samples were unclassified or uncharacterized, suggesting the presence of many undiscovered and unexplored microbiota. This study has provided novel insights into the nature of ecological interactions among important taxa in these communities, which in turn will help in determining future study courses in these sites.

J	Piano, E; Falasco, E; Bona, F				Piano, Elena; Falasco, Elisa; Bona, Francesca			How does water scarcity affect spatial and temporal patterns of diatom community assemblages in Mediterranean streams?	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Mediterranean streams are mostly characterised by intermittent flow regime, with droughts in summer followed by floods in autumn. During droughts, the creation of lentic habitats (i.e. lentification process) and isolated pools in the riverbeds (i.e. fragmentation process) represents a strong selective pressure on biotic communities, which might be intensified by human-induced water scarcity. In the highly heterogeneous habitat patches created by these processes, species sorting may be driven by stochastic mechanisms, as well as by environmental filtering. In this work, we investigated the spatial and temporal patterns in the assemblage of diatom communities during water scarcity periods in Mediterranean streams. Five oligotrophic streams, which were similar in terms of physical and chemical parameters, were sampled in the Ligurian Alps (NW Italy). Data were collected during moderate flow in April 2014 and then at least monthly during water scarcity, from June to September 2014, in: (1) lentic sites, where the water flow became slower but was permanent all year around, (2) fragmented sites, where the riverbed stretch dried out creating isolated pools. For each sampling site, we collected six benthic diatom samples from different microhabitats. We examined which type of factors, i.e. spatial or environmental, better explained the temporal and spatial variation in diatom communities. We then calculated the turnover and nestedness components of dissimilarity by comparing samples collected during moderate flow with samples obtained during a period of water scarcity. We further investigated if the idiosyncrasy of diatom species, i.e. a measure of their discrepancy from a nested pattern, could be explained by the ecological niche width of species and/or by species traits. Our results showed a contribution of both environmental and spatial factors in determining species composition during water scarcity, with the overall trends in community structure being driven by species turnover. The percentage of idiosyncratic species (those departing from the nested pattern) increased with increasing water scarcity, but showed no differences in terms of species traits. According to our results, species turnover, with replacement of sensitive species by tolerant species, seemed to be the dominating process in diatom benthic communities during water scarcity in the streams under investigation. A better evaluation of species autecology could improve the evaluation of water quality in Mediterranean streams.

Sequential rather than interactive effects of multiple stressors as drivers of phytoplankton community change in a large lake	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Predicting how freshwater biota respond to multiple stressors is currently a major challenge facing aquatic ecologists and environmental managers. Lake Simcoe is an ideal location to test the impact of multiple stressors on aquatic biota over time, as changes in climate warming, species invasions, nutrient loading, and human population growth have occurred throughout the last three decades. In this study, we used a suite of multivariate analyses to quantify the unique and interactive effects of physico-climatic, water quality, and biological variables in explaining phytoplankton community composition from 1986 to 2012. Changes in water quality, zooplankton abundance and community composition (following the invasion of Bythotrephes longimanus), euphotic zone temperature and thermal stability, and the invasion of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) acting at different times throughout the period of record, were associated with major shifts in the phytoplankton community of Lake Simcoe: dominance of eutrophic diatoms and cyanobacteria from 1986 to 1997 shifted to chlorophytes after 1998, then again to a diverse mix of taxa represented by all major categories of algae after 2004. Contrary to expectation, we found little evidence that interactions between multiple stressors are taking place in Lake Simcoe. Instead, our results demonstrated the sequential nature of multiple stressors in influencing interannual variation in phytoplankton community structure. By occurring consecutively over time, we propose a sequence of stressors has influenced the ecological health of the lake over the preceding three decades. Considered by category, biological stressors, followed by water quality, then temperature and climate, explained the largest amount of total variance in the phytoplankton data. The prominence of zooplankton community changes as significant predictors of phytoplankton community change throughout the period of record suggests the top-down effect of these herbivores are also very important. Our results highlight the importance of extensive ecosystem monitoring in determining ecosystem health. Our approach may assist in the management of other aquatic systems, where identifying when multiple stressors are not operating may simplify the management process, allowing remediation efforts to focus on the most impactful stressors as primary targets for ecosystem restoration.																	0046-5070	1365-2427				JUL	2017	62	7					1288	1302		10.1111/fwb.12945								WOS:000403021500015

A Modeling Study of the Impacts of Mississippi River Diversion and Sea-Level Rise on Water Quality of a Deltaic Estuary	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Freshwater and sediment management in estuaries affects water quality, particularly in deltaic estuaries. Furthermore, climate change-induced sea-level rise (SLR) and land subsidence also affect estuarine water quality by changing salinity, circulation, stratification, sedimentation, erosion, residence time, and other physical and ecological processes. However, little is known about how the magnitudes and spatial and temporal patterns in estuarine water quality variables will change in response to freshwater and sediment management in the context of future SLR. In this study, we applied the Delft3D model that couples hydrodynamics and water quality processes to examine the spatial and temporal variations of salinity, total suspended solids, and chlorophyll-alpha concentration in response to small (142 m(3) s(-1)) and large (7080 m(3) s(-1)) Mississippi River (MR) diversions under low (0.38 m) and high (1.44 m) relative SLR (RSLR = eustatic SLR + subsidence) scenarios in the Breton Sound Estuary, Louisiana, USA. The hydrodynamics and water quality model were calibrated and validated via field observations at multiple stations across the estuary. Model results indicate that the large MR diversion would significantly affect the magnitude and spatial and temporal patterns of the studied water quality variables across the entire estuary, whereas the small diversion tends to influence water quality only in small areas near the diversion. RSLR would also play a significant role on the spatial heterogeneity in estuary water quality by acting as an opposite force to river diversions; however, RSLR plays a greater role than the small-scale diversion on the magnitude and spatial pattern of the water quality parameters in this deltaic estuary.																	1559-2723	1559-2731				JUL	2017	40	4					1028	1054		10.1007/s12237-016-0197-7								WOS:000402100700008

In both deep and shallow lakes, we found marked seasonality in the ratio between total N and total P (TN:TP) and in the inorganic concentrations of nitrogen (DIN), indicating that N more easily becomes a limiting nutrient as summer proceeds. TN:TP reached its lowest values of < 7 (by mass) in August in 25% of the shallow lakes. Chla generally related more strongly to TP than to TN, but at high TP concentrations TN explained more of the variability in Chla than TP. Macrophyte cover tended to decrease at increasing TN when TP was between 0.1 and 0.4 mg/l. At macrophyte cover above 20%, Chla was considerably lower compared with lakes with low macrophyte cover. We conclude that P is of key importance for the ecological quality of Danish lakes but that increased N concentrations, particularly in shallow lakes with moderate to high TP, may have significantly adverse effects on lake water quality and ecological status in summer.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL	2017	795	1					35	48		10.1007/s10750-017-3110-x								WOS:000401917000003

Natural gas drilling in the Marcellus Shale region: well pad densities and aquatic communities	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Few studies have examined the relationship between natural gas development and surface water quality using well pad density (the number of well pads/km(2)) as an indicator of potential impacts to aquatic life, specifically fish, salamander, and crayfish assemblages. We tested the hypothesis that animal assemblages, assessed by densities of ecologically important species, will differ among groups of watersheds with different well pad densities. In 2011, sites were sampled in Pennsylvania between July 13 and September 14 (N = 28; 10 = no well pads, 8 = low density, 10 = moderate density). We did not detect evidence of impact on fish, salamander, and crayfish assemblages. It should be noted that this study primarily assessed infrastructure-related impacts. Watersheds under investigations in this study area included no stream withdrawals for drilling and relatively low well pad density (<= 0.541 well pads/km(2)), which reduces the amount of roads and pipeline as well as sediment runoff reaching the stream from this and other infrastructure during development. In addition, setback and landscape limitations also kept well pads relatively far from surface waters, and these watersheds remained highly forested after development because most were in state forests. Therefore, these findings represent the least intrusive scenario for impacts to aquatic communities while extracting natural gas.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL	2017	795	1					49	64		10.1007/s10750-017-3112-8								WOS:000401917000004

HYDROBIOLOGIA												Two methods of quantifying diatoms were compared: (i) by counting valves, and (ii) by simple assignment of individual species to a seven-point scale according to their coverage on a glass slide. The saprobity-trophic index introduced in the Czech Republic for assessing the ecological status of running waters in accordance with the requirements of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) was used for comparison. There were no statistically significant differences between the indices as calculated by the studied methods, and therefore the comparable indicative values of the two approaches were demonstrated. In all cases, however, indices based on coverage classes achieved higher correlation with the fundamental water chemistry parameters than did indices based on diatom valve counts. To explain the cause of higher correlations, different variants of editing input data were used. The results support the assumption that the main cause of the poorer predictive value for the index based on diatom valve counts is that the abundant taxa are attributed too much importance in the final assessment of the environment quality. Using degrees of coverage for the quantification of diatoms in evaluating the ecological status thus appears to be preferable (or at least sufficient) for the given purpose.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL	2017	795	1					113	127		10.1007/s10750-017-3123-5								WOS:000401917000008

Carbon dioxide emissions and sediment organic carbon burials across a gradient of trophic state in eleven New Zealand lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Lakes are known to be important to the global carbon balance as they are both CO2 sources to the atmosphere and also accumulate large amounts of carbon in their sediment. CO2 flux dynamics across the air-water interface in 11 lakes of varying trophic state in the Rotorua region, New Zealand, derived from measured alkalinity, pH and wind speed at given temperature, showed that lakes may shift from being atmospheric CO2 sources to sinks due to seasonal changes in phytoplankton productivity and lake mixing dynamics. Decreases in trophic state (i.e. improved water quality) in some of the lakes over the eight-year monitoring period were associated with increased surface water CO2 concentrations and, as a consequence, increased CO2 flux to the atmosphere. Organic carbon content analysis of the bottom sediments revealed that lakes with high phytoplankton productivity, indicated by high chlorophyll a biomass, generally had high rates of carbon deposition to the sediments, but not all deposited carbon was permanently buried. Remineralization of the organic carbon accrued in productive lakes may potentially generate CO2, as well as CH4, which promotes these lakes to act as greenhouse gas emitters.

J	Zhong, XX; Xu, GJ; Xu, HL				Zhong Xiaoxiao; Xu Guangjian; Xu Henglong			Use of multiple functional traits of protozoa for bioassessment of marine pollution	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Ecological parameters based on multiply functional traits have many advantages for monitoring programs by reducing "signal to noise" ratios of observed species data. To identify potential indicators for bioassessment of marine pollution in function space, the functional patterns of protozoan communities and relationships with environmental changes were studied in coastal waters of the Yellow Sea during a 1-year period. The results showed that: (1) the spatial variability in functional trait distributions of the protozoa was significantly associated with changes in environmental variables, especially chemical oxygen demand (COD) and nutrients on spatial scale; (2) the functional traits, especially food resources and feeding type, were significantly correlated with COD and nutrients; and (3) the functional diversity indices were generally related to nutrients or COD. Based on the results, we suggest that the functional traits and diversity indices of protozoan communities may be used as more effective indicators for bioassessment of marine pollution.

Environmental indicators and macrobenthic communities, were investigated during summer and winter 2015. Results indicated a strong seasonality in biotope of intertidal and subtidal zones. Lower macrobenthic diversity were calculated from subtidal inner bay, reflecting the effects of anthropogenic nutrients. However, intertidal sites in that part were indicated to be in a relatively healthier ecological status. Seasonal effects of excess nutrients on benthic habitat were reflected in ecological indicators. It is concluded that the excess nutrients at spatiotemporal scales, influences on the health of benthic habitat. Eventually, it is recommended by this research that, with considering the natural/anthropogenic circumstances, the taxonomic and phylogenetic ecological indicators would be helpful tools to evaluate the benthic health of a typical sub-tropical semi-enclosed bay.

Four types of coastal engineering works were analyzed, namely port construction, petroleum exploitation, fishery and aquaculture, and seawall defense. In addition, two areas with limited human disturbances were considered for comparison. From the weights of the response value for each indicator, port construction was determined to be the primary impact contributor among the four engineering works studies. Specifically, hydrodynamic conditions, ecological status, economic costs, and engineering intensity were on average 72.78%, 65.03%, 75.03%, and 66.35% higher than those of other engineering types. Furthermore, fishery and aquaculture impact on water quality was 42.51% higher than that of other engineering types, whereas seawall defense impact on landscape variation was 51.75% higher than that of other engineering types. The proposed indicator system may provide effective coastal management in future. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Variation in the health and biochemical condition of the coral Acropora tenuis along two water quality gradients on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												This study explores how plasticity in biochemical attributes, used as indicators of health and condition, enables the coral Acropora tenuis to respond to differing water quality regimes in inshore regions of the Great Barrier Reef. Health attributes were monitored along a strong and weak water quality gradient, each with three reefs at increasing distances from a major river source. Attributes differed significantly only along the strong gradient; corals grew fastest, had the least dense skeletons, highest symbiont densities and highest lipid concentrations closest to the river mouth, where water quality was poorest. High nutrient and particulate loads were only detrimental to skeletal density, which decreased as linear extension increased, highlighting a trade-off. Our study underscores the importance of assessing multiple health attributes in coral reef monitoring. For example, autotrophic indices are poor indicators of coral health and condition, but improve when combined with attributes like lipid content and biomass.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				JUN 30	2017	119	2					106	119		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.03.066								WOS:000403985200012	28460877

The key factors controlling GHG emission from subtropical estuarine wetlands were investigated in this study, which continuously monitored the uptake/emission of GHGs (CO2, CH4, and N2O) by/from a subtropical estuarine wetland located in the Minjiang estuary in the coastal region of southeastern China. A self-designed floating chamber was used to collect air samples on site at three environmental habitats (Phragmites australis marsh, mudflats, and river water). The CO2, CH4, and N2O concentrations were then measured using an automated nondispersive infrared analyzer. The magnitudes of the CO2 and N2O emission fluxes at the three habitats were ordered as river water > P. australis > mudflats. P. australis emitted GHGs through photosynthesis and respiration processes. Emissions of CH4 from P. australis and the mudflats were revealed to be slightly higher than those from the river water. The total GHG emission fluxes at the three environmental habitats were quite similar (4.68-4.78 g m(-2) h(-1)). However, when the total carbon dioxide equivalent fluxes (CO2-e) were considered, the river water was discovered to emit the most CO2-e compared with P. australis and the mudflats. Based on its potential to increase global warming, N2O was the main contributor to the total GHG emission, with that emitted from the river water being the most considerable. Tidal water carried onto the marsh had its own GHG content and thus has acted as a source or sink of GHGs. However, water quality had a large effect on GHG emissions from the river water whereas the tidal water height did not. Both high salinity and large amounts of sulfates in the wetlands explicitly inhibited the activity of CH4-producing bacteria, particularly at nighttime.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				JUN 15	2017	119	1					289	298		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.04.005								WOS:000403511000045	28434669

In general, loss of water quality and biological communities and massive development of toxic microorganisms are some of the consequences of this phenomenon. To reveal changes in species composition and cell abundance of the taxocoenosis of epibenthic dinoflagellates before and after a harmful algal bloom event in the water column that lasted about 150 days (August-December 2011) in the Dzilam - San Crisanto area (northern Yucatan Peninsula, southeastern Gulf of Mexico) were the main objectives of the present study. In August 2011 and September 2012, sampling along 20 transects perpendicular to the coastline along the entire northern Yucatan coast, starting from 20 sampling sites from El Cuyo in the east to Celestun in the west, at a distance of 50, 150 and 250 m from the coast, was carried out. Physicochemical characteristics measured before and after the bloom were within the ranges previously reported in the study area. Salinity was the most stable characteristic, with mean values of 36.25 and 36.42 in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Phosphates were the only parameter that showed a wide range with higher values before the bloom (0.03-0.54 mu M/I). A total of 168 macrophyte (seaweeds and seagrasses), sponge and sediment samples (105 in 2011 and 63 in 2012) that included associated microphytobenthos were taken by snorkeling from 0.7 to 5 m depth. Six substrate types were distinguished: Chlorophyta, Phaeophyceae, Rhodophyta, Angiospermae (seagrasses), Demospongiae (sponges) and sediment. Chlorophytes dominated the collected samples: 38 samples in 2011 and 23 in 2012. Avrainvillea longicaulis f. laxa predominated before the bloom and Udotea flabellum after it. In total, 25 epibenthic dinoflagellate species from 11 genera were found. The genus Prorocentrum was the most representative in terms of the number of species. The highest total dinoflagellate cell abundances were observed in the sites with different types of macrophytes (up to 2441 cells/g substrate wet weight in 2011 and up to 1068 cells/g in 2012). The lowest cell densities were observed in the areas with scarce or no macrophytes on sandy seafloor. Before the bloom, Prorocentrum rhathymum (up to 4995 cells/g) and P. cf. sipadanensis (up to 5275 cells/g) were the most abundant, and after the bloom the latter was dominant (up to 3559 cells/g); in 2012, both variety of substrates and dinoflagellate cell abundance diminished. A canonical correspondence analysis revealed significant relationships between the physicochemical variables and epiphytic/benthic dinoflagellate species either before or after the bloom. The pelagic bloom resulted in the loss of substrate for epiphytic dinoflagellates, which caused replacement of the dominant species and a decrease in cell abundance of the whole taxocoenosis.

Application of an unstructured 3D finite volume numerical model to flows and salinity dynamics in the San Francisco Bay-Delta	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												A linked modeling approach has been undertaken to understand the impacts of climate and infrastructure on aquatic ecology and water quality in the San Francisco Bay-Delta region. The Delft3D Flexible Mesh modeling suite is used in this effort for its 3D hydrodynamics, salinity, temperature and sediment dynamics, phytoplankton and water-quality coupling infrastructure, and linkage to a habitat suitability model. The hydrodynamic model component of the suite is D-Flow FM, a new 3D unstructured finite-volume model based on the Delft3D model. In this paper, D-Flow FM is applied to the San Francisco Bay-Delta to investigate tidal, seasonal and annual dynamics of water levels, river flows and salinity under historical environmental and infrastructural conditions. The model is driven by historical winds, tides, ocean salinity, and river flows, and includes federal, state, and local freshwater withdrawals, and regional gate and barrier operations. The model is calibrated over a 9-month period, and subsequently validated for water levels, flows, and 3D salinity dynamics over a 2 year period. Model performance was quantified using several model assessment metrics and visualized through target diagrams. These metrics indicate that the model accurately estimated water levels, flows, and salinity over wide-ranging tidal and fluvial conditions, and the model can be used to investigate detailed circulation and salinity patterns throughout the Bay-Delta. The hydrodynamics produced through this effort will be used to drive affiliated sediment, phytoplankton, and contaminant hindcast efforts and habitat suitability assessments for fish and bivalves. The modeling framework applied here will serve as a baseline to ultimately shed light on potential ecosystem change over the current century. (C) 2017 The Authors.

The aims of this study is to prove contamination presumption, by analyzing and determine correlation Cd and Pb concentration in the sediment, in the water and on milkfish Chanos chanos cultured in this area. On this study, we collected water quality data (pH, temperature, dissolve oxygen and salinity) and heavy metals contamination (Cd and Pb) in the sediment, in the water and on milkfish. We compare collected data with quality standar and correlate heavy metal concentration between in the water and in the sediment; in the water and on milkfish organ; and, in the sediment and on milkfish organ. In general, water quality is sufficient enough to support the life of farmed milkfish. Cd and Pb contamination level in the water lied below the quality standard of Ministry of Environment decree No. 51/2004 in the last April and July. However, the contamination exceeds the standard in the last October. The contamination in sediment lied below RNO (1981), EPA (1999) and IACD/CEDA (1997). Gills, viscera and the meat of the milkfish are contaminated with Cd and Pb, yet, still lied below the quality standard of Ministry of Environment Decree No. 51/2004. The results showed that farmed milkfish in Thousand Islands are safe to eat. We also found that the correlation of Cd and Pb contamination between water and sediment is positive. The correlation of Cd is much higher than Pb. The correlation of Cd between water and viscera as well as between sediment and viscera are the most closely related than any other organ.																	2087-9423	2085-6695				JUN	2017	9	1					235	246		10.28930/jitkt.v9i1.17938								WOS:000411129200020

The study aimed to evaluate the growth performance of broodstock candidates of tiger shrimp at different generati on (F-0 and F-1). This research was conducted at 2000 m(2)size of four ponds in Takalar Regency, South Sulawesi.. The treatment was different generations of broodstocks, which were: broodstocks originated from F-0 generation, (A) and F-1 (B). The 22.63 to 28.57 g of broodstock candidates were stocked 0.5 ind.m(-2) and then reared for 128 days. During rearing period, these shrimp were fed usingcommercial pelleted feed with content 36-38% of protein in dosage of 10-4%/body weight. Feeding frequency was applied in the morning and in the evening. Measured variables were growth, size distribution, survival rate and water quality The results indicated that the performances of these shrimps, growth, size distributions as well as survival rates between these F-0 and F-1 were not significantly different (p>0.05). The growth pattern was relatively equal between treatment during rearing period. Survival rate of tiger shrimp in this study ranged from 51.7 to 73.35%. This study have implications on the provision of superior broodstock shrimp in ponds in order to support the sustainability of shrimp seed production in hatchery.																	2087-9423	2085-6695				JUN	2017	9	1					185	199		10.28930/jitkt.v9i1.17932								WOS:000411129200016

Spatio-temporal co-occurrence of alien and native molluscs: a modelling approach using physical-chemical predictors	AQUATIC INVASIONS												The invasion of alien species can have serious economic and ecological impacts. Ecologically, invasions often lead to an increased rate of native species replacement and decreased biodiversity. A critical step in the dominance of alien species is their successful co-occurrence with native species. In this study, we assessed the occurrence of alien molluscs and their co-occurrence with native molluscs and identified the determining physical-chemical variables. We expected that a combination of some key variables of water quality could provide suitable conditions promoting alien molluscs to occur and to co-occur with native molluscs. The analyses were based on 20-year data, collected from river systems across Flanders (Belgium). Classification Trees (CTs) were used to perform the analyses and to develop the predictive models. Based on CT models, the co-occurrence of alien and native molluscs could be reliably predicted based on physical-chemical variables. However, there was insufficient data to determine the environmental conditions in which alien taxa dominate. From the past to the present, spatial co-occurrence significantly increased. Sinuosity, ammonium and nitrate concentrations, chemical oxygen demand, pH and conductivity were the key determining variables. Our findings suggest that the co-occurrence of alien and native molluscs mainly occurs in straight rivers with good chemical water quality. These results provide insights into the ecology and behaviour of alien species which could support management practices and priority setting for conservation planning in surface waters of Flanders and Europe.																	1798-6540	1818-5487				JUN	2017	12	2					147	158		10.3391/ai.2017.12.2.03								WOS:000406481300003

D.			The effect of oxygen saturation on the growth and feed conversion of juvenile Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.)	AQUACULTURE												In land-based fish farms, water quality can be controlled to support maximum growth and good feed conversion. Oxygen is an important water quality parameter in aquaculture and the objective of this study was to detect the range of oxygen saturations that maximizes growth of juvenile Atlantic cod. The fish ( initial body mass 21.9 g) were reared at five different levels of oxygen saturation: 65%, 81%, 103%, 121% and 150% of air saturation, for 98 days. At oxygen saturation under 100%, the growth of the fish decreased linearly with progressively lower oxygen saturation with the final body mass of fish reared at 65% saturation being 24% lower than that of fish reared at 103% saturation. The final body mass of fish reared at 150% saturation was significantly higher ( 7%) than that of fish reared at 103% saturation. Feed intake was also affected by oxygen saturation and was proportional to growth while the feed conversion ratio was not significantly affected by oxygen levels. The results suggest that oxygen saturation of at least 100% is required to obtain maximum growth of juvenile Atlantic cod.

Long-term dynamics of a high-latitude coral reef community at Sodwana Bay, South Africa	CORAL REEFS												Dynamics in reef cover, mortality and recruitment success of a high-latitude coral community in South Africa were studied over 20 yr with the aim to detect the effects of climate change. Coral communities at this locality are the southernmost on the African continent, non-accretive, attain high biodiversity and are dominated by soft corals. Long-term monitoring within fixed transects on representative reef was initiated in 1993 and has entailed annual photo-quadrat surveys and hourly temperature logging. Although sea temperatures rose by 0.15 A degrees C p.a. at the site up to 2000, they have subsequently been decreasing, and the overall trend based on monthly means has been a significant decrease of 0.03 A degrees C p.a. Despite this, minor bleaching was encountered in the region during the 1998 El Nio-Southern Oscillation event, again in the summer of 2000/2001 and in 2005. A significant decreasing trend of 0.95% p.a. in soft coral cover has been evident throughout the monitoring period, attributable to significant decreases in Sinularia and Lobophytum spp. cover. In contrast, hard coral cover gradually and significantly increased up to 2005, this being largely attributable to increases in cover by Acropora spp. Recruitment success and mortality of both soft and hard corals has displayed high inter-annual variability with increasing but non-significant trends in the last 5 yr. The reduction in soft coral cover has been more consistent and greater than that of hard corals, but it is difficult at this stage to attribute this to changes in water quality, acidification-linked accretion or temperature.																	0722-4028	1432-0975				JUN	2017	36	2					369	382		10.1007/s00338-016-1531-z								WOS:000401627400002

Green algae, diatoms, and charophytes dominated in the river, which reflects regional features of agricultural activity. Species richness and algal abundance increased down the river. The Water Quality Index characterizes the quality of water down the river as medium to bad. The index of saprobity S reflects Class III water quality. The Water Ecosystem Sustainability Index (WESI) shows contamination with nutrients. According to the River Pollution Index (RPI), waters in the river have low alkalinity and low salinity, and are contaminated with nutrients. Pearson coefficients showed that water temperature plays a major role in the total species richness distribution (0.93*) and in the green algae distribution (0.89*), while cyanobacteria were stimulated also by water salinity (0.91*). Stepwise regression analysis indicated water temperature as the major regional factor that determines riverine algal diversity. Surface plots and Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) showed that salinity, nitrates, temperature, and Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) can be defined as major factors affecting algal diversity. Dendrites mark the upper site of the Warsak Dam as the source of the community species diversity. Bioindication methods can give relevant and stable results of water quality and self-purification assessment that can be employed to monitor the regional water quality.																	1730-413X	1897-3191				JUN	2017	46	2					140	153		10.1515/ohs-2017-0015								WOS:000402628100002

A particle-tracking technique for spatial and temporal interpolation of satellite images applied to Lake Superior chlorophyll measurements	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Ocean color satellite-derived estimates of water properties are generally discontinuous in spatial and temporal coverage due to cloud cover. We describe a novel method for providing an estimate of continuous distribution of a satellite-derived water property, chlorophyll concentration in Lake Superior. The method uses calculated wind-driven lake circulation from a hydrodynamic model to estimate the evolution of the chlorophyll concentration field between available imagery. This new technique considers hydrodynamic effects by integrating a property-carrying particle model (PCPM) and an Eulerian concentration remapping approach. The PCPM interpolation method uses computational tracer particles that move with the calculated lake currents to represent the chlorophyll field. The concentration associated with each particle is dynamically adjusted toward the satellite-derived chlorophyll field at times and locations where imagery is available and produces a spatially and temporally continuous estimate of the chlorophyll concentration field. One of the important characteristics revealed from the analysis is the seasonally-dependent and region-specific chlorophyll concentration, which is significantly controlled by seasonal hydrodynamic conditions in Lake Superior. Analysis suggests that without adding extra sampling cost, moving a few sampling locations from offshore water to sample the embayments and southern coasts can provide more accurate characterization of the spatial pattern of chlorophyll concentration in Lake Superior. Furthermore, we found that Lake Superior chlorophyll concentrations do not appear to have changed significantly over the past 12 years and likely only slightly or not at all over the last 50 years, which differs from that in the other upper Great Lakes.

Assessing the status of sediment toxicity and macroinvertebrate communities in the Eighteenmile Creek Area of Concern, New York	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												In 1972, the governments of Canada and the United States committed to restoring the physical, chemical, and biological integrity of the Laurentian Great Lakes under the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. Through this framework, the downstream-most section of Eighteenmile Creek, a tributary to the south shore of Lake Ontario in New York, was designated as an Area of Concern (AOC) because water quality and bed sediments were contaminated by past industrial and municipal discharges, waste disposal, and pesticide usage. Five beneficial use impairments (BUls) have been identified in the AOC including the degradation of the "benthos", or the benthic macroinvertebrate community. This investigation used sediment toxicity testing and macroinvertebrate community assessments to determine if the toxicity of bed sediments in the AOC differed from that of an unimpacted reference stream. Results from 10-day toxicity tests indicated that survival and growth of the dipteran Chironomus dilutus and the amphipod Hyalella azteca did not differ significantly between sediments from the AOC and reference area. Analyses of benthic macroinvertebrate community integrity and structure also indicated that macroinvertebrate communities, while impacted across most sites on both streams, were generally similar between the AOC and reference area. Despite these findings, the upstream-most AOC site consistently scored poorly in all analyses, which suggests that localized sediment toxicity may exist in the AOC, even if large scale differences between the AOC and a comparable reference stream are minimal.

To quantify microbial loads and to determine probable sources of elevated E. coli levels, water and sediment samples were collected from both beaches during swimming season 2011. Sources of fecal pollution were assessed using multiple molecular markers: human-associated Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron alpha 1-6 mannanase (B. theta), bovine-associated Bacteroides (BoBac), human adeno-viruses (HAdVs), and bovine adenoviruses (BAdVs). Fecal indicator bacteria (E. coli and enterococci) were also monitored. In Singing Bridge Beach, 50% of water samples (n = 78) exceeded the recreational water quality guidelines for E. coli, while in Whites Beach all water samples met the E. coli standard. B. theta, BoBac, HAdVs, and BAdVs were detected in both beaches indicating influence of multiple sources of contamination. Cell culture assays indicated six water samples from Singing Bridge Beach and seven water samples from Whites Beach contained infectious viruses. Both frequency and concentrations of B. theta and BoBac were higher in sediment samples than in water samples. Elevated BoBac as compared with B. theta in water and sediment samples in both beaches, which are located in a watershed characterized as intensely farmed, suggest that runoff from agricultural areas was one of the probable dominant pollution sources. This study demonstrates that Bacteroides markers used in combination with land use information may help to characterize impacted beaches in mixed watersheds and design management plans.

J	Brothers, S; Vadeboncoeur, Y; Sibley, P				Brothers, Soren; Vadeboncoeur, Yvonne; Sibley, Paul			A decline in benthic algal production may explain recent hypoxic events in Lake Erie's central basin	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Since the late 1990s, the central basin of Lake Erie has reputedly experienced an increase in the frequency and severity of hypoxic events. However, total phosphorus (TP) loading, in-lake TP concentrations, chlorophyll a (Chl a), and sediment oxygen demand (SOD) have all declined in the central basin since the 1970s. Water clarity in this basin has declined from the 1970s to 2000s despite the invasion of dreissenid mussels around 1990. In shallow lakes, declines in benthic primary production (PP) can generate positive feedback loops between the internal loading of nutrients/dissolved organic carbon and hypoxic/anoxic conditions in the water column. Such a hypoxia-inducing mechanism driven by declines in benthic PP has not been explored in Lake Erie. To test if a decline in benthic PP might explain hypoxic events in the central basin of Lake Erie, we calculated the inter-decadal changes in benthic and planktonic algal production in this basin from the 1970s to the 2000s. Primary production models using water column Chl a concentrations and light attenuation indicated that benthic PP represents roughly 10% of the basin's total areal PP. However, our calculations show that bentliic PP declined from approximately 540 to 200 g C/m(2) y since the 1970s. We propose that a decline in benthic PP may have played a key mechanistic role in the transition from externally-induced hypoxia (i.e. watershed nutrient loading fueling phytoplankton production) in the 1970s and 80s to internally-induced hypoxia (sediment resuspension and internal loading) since the late 1990s.

J	Francoeur, SN				Francoeur, Steven N.			Stimulation of Saginaw Bay charophyte photosynthesis by phosphorus	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Like many other benthic algae, charophytes can attain high abundance in shallow waters, thereby affecting benthic ecology and nutrient cycling, and their subsequent death, detachment, and shoreline deposition contribute to beach fouling within the Laurentian Great Lakes. In-situ nutrient enrichment experiments and stoichiometric analyses have shown that other types of Great Lakes benthic algae are frequently phosphorus (P)-limited, but comparable information is lacking for charophytes. This study coupled short-term P enrichment of charophytes collected from inner Saginaw Bay with fluorometric estimates of algal photosynthesis to assess potential nutrient limitation. Benthic irradiance at the experimental sites was frequently sufficient to saturate charophyte photosynthesis, and charophyte photosynthesis was stimulated by experimental P enrichment, suggesting that these algae were P -limited under natural conditions. Reduction of P loading may be an effective charophyte control measure, even in relatively light-poor and nutrient-rich areas of the Great Lakes.

Ontogenetic dietary shifts and bioaccumulation of diphenhydramine in Mugil cephalus from an urban estuary	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Though bioaccumulation of pharmaceuticals has received attention in inland waters, studies of pharmaceutical bioaccumulation in estuarine and marine systems are limited. Further, an understanding of pharmaceutical bioaccumulation across size classes of organisms displaying ontogenetic feeding shifts is lacking. We selected the striped mullet, Mugil cephalus, a euryhaline and eurythermal species that experiences dietary shifts with age, to identify whether a model base, diphenhydramine, accumulated in a tidally influenced urban bayou. We further determined whether diphenhydramine accumulation differed among size classes of striped mullet over a two year study period. Stable isotope analysis identified that ontogenetic feeding shifts of M. cephalus occurred from juveniles to adults. However, bioaccumulation of diphenhydramine did not significantly increase across age classes of M. cephalus but corresponded to surface water levels of the pharmaceutical, which suggests inhalational uptake to diphenhydramine was more important for bioaccumulation than dietary exposure in this urban estuary.

Due to the restrictions on water use, production systems are becoming increasingly more intensive, raising concerns about the production water quality. Macrobrachium amazonicum is among the freshwater prawn species with favorable characteristics for production and possibility of intensification. Nitrogen compounds such as ammonia and nitrite affect the health of aquatic organisms since they quickly reach toxic concentrations. These compounds can also cause damage to the gill structure, leading to hypoxia in tissues, affecting acid-base balance, osmoregulation (salt absorption) and ammonia excretion, decreasing the immune capacity of the animal and, in extreme cases, cause death. The aim of this study was to assess histological changes in the gills of Macrobrachium amazonicum juveniles subjected to different concentrations of total ammonia and nitrite. The prawns were subjected to different concentrations of those compounds and their gills were removed and preserved for histological analysis. The gills were assessed for changes according to the Organ Index (I-org and, for each change, an importance factor (w) was attributed according to the degree of reversibility and applied according to the degree of extension or frequency of the damage. The damage to the gills in the treatments with 100% mortality, both for ammonia and nitrite, corresponded to the high occurrence of progressive, regressive, circulatory, and inflammation damages. The other treatments (which caused less mortality) had mainly inflammation and regressive damages, whose occurrence increased according to the increase in ammonia and nitrite concentration. The histological analysis confirmed that the higher the total ammonia and nitrite concentrations, the larger the damages caused to the gill structure and that lower nitrite concentrations caused similar damages to those caused by higher total ammonia concentrations, which reflects the lower capacity M. amazonicum has to tolerate nitrite.																	0166-445X	1879-1514				JUN	2017	187						115	123		10.1016/j.aquatox.2017.04.003								WOS:000401876700014	28410472					
J	Zhang, XF; Tang, YL; Jeppesen, E; Liu, ZW				Zhang, Xiufeng; Tang, Yali; Jeppesen, Erik; Liu, Zhengwen			Biomanipulation-induced reduction of sediment phosphorus release in a tropical shallow lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Biomanipulation via fish regulation combined with submerged plant introduction is an effective measure to restore eutrophic shallow lakes. Improved water quality and clarity promote growth of benthic algae, which with submerged plants may limit sediment phosphorus (P) release, thereby reinforce lake recovery. Our study sought to evaluate the effect of such a biomanipulation on water quality, benthic algal development and sediment P release in a shallow, tropical lake by (1) comparing porewater and lake water quality, light intensity and benthic algal development in restored and unrestored sections; (2) conducting a P-32 radiotracer experiment to track P release from sediment cores sampled from both sections. The biomanipulation led to lower total P, total dissolved P, and soluble reactive P concentrations in lake water, lower phytoplankton biomass, and increased light intensity at sediment surface, stimulating benthic algal development. Moreover, sediment P-32 release was lower in the restored than unrestored section. Concurrently, dissolved oxygen levels in upper layers of the sediment cores were higher in the restored section. Our study indicates that the biomanipulation improved water quality and enhanced growth of benthic algae, thereby reducing sediment P release, which may be one of the main mechanisms to create successful restoration.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2017	794	1					49	57		10.1007/s10750-016-3079-x								WOS:000401474400004						
J	Tonetta, D; Staehr, PA; Petrucio, MM				Tonetta, Denise; Staehr, Peter Anton; Petrucio, Mauricio Mello			Changes in CO2 dynamics related to rainfall and water level variations in a subtropical lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We investigated the implications of low rainfall and reduced water level for changes in nutrients and chlorophyll-a in a subtropical lake, and how these changes affected levels and atmospheric fluxes of CO2. Based on nine consecutive years of monthly monitoring of pH, alkalinity, oxygen, and temperature, we calculated the pCO(2) and CO2 flux and related these to environmental drivers. Variations in annual rainfall, with extreme low levels along 2012-2014 caused the water level to decrease up to 1 m. Low water levels were associated with higher concentrations of chlorophyll-a and organic carbon as well as reduced water transparency. Under these conditions, pCO(2) increased and the lake was predominantly a source of CO2 to the atmosphere. Applying a generalized linear model, we found that water temperature, water column stability, and water level were linked to pCO(2). The influences of predicted regional changes in rainfall associated with low water levels will according to our model further deteriorate the water quality and enhance CO2 emissions from the lake to the atmosphere.

Knowledge of patterns of macrophyte space occupation and time to recovery is poor and mostly restricted to free floating species or riparian vegetation. Here we use pre- and post-impact monitoring data over 20 years showing the evolution of submersed aquatic vegetation of lake Baciver (Pyrenees), and develop models to infer space occupation and time to recovery. We use pre-impact macrophyte distribution in relation to bathymetry-derived data to fit logistic models to further simulate lake equilibrium scenarios. Depth and slope were found to be the best predictors, and models suggested that an assemblage dominated by Sparganium angustifolium was, at time of this study, over 95% of its potential distribution area. A dense, newly grown monospecific Isoetes lacustris population occupied < 10% of its potential area and model projections suggest that it will take decades to recover. An I. lacustris residual population remains below the estimated depth threshold for survival and is bound to disappear. The lake appears to evolve towards a new steady-state where the current lake hypsography promotes the expansion of algae (Nitella sp.) over angiosperms.

The effect of channelization on the biological quality of lowland streams using macroinvertebrates as proxies	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We studied whether and how channelization affects macroinvertebrate communities and biological quality in lowland streams of Estonia (Northern Europe). Two datasets of semi-quantitative samples (collected during 2001-2010) were used: (1) pairwise data (natural sites located upstream of the channelized sites; 22 streams, 24 pairs), and (2) background data (73 natural sites from 62 streams, 73 channelized sites from 62 streams). The mean stream order in both datasets was 3. Channelization had no significant effects on physicochemical parameters or on macroinvertebrates in the pairwise dataset where channelization was done decades earlier. However, it had several negative effects on macroinvertebrates in the background dataset where several areas had probably been maintained more recently. Richness of sensitive data, Shannon diversity, mean sensitivity, organic pollution index, and multimetric quality were significantly lower for the modified sites than for the natural sites. Only total taxon richness and score of hydromorphology were not significantly affected by channelization. Thus, several macroinvertebrate metrics that indicate water pollution, proved to be sensitive to channelization as well. The recovery conditions (such as stream type, channelization season, recovering duration, etc.) have been poorly studied and would deserve further attention.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2017	794	1					167	177		10.1007/s10750-017-3091-9								WOS:000401474400012						
J	Townsend, SA; Douglas, MM				Townsend, Simon A.; Douglas, Michael M.			Discharge-driven flood and seasonal patterns of phytoplankton biomass and composition of an Australian tropical savannah river	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Discharge is a primary determinant of river phytoplankton, but its influence can be mediated by climate, water quality and catchment development. The relationship between discharge and phytoplankton over seasonal and flood temporal scales was examined for the Daly River in the Australian tropical savannah. Phytoplankton, water quality and hydrographic data were collected over the high-discharge wet season and lower-discharge dry season. Wet season main channel river conditions were unfavourable for phytoplankton growth. Floods, however, connected the main channel to off-channel water bodies that supplied phytoplankton, predominately Cryptomonas, to the river. Wet season phytoplankton biovolume and cell concentrations were higher than in the dry season and comprised the majority of the annual phytoplankton biomass load. High discharges served to both temporally connect the river to off-channel phytoplankton sources as well as dilute these sources. In the dry season, the Daly River was groundwater-fed and disconnected from off-channel phytoplankton sources and dominated by a potamoplanktonic population of Cryptomonas and Peridinium. River phytoplankton were determined by the seasonal discharge regime which drove water quality and underpinned a shift from highly productive, spatially extensive off-channel sources in the wet season to less productive more spatially confined in-channel sources in the dry season.

J	Carrie, R; Dobson, M; Barlow, J				Carrie, Rachael; Dobson, Michael; Barlow, Jos			Challenges using extrapolated family-level macroinvertebrate metrics in moderately disturbed tropical streams: a case-study from Belize	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Family-level biotic metrics were originally designed to rapidly assess gross organic pollution effects, but came to be regarded as general measures of stream degradation. Improvements in water quality in developed countries have reignited debate about the limitations of family-level taxonomy to detect subtle change, and is resulting in a shift back towards generic and species-level analysis to assess smaller effects. Although the scale of pollution characterizing past condition of streams in developed countries persists in many developing regions, some areas are still considered to be only moderately disturbed. We sampled streams in Belize to investigate the ability of family-level macroinvertebrate metrics to detect change in stream catchments where less than 30% of forest had been cleared. Where disturbance did not co-vary with natural gradients of change, and in areas characterized by low intensity activities, none of the metrics tested detected significant change, despite evidence of environmental impacts. We highlight the need for further research to clarify the response of metrics to disturbance over a broader study area that allows replication for confounding sources of natural variation. We also recommend research to develop more detailed understanding of the taxonomy and ecology of Neotropical macroinvertebrates to improve the robustness of metric use.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2017	794	1					257	271		10.1007/s10750-017-3100-z								WOS:000401474400017						
J	Piepho, M				Piepho, Maike			Assessing maximum depth distribution, vegetated area, and production of submerged macrophytes in shallow, turbid coastal lagoons of the southern Baltic Sea	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Submerged macrophytes improve water quality in shallow coastal lagoons but eutrophication often resulted in a degradation of macrophytes. Management measures that protect and restore macrophyte stands require knowledge on what limits macrophyte distribution. Information on macrophyte production and distribution in the Darss-Zingst Bodden Chain (southern Baltic Sea) is lacking since an almost complete loss of submerged vegetation in the 1980s. Nutrient input was reduced in the 1990s and macrophytes seem to recover, although turbidity is high and light conditions are still poor. However, this recovery raised hope that returning macrophytes could stabilize sediments and improve water clarity. In this study, seasonal changes in photosynthesis-irradiance curves of selected macrophyte species were used to calculate potential primary production in different depths and turbidity situations. Bathymetry of the area is then used to assess depth distribution and vegetated area. Since the so-calculated depth limits correspond well with the actual depth distribution in the field, macrophyte depth distribution is concluded to be mostly determined by light conditions. Most macrophytes grow in very shallow areas up to 50 cm depth where also 70% of potential primary production takes place. Present light conditions do not support a further expansion of macrophyte distribution in the DZBC.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2017	794	1					303	316		10.1007/s10750-017-3107-5								WOS:000401474400020

Exploiting the chance provided by the specific hybrid bigheaded carp stock in Lake Balaton (Hungary) covering the entire morphological range between the two species (including gill raker morphology), we implemented a comprehensive study (1) to reveal the feeding habits of hybrid bigheaded carps living in a mesotrophic, lacustrine habitat and (2) to assess how biotic and abiotic environmental factors and gill raker morphology affect diet composition. We found that all bigheaded carps utilized primarily zooplankton and neglected the scarce and inefficiently digestible phytoplankton, irrespective of gill raker morphology. Moreover, we observed strikingly high levels of inorganic debris consumption, but the proportion of inorganic matter in the guts was not associated directly with the concentration of suspended inorganic particles. Variance in the diet composition of bigheaded carps was related mostly to environmental factors, including the wind-induced resuspension of inorganic particles and seasonally variable availability of food resources. In conclusion, the effects of abiotic environmental factors and available food resources could overwhelm the effect of gill raker morphology in shaping the feeding habits of bigheaded carps.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2017	794	1					317	332		10.1007/s10750-017-3137-z								WOS:000401474400021

Incorporation of wastes by native species during and after an experimental aquaculture operation	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Freshwater aquaculture increases dissolved and particulate nutrients near fish cages, but the degree to which they are incorporated into tissues of native animals is uncertain. At the Experimental Lakes Area in northwestern Ontario, Canada, a cage culture of Rainbow Trout was operated seasonally for 5 y, and invertebrates and fishes were collected before, during, and after culturing from the experimental lake and a reference lake to assess changes in stable isotopes of C and N in their tissues. The feed contained marine fishmeal and was higher in C and N isotope values (delta C-13 and delta N-15) than lake biota by >= 4 parts per thousand (all taxa) and 3 parts per thousand (all invertebrates), respectively. During the aquaculture operation, delta N-15 of littoral and pelagic invertebrates, profundal chironomids, minnows, and Lake Trout (Salvelinus namaycush) increased by 2 to 5 parts per thousand relative to before aquaculture values. In the 1(st) and 2(nd) years after aquaculture, delta N-15 of several invertebrate taxa and all fishes continued to increase 1 to 2 parts per thousand/y. In contrast, during aquaculture, only minnows and trout had significant increases (up to 3 parts per thousand) in delta C-13. In the period after aquaculture, the delta C-13 of fishes, plankton, and profundal chironomids declined to below values measured before or during aquaculture. Isotopic analysis of native biota can be used to monitor assimilation of cage culture wastes in freshwater ecosystems.

Calibration of the biological condition gradient in Minnesota streams: a quantitative expert-based decision system	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												The Biological Condition Gradient (BCG) is a conceptual model that describes changes in aquatic communities with increasing levels of anthropogenic stress. The gradient represented by the BCG has been divided into 6 levels of condition that biologists consider readily discernible in most areas of North America. We developed quantitative BCG models for 7 warm-water stream types in Minnesota for both fish and macroinvertebrates. Panels of aquatic biologists calibrated the general BCG model to Minnesota streams by assigning test samples (271 macroinvertebrate and 288 fish samples) to BCG Levels 1 to 6. From the panelists' descriptions of their criteria for assigning sites to levels, a set of quantitative operational rules was developed for performing the same task. We developed a decision model based on fuzzy-set theory to account for discontinuities and to identify when BCG assignments might be intermediate between adjacent levels. This model captures the consensus professional judgment of the panel and uses panel-derived rules. Decisions based on the quantitative model for macroinvertebrates exactly matched 77% of the panel decisions, 89% within 1/2 BCG level, and 100% within 1 BCG level. Decisions based on the quantitative fish model exactly matched 70% of the panel decisions, 86% within 1/2 BCG level, and 99% within 1 BCG level. The BCG provides a tool to interpret aquatic biological condition along a gradient of naturalness and is consistent across stream types and political boundaries. It includes documentation of baselines to prevent inadvertent shifting, and the BCG logic rules are transparent, a desirable property for communicating condition, management goals, and water-quality criteria.																	2161-9549	2161-9565				JUN	2017	36	2					427	451		10.1086/691712								WOS:000401114200015						
J	Constantin, S; Constantinescu, S; Doxaran, D				Constantin, Sorin; Constantinescu, Stefan; Doxaran, David			Long-term analysis of turbidity patterns in Danube Delta coastal area based on MODIS satellite data	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												The monitoring of coastal areas is becoming an urgent necessity in the context of increased pressure over these ecosystems due to climate change and human activities. Long term evaluation of specific parameters regarding water quality can now be achieved, thanks to the increased number of archived Earth Observation satellite data, now covering decades. Within this study, 12 years of MODIS information were used to compute surface water turbidity products that were further temporal binned into composite datasets (e.g. monthly, annual). A regional algorithm, based on local in situ measurements, was used in order to inverse remote sensing reflectance values into turbidity units. The interpretation of the final maps revealed important characteristics of the processes that play a major role in the regional turbidity dynamics. Observations were made regarding the relation between surface water turbidity and Danube River's discharge rates, winds, currents and also the bottom sedimentary characteristics of the shelf area. We discuss how different regions are affected by various external factors, depending on their geographical location, and we reinforce the idea that the river solid input is not the only parameter controlling water clarity in the Danube Delta coastal area, resuspension processes playing also an important role.

The analysis covers two main groups of particles: phytoplankton and non-algal. For this purpose we use the extensive database of optical measurements acquired from 2006 to 2013 during 40 cruises of r/v Oceania in various regions of the southern Baltic: open waters, coastal waters, the Gulf of Gdansk, the Pomeranian Bay and river mouths. Expressions are derived for each of these regions to describe the seasonal variations of the dependence of the light absorption coefficients for phytoplankton a(ph)(440) and non-algal particles a(NAP)(440) on concentrations of chlorophyll a (Tchla) and suspended particulate matter in sea water (SPM). With a knowledge of these dependences, one can determine the overall absorption coefficient for all suspended particles in any part of the Baltic Sea in particular seasons from known Tchla and SPM concentrations using the relationship a(p)(440) = a(ph)(440) + a(NAP)(440) = f(Tchla, SPM). These dependences reflect the characteristics of a study area and season, and their application increases the accuracy of determination of the overall absorption properties of suspended particles and their main constituents as confirmed by statistical error reduction, e.g. standard error factor falls from 1.46 to 1.38. The relationships derived in this work can be applied in the local remote sensing algorithms used for monitoring the southern Baltic. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Decline of a giant salamander assessed with historical records, environmental DNA and multi-scale habitat data	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Freshwater species are declining rapidly but more complete data are needed for determining the extent and cause(s) of population declines and extirpations. Integrating newer survey techniques, freely available data, and traditional field work may allow for more effective assessment of population decline. We used detailed historical species records and environmental DNA (eDNA) survey methods to identify changes in population distribution of a long-lived, imperiled stream salamander, the eastern hellbender (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis alleganiensis: Cryptobranchidae). We used logistic regression with Bayesian inference to test whether selected environmental variables may be good predictors of hellbender population persistence and extirpation. Hellbenders persisted in only 42% of the 24 historical record sites. The best fit model indicated electrical conductivity (EC) was the strongest predictor of hellbender population persistence (EC<278S/cm) and extirpation. Conductivity was strongly negatively correlated with canopy cover within the total watershed (r=-0.83, n=21, p<0.001) and riparian buffer of the watershed (r=-0.77, n=21, p<0.001). Electrical conductivity tends to increase following deforestation, and may inhibit sperm motility and thus limit recruitment of hellbenders and other aquatic vertebrate species with external fertilisation. By integrating historical data, eDNA, field data, and freely available high resolution remote sensing data, our study design allowed for rapid assessment of predictors of and changes in hellbender distribution over a relatively broad geographic area. This cost- and time-effective approach may be used for evaluating other rare aquatic species.																	0046-5070	1365-2427				JUN	2017	62	6					967	976		10.1111/fwb.12917								WOS:000400571200001

To predict the consequences of river restoration, biological invasions and water quality change in the taxonomic composition of macroinvertebrate communities in rivers, we extended the mechanistic model Streambugs, which describes growth, respiration and death of interacting taxa under given environmental conditions. The model parameterised with prior knowledge on macroinvertebrate traits had already a reasonable explanatory power for data from restored and unrestored sites in two Swiss rivers. As anticipated, the explanatory power of the model was increased further by incorporation of learning from observations through Bayesian inference. The predictive application of the model to changes in water quality and invasions by alien species indicated the importance of integrative planning of management measures: although invasive species are predicted to be able to colonise restored and unrestored sites and replace native species, both invasion of alien species and subsequent exclusion of native taxa is predicted to be reduced when water quality improves. The unavoidable simplification in the mathematical description of complex interactions in the macroinvertebrate community results in predictions that are uncertain. Our modelling techniques make the best attempt to quantify this uncertainty. Despite the uncertainty that always calls for more research, this study makes a considerable step towards improving our understanding of community structure and supporting river management through mechanistic, predictive modelling of macroinvertebrate communities in rivers under changing environmental conditions.

The importance of small waterbodies for biodiversity and ecosystem services: implications for policy makers	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Small waterbodies, including ponds and small lakes, low-order streams, ditches and springs, are the most numerous freshwater environments globally, are critical for freshwater biodiversity and are increasingly recognised for their role in ecosystem service delivery. Small waters often represent the best remaining examples of intact freshwater habitats and are the most likely to remain unpolluted, often being a refuge for species which have disappeared from larger, more damaged, waterbodies. Practically all water-related ecosystem services are initially mediated by small waters and some, such as carbon cycling, may be dominated by them. Small waters are exposed to all the threats affecting larger waters, and some experienced only by small waters. Despite this, small waters remain the least investigated part of the water environment and are largely excluded from water management planning. We identify the priorities for research to underpin better protection of small waters and recommend policy actions needed to better integrate small waters into the management of catchments and landscapes. The primary requirements are to identify reliable monitoring programmes for small waters, develop effective measures to protect the biodiversity and ecosystem services they provide and ensure that regulators take full account of this critical part of the water environment.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2017	793	1					3	39		10.1007/s10750-016-3007-0								WOS:000399890800002

In this study of 165 small water bodies situated in the lowland high-productive agricultural landscape of western Poland we evaluate the effect of catchment, buffer zone, water body and water quality parameters on macrophyte functional groups (nymphaeids, elodeids, pleustophytes, helophytes) and zooplankton diversity. The potential pressure of the catchment on ponds was high (mean Ohle index 140). For macrophytes, shore length and depth of pond were highly significant and, subsequently the type of catchment and buffer, while for zooplankton, apart from water depth, trophic features of the habitat were decisive. Cluster analysis was used to identify functional types of water bodies on the basis of catchment and buffer zone attributes. Regardless of physico-geographical macroregion, water bodies of arable catchments with herbage buffer prevailed in a landscape. For protection and prevention of ecological deterioration of ponds and stability of trophic conditions the optimal situation is a buffer which is created by shrubs and trees around the pond.

J	Weigelhofer, G				Weigelhofer, Gabriele			The potential of agricultural headwater streams to retain soluble reactive phosphorus	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The study focuses on the capacity of agricultural headwater streams to retain soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP). In-stream phosphorus uptake was determined via short-term SRP additions in 14 reaches differing in channel morphology and riparian vegetation. In addition, zero equilibrium phosphorus concentrations (EPC0) were estimated for 8 reaches based on adsorption experiments. Average SRP uptake lengths amounted to 3.8 km in channelized sections, 1.9 km in forested sections, and 0.5 km in open meanders. Mass transfer coefficients were highest in open meanders (0.1 cm min(-1)), followed by forested (0.05 cm min(-1)) and channelized sections (0.04 cm min(-1)). EPC0 ranged from 20 to 1,600 A mu g SRP l(-1) and correlated positively with inorganic P and reductant-soluble P concentrations of the sediments. In 50% of the reaches, phosphorus was released from the sediments at initial water concentrations of up to 500 A mu g SRP l(-1), indicating a high release potential. Although EPC0 did not correlate with in-stream SRP uptake, sediments probably play a significant role for the P retention in agricultural headwater streams as they supply the benthic community with phosphorus from the subsurface. Thus, it is crucial that sediment-water interactions are considered in the restoration and management of agricultural headwater streams.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2017	793	1					149	160		10.1007/s10750-016-2789-4								WOS:000399890800011

Large-scale coastal land reclamation can have adverse effects on the coastal environment, including loss of marine habitats and deterioration of coastal water quality. In recent decades, coastal land reclamation has occurred extensively to meet the increasing needs of rapid economic development and urbanization in China. The overall objective of this study is to understand the coastal reclamation status of China from 1979 to 2014 and analyzed its driving factors for mitigating negative ecological effects. The data of coastal reclamation were done with the ERDAS Imagine V9.2 platform and ArcGIS software based on remote images including Landsat, SPOT, ZY-2 and ZY-3. Potential driving factors for sea reclamation were selected based on statistics bulletins and the knowledge of experts in coastal management. In order to understand the relationships among possible impact factors and coastal reclamation, the Partial Least-Squares Regression models was constructed. The analysis results indicated that the total area of reclamation was 11162.89 km(2) based on remote sensing images between 1979 and 2014. Shandong Province is the largest reclamation area, reaching 2736.54 km(2), and the reclamation is mainly concentrated in Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Liaoning, where the reclamation areas were all more than 1000 km(2). According to the remote sensing images, there are three coastal reclamation hotspot regions including Bohai bay (in which is located Liaoning, Tianjin and Hebei), Jiangsu province coastal area and Hangzhou bay (in Zhejiang province). A large scale land reclamation plan of more than 5880 km(2) has been made by local government and 2469 km(2) has approved by the State Council. From the analyzed results, there is a significant collinearity between these indicators, and no significant correlation between the area of reclamation and selected indicators. Economic development and employees in marine industries have weak positive correlation and correspondingly, the area of cultivated land (ACL) had a negative correlation. Because of the weak correlation, there is an assumption that economic development, outcome of coastal reclamation and population growth were not only was the direct driving factor, but also the outcome of coastal reclamation and population growth was not the direct driving indicator. Construction land quota and huge economic returns to local government may be the direct driving factors according to our field investigation. To resolve the contradiction between the need for land and coastal wetland conservation, it is recommended that China should establish a special management agency and coordination mechanisms, reconsidered the implementation of the reclamation plans and projects that have been approved, enhance law enforcement and increase penalties and strengthen public participation in reclamation management.

In this paper, we use a relationship between MODIS-Terra red light reflectance and total suspended solid (TSS) concentrations in order to develop a fourteen-year time period of TSS estimates during which effects of storms and land cover can be studied over a large portion of the Bay. Exponential fits were most appropriate, resulting in viable reflectance TSS relationships for the five major Western Shore rivers and the Mainstem of the Bay. Other tributaries were less well-disposed for such relationships due to lack of a large range of TSS concentrations, shallow river beds, or low number of data points. Treating the entire Chesapeake as a single entity and modeling a single reflectance-TSS relationship for the entire estuary produced poorer models with less significance compared to treating each channel separately. Over 2800 rain events were studied in the Lower Western Shore between 2000 and 2014. We found some evidence that higher rainfall amounts correspond to a lower distribution of TSS concentrations 1 day following the event in forested watersheds. At rainfall events of < 50 mm, maximum TSS within one day of the storm was highly variable, suggesting that rainfall amounts alone cannot explain variation in TSS levels. Finally, we found value in the use of prediction intervals around TSS estimates, a statistical procedure uncommonly used heretofore with satellite-based estimates but which can help to determine if results are significant or not.

Substrate origin and morphology differentially determine oxygen dynamics in two major European estuaries, the Elbe and the Schelde	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												The expansion of oxygen minimum zones (DMZ's) in estuaries can be harmful for ecology and economy, prompting the demand for expensive measures. Here we look at the oxygen dynamics in two northern temperate European estuaries, the Schelde (The Netherlands/Belgium) and the Elbe (Germany) and analysed data from the period of 2004-2009. The Schelde is characterized by two zones of increased oxygen consumption; the Elbe shows one zone of increased oxygen consumption. Despite reduction in biochemical oxygen demand in both estuaries, oxygen conditions improved in the Schelde estuary, while the oxygen minimum zone persisted in the Elbe estuary. To understand these different oxygen dynamics, we applied a one-dimensional reactive transport model to both estuaries. In the Schelde we found low oxygen concentrations to be related to organic matter and ammonium input from the major tributaries. In the Elbe, additionally to a high input of organic matter from upstream, oxygen dynamics were influenced by abrupt changes in estuarine morphology. Next, the origin of the organic matter substrate differs between the two estuaries. In the Elbe, the organic matter imported is mostly composed of algal die-off produced in the Elbe River upstream. In the Schelde the organic matter and ammonium input is mostly related to sewage input of anthropogenic origin. This implies that waste water treatment will be more effective to remediate hypoxia related problems in the Schelde than in the Elbe. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Alosairi, Y; Pokavanich, T				Alosairi, Yousef; Pokavanich, Tanuspong			Residence and transport time scales associated with Shatt Al-Arab discharges under various hydrological conditions estimated using a numerical model	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Over the last several decades, concerns in the Northwest Arabian Gulf have risen regarding water quality and ecological conditions, particularly near Kuwait. This interest is mainly attributed to the reduction of freshwater discharge and its associated constituents from the Shatt Al Arab as a result of human activities at diverse scales. From the hydrological perspective, the reduction has also resulted in alteration to the dynamic regime and related residence time and transport conditions. Using a previously well-validated three-dimensional numerical model of the Northern Arabian Gulf (NAG) (Alosairi and Pokavanich, 2017), the residence and transport conditions of numerical tracers have been assessed through a series of numerical tests. The results indicate that density-driven circulations have played a key role in reducing the residence time in the Northwest Gulf by approximately 15% to 20% compared to tidal forces only. The transport conditions correlated well with the Shatt Al Arab discharges, but they were only significant along the Kuwait coast due to counter-clockwise circulations and alongshore currents. Arrival times and mixing processes varied reasonably with the Shatt Al Arab discharges; the results exhibited the enhancement in mixing and transport with increases in discharge. Residence times in the NAG associated with Shatt Al Arab discharge displayed spatial variations, particularly in Kuwait Bay, where the residence time increased by 60 days during low discharge compared to high discharge.

J	Chazottes, V; Hutchings, P; Osorno, A				Chazottes, Veronique; Hutchings, Pat; Osorno, Alicia			Impact of an experimental eutrophication on the processes of bioerosion on the reef: One Tree Island, Great Barrier Reef, Australia	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												The components of bioerosion were investigated during ENCORE (The Effect of Nutrient Enrichment on Coral Reefs) over 2 years of controlled additions of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus. The study was carried out at One Tree Island, southern Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Rates of microbioerosion and external erosion by grazing were significantly higher at the enriched sites than at the control sites. Rates of accretion by coralline algae were also significantly higher at enriched sites. In contrast, rates of macroboring were not significantly different between enriched and control sites. This study highlights the importance of improving water quality on the reef to reduce rates of bioerosion given that quantities of dead coral substrates have recently substantially increased as a result of coral bleaching (Hughes et al., 2015) and several Crown of Thorns plagues (Fabricius et al., 2010; Death et al., 2012), on the Great Barrier Reef.

Stormwater runoff plumes in the Southern California Bight: A comparison study with SAR and MODIS imagery	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Stormwater runoff is the largest source of pollution in the Southern California Bight (SCB), resulting from untreated runoff and pollutants from urban watersheds entering the coastal waters after rainstorms. We make use of both satellite SAR and MODIS-Aqua ocean color imagery to examine two different components of runoff plumes, the surface slick and the sediment discharge. We expand on earlier satellite SAR studies by examining an extensive collection of multi-platform SAR imagery, spanning from 1992 to 2014, that provides a more comprehensive view of the plume surface slick characteristics, illustrated with distribution maps of the extent and flow direction of the plumes. The SAR-detected surface plumes are compared with coincident rain and runoff measurements, and with available measured shoreline fecal bacteria loads. We illustrate differences in the detection of SAR surface plumes with the sediment-related discharge plumes derived from MODIS imagery. A conceptual satellite stormwater runoff monitoring approach is presented. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We argue, however, that the direct negative effects on the symbiosis are not necessarily caused by the nutrient enrichment itself but by the phosphorus starvation of the algal symbionts that can be caused by skewed nitrogen (N) to phosphorus (P) ratios. We exposed corals to imbalanced N:P ratios in long-term experiments and found that the undersupply of phosphate severely disturbed the symbiosis, indicated by the loss of coral biomass, malfunctioning of algal photosynthesis and bleaching of the corals. In contrast, the corals tolerated an undersupply with nitrogen at high phosphate concentrations without negative effects on symbiont photosynthesis, suggesting a better adaptation to nitrogen limitation. Transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed that the signatures of ultrastructural biomarkers represent versatile tools for the classification of nutrient stress in symbiotic algae. Notably, high N:P ratios in the water were clearly identified by the accumulation of uric acid crystals. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Comparing different methods for fast screening of microbiological quality of beach sand aimed at rapid-response remediation	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												There is scientific evidence that beach sands are a significant contributor to the pathogen load to which visitors are exposed. To develop beach quality guidelines all beach zones must be included in microbiological evaluations, but monitoring methods for beach sand quality are relatively longstanding, expensive, laborious and require moderate laboratory infrastructure. This paper aimed to evaluate the microorganism activity in different beach zones applying and comparing a classical method of membrane filtration (MF) with two colorimetric screening methods based on fluorescein (FDA) and tetrazolium (TTC) salt biotransformation to evaluate a new rapid and low-cost method for beach sand microbiological contamination assessments. The colorimetric results can help beach managers to evaluate rapidly and at low cost the microbiological quality of different beach zones in order to decide whether remedial actions need to be adopted to prevent exposure of the public to microbes due to beach sand and/or water contamination.

However, some projects focus on a single impact on hydrodynamic conditions, water quality or marine organisms. In a case study in Xiamen, China, an integrated effects assessment framework centres on ecohydrology, using modeling of hydrodynamic conditions and statistical analysis of water quality, was developed to assess the effects of ecological restoration projects. The benefits of SDADO projects include improving hydrodynamic conditions and water quality, as a precursor to further marine biological improvements. This study highlights the need to comprehensively consider ecological effects of SDADO projects in the planning stage, and an integrative assessment method combining cumulative effects of hydrodynamic conditions, water quality and biological factors.

Milne Edwards, 1854)) on submersed macrophytes'	AQUATIC BOTANY					2nd International Symposium of Aquatic Plant Biology (MACROPHYTE)	OCT 27-31, 2014	Wuhan, PEOPLES R CHINA					The Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis (H. Milne Edwards, 1854)), is a highly invasive species and poses a great threat to endemic species and infrastructure in Europe and North America. Although it is partly herbivorous and prefers to live in lakes with abundant submersed macrophytes, little is known about its effect on macrophytes. We used its native range, the mid-lower Yangtze Basin where the species has been cultured intensively for decades, as our study site to test the hypotheses that (1) high crab densities weaken the positive feedback between macrophytes and water transparency, and that (2) the effects of crabs become apparent only on decadal timescales and (3) are density dependent. We used correlative analyses based on 12 years of monitoring and multi-lake comparisons among 20 sub-areas in 4 lakes. High crab densities were found to cause negative effects on submersed macrophytes and transparency, and to weaken the positive relation between macrophytes and transparency. High densities of macrophytes showed resilience to disturbance from crabs. This resilience, however, reduced with continuous presence of high crab densities. Crab densities were strongly positively related with total phosphorus and negatively with transparency and total nitrogen. Phosphorus concentrations and transparency were not related with phytoplankton chlorophyll a, suggesting that crab's bioturbation strongly influences water quality. The apparent resilience of the dense macrophyte stands should however, not delay attempts to eradicate the crab where it is invasive as this becomes more difficult once they have become established. When macrophyte abundance is already low at the time of invasion, immediate loss of macrophytes may occur. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We applied ensemble modelling to study the hydrodynamic and thermal behaviour of the Mediterranean reservoir of Bimont (France). We used a single-model ensemble composed of three realizations of the same hydrodynamic model (Dynamic Reservoir Simulation Model, DYRESM) with different calibration parameter values as follows: 1) default parameter values, 2) parameter values obtained by manual calibration, and 3) parameter values corresponding to the best performing member of a set of behavioural parameter sets obtained using the GLUE (Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation) method. The results confirmed the good performance of the ensemble average for lake water temperature simulations. A loss of signal was present because of the smoothing induced by model averaging, especially for the simulation of surface temperature. Single ensembles are a good alternative to obtain consistently better simulation results in hydrodynamic simulations, as well as providing a qualitative estimation of uncertainty. However, awareness of its limitations is necessary when interpreting the results.																	0213-8409	1989-1806				MAY	2017	36	1					1	14		10.23818/limn.36.01								WOS:000404325000001

Understanding the dominant processes shaping eutrophication processes is crucial to sustainable water management in lake catchments. The aim of the study was to determine the importance of elements of lake-catchment system structures in the processes of shaping lake water quality. The values of loads delivered to the lake basins from their catchments as well as nutrient output were calculated on the basis of stream discharge and nutrient concentration. A range of hydro-chemical influences of each stream was presented by means of a range of a radius. A model of nutrient transport (prepared in GIS software) was used in the catchment of a lake without tributaries. Additionally, phytoplankton abundance and water quality indices were calculated. The results showed a clear pattern for the following lakes, Syczynskie > Pniowno > Chuteckie > Tarnowskie, in terms of nutrient load as well as water quality. The hydrochemical influence of lake tributaries was determined by runoff processes, which reflected catchment geology, relief, and flushing time. The Q index showed a good ecological status for lakes Chuteckie and Tarnowskie, moderate for Lake Pniowno, and poor for Lake Syczynskie.

Application of taxonomic and morpho-functional properties of phytoplankton communities to water quality assessment for artificial lakes in the Mediterranean Ecoregion(aEuro)	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Starting in September 2010, a monitoring program was developed for evaluating the water quality in six artificial lakes (reservoirs) of the Apulia Region (Southern Italy). Lake ecological status was evaluated according to the requirements of the 2000/60/EC Water Framework Directive. Phytoplankton taxonomic composition, biovolume and chlorophyll a data were used in an application of the Italian methods (Italian Phytoplankton Assessment Method or New Italian Method) for water quality assessment of artificial lakes. Even though all the reservoirs were classified as being in good ecological status, the phytoplankton communities of the six reservoirs were different and characterized by highly site-specific components and by distinctive dominant taxa. The influences of environmental variables on the phytoplankton communities were analyzed. Results of Constrained Coordinate Analysis (CCA) indicated strong influences of the trophic gradient and water depth on the phytoplankton assemblages, but significant factors are also the surrounding landscape and the origin and the history of the lakes. A functional traits-based analysis was carried out to support the water quality assessment tools. Twenty-one morpho-functional groups were identified. Most of them were common in all six lakes, so functional properties clearly recur among different phytoplankton species.																	0142-7873	1464-3774				MAY-JUN	2017	39	3					550	563		10.1093/plankt/fbx011								WOS:000402613800015

Six groups were established and fed the same plant-based feed containing 20 or 30% crude protein: two groups in clear water conditions with no added carbon source, two biofloc groups given a wheat milling by-product (WMB) as additional carbon source and two biofloc groups given rice bran (RB). The results showed that biofloc volume was higher when WMB was used as carbon source. The highest growth performance were obtained with the biofloc system and the higher dietary protein level. Fish fed 20% crude protein and stocked in WMB biofloc significantly outperformed the fish fed 30% crude protein and stocked in clear water. Significant improvements in hematocrit, white blood cells, lymphocytes, plasma proteins, and humoral (immunoglobulin, lysozyme, myeloperoxidase and ACH(50)) and cellular (phagocytosis activity and respiratory burst) immune parameters were observed in all BET fish. BFT also increased superoxide dismutase and catalase activities. Moreover, the fish fed 20% dietary protein and reared in both biofloc conditions showed equal or superior levels of the immunological criteria to fish fed 30% protein in clear water conditions. In conclusion, using WMB as carbon source could make up for a reduction in dietary protein levels of 10% and improve growth performance, and the immune and antioxidant status of O. niloticus.

The OLR clearly influenced both sponge pore water quality and relative flagellates and ciliates (free-swimming, carnivorous, crawling, and stalked protozoa) abundances in the retained sludge. Immediately after the OLR was increased from 1.05 to 1.97 kg chemical oxygen demand (COD) m(-3) day(-1), COD and NH4+-N treatment efficiencies both deteriorated, and relative flagellates and ciliates abundances then increased from 2-8 % to 51-65 % total cells in the middle-bottom part of the DHS reactor. In a continuous operation at a stable OLR (2.01 kg COD m(-3) day(-1)), effluent water quality improved, and relative flagellates and ciliates abundances decreased to 15-46 % total cells in the middle-bottom part of the DHS reactor. This result may indicate that flagellates and ciliates preferentially graze on dispersed bacteria, thus, stabilizing effluent water quality. Additionally, to investigate eukaryotic community structure, clone libraries based on the 18S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene of the retained sludge were constructed. The predominant group was Nucletmycea phylotypes, representing approximately 29-56 % total clones. Furthermore, a large proportion of the clones had < 97 % sequence identity in the NCBI database. This result indicates that phylogenetically unknown eukaryotes were present in the DHS reactor. These results provide insights into eukaryotic community shift in the DHS reactor treating domestic sewage.																	0095-3628	1432-184X				MAY	2017	73	4					801	814		10.1007/s00248-016-0871-0								WOS:000401565700005	27796418

Coastal marshes provide flood abatement, carbon and nutrient sequestration, water quality maintenance, and habitat for fish, shellfish, and wildlife, including species of concern, such as the saltmarsh sparrow (Ammodramus caudacutus). We present a climate change adaptation strategy (CCAS) adopted by scientific, management, and policy stakeholders for managing coastal marshes and enhancing system resiliency. A common adaptive management approach previously used for restoration projects was modified to identify climate-related vulnerabilities and plan climate change adaptive actions. As an example of implementation of the CCAS, we describe the stakeholder plans and management actions the US Fish and Wildlife Service and partners developed to build coastal resiliency in the Narrow River Estuary, RI, in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy. When possible, an experimental BACI (before-after, control-impact) design, described as pre- and post-sampling at the impact site and one or more control sites, was incorporated into the climate change adaptation and implementation plans.

Changes in shallow-reef community composition along environmental gradients on the East African coast	MARINE BIOLOGY												Abiotic determinants of community composition on shallow reefs are seldom examined at a scale transcending biogeographic regions, and knowledge for the western Indian Ocean is sparse. To address this deficit, turnover in reef community composition was quantified, using gradient forest analyses, along gradients of nine abiotic variables collected in situ or via remote sensing at 54 sites across and within three bioregions: Tropical Western Indian Ocean (Tropical WIO), Delagoa and Natal, spanning 4800 km of east African coastline (5.2-31.1 degrees S). All oceanographic variables differed significantly among bioregions. At a scale across bioregions, wave height declined northwards, while temperature increased. Values for suspended inorganic sediments, chlorophyll-a concentration [chl-a], turbidity and nutrients were all lowest in Delagoa, in association with the scarcity of rivers there. The most novel and unexpected finding was that the northwards decline in wave action was more strongly associated with changes in community composition across bioregions than any other variable. Temperature was the second-most important variable at that scale. Within bioregions, temperature and [chl-a] had strongest relationships with community composition in the Tropical WIO. By contrast, in Delagoa, reef profile, susceptibility to sand inundation and reef heterogeneity were most strongly associated with community composition; and in Natal, depth, turbidity and suspended sediment were foremost. Variables of greatest importance within bioregions distilled to (1) those influencing food/energy supply ([chl-a], turbidity, depth and suspended sediments), which were of particular importance in the Tropical WIO and Natal bioregions, and (2) those altering sand inundation and small-scale current dynamics of reefs (profile, heterogeneity and depth), which were leading factors in the Delagoa Bioregion.																	0025-3162	1432-1793				MAY	2017	164	5							101	10.1007/s00227-017-3130-0								WOS:000399218700005

Macrophyte beds in a subtropical reservoir shifted from a nutrient sink to a source after drying then rewetting	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Macrophytes play a key role in assimilating and storing nutrients in shallow aquatic ecosystems, but their capacity to act as a long-term nutrient sink can be affected by water level fluctuations. Water level drawdown in reservoirs followed by rewetting may mobilise a significant nutrient pool. These nutrients can be stored in the littoral zone in dead or dormant macrophytes, and in the desiccated sediments within the macrophyte beds. However, the contribution of desiccated macrophyte beds to nutrient release upon rewetting has not been well quantified. 2. Our study examined the effect of rewetting the previously desiccated waterlily Nymphoides indica (Menyanthaceae) in treatments (1) without sediments (N.i.-Sed), and (2) with sediments in N. indica beds (N.i.+Sed) on water quality. 3. We found that longer drying duration increased dissolved nutrients (nitrate/nitrite, ammonium and total dissolved organic nitrogen/phosphorus) and organic carbon release from N.i.+Sed and N.i.-Sed treatments after rewetting. In the N.i.+Sed treatment with <4 weeks of desiccation, all N. indica plants regenerated from roots after subsequent rewetting. In addition, the resulting nutrient/carbon release was not significantly different to the control treatment which did not have desiccation. A significant increase in dissolved nutrient and carbon concentrations in the water column was found in treatments with more than 10 weeks of desiccation followed by rewetting. This coincided with the sediment reaching its minimum moisture content. Furthermore, chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentrations in the overlying water also increased with more than 10 weeks of desiccation, presumably in response to the increased nutrient availability and the removal of competition for nutrients from macrophytes. 4. On the basis of our laboratory experiments, we calculated the potential effect of desiccated and rewetted N. indica beds on water quality in a local N. indica-dominated reservoir after water level drawdown. We also separated the contribution of N. indica plants from their macrophyte beds on water quality changes. Fourteen days after rewetting, the total dissolved nutrients released from N. indica alone (N.i.-Sed) could contribute 0.5% of the total nitrogen and 29% of total phosphorus to the water column concentrations in the whole reservoir. In contrast, N. indica beds (N.i.+Sed) contributed more total dissolved nitrogen (4.3%) but less total dissolved phosphorus (0.3%) release into the water column. The higher nitrogen release for the N.i.+Sed treatment was likely due to the organic matter decomposition in the sediment in macrophyte beds. In contrast, the less dissolved phosphorus release, compared with the N. indica alone, was likely the result of phosphate adsorption by previously desiccated soil particles and/or assimilation by phytoplankton, since the phytoplankton biomass (as measured by Chl-a concentrations) was significantly higher in the N.i.+Sed treatment. 5. This study highlights the importance of managing both the duration and rate of water level drawdown in reservoirs to prevent rooted macrophytes, like N. indica, from becoming a source of nutrients, which may cause deterioration in water quality.

In-stream nitrate removal capacity may be used as a proxy for the ecosystem service of water quality regulation. It is well known that this natural function is driven by abiotic and biotic factors in running water environments. With regard to biotic drivers, most of the literature focuses on the microbial community influences, but there has been very little emphasis on the relationship with the benthic macroinvertebrate community. Since this community feeds on microbial assemblages (autotrophic and/or heterotrophic biofilms) that live on the streambed and in the hyporheic zone of the river, macroinvertebrates also have the potential to influence nitrate removal via its influences on microbiological processes. 2. The objective of this study was to examine the potential relationship between the macroinvertebrate communities and nitrate removal. A dataset of in-stream nitrate removal rates measured in nine-third-order streams was analysed. The simultaneous influences of abiotic (hydromorphological, physical and chemical characteristics) and biotic (biofilm and macroinvertebrate) drivers were examined and together explained 56% of the in-stream nitrate removal variance. An analysis of the independent contributions of each driver showed that abiotic drivers (e.g. ammonium, dissolved organic carbon, temperature and transient zone) contributed 40% of this nitrate removal variance, whereas the macroinvertebrate community contributed 39%. 3. The potential relationship between macroinvertebrates and nitrate removal was subsequently explored using trait-based approaches of the macroinvertebrate community. This method allows for the selection of trait modalities assuming a top-down control of microbial communities by macroinvertebrates, with in-stream abiotic conditions correlated with nitrate removal (assuming that environmental conditions affect macroinvertebrate community composition). 4. The main trait modalities positively correlated with nitrate removal were scraper (feeding habit), flagstones/boulders/cobbles/pebbles (substrate preference), crawler and interstitial (locomotion) and detritus (food). The main modalities negatively correlated with nitrate removal were silt and mud with microphytes (as substrate preference), and with fine sediment with microorganisms, and dead animals (as food sources). These results agreed with the hypothesis of top-down control and enhanced understanding of the influence of hydromorphological factors on nitrate removal. 5. This study highlights the involvement of the macroinvertebrate community in in-stream nitrate processing, and demonstrates the usefulness of applying a functional approach to explain relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem function.				sauvage, sabine/P-1742-2015; Solimini, Angelo/C-9290-2018; Marti, Eugenia/J-9146-2012; Puig, Maria Angeles/A-4485-2013	sauvage, sabine/0000-0002-6360-1036; Marti, Eugenia/0000-0002-6910-4874; Puig, Maria Angeles/0000-0003-0997-3055; Morais, Manuela/0000-0003-0482-4309; Sabater, Francesc/0000-0001-6767-231X; COLAS, FANNY/0000-0002-5485-6715												0046-5070	1365-2427				MAY	2017	62	5					929	944		10.1111/fwb.12913								WOS:000398592200009

The 3D ecological model ERGOM was validated and applied in a local set-up of the Kattegat, Denmark, using the off-line Flexsem framework. The model scenarios were conducted by changing the forcing by +/- 20% of nutrient inputs (bottom-up) and mesozooplankton mortality (top-down), and both types of forcing combined. The model results showed that cascading effects operated differently depending on the forcing type. In the single-forcing bottom-up scenarios, the cascade directions were in the same direction as the forcing. For scenarios involving top-down, there was a skipped-level-transmission in the trophic responses that was either attenuated or amplified at different trophic levels. On a seasonal scale, bottom-up forcing showed strongest response during winter-spring for DIN and ChI a concentrations, whereas top down forcing had the highest cascade strength during summer for ChI a concentrations and microzooplankton biomass. On annual basis, the system was more bottom-up than top-down controlled. Microzooplankton was found to play an important role in the pelagic food web as mediator of nutrient and energy fluxes. This study demonstrated that the best scenario for improved water quality was a combined reduction in nutrient input and mesozooplankton mortality calling for the need of an integrated management of marine areas exploited by human activities.

Four probiotic PNSB (Rhodobacter sphaeroides strains SS15, S3W10, TKW17 and Afifella marina STW181) were investigated for controlling water quality using a mixed culture at a ratio of 1: 1 (roughly 1 x 10(8) cells mL(-1) for each, every week 1-7) as follows; T1 (S3W10 + SS15), T2 (S3W10 + TKW17) and T3 (S3W10 + STW181) and found that throughout 8 weeks shrimp cultivation the most effective sets to reduce NH4(+) and promote shrimp growth (based on weight and total length) were T1 and T3, respectively. Hence, PNSB strains (SS15, S3W10 and STW181) were used as a mixed culture (1: 1: 1, roughly 1 x 10(8) cells mL(-1) for each at weeks 1, 2 and 3) assessing their potential to prevent AHPND by challenge test on shrimp with a virulent strain AHPND-causing Vibrio parahaemolyticus SR2 (roughly 1 x 10(5) cells mL(-1) at day 15) during shrimp cultivation for 30 days. Inoculated PNSB sets (positive control: only PNSB inoculation, and treatment: both PNSB and SR2 inoculations) significantly decreased (P < 0.05) the levels of NH4-, NO2-, NO3- and chemical oxygen demand (COD) with significantly higher (P < 0.05) of dissolved oxygen (DO) compared to native control (no inoculation) and challenge test (only SR2 inoculation). The maximal growth performance of shrimp was observed in the positive control; while no significant difference (P > 0.05) was observed for other sets. PNSB survived and colonized in intestinal shrimp tract to prevent AHPND by increasing 11% survival rate of infected shrimp by strain SR2. The correlation coefficient between PNSB population and shrimp survival showed a positive strong correlation, but a negative strong correlation between vibrios population and shrimp survival. Overall results proved that a mixed three probiotic PNSB are a good candidate for applying in white shrimp cultivation to maintain water quality and to protect shrimp diseases for promoting shrimp growth with higher survival rate.

The present study examined the effectiveness of periphyton for biofiltration of mariculture effluents. Marine periphyton was allowed to spontaneously develop on a plastic net substrate, in experimental bioreactors that were fed with effluents from fish mariculture ponds. Biomass development and nutrient uptake were followed over four seasons. Attention was given to the orientation and area of the net substrate, season and additional operational factors. The highest specific growth rate (SGR) of 27% day(-1) was measured during the second week of periphyton growth in the summer. Mean daily periphyton production rates in the spring and autumn were 2.4 and 1.8 g (ash-free dry weight) m(-2) day(-1), respectively. The vertical orientation of the net substrate was overall advantageous over the horizontal orientation. Increasing the substrate area of vertically oriented nets in the biofilter increased the removal efficiency of total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) up to 80%, and allowed more biomass production in the biofilter. Multiple polynomial regression models suggest strong effect of biomass weight and effluent retention time on the removal efficiency of TAN and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN). The removal rates of TAN and DIN in these experiments were between 0.11 and 1.2 g Nm(-2) (substrate area) day(-1) for periphyton at the age of 7 and 42 days, respectively. Marine periphyton seems to be a simple, low cost and sustainable component, which can performbiofiltration/rehabilitation of water quality and potentially serve as feed for fish and shrimp.

With the Gamtoos Estuary experiencing regular high flow conditions, a key difference between the two systems is the propensity for natural flushing events to occur; a mechanism largely eliminated from the highly-regulated Sundays Catchment. Phytoplankton blooms (>20 Chl-alpha mu g l(-1)) were persistent and seasonal in the Sundays, inducing summer bottom-water hypoxia (<2 mg l(-1)), whilst those in the Gamtoos were episodic and flow-dependent. Of concern in the Sundays Estuary, was the magnitude (>550 mu g l(-1)) and recurrent nature of two harmful algal bloom (HAB) species. This study provides the first account of HAB persistence and seasonal hypoxia in a South African estuary, demonstrating the possible consequences of shifting an ecosystem into a new stable state.

No effects were observed at any sediment concentrations when applied alone. All corals in the lowest light treatments lost chlorophyll a and discoloured (bleached) after a week. Coral mortality only occurred in the two lowest light treatments and was higher when simultaneously exposed to elevated SSCs. Compared to water quality data collected during large dredging programs and natural resuspension events (and in the absence of sediment deposition as a cause-effect pathway) these data suggest the light reduction associated with turbidity poses a proportionally greater risk than effects of elevated SSCs alone.

The current study investigated the use of a new method for measuring valve behaviour responses in mussels (Mytilus edulis) exposed to dispersed crude oil (DCO). Results confirmed that valve gape is a sensitive parameter; at the high DCO concentration (0.25 mg L-1) the mean valve gape was reduced from 49 to 31%, and mussels increased shell movement (measured as distance travelled) or spent more time closed to avoid contact with the oil. At the low DCO concentration (0.015 mg L-1) the distance travelled parameter was the most sensitive endpoint. Results also demonstrated that valve gape behaviour is a valid endpoint when monitoring mussels for exposure to DCO. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Among 32 identified tintinnid species, the agglomerated genera Tintinnopsis (20 sp), dominated the community (similar to 62%) followed by Tintinnidium (2 sp), Leprotintinnus (2 sp), Codonellopsis, Stenosemella, Helicostomella, Favella, Eutintinnus, Metacylis, Dadayiellaand Wangiella (each comprising single species). A wide range of seasonal variations in tintinnid abundance was recorded maximum (2067 +/- 893 ind. l(-1)) for Tintinnopsis beroidea and minimum (11 +/- 4 ind. l(-1)) for Metacylis sp. during the investigation period. The biomass and daily production rate of tintinnid ranged from 0.004-2.764 mu g C l(-1) and 0.04-3.54 mu g C l(-1) day(-1) respectively. An overall dominance and diversity of the small-sized tintinnid (lorica length < 76 mu m) belonging to the genera Tintinnopsis sp., Tintinnidium sp., Codonellopsis sp., Wangiella sp., Eutintinnus sp., Metacylis sp. and Helicostomella sp. was pronounced, accounting similar to 66% of the total tintinnid abundance. K-dominance curves were plotted against log rank k, showed species dominance over the investigated sites. The multidimensional scaling (MDS) Canonical Analysis of Principal coordinates (CAP) highlighting a significantly different spatial distribution of tintinnid. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) map showed clustering of core species with chl a and nitrate and could be considered as the crucial factors controlling the distribution and seasonal patterns of tintinnid.

We show the influence of high rainfall levels on the water quality, composition and seasonal succession of Cyanobacteria in the Sumarice reservoir, Serbia (44 degrees 01' 49 '' N, 20 52' 28 '' E). The changes in physical and chemical parameters of water, Chl-a, Cyanobacteria biomass, abundance of phytoplankton and Cyanobacteria along a temporal gradient are visualized using a self-organizing map (SOM). Data was collected monthly during 2013 and 2014. During 2013, the reservoir was characterized as mesotrophic and eutrophic, with a low level of nutrients (the maximum value of total phosphorus was 0.068 mg L-1 and total nitrogen was 0.764 mg L-1 in August), while the maximum values of Cyanobacteria biomass (12.7 mg L-1) and abundance (1.36 x 10(6) ind L-1) were in September, when Cyanobacteria represented 21% of the whole phytoplankton. In the following year (2014), after the extreme precipitation (227L m(-2) in May and 138 L m(-2) in July), the concentration of nutrients in the reservoir increased. In September, the maximum value of total phosphorus was 0.310 mg L-1, and the maximum value of total nitrogen was 6.828 mg L-1. In October, the maximum values of Cyanobacteria biomass (1567.28 mg L-1) and abundance (2.36 x 10(8) ind L-1) were recorded when the bloom of Aphanizomenonflos-aquae was observed, representing 98 % of the whole phytoplankton. This blooming is strongly positively correlated with the increase of total phosphorus and nitrogen. The extreme and long-term precipitation was significant enough to change the state of the reservoir from eutrophic to hypereutrophic.

Revisiting Killarney Provincial Park lakes (Ontario, Canada)	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												Previous paleolimnological assessments have shown that many poorly buffered Canadian Shield lakes in the Sudbury (Ontario) region, including George and Lumsden lakes in Killarney Provincial Park (similar to 60 km southwest of Sudbury), acidified as a result of metal mining and smelting activities since the 1880s. In this paper, we revisit George and Lumsden lakes to conduct a paleolimnological re-assessment of these sites 25 years after the original sediment cores were collected. This updated study represents a period of chemical recovery from acidification, as well as the acceleration of regional climate warming. In agreement with the earlier paleolimnological study, our results also show that diatoms responded to acidification beginning 1920/30s, characterized by an increase in the relative abundance of acidobiontic Asterionella ralfsii. Although the most recent diatom assemblages (past 30 years) suggest that pH has likely returned to pre-acidification levels, the arrival and increases in diatom taxa absent in earlier sedimentary intervals (such as Asterionella formosa, Eunotia exigua, Frustulia magaliesmontana, and Kobayasiella subtilissima) signify the onset of new environmental conditions. The marked difference in composition between recent and pre-acidification diatom assemblages suggests a response to multiple environmental stressors, particularly regional warming, that has likely affected the trajectory of biological recovery. In these oli-gotrophic lakes, the recent increase in the relative abundance of Asterionella formosa, a rise in whole lake primary production, and a higher chrysophyte scale : diatom valve index suggest that regional warming has influenced the observed algal re-organization. Our paleolimnological investigation shows that, much like what had been reported for the Cladocera, the algal communities of these lakes have crossed climate-related limnological thresholds and are not returning to pre-acidification assemblages.

This embryo will develop into a mature organism capable of producing gametes again. This colloquial statement comprehends however the most complex mechanisms in biology, namely, cell differentiation and cell reprogramming. Epigenetic modifications are major actors in this process, both during gametogenesis and embryo development. The epigenetic concept is resulting from the growing scientific understanding of embryology and genetics, and it is made operational by generic molecular mechanisms, namely DNA methylation, histone tails modifications, and non-coding RNAs. Epigenetic modifications associated with gamete differentiation and early embryo development are quite well described in mammals, but increasing research is developed in fish today, either in model or in aquaculture species. Because fish are living organisms thoroughly exposed to temperature and to water quality, environment is likely to influence the epigenetic pattern of the gametes, embryo, or adult organisms. Reproductive biotechnologies are also at risk to modify gametes and embryo epigenetics. This review is aimed towards giving the basic knowledge on the molecular actors of epigenetics, highlighting the developing knowledge in mammals which can be useful to fish research and proposing the possible area where epigenetics can enrich research on fish gametes and reproductive technologies.

Oyster populations and the reefs they form have suffered chronic long-term decline throughout the species' range, including in northwest Florida's Pensacola Bay estuary system (PBS). To guide efforts to rebuild oyster populations in the PBS, connectivity patterns were evaluated among historic and extant reef locations using an integrated biophysical numerical model. Water quality parameters and oyster recruitment were monitored in May 2007 and then monthly from July 2007 through July 2008. Resultant salinity data were used to calibrate an Estuarine Coastal Ocean Model-based numerical circulation model of Pensacola Bay, which was then coupled to an existing, individual-based, oyster larvae routine to predict ontogenetic larval distribution. Three-dimensional Lagrangian transport algorithms were used to simulate transport of modeled larvae during four 20-day time periods during those summer and autumn months when oyster recruitment was empirically recorded in the bay. Based on outcomes from contemporaneous sampling of oyster larvae, the model was shown to represent the salient features of oyster larval distribution in Pensacola Bay. There were, however, instances of incongruity between modeled and sampled outcomes, indicating that model outcomes not validated with field data must be interpreted with caution. Larval supply was highly variable and spatially complex, but potentially limiting to successful recruitment and reef replenishment. Larval transfer rates within and among previously identified oyster reefs in Pensacola Bay were determined and were used to predict optimal oyster reef restoration or rehabilitation sites. Finally, larval exports from the bay were estimated and considered within the context of larval exchange among north Florida estuaries and potential repercussions to the long-term health of the Gulf of Mexico oyster metapopulation.

In the Gulf of Aqaba (GoA), coral reefs are considered the dominating ecosystem, while seagrass meadows, recognized worldwide as important ecosystems, have received little attention. Absence of comprehensive seagrass maps limits awareness, evaluations of associated ecosystem services, and implementation of conservation and management tools. 2. Presented here are the first detailed maps of seagrass meadows along the Israeli coast of the northern GoA. Mapping was performed by snorkelling along transects perpendicular to the shore above meadows growing at 15-25 m. Measurements along these transects included position, meadow depth and visual estimations of seagrass cover. Shallow boundaries of meadows, parallel to shore, were recorded by GPS tracking. Supplementary work included drop-camera boat surveys to determine the position of the deeper edge of meadows. In addition, GIS layers were created that indicated shoreline infrastructures, near-shore human activities and potential pollution threats. Ecosystem services of seagrass meadows mapped were valuated using a benefit transfer approach. 3. In total, 9.7 km of the 11 km shoreline were surveyed and 2830 data points collected. Seagrasses were growing along 7.5 km of the shoreline, with shallow (15-25 m) meadows found to cover an area of 707 000 m(2) and valued at more than US$ 2 000 000 yr(-1) in associated ecosystem services. Pilot drop-camera surveys (additional 283 data points) indicated that meadows can extend down to 50 m in some places. Coastal uses and threats varied in character and location. A municipality runoff point and drainage canal located close to the largest meadow were identified as the main threats to local seagrasses. 4. These low-cost methods enhance our understanding of seagrass distribution in the northern GoA. They demonstrate a GIS-based tool for assessing how environmental changes might affect the cover and state of seagrasses, improving efforts to conserve seagrass, and have particular relevance to seagrass mapping in developing countries and/or island nations.

Combining ex situ and in situ methods to improve water quality testing for the conservation of aquatic species	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												1. Determining whether water quality is suitable is an important part of managing aquatic species for conservation, although it is often challenging to achieve. Past approaches have largely consisted of tests exposing individuals to artificial solutions, or field studies that examine the effect of a subset of water quality parameters on the distribution or abundance of a species. 2. Owing to the complex nature of water chemistry in natural systems, which is difficult to replicate using laboratory studies or to capture entirely with correlational field studies, these types of study may not be suitable for determining accurately whether or not water quality at a particular site is suitable for a target species. In situations where conservation outcomes rely heavily on achieving this, an alternative approach is therefore needed. 3. Embryos of the threatened green and golden bell frog Litoria aurea were placed in water collected from ponds that were used by this species for breeding and ponds where breeding was not detected at Sydney Olympic Park, Australia. After 19 days, the tadpoles were placed in enclosures in the same breeding and non- breeding ponds, and monitored until they metamorphosed. 4. There was no difference in tadpole survival, time to metamorphosis or body condition between the two treatments, indicating that poor water quality was not a cause of low pond occupancy by tadpoles at the site and resources should be directed towards investigating other potential causes. 5. We suggest that this method of an ex situ followed by an in situ exposure study is an effective approach to eliminating or confirming poor water quality as a cause of population declines and reduced occupancy, for species that are aquatic for at least part of their life cycle. Other applications include establishing that artificially created habitat provides suitable water chemistry, or identifying a potential location for a reintroduction project.

A.; Legendre, Pierre			Environmental factors structuring benthic primary producers at different spatial scales in the St. Lawrence River (Canada)	AQUATIC SCIENCES												The influence of environmental factors controlling the biomass of submerged aquatic macrophytes, cyanobacterial mats, and epiphyton was examined at three nested spatial scales within the St. Lawrence River: (1) along a 250-km-long upstream-downstream river stretch, (2) among three fluvial lakes located within that river stretch and (3) within each fluvial lake at sites located upstream, at the mouth, and downstream of the St. Lawrence River tributaries. Over its 250-km-long course, large increases of water colour (fivefold), suspended matter (tenfold), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (twofold) and dissolved N and P concentrations (2.5-fold) were observed in the St. Lawrence River, showing the cumulative effects of human activities on water quality. In contrast, biomass of submerged vascular macrophytes dropped tenfold along the sampled reach whereas biomass of epiphytes and cyanobacterial mats rose significantly. Biomass of the three benthic primary producers (PP) was explained (59 %) by the combined effects of conductivity, TP and spatial structure. Macrophyte biomass was related to changes in conductivity (+), biomass of epiphyton responded to DIN:TDP ratio (+) and light extinction coefficient (+) and cyanobacterial mats coincided with differences in DOC (+) and NH4 (+) (-). Within-lake structure was the most important spatial component for all benthic PP, suggesting that local effects, such as enrichment by the inflow of tributaries, rather than upstream-downstream gradients, determined the biomass of benthic PP. Our study shows that the sum of local tributary inflows exerts major overall pressures on benthic PP in the St. Lawrence River and that conversely, small-scale management of individual watersheds, can markedly improve local ecological condition of the river ecosystems.																	1015-1621	1420-9055				APR	2017	79	2					345	356		10.1007/s00027-016-0501-4								WOS:000397570900011

Seasonal shifts in the relative importance of local versus upstream sources of phosphorus to individual lakes in a chain	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Water quality in the Yahara chain of lakes in southern Wisconsin has been degraded significantly since European settlement of the region, primarily as a result of anthropogenic nutrient inputs. While all four main lakes (Mendota, Monona, Waubesa, and Kegonsa) have undergone eutrophication, elevated phosphorus and chlorophyll concentrations are particularly pronounced in the smaller lakes at the bottom of the chain (Waubesa and Kegonsa). Due to their short water residence times (2-3 months), these lakes are more responsive to seasonal variability in magnitude and source of phosphorus loading compared with the larger upstream lakes. In 2014, more than 80 % of the phosphorus load to Lake Waubesa passed through the outlet of Lake Monona (situated immediately upstream). However, between mid-May and late October when phosphorus concentrations in Lake Monona were reduced as a result of thermal stratification the upstream load dropped to similar to 40 % of the total, with the majority of loading during this period coming from Lake Waubesa's local watershed. Correspondingly, seasonal phosphorus trends in Lake Waubesa during summer are correlated with precipitation, rather than phosphorus concentrations leaving upstream lakes. While phosphorus export from the local watersheds of Lakes Waubesa and Kegonsa is relatively small on an annual time scale, targeted loading reductions in these areas during the summertime will most effectively reduce summertime phosphorus concentrations in these fast-flushing lakes. Understanding the interaction of landscape position, water residence time, and mixing regime can help guide watershed management for water quality improvements in lake chains.

Changes in macroinvertebrate trophic structure along a land-use gradient within a lowland stream network	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Running waters are among the most threatened ecosystems globally, having altered hydrological regimes, homogenized habitat, and impaired water quality. These multiple stressors impact aquatic biodiversity and ecosystem function across space and time, although a clear mechanistic understanding is still lacking. Here, we examined the trophic response of macroinvertebrates among streams in a Swiss lowland catchment encompassing a gradient of land uses. Clear compositional changes were observed as anthropogenic impacts increased from least-impacted to agricultural and urbanized sites. Taxonomic diversity was lowest at sites with morphological and water quality impairment (agricultural sites), whereas taxonomic identity (susceptible vs. generalist species) mainly changed due to water quality degradation (agricultural and urban sites) based on the SPEAR (pesticides) index. Using stable isotopes (delta C-13, delta N-15), a simplification in macroinvertebrate trophic structure was evident along the land use gradient. At a site receiving wastewater treatment effluent, stable isotopes also revealed trophic shifts in primary consumers that corresponded to changes in available food resources. Results further showed that some taxa losses, e.g., the mayfly Ecdyonurus, to land- use effects may be due to low trophic plasticity. The combination of analyses, including stable isotopes, provided an improved mechanistic understanding of community and population responses to land-use changes along river networks.																	1015-1621	1420-9055				APR	2017	79	2					407	418		10.1007/s00027-016-0506-z								WOS:000397570900016

Ecotoxicological assessments show sucralose and fluoxetine affect the aquatic plant, Lemna minor	AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY												Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCP) are prevalent in aquatic systems, yet the fate and impacts on aquatic plants needs quantification for many compounds. We measured and detected sucralose (an artificial sweetener), fluoxetine (an antidepressant), and other PPCP in the Portneuf River in Idaho, USA, where Lemna minor (an aquatic plant in the environment and used in ecotoxicology studies) naturally occurs. Sucralose was hypothesized to negatively affect photosynthesis and growth of L. minor because sucralose is a chlorinated molecule that may be toxic or unusable for plant metabolism. A priori hypotheses were not created for fluoxetine due to lack of previous studies examining its impacts on plants. We conducted laboratory ecotoxicological assessments for a large range of concentrations of sucralose and fluoxetine on L. minor physiology and photosynthetic function. Frond green leaf area, root length, growth rate, photosynthetic capacity, and plant carbon isotopic composition (discrimination relative to a standard; delta C-13) were measured among treatments ranging from 0 to 15000 nmol/L-sucralose and 0-323 nmol/L-fluoxetine. Contrary to our predictions, sucralose significantly increased green leaf area, photosynthetic capacity, and delta C-13 of L. minor at environmentally relevant concentrations. The increase of delta C-13 from sucralose amendments and an isotope-mixing model indicated substantial sucralose uptake and assimilation within the plant. Unlike humans who cannot break down and utilize sucralose, we documented that L. minor a mixotrophic plant can use sucralose as a sugar substitute to increase its green leaf area and photosynthetic capacity. Fluoxetine significantly decreased L. minor root growth, daily growth rate, and asexual reproduction at 323 nmol/L-fluoxetine; however, ambiguity remains regarding the mechanisms responsible and the applicability of these extreme concentrations unprecedented in the natural environment. To our knowledge, this was the first study to show aquatic plants can uptake and metabolize sucralose as a carbon source. This study further supports the common notion that L. minor can be useful in bioremediation of PPCP from wastewaters. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Nitrite toxicity in juvenile Goodeinae fishes Skiffia multipunctata (Pellegrin, 1901) and Goodea atripinnis (Jordan, 1880)	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY					15th European Congress of Ichthyology	SEP 07-11, 2015	Porto, PORTUGAL	Interdisciplinary Ctr Marine & Environm Res				Lethal concentration (LC50) and sub-lethal effects of NO2-N on the endemic viviparous fishes Skiffia multipunctata (Pellegrin, 1911) (SM; considered threatened under Mexican regulations) and Goodea atripinnis (Jordan, 1880) (GA; without conservation status) were determined. LC50/96hr values were 0.002 and 0.359mg NO2-N/L for SM and GA, respectively. Sub-lethal exposure resulted in swelling of the gill epithelium, hyperplasia, fusion of the primary and secondary lamellae, erythrocyte pyknosis, and aneurysms with respiratory stress responses at 0.0012 and 0.244mg NO2-N/L for SM and GA. The study demonstrates that sensitivity of both species is strongly related to the conservation status and acceptable nitrite concentrations, which are clearly below those permitted by the Mexican national water quality norm for wildlife preservation. Therefore, this norm is not adequate protection for these species, and where other threatened species may also be affected. Adequate criteria for nitrites in Mexican waters should include the data of all threatened endemic species.																	0175-8659	1439-0426				APR	2017	33	2					300	305		10.1111/jai.13292								WOS:000397476300022

Seasonal and inter-annual variability of phytoplankton in central Lake Diefenbaker (Saskatchewan, Canada) proximal to a large commercial aquaculture farm	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake Diefenbaker, Saskatchewan, is a large reservoir (392 km(2)) with multiple end users, including a commercial aquaculture farm, which rely on sustainable water quality. Phytoplankton samples were taken monthly at upstream, aquaculture, and downstream locations during August 2008 to November 2011. The phytoplankton community was primarily diatoms and cryptophytes. Diatom biomass was correlated with greater mixing depth, while cryptophyte biomass was correlated with higher dissolved nutrients. Phytoplankton biomass was characterized by date, season and year, and this information was used to test spatial differences between upstream, farm and downstream locations. There was no significant difference in chlorophyte, chrysophyte or dinoflagellate biomass spatially. Upstream sites (US) had higher diatom biomass in the fall (US-DS = 329 mg/m(3)). Downstream sites (DS) had higher cryptophyte biomass in the summer (DS-US = 241 mg/m(3)) and higher cyanobacteria biomass in the fall (DS-US = 15 mg/m(3)). Spatial trends in diatoms, cryptophytes, and cyanobacteria between upstream and downstream locations were found to be significantly related to distance downstream, but failed to provide evidence of a fish farm effect. There was far greater inter-annual variability than spatial variability in phytoplankton biomass of Lake Diefenbaker, a lake prone to flooding and drought. For instance, flooding in 2011 resulted in elevated suspended solids, nutrient concentrations, and algal biomass (particularly cryptophytes and dinoflagellates) due to a La Nina winter. Flood inputs of suspended solids to Lake Diefenbaker favour low-light adapted taxa (e.g., Rhodomonas minuta Skuja) over potentially toxic cyanobacteria.

Microbial indicators as a diagnostic tool for assessing water quality and climate stress in coral reef ecosystems	MARINE BIOLOGY												Microorganisms play a fundamental role in the functioning and stability of coral reef ecosystems. However, environmental disturbances can trigger alterations to the natural microbial community composition and their functional traits with potentially detrimental consequences for host organisms, such as corals, sponges and algae and concomitant implications for the entire coral reef ecosystem. Coral reefs are increasingly affected by localized impacts such as declining water quality and global pressures derived from human-induced climate change, which severely alters the natural conditions on reefs and can push dominating benthic life forms towards the limit of their resistance and resilience. Microorganisms can respond very rapidly to these altered environmental conditions so defining their natural variability over spatial and temporal gradients is critical for early and accurate identification of environmental disturbances. The rapid response of microbes to environmental change is likely to confer significant advantages over traditional reef monitoring methods, which are based on visual signs of health deterioration in benthic coral reef macroorganisms. This review discusses the potential of microbes as early warning indicators for environmental stress and coral reef health and proposes priorities for future research.

Water exchange rate in RAS and dietary inclusion of micro-minerals influence growth, body composition and mineral metabolism in common carp	AQUACULTURE												Recirculation aquaculture systems (RASs) operated at low water exchange rates are known to accumulate minerals in the water. This study examined the dietarymineral requirement and metabolism in common carp reared in RAS of contrasting water exchange rates. Two independent RAS (water exchange rates, 70 vs. 2000 L/kg feed) and five experimental diets with graded levels of micro-mineral premix inclusion (0.0, 0.3, 0.6, 1.0 and 1.5%) were tested in a 2 x 5 factorial arrangement. Common carp fingerlings (8.5 g) were reared in either of the RAS and fed the experimental diets in triplicates for 8 weeks at 24 degrees C. Water quality, fish growth, body composition, tissue mineral concentrations, blood haemoglobin and haematocrit levels, biochemical andmolecular markers of oxidative stress, mineral uptake and metabolismwere studied. RAS operated at lowwater exchange rate showed significantly high conductivity, nitrate, nitrite and dissolved mineral concentrations in water. A tendency for higher growth, significantly higher whole body mineral levels except Cu and Zn were observed in fish reared in RAS with high accumulation ofminerals (H-RAS). Of the micro-minerals studied, effect of RAS on the minimal dietary inclusion level was significant only for Se; lower in fish reared in the H-RAS (0.28mg/kg) compared to LRAS (0.32 mg/kg). Increasing premix inclusion decreased growth and feed efficiency, increased the whole body concentration of Cu, Se and Zn, while Fe and Mn were unaffected. Plasma P, Ca, K and Mn were higher and haematocritwas lower inH-RAS reared fish; plasmamineral levels were also influenced by premix inclusion. Enzymes involved in micro-mineral uptake and metabolism (ferric reductase, cupric reductase and alkaline phosphatase) and oxidative stress markers (glutathione peroxidase, catalase, glutathione reductase and glutathione S-transferase) were analysed in gill, intestine and liver. In fish reared in H-RAS, reduced glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and increased glutathione reductase (GR) activities were observed in liver and intestine, respectively. Activity of GPx in all the analysed tissues increased with premix supplementation. Differential regulation inmRNA expression of molecular markers related to micro-mineral uptake, metabolism and oxidative stress were observed in the tissues in response to RAS and premix inclusion. To conclude, fish reared in high accumulation RAS had higher mineral levels inwhole body and vertebrae, but did not result in a lower estimate of micro-minerals, except for Se. Difference in rearing systemhad multiple effects on the physiology andmetabolismof fish on the whole, apart from mineral balance alone. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

Impacts of organic waste froma yellowtail cage farm on surface sediment and bottom water in Shido Bay (the Seto Inland Sea, Japan)	AQUACULTURE												The environmental impacts of a yellowtail (Seriola quinqueradiata) culture on sediment and water qualities were investigated at an intensive cage farm located in a coastal ecosystem(Shido Bay, the Seto Inland Sea, Japan) during low and high feeding times. The experimental design involved the establishment of surrounding sites (10 m from the cages) and a transect extending away from the cage at 0, 10, 50, and 100 m. The organic matter depositions were measured using sediment traps. Surface sediments and bottom water characteristics were also described. The organic depositions of the yellowtail cage farm in Shido Bay on the sediment were quite significant compared to the control site (100 m from the cage) and extended to 10 m around the fish farms. Due to the high organic deposition under the cage, the surface sediment showed an elevated level of organic-enriched sediments, and led to an increase in the production of sulfides. Oxygen depletion of the bottom water was accompanied by organic-enriched sediments and production of high-acid volatile sulfide (AVS) contents in the surface sediments, and caused a significant increase in ammonium (NH4+) and phosphate (PO43-) concentrations in the bottom water. As a result, impacts of organic waste from a yellowtail cage on surface sediments and bottom water quality were clearly found in Shido Bay. Statement of relevance: Present study, the organic waste impacts of a yellowtail (Seriola quinqueradiata) culture on sediment and water qualities were investigated at an intensive cage farm located in a coastal ecosystem (Shido Bay, the Seto Inland Sea, Japan) during low and high feeding times.

Exceptionally high organic nitrogen concentrations in a semi-arid South Texas estuary susceptible to brown tide blooms	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Studies of estuarine eutrophication have tended to focus on systems with continually flowing rivers, while little is known about estuaries from semi-arid/aridregions. Here we report results from an assessment of water quality conditions in Baffin Bay, Texas, a shallow (<2-3 m) subtropical estuary located in a semi-arid region that has agriculture as the dominant (44%) watershed land use. Chlorophyll a averaged 28-30 mu g/1 in Baffin Bay from 2003 to 2013 and total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) concentrations were also very high (116-120 mu M), with concentrations of both variables exceeding those of most other Texas estuaries by 2-5 fold. More recent field sampling (2013-2015) showed that dissolved organic nitrogen concentrations in Baffin Bay (62 14 mu M) were >2 fold higher than in three other Texas estuaries. In contrast, inorganic nitrogen (ammonium, nitrate) and phosphate concentrations were relatively low. Statistically significant long-term annual increases in chlorophyll a and salinity were observed in Baffin Bay, while long-term seasonal increases were observed for water temperature and TKN. Overall, Baffin Bay is displaying multiple symptoms of eutrophication, namely very high organic carbon, organic nitrogen and chlorophyll concentrations, as well as symptoms not quantified here such as fish kills and episodic hypoxia. Much of the increase in chlorophyll in Baffin Bay, at least since similar to 1990, have coincided with blooms of the mixotrophic phytoplankton species, Aureoumbra lagunensis, which is thought to be favored under high proportions of organic to inorganic nitrogen. Thus the high and possibly increasing organic nitrogen concentrations, coupled with a long-term annual increase in salinity and a long-term seasonal increase in water temperature are likely to promote additional brown tide blooms in this system in the future.

Satellite images and national agriculture censuses were used for a quantitative analysis of land use changes from 1974 to 2005, and a nutrient export coefficient approximation was used to determine long-term changes in annual loads. Several eutrophication indicators (water, sediment and autotrophic communities) were assessed seasonally in the lagoon basins during 2005 and 2006. The areal annual load of nutrients exported to the lagoons increased over time. Population and extensive livestock ranching were the most important nutrient sources, while agriculture is increasing in importance. 'Buffer effects of riparian forests on eutrophication indicators were observed in contrast to the wetlands surrounding the lagoons, which seem to be acting as a source of nutrients. Catchment size was inversely related to most eutrophication indicators. Afforestation and agriculture were found not to directly impact eutrophication indicators, however, catchments with larger agricultural areas showed higher concentrations of suspended solids, which may indicate the export of particulate nutrients. Salinity was inversely related to most eutrophication indicators, suggesting that the manipulation of the sand bar of the lagoons is a critical management issue. Sediment-related eutrophication indicators were more sensitive to changes in land uses and covers, in contrast with the more variable water column indicators, suggesting their potential use as enduring indicators. This research provides a rapid and integral assessment for qualitatively linking catchment changes with eutrophication indicators in coastal environments, which can easily be replicated to track pollutants in locations that lack standardized monitoring programs needed for more complex catchment modeling approaches.

Impact of roadside ditch dredging on bacterial communities and biological contamination of a tidal creek	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Tidal creek networks form the primary hydrologic link between estuaries and land-based activities on barrier islands. A possible impact from the excavation of drainage ditch systems on bacterial communities and biological contamination was studied in the water column and sediments of headwater, midstream, and mouth sites of the intertidal Oakdale Creek on Sapelo Island, GA. Community analysis was performed using the MiSeq Illumina platform and revealed that dredging was the cause of a significant rise in Proteobacteria, especially gamma-proteobacteria. Targeted biological contaminants included fecal indicator bacteria, Enterococcus spp. (Entero-1), pathogens, Shigella spp. (ipaH), and Salmonella spp (invA), virulence associated genes (VG's) of pathogenic E. coil (eaeA, hlyD, stx1, stx2, and set1B), integrons (intI1, intI2), and tetracycline resistance genes (TRGs). Incidence and gene concentrations of Shigella spp., eaeA and set1B, and of TRGs increased 3-20 folds after the onset of dredging, and followed the dredging schedule. Principal Component Analysis suggested possible common carriers for Shigella spp., some TRGt, and the pathogenic E. coli eaeA gene. At the site of dredging, all of the above contaminants were detected at high concentrations. We concluded that excavation of roadside ditches caused significant changes in bacterial composition and a rise in incidence and concentrations of biological contaminants in the creek. The authors suggest a different approach for the maintenance of this material be explored. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Huang, GX; Falconer, RA; Lin, BL				Huang, Guoxian; Falconer, Roger A.; Lin, Binliang			Integrated hydro-bacterial modelling for predicting bathing water quality	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												In recent years health risks associated with the non-compliance of bathing water quality have received increasing worldwide attention. However, it is particularly challenging to establish the source of any non-compliance, due to the complex nature of the source of faecal indicator organisms, and the fate and delivery processes and scarcity of field measured data in many catchments and estuaries. In the current study an integrated hydro-bacterial model, linking a catchment, 1-D model and 2-D model were integrated to simulate the adsorption-desorption processes of faecal bacteria to and from sediment particles in river, estuarine and coastal waters, respectively. The model was then validated using hydrodynamic, sediment and faecal bacteria concentration data, measured in 2012, in the Ribble river and estuary, and along the Fylde coast, UK. Particular emphasis has been placed on the mechanism of faecal bacteria transport and decay through the deposition and resuspension of suspended sediments. The results showed that by coupling the E.coli concentration with the sediment transport processes, the accuracy of the predicted E.coli levels was improved. A series of scenario runs were then carried out to investigate the impacts of different management scenarios on the E.coli concentration levels in the coastal bathing water sites around Liverpool Bay, UK. The model results show that the level of compliance with the new EU bathing water standards can be improved significantly by extending outfalls and/or reducing urban sources by typically 50%.

Samples were biweekly collected at five stations with different hydrographic conditions during a 1-year cycle. The second-stage-matrix-based multivariate approach was used to summarize the internal interactions of the ciliate functional groups among five stations during a 1-year period. The functional groups of the ciliates represented a clear spatial variation in annual cycle among five stations. Mantel analysis demonstrated that the spatial variation in annual cycles of the ciliate functional groups were significantly correlated with the changes nutrients (mainly soluble reactive phosphates and nitrates), alone or in combination with salinity among five stations. Based the results, it is suggested that the spatial variation in annual cycles of functional groups of planktonic ciliates may indicated the changes of hydrographic conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Increased phytoplankton food resulting from eutrophication is suggested to enhance larval survival. We addressed the hypothesis that larval success is associated with particular chl-a levels in tightly controlled larval:algal conditions. We used chl-a conditions found on coral reefs (0.1-5.0 mu g chl-a L-1), including nominal threshold levels for disproportionate larval success (>= 1.0 mu g chl-a L-1). High success to the juvenile occurred across an order of magnitude of chl-a concentrations (0.5-5.0 mu g chl-a L-1), suggesting there may not be a narrow value for optimal success. Oligotrophic conditions (0.1 mu g chl-a L-1) appeared to be a critical limit. With a review of the evidence, we suggest that opportunistic COTS larvae may be more resilient to low food levels than previously appreciated. Initiation of outbreak populations need not require eutrophic conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Chen, WB; Liu, WC				Chen, Wei-Bo; Liu, Wen-Cheng			Investigating the fate and transport of fecal coliform contamination in a tidal estuarine system using a three-dimensional model	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												A three-dimensional fecal coliform transport model was developed and incorporated into a hydrodynamic and suspended sediment transport model to better understand the microbiological water quality in the tidal Tamsui River estuarine system of northern Taiwan, which includes three main tributaries: Dahan River, Xindian River, and Keelung River. The model was calibrated using the water level, salinity, suspended sediment concentration, and fecal coliform data measured in 2010. The predictive skill, a statistical approach, is used to evaluate the model performance. There was quantitatively good agreement between the simulation and measurement results. Further, the calibrated model underwent model sensitivity analysis by varying the model parameters which include the settling velocity, darkness decay rate, partition coefficient, and fecal coliform concentration in the sediment bed. The results indicated that the settling velocity played the most important role in affecting fecal coliform concentrations followed by partition coefficient, darkness decay rate, and fecal coliform concentration in the sediment bed. The model was also used to investigate the effects of salinity and suspended sediment on fecal coliform contamination. The salinity module was excluded in the simulations, resulting in an increase of fecal coliform concentration. However the effect of salinity on fecal coliform concentration is minor. If the suspended sediment transport was excluded in the simulations, the predicted results of fecal coliform concentration decrease to be underestimated the measured data. The modeling results revealed that the inclusion of the suspended sediment transport model in the simulations was of crucial importance because the fecal coliform concentrations were significantly influenced by the suspended sediment concentration in the estuarine system.

A novel quantile method reveals spatiotemporal shifts in phytoplankton biomass descriptors between bloom and non-bloom conditions in a subtropical estuary	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Estuarine environments support dynamic phytoplankton blooms, especially in lowlatitude regions, where the effects of local drivers dominate. Identifying key bloom drivers from entangled ecological and anthropogenic influences is particularly challenging in stressed systems where several disturbances interact. Additionally, processes controlling bloom and non-bloom phytoplankton biomass dynamics can differ spatially, further confounding characterization of disturbance regimes that create bloom-favorable conditions. This study aims to explore the question of whether the shift from non-bloom to bloom conditions is matched by a shift in the relative importance of water quality drivers. Florida Bay (USA), a shallow subtropical inner shelf lagoon, was chosen as the study site due to its unique bloom dynamics and low-latitude location, as well as for the availability of long-term (16 yr) water quality data consisting of monthly measurements from 28 locations across the 2200 km(2) bay. At each of the locations, we applied a novel thresholdbased quantile regression analysis to chlorophyll a data to define bloom conditions, separate data from non-bloom conditions, and evaluate phytoplankton biomass dynamics of each of the 2 states. The final suite of explanatory covariates revealed spatial trends and differences in the relative importance of water quality descriptors of phytoplankton between the 2 conditions. The effects of turbidity and salinity on phytoplankton biomass became pronounced during blooms, whereas non-bloom conditions were primarily explained by autoregressive phytoplankton biomass trends and nutrient dynamics. The proposed analytical approach is not limited to any particular aquatic system type, and can be used to produce practical spatiotemporal information to guide management, restoration, and conservation efforts.

J	Ahmed, A; Pelletier, G; Roberts, M				Ahmed, Anise; Pelletier, Greg; Roberts, Mindy			South Puget Sound flushing times and residual flows	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												A three-dimensional South and Central Puget Sound hydrodynamic and water quality model was used to assess flushing times in finger inlets in South Puget Sound as well as residual flows at key transects in the model domain. The model was evaluated using instantaneous virtual dye in the inlets. Residual flows were determined at seven horizontal and vertical transects using model hydrodynamic output from 2006 to 2007 period. Flushing times based on virtual dye release for South Puget Sound was compared with that based on traditional method using residual flows and volumes. Longer flushing times in the inlets provide evidence of why low dissolved oxygen were observed in these areas from a previous study. Residual flows were comparable at several locations with literature values while at others they were lower. Possible reasons are summarized. Results provide important physical context for different regions of South Puget Sound. Flushing time for South Puget Sound (south of Tacoma Narrows) was estimated at 65 days based on virtual dye simulation. The flushing time was much shorter (34 days) when using the classical hydrodynamic formulation of volume divided by the residual flow and was close to values in existing literature.

Relationships between fish assemblages and selected habitat features were examined in the Pearl River, the largest subtropical river in southern China. Altogether, 94 fish species, representing 17 families and 5 orders were sampled. The dominant fish family was Cyprinidae, accounting for 49 taxa. Non-metric multidimensional scaling was applied to the collected data and it was found that the spatial variation of upstream fish assemblages was significantly different from downstream. Both water quality and habitat climate were significantly related to assemblages. Redundancy analysis revealed that the spatial patterns of fish assemblages were mostly explained by river width, temperature, river discharge, transparency and precipitation. It was concluded that the spatial patterns of fish assemblages in the Pearl River are closely associated with local abiotic features. Understanding the mechanisms such as those outlined in this research paper is the basis of conservation of fish community diversity, which is a critical resource to a successful sustainable wild fishery in the Pearl River.																	1863-9135					MAR	2017	189	4					329	340		10.1127/fal/2016/0922								WOS:000400955400004

Impacts of the 2014 severe drought on the Microcystis bloom in San Francisco Estuary	HARMFUL ALGAE												The increased frequency and intensity of drought with climate change may cause an increase in the magnitude and toxicity of freshwater cyanobacteria harmful algal blooms (CHABs), including Microcystis blooms, in San Francisco Estuary, California. As the fourth driest year on record in San Francisco Estuary, the 2014 drought provided an opportunity to directly test the impact of severe drought on cyanobacteria blooms in SFE. A field sampling program was conducted between July and December 2014 to sample a suite of physical, chemical, and biological variables at 10 stations in the freshwater and brackish reaches of the estuary. The 2014 Microcystis bloom had the highest biomass and toxin concentration, earliest initiation, and the longest duration, since the blooms began in 1999. Median chlorophyll a concentration increased by 9 and 12 times over previous dry and wet years, respectively. Total microcystin concentration also exceeded that in previous dry and wet years by a factor of 11 and 65, respectively. Cell abundance determined by quantitative PCR indicated the bloom contained multiple potentially toxic cyanobacteria species, toxic Microcystis and relatively high total cyanobacteria abundance. The bloom was associated with extreme nutrient concentrations, including a 20-year high in soluble reactive phosphorus concentration and low to below detection levels of ammonium. Stable isotope analysis suggested the bloom varied with both inorganic and organic nutrient concentration, and used ammonium as the primary nitrogen source. Water temperature was a primary controlling factor for the bloom and was positively correlated with the increase in both total and toxic Microcystis abundance. In addition, the early initiation and persistence of warm water temperature coincided with the increased intensity and duration of the Microcystis bloom from the usual 3 to 4 months to 8 months. Long residence time was also a primary factor controlling the magnitude and persistence of the bloom, and was created by a 66% to 85% reduction in both the water inflow and diversion of water for agriculture during the summer. We concluded that severe drought conditions can lead to a significant increase in the abundance of Microcystis and other cyanobacteria, as well as their associated toxins. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Combined physical, chemical and biological factors shape Alexandrium ostenfeldii blooms in the Netherlands	HARMFUL ALGAE												Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are globally expanding, compromising water quality worldwide. HAB dynamics are determined by a complex interplay of abiotic and biotic factors, and their emergence has often been linked to eutrophication, and more recently to climate change. The dinoflagellate Alexandrium is one of the most widespread HAB genera and its success is based on key functional traits like allelopathy, mixotrophy, cyst formation and nutrient retrieval migrations. Since 2012, dense Alexandrium ostenfeldii blooms (up to 4500 cells mL(-1)) have recurred annually in a creek located in the southwest of the Netherlands, an area characterized by intense agriculture and aquaculture. We investigated how physical, chemical and biological factors influenced A. ostenfeldii bloom dynamics over three consecutive years (2013-2015). Overall, we found a decrease in the magnitude of the bloom over the years that could largely be linked to changing weather conditions during summer. More specifically, low salinities due to excessive rainfall and increased wind speed corresponded to a delayed A. ostenfeldii bloom with reduced population densities in 2015. Within each year, highest population densities generally corresponded to high temperatures, low DIN:DIP ratios and low grazer densities. Together, our results demonstrate an important role of nutrient availability, absence of grazing, and particularly of the physical environment on the magnitude and duration of A. ostenfeldii blooms. Our results suggest that predicted changes in the physical environment may enhance bloom development in future coastal waters and embayments. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

They were among the largest of such outbreaks around the world, and these blooms likely originated along the coast of the Jiangsu Province, China. Understanding the roles of nutrients in the onset of these macroalgal blooms is needed to identify their origin. This study analyzes the spatiotemporal variations in dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus (DIN and PO4-P) and the N/P ratio along the Jiangsu coast from 1996 to 2014 during late-March to April, the months which corresponds to the pre-bloom period of green tides since 2007. A zone of high DIN and PO4-P concentrations has developed along the Jiangsu coast, between the cities of Sheyang and Nantong, since 1996. There was an 18-year trend of increasing DIN concentrations during the pre-bloom period as well as a positive correlation between the U. prolifera biomass and DIN concentrations. Nutrient inputs from rivers and mariculture in the Jiangsu Province may have provided nitrogen that contributed the magnitude of macroalgal blooms that subsequently spread into the southern Yellow Sea.

The experiment was carried out with two of fish: cultivated in conventional system - the carp was fed with 4.5 kg wheat per kg of fish growth and cultivated in organic system - the carp was fed with natural food from the ponds. In comparison to the conventional systems, the meat obtained from organic cultivated carp (Cyprinus carpio L.), was with 0.2 - 0.4 more alkaline pH; 1.5 - 2.0% higher water holding capacity; 0.7 - 1.3% higher total lipid content; 2.4 - 4.1% higher PUFAs concentration; 0.13 - 0.14 % higher lypolitical activity; 10.8 - 23.3% higher color redness (a*); 1.1 - 6.7% lower brightness of the color (L*) and 52.7 - 72.7% lower color yellowness (b*). The organic cultivated fresh and grill carp meat were assessed with 19 to 34% higher overall sensory scores resp. fish.

However, not all cyclones produce similar impact on a coastal lagoon, some trigger algal blooms after passage while others just increase the overall turbidity. Asia's largest brackish water lagoon, Chilika Lagoon, India was hit by two anniversary-severe cyclones Phailin (12 October 2013) and Hudhud (12 October 2014) recently. Their impacts were analysed with respect to physical, biological and meteorological factors which favour or restrict a phytoplankton bloom after the passage of a storm. Moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer surface reflectance data were used to examine the spatio-temporal variability in total suspended sediment (TSS) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration pre-and post-cyclone. Comparative results revealed that Phailin was associated with higher rainfall, wind speed and surface runoff compared with Hudhud. These factors contributed to higher TSS concentration in all sectors of the lagoon post-Phailin compared with post-Hudhud. Extreme TSS, limited light, high rainfall and runoff and increased flushing rate post-Phailin restricted the likelihood of a phytoplankton bloom in the lagoon, a commonly reported phenomenon after the passage of a cyclone. In contrast, sufficient light availability due to lower TSS, low runoff and flushing and stable wind supported a phytoplankton bloom post-Hudhud. The observed differential impacts were linked to the individual cyclone's characteristics such as differences in landfall locations, wind speed, trajectory after the landfall, differences in rainfall rate and surface runoff and speed of passage.

Major changes in the distribution of diatom assemblages were determined by multivariate statistical analyses. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to ordinate environmental variables of the water, showing a clear gradient along the estuary, with higher nutrient levels (total phosphorus and total nitrogen) and lower dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations at upstream sites. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to determine the species-environmental relationship. Total phosphorus (TP) and DO (p < 0.001) as well as salinity and pH (p < 0.002) were the most significant variables related to diatom composition. The neritic planktonic species Thalassionema nitzschioides (Grunow) Mereschkowsky was the most widespread and abundant species in the data set, presumably also reflecting significant influence of oceanic water. Thalassiosira cedarkeyensis Prasad, a marine benthic species, was the second most abundant species and seems to be related to higher nutrient levels, particularly at upstream sites. High abundances of Cyclotella meneghiniana Kutzing and Cyclotella atomus Hustedt were also recorded upstream sites. Their association to high TP levels and lower DO concentrations suggests deterioration of water quality. This study shows the potential of diatoms as indicators of environmental change even in dynamic systems such as estuaries.

Bioremediation and biocontrol of commercial probiotic in marine shrimp culture with biofloc	LATIN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC RESEARCH												The use of probiotics within shrimp farms has increased as an alternative to antibiotic use because of an increasing demand for more environment- friendly aquaculture. This has improved growth performance and health of shrimp, and improved pathogen control as well as water and soil quality in culture systems. However, efficacy of probiotics in intensive systems using biofloc remains uncertain. Here, bioremediation and biocontrol of a commercial probiotic was investigated through analysis of water quality and main bacterial groups that influence a Litopenaeus vannamei culture using biofloc. Furthermore, additional knowledge was gained on phytoplankton and shrimp performance. Treatments consisted of four different probiotic concentrations (Bacillus subtilis and B. licheniformis): 0.5 g m(-3) (P0.5), 1 g m(-3) (P1.0), 2 g m(-3) (P2.0), 3 g m(-3) (P3.0), and a control without probiotic (CTL). All variables were shown to be balanced and within the recommended limits for shrimp farming. Under the culture conditions adopted in this study, the commercial probiotic did not result in a significant effect (P >= 0.05) on water quality, bacteria, phytoplankton, or shrimp performance. Bacteria naturally present in biofloc were sufficient for maintaining the balance of culture and continued to exert excellent bioremediation and biocontrol when management was conducted properly.																	0718-560X	0717-7178				MAR	2017	45	1					167	176		10.3856/vol45-issue1-fulltext-16								WOS:000398127700016

Monthly measurements of oyster height were taken on 30 oysters randomly collected from each study site. Only oysters raised at Punta Pargo and Enfermeria reached the mean commercial size (> 40 mm) within the study period; these oysters were significantly larger than oysters raised at Canete and Jorobado. No significant differences in survival between the sites were observed. Punta Pargo and Enfermeria showed the best potential for oyster farming in the Bahia de Sagua area. Despite human impact on runoff caused by damming of the adjacent river, water quality remains acceptable for oyster cultivation. With proper stock management and production of selected fast-growing oysters in hatcheries, oyster farming can become an important aquaculture industry in Cuba.																	0718-560X	0717-7178				MAR	2017	45	1					218	222		10.3856/vol45-issue1-fulltext-24								WOS:000398127700024						
J	Perez-Santos, I				Perez-Santos, Ivan			Deep ventilation event during fall and winter 2015 in the Puyuhuapi Fjord (44.6 degrees S)	LATIN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC RESEARCH												The Puyuhuapi Fjord has previously been reported as one of the hypoxic fjords in Patagonia (dissolved oxygen -DO below 2 mL L-1). Hydrographic sampling between 1995-2015 confirmed hypoxia below 100 m depth, down to the bottom (250 m). A line of sensors at an oceanographic mooring in Puyuhuapi were deployed to continuously record the temporal-vertical behaviour of water column temperature and salinity from the surface down to. 120 m, from February to July 2015. A Multi-parameter water quality sonde was deployed at the bottom of the line, with a DO optical sensor. From February to mid-May, hypoxia was sustained (1.4-1.6 mL L-1). However, from May until the end of June, DO values increased (2.8 mL L-1), exceeding the hypoxia threshold. This was the first event of deep ventilation reported in a Patagonian fjord. During this time period, deep water temperatures increased by similar to 1.3 degrees C, coinciding with the decreased in salinity from 33.6 to 32.8. The main cause of this event was attributed to the arrival of a new volume of mixed oceanic water into the Fjord, transported by Modified Subantartic Water, with warm temperatures and slightly higher DO values, given its origin in the surface layer of the outer region of the Patagonian fjords and channels.

Here, we examined the impact of the Geum River estuary barrage, completed in 1990, on fish assemblages by using a literature search and fresh surveys of fishways in the barrage. We found that fish assemblages upstream and downstream of the barrage were altered following its completion. After construction, more species were found in the freshwater area, with a particularly great increase in freshwater species. Conversely, estuarine and marine species were only consistently caught in the downstream salt-water area, although the number of species increased. In total, 15,829 fish from 47 species and 20 families were identified at the three types (pool and weir, rubble type, and boat passage) of fishways in the barrage. The dominant species were Chelon haematocheilus, an estuarine species, Coilia nasus, a diadromous species, and Erythroculter erythropterus, a freshwater species. The mean total length of fish (101.9 +/- 76.0 mm) in the boat passage fishway was approximately 100 mm lesser than those in the pool and weir (207.2 +/- 112.8 mm) and rubble type (205.8 +/- 112.7 mm) fishways. The boat passage fishway was the most efficient for fish movements. The current fishway system is not sufficient for fish migration, and thus additional ways are required to improve the system such as the boat passage. Few estuarine or diadromous species were found in both freshwater and salt-water areas, but freshwater fishes that accidently moved to salt-water area actively used fishways. Therefore, fishway management in the Geum River estuary barrage has to focus on freshwater fish; however, this may need to change to a focus on migratory fishes depending on ecological life cycles of migratory fish.																	1738-5261	2005-7172				MAR	2017	52	1					147	164		10.1007/s12601-017-0015-6								WOS:000397134300013

First record of Prestauroneis tumida Levkov and accompanying species in Poland	OCEANOLOGICAL AND HYDROBIOLOGICAL STUDIES												The paper presents morphological and ecological characteristics of Prestauroneis tumida Levkov recorded for the first time in Poland. The diatom Prestauroneis tumida Levkov was found in the microbenthos of the Czarna Staszowska River (left tributary of the Vistula River, south-eastern Poland). This diatom species was present in the upper section of the river (sampling sites: 1-Drogowle, 2-Rakow) where saprobic state varied from oligosaprobic to beta-mesosaprobic. Dimensions of the valve were as follows: length 30-44 mu m, width 8-11 mu m and 13-16 striae in 10 mu m. Our research updates the morphological diversity data such as measurements of valves in terms of width and the number of striae. The accompanying species of Prestauroneis tumida belonged to the group of good water quality indicators, from oligo-to mesosaprobic ones. Some of the identified species were indicators of alkaline, calcium-rich waters.

Eight heavy metals including chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), arsenic (As), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and mercury (Hg) were determined using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). Among the tested heavy metals, Cd and Hg were detected in all surface water samples. The concentrations of Cr, Cd, Ni, and Pb were relatively lower than those of other metals in the four lakes. Results of Kohonen self-organizing map indicated that all the sampling sites in four lakes of the Great Rift Valley in Kenya could be classified into three different groups based on the heavy metal pollution. Lake Naivasha and Nakuru had characteristics of low concentrations of Cr, Ni, Cu, As, and Hg. Lake Bogoria was characterized by high levels of Ni, Cu, Cd, and Hg, and low levels of Pb, Cr, Zn, and As. Lake Elementaita showed characteristics of high concentrations of As and Hg and low concentrations of Pb, Ni, Cu, and Cd. Source identification using principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that anthropogenic factor played an increasingly important role in the heavy metal pollution of four lakes of the Great Rift Valley in Kenya, East Africa. Analysis of non-carcinogenic health risks of heavy metals indicated Hg and As in Lake Elementaita and Hg in Lake Bogoria may pose adverse health effects to local residents via ingestion route.

A meta-analysis with implications for restoration and management	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. There are strong conceptual links between riparian zones and freshwater fish via riparian influences on water quality, habitat quality and availability, and trophic dynamics. Many of the world's riparian zones are, however, severely degraded, and the key functions they provide for fish are lost or compromised. In response to their ongoing degradation, extensive works are underway globally to restore the structure and function of riparian zones. Despite intense effort, we lack clear empirical evidence of how fishes respond to changes in riparian zones. 2. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore how trout ( specifically brook, brown, cutthroat, rainbow and steelhead), fish with globally important social, cultural, economic and ecological value, respond to key drivers of riparian alteration. We also identified where and with which species current research is being undertaken and examined the broad characteristics of different studies (e.g. location, focal species, length of study, study design) to better understand potential knowledge gaps in our understanding of how trout respond to changes in riparian zones. 3. ISI Web of Science and Google Scholar were searched for relevant peer-reviewed studies, and from an initial 6514 papers, 55 were included in the formal meta-analysis. From these, we extracted data to calculate response ratios comparing biological attributes at sites with altered riparian characteristics to suitable unmanipulated control sites. We used linear mixed effects models to assess general and species-specific trout responses to eight key 'drivers' of change in riparian condition. 4. Most studies were undertaken in North America using control-impact designs. We found little evidence for species-specific responses to riparian change, and surprisingly, many drivers deemed important in the literature (e.g. revegetation, managed canopy removal, grazing, and forestry clearing) did not consistently influence trout population-or individual-level metrics. Nonetheless, trout populations did respond positively to increasing woody debris and livestock exclusion (+87.7 and +66.6% respectively), and negatively to bushfire and afforestation (-67.4 and -88.2% respectively). We found some evidence that positive riparian changes may just attract fish (i.e. increased abundance or density) rather than enhance actual population production (i.e. individual size and growth). While this conclusion necessarily needs to be interpreted with caution, it does suggest that targeted research on the 'production versus attraction' hypothesis would be beneficial. 5. Several key drivers of riparian change, such as revegetation activities, have been the focus of only limited research. More generally, long-term data are lacking for most drivers. Both of these key information gaps limit our ability to predict the likely timing and trajectory of responses to riparian management. Robust monitoring programmes in areas with altered riparian zones - particularly using BACI designs to allow changes to be attributed to management - are required. The knowledge gaps present for fishes as ecologically, socially and environmentally important as trout are likely to be even more pronounced for the majority of less-studied freshwater fish species.

Understanding spatial and environmental drivers of undisturbed stream assemblages is important for separating natural and human-induced changes, but has rarely been attempted for an entire tropical bioregion. 2. We sampled riffle macroinvertebrate assemblages and measured associated biophysical variables in post-wet and dry seasons from 68 streams of orders 1-5 across the Australian Wet Tropics, a small bioregion (18 497 km 2) defined by its warm moist climate and closed-forest vegetation. 3. As climate and landscape were relatively uniform across the bioregion, we predicted that assemblages would be similar, with turnover (beta diversity) unrelated to distance, and with composition determined mainly by habitat. 4. We identified 93 higher taxa. Density and richness of macroinvertebrates were greatest in the dry season because of habitat contraction and minimal flow disturbance. Richness was greatest in higher order streams. 5. Relative abundance and richness of functional groups showed minor effects of catchment, lithology and stream order, and a positive relationship with altitude for richness of collectors, predators and shredders, and for abundance of shredders. 6. Distance-based linear modelling showed that among-assemblage differences were explained by landscape-scale variables (9.5% of the variation), stream size (13.0%), riparian characteristics (9.6%), water quality (4.6%), substratum (21.1%) and organic resources (22.4%); for models of individual taxa and functional groups, habitat and organic-resource variables also predominated. 7. Similarities among site assemblages differed little among catchments and there was no relationship between pairwise similarities of catchments and their geographical distances. Nestedness analysis confirmed that samples and catchment groupings were nested subsets of the total set of samples. 8. Across the Australian Wet Tropics, uniformity of assemblages (identified to family or above) conformed to the bioregional classification, probably as a result of the great age of the region. The habitat variables that most influenced macroinvertebrate assemblages support the idea that a suite of biophysical influences is common to stream macroinvertebrate assemblages globally.

A rare Uroglena bloom in Beaver Lake, Arkansas, spring 2015. Lake Reserve Manage. 33:8-13.A combination of factors triggered a Uroglena volvox bloom and taste and odor event in Beaver Lake, a water-supply reservoir in northwest Arkansas, in late April 2015. Factors contributing to the bloom included increased rainfall and runoff containing increased concentrations of dissolved organic carbon, followed by a stable pool, low nutrient concentrations, and an expansion of lake surface area and littoral zone. This was the first time U. volvox was identified in Beaver Lake and the first time it was recognized as a source of taste and odor. Routine water quality samples happened to be collected by the US Geological Survey and the Beaver Water District throughout the reservoir during the bloom. Higher than normal rainfall in March 2015 increased the pool elevation in Beaver Lake by 2.3m (by early April), increased the surface area by 10%, and increased the littoral zone by 1214 ha; these conditions persisted for 38days, resulting from flood water being retained behind the dam. Monitoring programs that cover a wide range of reservoir features, including dissolved organic carbon, zooplankton, and phytoplankton, are valuable in explaining unusual events such as this Uroglena bloom.																	1040-2381	2151-5530				MAR	2017	33	1					8	13		10.1080/10402381.2016.1238427								WOS:000396042900002

Predicting cyanobacterial abundance, microcystin, and geosmin in a eutrophic drinking-water reservoir using a 14-year dataset	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Harris TD, Graham JL. 2017. Predicting cyanobacterial abundance, microcystin, and geosmin in a eutrophic drinking-water reservoir using a 14-year dataset. Lake Reserve Manage. 33:32-48.Cyanobacterial blooms degrade water quality in drinking water supply reservoirs by producing toxic and taste-and-odor causing secondary metabolites, which ultimately cause public health concerns and lead to increased treatment costs for water utilities. There have been numerous attempts to create models that predict cyanobacteria and their secondary metabolites, most using linear models; however, linear models are limited by assumptions about the data and have had limited success as predictive tools. Thus, lake and reservoir managers need improved modeling techniques that can accurately predict large bloom events that have the highest impact on recreational activities and drinking-water treatment processes. In this study, we compared 12 unique linear and nonlinear regression modeling techniques to predict cyanobacterial abundance and the cyanobacterial secondary metabolites microcystin and geosmin using 14years of physiochemical water quality data collected from Cheney Reservoir, Kansas. Support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), boosted tree (BT), and Cubist modeling techniques were the most predictive of the compared modeling approaches. SVM, RF, and BT modeling techniques were able to successfully predict cyanobacterial abundance, microcystin, and geosmin concentrations <60,000 cells/mL, 2.5 mu g/L, and 20ng/L, respectively. Only Cubist modeling predicted maxima concentrations of cyanobacteria and geosmin; no modeling technique was able to predict maxima microcystin concentrations. Because maxima concentrations are a primary concern for lake and reservoir managers, Cubist modeling may help predict the largest and most noxious concentrations of cyanobacteria and their secondary metabolites.																	1040-2381	2151-5530				MAR	2017	33	1					32	48		10.1080/10402381.2016.1263694								WOS:000396042900005

Seventeen years of grass carp: an examination of vegetation management and collateral impacts in Ball Pond, New Fairfield, Connecticut. Lake Reserve Manage. 33:84-100.Ball Pond is a 32ha meso-eutrophic lake located in the Marble Valley of Connecticut. The local bedrock geology and watershed influences have resulted in a hardwater system with limited plant community diversity and an assemblage dominated by the nonnative species Myriophyllum spicatum. By 1996, M. spicatum dominated 32% of the waterbody, and residents were concerned their property values would fall as the recreational value of the lake diminished. In an attempt to remedy this issue, 400 grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella; approximate to 30cm length) were released in 1997 at a rate of 38 per vegetated hectare. As a requirement of the state permit, the plant community, water quality, and the fish community were monitored throughout the initiative (1997-2014) to examine the impact of grass carp at multiple ecological levels of the lentic system. M. spicatum was significantly reduced in biomass and cover between 1997 and 2014, with no change in plant community richness. Concordant with the decrease in M. spicatum, the cover of Ceratophyllum demersum increased significantly and became more dominant in the plant community as M. spicatum was reduced. Our results also suggest there was no change in water quality or fish community density/diversity during the study period; however, fish community richness was reduced. Bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) density and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) size distribution both increased during this study. We assert that grass carp can be an effective approach to nonnative plant management in a northern meso-eutrophic lake.																	1040-2381	2151-5530				MAR	2017	33	1					84	100		10.1080/10402381.2017.1284966								WOS:000396042900009

Effects of omnivorous tilapia on water turbidity and primary production dynamics in shallow lakes: implications for ecosystem management	REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES												The introduction of omnivorous tilapia into a variety of aquatic systems worldwide has led to a number of serious ecological problems. One of the main issues is an increase in water turbidity, which affects not only light penetration but also primary production and the distribution of phytoplankton and benthic algae in shallow lakes. These changes cause deterioration of water quality in these lakes. A 12-week mesocosm experiment was set up to test the hypotheses that omnivorous Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) introduced to a shallow water system will increase turbidity and nutrient levels in the water column and thereby boost growth of phytoplankton and depress benthic algae. Relative to the control treatments, the presence of tilapia led to higher concentrations of total nitrogen and total phosphorus in the water column, greater biomass of phytoplankton as measured by chlorophyll a (Chl a), greater concentrations of total suspended solids and inorganic suspended solids, lower light intensity, and lower biomass of benthic algae at the sediment surface. A tube-microcosm experiment using P-32 radio tracer indicated that the presence of tilapia accelerated the release of sediment phosphorus (P) into the water column. We conclude that these invasive omnivorous fish not only stimulate growth of phytoplankton in shallow lakes by increasing nutrients in water column, but also depress benthic algal growth by promoting sediment resuspension, leading to increased turbidity of the water. Thus the removal of tilapia could be a useful practice for managers of shallow aquatic ecosystems, promoting benthic primary production and improving water clarity.

Influence of the colonizing substrate on diatom assemblages and implications for bioassessment: a mesocosm experiment	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												Although diatoms are important bioindicators of ecological quality, their ecological traits are still not well understood. A major issue is that of substrate preferences, which may result in differences in production, and assemblage structure and composition, and which should therefore be taken into account for ecological quality assessment studies. Thus, in this work, the periphyton grown on sand and ceramic tiles in indoor controlled channels were compared to understand whether substrate differences lead to differences in: periphyton production (chlorophyll-a), chlorophyll-b and c concentrations, diatom assemblages (diversity-Shannon-Wiener, cell density, taxonomic composition, trait proportions), and ecological quality assessments (IPS-'Indice de Polluosensibilit, Sp,cifique'). A combined inoculum of periphyton from four Portuguese streams was introduced to the running channels (six sand and six tile) and left to colonize for 35 days. Epilithic (tiles) and epipsammic (sand) assemblages were sampled at days 14 and 35. We verified that there were no differences in chlorophyll-a concentration over time and between substrates. On both sampling occasions, the epipsammic assemblages had higher concentration of chlorophyll-c and diatom density but without significant differences over time in each substrate. The taxonomic composition was different between substrates and over time. However, these differences were not reflected in ecological quality assessment. The diversity was also similar between substrates in both sampling occasions, but it was higher at day 14. Mobile and stalked species were more abundant over the entire study and differed significantly between substrates, with the epipsammic assemblages presenting higher abundances of both traits. We concluded that the colonizing substrate influences diatom assemblages but not the ecological quality assessment.

Although our understanding of how wastewater effluent impacts fish reproduction is growing, we know very little about how effluent affects non-reproductive physiology and behaviours associated with fitness (such as aggression and activity). To better understand how fish cope with chronic exposure to wastewater effluent in the wild, we caged round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) for three weeks at different distances from a wastewater outflow. We evaluated the effects of this exposure on fish survival, behaviour, metabolism, and respiratory traits. Fish caged inside the WWTP and close to the outfall experienced higher mortality than fish from the reference site. Interestingly, those fish that survived the exposure performed similarly to fish caged at the reference site in tests of aggressive behaviour, startle-responses, and dispersal. Moreover, the fish near WWTP outflow displayed similar resting metabolism (O-2 consumption rates), hypoxia tolerance, haemoglobin concentration, haematocrit, and blood-oxygen binding affinities as the fish from the more distant reference site.

We evaluated PO43-, as soluble reactive P (SRP), and NH4+ uptake in 2 chronically enriched Pampean streams with different macrophytic abundance. We performed short-term nutrient additions to quantify SRP and NH4+ uptake metrics throughout the year, and we investigated which hydrological and biological factors influenced nutrient uptake. The results showed that SRP and NH4+ uptakes were high in relation to pristine and impaired streams elsewhere, and they did not saturate despite elevated background nutrient levels. NH4+ areal uptake rate fit in a 1st-order uptake model, but an exponential model described the relationship between SRP areal uptake rate and SRP concentration. Consistent with this finding, SRP uptake velocity tended to increase linearly, and SRP uptake length decreased linearly with SRP concentration. The analysis of factors influencing uptake metrics suggested that SRP uptake mainly depended on heterotrophic demand, whereas NH4+ uptake was enhanced under more autotrophic conditions. Our results showed that nutrient uptake metrics of enriched Pampean streams were similar to those observed in streams with low nutrient levels.

The effects of urbanization on trophic relationships in constructed wetlands	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Constructed stormwater wetlands are one strategy for mitigating the negative effects of urbanization on aquatic ecosystems. However, the biotic community in these wetlands generally is dominated by organisms able to tolerate poor water quality. Reduced macroinvertebrate diversity and abundance in comparison to natural wetlands, and prevalence of invasive species, such as Gambusia, can influence the flow of energy through food webs. We used stable -isotope analysis (813C and 8'5N) of food webs to assess whether the amount of catchment urbanization (total imperviousness [imperviousness] = % catchment covered in impervious surfaces) influenced basal resources and trophic relationships in constructed wetlands in Melbourne, Australia. As imperviousness increased, the abundance and diversity of macroinvertebrates decreased significantly and the values of 813C and 815N recorded for fishes and macroinvertebrates increased significantly. An increase in imperviousness was associated with a decrease in the mean trophic position of fishes and an increase in the mean trophic position of macroinvertebrates. Our results suggest that sources of C differed between sites of low and high imperviousness and that N sources increased with increasing imperviousness. Our study provides an understanding of the likely consequences of disturbance associated with urbanization on the foodweb structure of constructed wetlands.																	2161-9549	2161-9565				MAR	2017	36	1					138	150		10.1086/690674								WOS:000394633500012

FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Current freshwater biomonitoring with diatoms is based on microscopic examination of the morphology of their silica skeleton. This standardized approach is time consuming and requires a high degree of taxonomic expertise. Metabarcoding combined with high-throughput sequencing (HTS) has great potential for next-generation biomonitoring applications but requires standardization. Molecular inventories are strongly influenced by the DNA extraction method used, but the effect of extraction protocols has not been tested to enable selection of the best DNA extraction method for HTS metabarcoding. We used 5 DNA extraction methods combining various types of cell lysis and DNA purification to extract DNA from 8 pure diatom cultures and 8 samples from streams and lakes with differing water quality. We compared the methods based on: 1) quality and purity of the extracted DNA, 2) community inventories obtained from HTS targeting the ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase (rbcL) barcode, and 3) similarity between molecular and microscopy-based inventories of community composition and the Specific Pollution sensitivity Index [SPI]. A method based on GenEluteTM-LPA had higher extraction efficiency than the 4 commercial kits but had the highest polymerase chain reaction inhibition level. All 5 methods were efficient for HTS, and method did not affect operational taxonomic unit richness. We observed variations in the relative abundance of some taxa within Nitzschia, Amphora, Encyonerna, Gomphonema, and Navicula between 2 of the 5 methods, but method did not affect global diatom community composition or SPI values. SPI values calculated from microscopy-based inventories and molecular inventories based on all 5 extraction methods were strongly correlated. For convenience purposes (high DNA quantity and low cost), we encourage standardization of FITS diatom biomonitoring based on the SA-Gen method.

Density-dependent water use in carp polyculture: Impacts on production performance and water productivity	AQUACULTURE												The total water use (TWU) and consumptive water use index (CWUI) in carp polyculture under varying intensity levels [T-1: 6000 fingerlings ha(-1), T-2: 8000 fingerlings ha(-1), T-3: 10,000 fingerlings ha(-1)] were quantified. Treatment-wise estimated TWU was 3.71 x 10(4), 3.92 x 10(4) and 4.34 x 10(4) m(3) hat 180 d(-1) while, the CWUI was 6.38, 5.61 and 5.89 m(3) kg(-1) fish production in T-1, T-2 and T-3, respectively. The estimated evaporation and seepage loss ranged between 2.1-3.1 and 1.9-2.8 m(3) water kg(-1) fish production respectively and contributed significantly to consumptive water use (CWU). Treatment-wise sediment load ranged between 57.1 and 61.1 m(3) t(-1) fish biomass. Faster growth rate and biomass contribution (%) to yield was maximum by C. catla followed by C. mrigala and L. rohita in all the treatments. In this study, under best management practice (T-2),1 m(3) of water produced 178 g of carp biomass and its economic value per unit of water used (USD m(-3)) greatly exceeds that of T-1 and T-3. Among the treatments, minimization of total water use (3.92 x 10(4) m(3)), CWU (2.03 x 10(4) m(3)) and water exchange (0.20 x 10(4) m(3)) at stocking density of 8000 fingerlings ha(-1) (T-2), resulted in higher (P < 0.05) yield (3.62 t ha(-1) 180 d(-1)), output value-cost of cultivation ratio (1.88), net consumptive water productivity (USD 0.15 m(-3)) and lower AFCR (1.74). Further, farming systems with low water exchange, serves to keep the water quality suitable for the fish growth, improves water use efficiency and helps in minimizing the quantity of pollutant outputs. Statement of relevance: This paper presents findings and analysis, from a methodologically rigorous investigation and provides insight regarding density-dependent optimum water use, its effect on pond water quality, sedimentation rate, growth performance and water productivity. The knowledge derived from this study may be a basis to optimize pond rearing efforts in carp polyculture and the water management strategies can be tailored to prevent wasteful use of water and enhance water use efficiency and water productivity.

However, confinement is a factor that favors the occurrence of diseases. This study aimed to report the parasitic fauna of ornamental fish from three facilities, as well as to observe the histological pathogenesis caused by the parasites. Between May 2015 and February 2016, a total of 781 ornamental fishes were used for parasitological and histopathological analysis. Water quality was measured in fishponds from each facility. Ciliate protozoans Ichthyophthirius multifiliis; Trichodina sp.; the monogeneans Dactylogyrus extensus, D. minutus and Diaphorocleidus kabatai; metacercariae of the digeneans; the cestode Bothriocephalus acheilognathi; the nematode Rhabdochona sp.; and the branchiuran Argulus japonicus were found in the examined fish. The greatest prevalence and mean intensity was observed in the gills of Gymnocolymbus ternetzi parasitized by D. kabatai, followed by the protozoan parasite I. multifiliis on the body surface of Xiphophorus maculatus. Histopathological analysis showed epithelial interlamellar hyperplasia of the secondary lamellae, partial fusion of the secondary lamellae, telangiectasia, justalamellar edema and eosinophilic inflammatory infiltrate. The intestine of cestode parasitized fish showed necrosis in the submucosa, intestinal obstruction and lymphoeosinophilic inflammatory infiltrate. It is important to know the parasitic fauna of farmed fish and the pathogenesis caused by the parasites in order to ensure fish production and the health of the hosts. Statement of relevance: Ornamental fish production as a consolidate activity around the world faces problems of parasite infection leading to fish mortality and economic losses. To ensure farming production, it is important to monitor the status of fish health. Parasitic fauna and histopathological analysis are used as important tools for the diagnosis of tissue lesions.

J	Broyer, J; Chavas, G; Chazal, R				Broyer, Joel; Chavas, Gilles; Chazal, Romain			The effects of cessation of fish farming on duck breeding in French fishpond systems	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Fishponds are man-made aquatic systems subjected to more or less active management by fish farmers. They also are an important habitat category for waterbirds. In this study, we attempted to assess the consequences for duck breeding of fish farming interruption in a typical French fishpond region, the Forez, where fish production has declined strongly since the 1990s. Duck pair density, a brood: pair ratio and mean brood size were studied in two successive periods, 2010-2012 and 2013-2015, in 19 ponds abandoned for fish farming between 2008 and 2010, and in 34 ponds still stocked with fish among which 17 were harvested every 2 or 3 years and 17 harvested annually. Between the two study periods, a decrease in abandoned ponds was observed in diving duck (Aythya species) and red-crested pochard Netta rufina pair density and for dabbling duck (Anas species) and red-crested pochard brood: pair ratio. A possible explanation is that fish influenced the nutrient level within the aquatic ecosystem through bioresuspension of phosphorus when stirring the sediment for feeding and through nitrogen production by excretions. Decreased brood sizes in ponds still used for traditional fish farming are suggested to be the result of density-dependent predation rates.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR	2017	788	1					47	53		10.1007/s10750-016-2985-2								WOS:000392386500004						
J	Al Jawaheri, R; Sahlen, G				Al Jawaheri, Raad; Sahlen, Goran			Negative impact of lake liming programmes on the species richness of dragonflies (Odonata): a study from southern Sweden	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Liming programmes aiming to restore fish populations are being implemented in many acidified aquatic systems in northern Europe. We studied Odonata communities in 47 forest lakes in SW Sweden, 13 that are currently being limed, and 8 that have previously been limed. Thirty-one species were recorded, with the highest mean number in untreated lakes, followed by previously treated lakes and currently treated lakes. Species communities differed between untreated and limed lakes, but only few rare species found in the untreated lakes were absent in the treated lakes. Likewise, species known to thrive in acid environments were either rare or showed no preferences. Comparing the number of records of odonate species within a large regional area to the proportion of lakes inhabited in our study, we found that seven of the most commonly observed species occurred less frequently in limed lakes than in the untreated ones, including two of the three most common taxa. Reduced species numbers in limed lakes might be due to conditions on other trophic levels, including fish predation. We argue that Odonata should be considered when developing new biological indices of water quality, although the causes of the observed occurrence patterns need to be studied further.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR	2017	788	1					99	113		10.1007/s10750-016-2990-5								WOS:000392386500009

Jack; Rains, Christine			Satellite detection of wastewater diversion plumes in Southern California	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Multi-sensor satellite observations proved useful in detecting surfacing wastewater plumes during the 2006 Hyperion Treatment Plant (HTP) and 2012 Orange County Sanitation District (OCSD) wastewater diversion events in Southern California. Satellite sensors were capable of detecting biophysical signatures associated with the wastewater, compared to ambient ocean waters, enabling monitoring of environmental impacts over a greater spatial extent than in situ sampling alone. Thermal satellite sensors measured decreased sea surface temperatures (SSTs) associated with the surfacing plumes. Ocean color satellite sensors did not measure a distinguishable biological response in terms of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentrations during the short lived, three-day long, 2006 HTP diversion. A period of decreased chl-a concentration was observed during the three-week long 2012 OCSD diversion, likely in association with enhanced chlorination of the discharged wastewater that suppressed the phytoplankton response and/or significant uptake by heterotrophic bacteria. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite data were able to identify and track the 2006 HTP wastewater plume through changes in surface roughness related to the oily components of the treated surfacing wastewater. Overall, it was found that chl-a and SST values must have differences of at least 1 mg m(-3) and 0.5 degrees C, respectively, in comparison with adjacent waters for wastewater plumes and their biophysical impact to be detectable from satellite. For a wastewater plume to be identifiable in SAR imagery, wind speeds must range between similar to 3 and 8 m s(-1). The findings of this study illustrate the benefit of utilizing multiple satellite sensors to monitor the rapidly changing environmental response to surfacing wastewater plumes, and can help inform future wastewater diversions in coastal areas.

J	Balci, M; Balkis, N				Balci, Muharrem; Balkis, Neslihan			Assessment of phytoplankton and environmental variables for water quality and trophic state classification in the Gemlik Gulf, Marmara Sea (Turkey)	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Phytoplankton assemblages related to environmental factors and ecological status of the Gemlik Gulf were investigated between June 2010 and May 2011. A total 155 phytoplankton species were detected and 6 taxa (Amphisolenia laticincta, Archaeperidinium minutum, Cochlodinium sp., Gynogonadinium aequatoriale, Heterocapsa rotundata and Metaphalacroma sp.) were new records for the Turkish Seas. The lowest and highest total phytoplankton abundance among the sampling units (depths) was recorded in April 2011 (7.4 x 10(3) cells L-1) and July 2010 (251.8 x 10(3) cells L-1). Local small patches of visible red tide events were detected especially in the gulf, although a phytoplankton bloom was not observed. The water column was well stratified in the early autumn and well mixed in the early spring according to stratification index values. Surface nutrient concentrations increased especially at stations located inside of the gulf. The limiting effect of silicate was observed in early, midsummer and early winter periods while the nitrogen was the limiting nutrient in the gulf during the whole sampling period. In the Gulf, low water quality-high mesotrophic and bad water quality-eutrophic status, high quality and low trophic level were generally detected according to Chl a, dissolved oxygen and trophic index. However, indices developed to determine the trophic level and water quality of the Mediterranean Sea can give unexpected results about the current environmental quality status when it is applied to the Marmara Sea which has limited photic zone by the halocline-pycnocline and thermocline.

MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Occurrence of algal blooms in coastal waters is predicted to be more prevalent in future. To minimize their occurrence, manipulating the grazing pressure by suspension feeders is a potential management strategy, but its effectiveness may depend on their feeding preference. Therefore, we assessed the clearance rate of a widespread serpulid polychaete Hydroides elegans in larval and adult stages on various coastal phytoplankton. Additionally, the growth and development of H. elegans after consuming these phytoplankton were determined to reflect its sustainability to counter algal blooms. Results showed that H. elegans can consume and utilize different phytoplankton, except diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana, for growth and development in both life stages. Given the fast-colonizing ability which allows easy manipulation of abundance, H. elegans is considered practically and biologically ideal for tackling algal blooms. Other suspension feeders with different feeding niches could be used in combination to maximize the versatility of the top-down control. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Differences in the structure of copepod assemblages in four tropical estuaries: Importance of pollution and the estuary hydrodynamics	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												We examined the relationship between pollution and structure of copepod assemblages in estuaries, using sampling standardization of salinity range to reduce the effects of "Estuarine Quality Paradox". Copepod assemblages were analyzed in four Southeast Brazilian estuaries with different water quality levels and different hydrodynamic characteristics. The pollution negatively impacted the descriptors of the assemblage structure. The distribution of structure of copepod assemblages also showed a main separation trend between the most polluted estuaries and those less polluted. Temperature was the main factor affecting the assemblage structuring in the four estuaries. This factor acted in synergism with the effects of pollution impact and physical characteristics of the estuaries on the structure of copepod assemblages, supporting the potential vulnerability of coastal environments due to nutrient enrichment associated with climate change. Our study demonstrated the importance of sampling standardization of the salinity range in estuaries for reliable analysis of pollution effects on biota. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

At the densely inhabited Port Blair Bay, the dominance of mixotrophs in water and Protoperidinoids in sediments was attributed to anthropogenic nutrient enrichment and prey availability. A significant decrease in dinoflagellate abundance from inner to outer bay emphasize the variation in nutrient availability. The dominance of autotrophs and Gonyaulacoid cysts at the North Bay highlight low nutrient conditions with less anthropogenic pressure. The occurrence of oceanic Omithocercus steinii and Diplopsalis sp. could evince the oceanic water intrusion into the North Bay. Nine potentially harmful and red-tide-forming species including Alexandrium tamarense complex, A. minutum were identified in this study. Although there are no harmful algal bloom (HABs) incidences in this region so far, increasing coastal pollution could support their candidature towards the future HABs initiation and development.

Specific features, such as constricted areas, can potentially affect and energize the hydrodynamics of these types of systems. Particularly, tidal range and tidal currents can be significantly amplified where the incoming tidal wave becomes constricted. In this work, the impact of a narrow constriction on a mesotidal estuary was analysed at tidal and subtidal time scales. Tidal hydrodynamics, energy fluxes and energy dissipation were determined for the entire Cadiz Bay (southwestern Spain) using the Delft3D numerical model. Field observations were used to analyse tidal propagation and energy dissipation along the bay constriction and to calibrate and test the numerical model. The results indicate that the presence of the constriction transformed and distorted the tide and increased the tidal range and flow velocities along the channel, with implications on energy dissipation. The tidal currents were oriented along-channel at the central part of the constriction, although abrupt bathymetric changes at the channel inner boundary provoked a sudden rotation of the flow. Although the energy fluxes were higher for spring tides and were strongly influenced by winds, the energy dissipation was controlled by bed shear stresses and vertical dispersion. The significance of this energy dissipation was that it destabilized the water column, which resulted in a weakly stratified system with implications on water quality. At a subtidal scale, the residual water volume exchange was the result of the combined effects of the neap/spring tides, wind and waves, whereas tides were dominant at the tidal scale.

An exception to this success story is Old Tampa Bay, the northernmost subestuary of the system. Compared to the other bay segments, Old Tampa Bay is characterized by poorer water quality and spring and summer blooms of cyanobacteria, pico-plankton, diatoms, and the saxitoxin-producing dinoflagellate Pyrodinium bahamense. Together, these blooms contribute to light attenuation and lagging recovery of seagrass beds. Yet, studies of phytoplankton dynamics within Old Tampa Bay have been limited both in number and in their spatiotemporal resolution. In this, study, we used field sampling and continuous monitoring to (1) characterize temporal and spatial variability in phytoplankton biomass and community composition and (2) identify key drivers of the different phytoplankton blooms in Old Tampa Bay. Overall, temporal variability in phytoplankton biomass (using chlorophyll a as a proxy) and community composition surpassed spatial variability of these parameters. We found a base community of small diatoms and flagellates, as well as certain dinoflagellates, that persisted year round in the system. Seasonally, freshwater runoff stimulated phytoplankton growth, specifically that of chlorophytes, cyanobacteria and other dinoflagellates consistent with predictions based on ecological theory. On shorter time scales, salinity, visibility, and freshwater inflows were important predictors of phytoplankton biomass. With respect to P. bahamense, environmental drivers including salinity, temperature and dissolved nutrient concentrations explained 24% of the variability in cell abundance, indicating missing explanatory parameters in our study for this taxon, such as cyst density and location of cyst beds. Spatially, we found differences in community trajectories across north south and west east gradients, with the northernmost sampling station being the most unique in the region. This work contributes to the knowledge of phytoplankton biomass and community composition in Tampa Bay by generating spatially and temporally rich phytoplankton community and environmental data for the Old Tampa Bay subestuary. Moreover, it enhances our understanding of bloom drivers and provides recommendations for ecosystem management. Specifically, our findings support continued nutrient reduction measures as a way to mitigate seasonal blooms of diatoms, cyanobacteria and chlorophytes, but not necessarily blooms of P. bahamense. Prediction and mitigation of P. bahamnese blooms should incorporate first order drivers such as cyst location and abundance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Feeding competition between the native oyster Crassostrea virginica and the invasive mussel Mytella charruana	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The sub-tropical mussel Mytella charruana has been reported as invasive along the southeast coast of the USA since 1986. This mussel has been found to negatively impact the keystone species in its invaded range, the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica. To date, however, no mechanism for this negative impact has been determined. To elucidate the role of the invasive mussel on economically important oyster reefs, we compared the feeding of both species in a lagoon along the east coast of Florida (USA). Three different methodologies were used: (1) in situ filter-feeding experiments using the biodeposition method to estimate feeding behavior; (2) laboratory assays to estimate the depletion of bacterial particles using a flow cytometer; and (3) stable isotope analysis in conjunction with ellipse-based metrics to investigate the niche size and overlap of these 2 species. The in situ filter-feeding experiments revealed that, compared to C. virginica, M. charruana had significantly higher clearance, filtration, rejection, organic ingestion, and ab sorption rates, as well as higher rejection percentage and absorption efficiency, but rejected the same amount of inorganic particles. Flow cytometry data suggested that bacteria were a food source for both bivalve species. Stable isotope values confirmed that M. charruana and C. virginica filled similar functional niches in this ecosystem. These results suggest that M. charruana can out-compete native oysters; the findings also demonstrate that an invasion of M. charruana might significantly alter plankton abundance, potentially limiting food sources available to other less efficient native filter-feeders such as clams.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				FEB 3	2017	564						57	66		10.3354/meps11976								WOS:000400661400005

Effects of organic pollution on environmental conditions and the phytoplankton community in the central Lebanese coastal waters with special attention to toxic algae	REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE												Organic pollution is a major global environmental issue for coastal ecosystems. In order to assess the effects of this pollution, environmental parameters and phytoplankton community were monitored during a two-year period (from April 2010 till March 2012) in the central coast of Lebanon in the Levantine Sub-basin. Data were collected for temperature, salinity, nutrients, chlorophyll-a and phytoplankton community. Temperature followed its normal seasonal and annual cycles, usually noted in the Lebanese coastal waters, whereas salinity varied spatially and temporally presenting sometimes low values due to continental inputs (19.07-39.6). Significant fluctuations of nutrients (N-NO2 = 0.004-4.28 mu M L-1; N-NO3 = 0.25-39.15 mu M L-1; P-PO4 = 0.014-5.77 mu M L-1), Chl-a concentrations (0.03-8.9 mg/m(3)) and density of total phytoplanktonic cells (40383-22.10(6) cells/L) were observed between the sites and through the years (P < 0.05). Environmental conditions were largely influenced by continental inputs. A perturbation of the natural phytoplanktonic succession and an occurrence of toxic or potentially harmful algae were noticed in the polluted sites, reflecting the influence of wastewater effluents on the coastal seawater equilibrium and thus on the Lebanese marine biodiversity. The overall study provides a good outline on the prevailing condition of few coastal areas which could facilitate the management of their pollution sources. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we examined three sandy disturbed beaches (including two artificial beaches) on three different sides of the island (artificial Ginowan Tropical Beach on the west coast, artificial Azama San-san Beach on the east coast, public Odo John Man Beach on the south coast) to investigate if differences exist in the environment and crustacean biota between paired disturbed and natural beaches. We conducted seasonal surveys (n = 4 surveys) by placing quadrats at three paired locations (artificial/disturbed and natural beaches at each location, to collect and record the diversity of infaunal crustacean (isopods and amphipods) taxa. Amphipods and isopods are basal parts of the food chain and therefore many marine creatures' diets contain them directly or indirectly, and they have been used in many studies as bioindicators. As well, environmental parameters including sand grain size, water temperature, and seawater quality (salinity, dissolved oxygen content, particulate organic matter, turbidity, conductivity, pH, phosphate, nitrite, nitrate, ammonium levels) were obtained from each site during each survey. The results showed that while water nutrients, sand composition, and water quality were very similar between paired disturbed and natural beaches, disturbed beaches had significantly less biodiversity. These results show that despite no obvious effects on water nutrients or quality, disturbed and artificial beaches influence the infaunal crustacean biodiversity/community in the classic manner of a disturbance. Furthermore, our results indicate that amphipods may be better indicators of disturbance compared to isopods, as the numbers of isopods were too low to be used in statistically robust analyses. With increasing tourism and corresponding development of artificial beaches in Okinawa Island, it is clear more research needs to be done on this subject. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Environmental characterization of a Mediterranean protected shallow brackish coastal aquatic system, Klisova Lagoon, Western Greece: a case study	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												The Klisova lagoon aquatic system belongs to the wetland of Messolonghi - Aetoliko - Klisova Lagoon Complex, located in the western Greece and represents one of the most important Mediterranean lagoon systems, as it is protected by international conventions and is listed in the Natura 2000 European Network. Water physicochemical parameters such as pH, temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, nutrients definition, TOC, TN and bacteriological indicators (E.coli and Enterococcus spp.) were analyzed in a time period of 1 year monthly monitoring in five sampling sites along the lagoon. The geographical distribution of these parameters show a clear zonation and partition of the lagoon as the result of: (a) the discharging of poorly treated wastes into the lagoon of Mesolonghi city waste water treatment plant and (b) the interplay between sea water influence via the lagoon inlet and the fresh water inflow via lagoon's perimeter channels. The lagoon is characterized by seasonal hypoxic conditions, which are responsible for several ecological socks in the past including fish mortalities. The system is threatened by human interference and sedimentological processes such as the longshore drifting and siltation of the lagoon inlet. Measurements should immediately be taken in order to prevent further downgrading of the water quality.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				FEB	2017	21	1					115	125		10.1007/s11852-016-0476-2								WOS:000399030200010						
J	Rosinska, J; Rybak, M; Goldyn, R				Rosinska, Joanna; Rybak, Michal; Goldyn, Ryszard			Patterns of macrophyte community recovery as a result of the restoration of a shallow urban lake	AQUATIC BOTANY												Restoration of urban lakes becomes necessary to slow down unfavourable processes and to recover their recreational role. Macrophyte communities are good bioindicators, thus they can be used to assess the effectiveness of restoration. The aim of the study was to determine the dynamics and patternof macrophyte recovery as a result of the restoration measures in a degraded shallow urban lake characterized by strong cyanobacterial blooms. Annual changes in the composition and areal coverage of littoral macrophyte phytocoenoses, and in the Ecological State Macrophyte Indexwere recorded using a GPS and the ArcGIS programme and analysed in relation to changes in water quality for three years following restoration measures (phosphorus inactivation, aeration, and biomanipulation). The shifts were statistically significant in the first two for total nitrogenconcentrationand three years for chlorophyll aconcentration, whereas total phosphorus concentration only decreased significantly in the third year. Changes in water transparency were not significant. The ecological status of the lakewas good or moderate. A characteristic pattern of recovery was observed. Phytocenotic richness increased (from 9 to 12 communities) and total phytolittoral area decreased (from 42 to 37 ha, i.e. 12%) during restoration efforts. The area of hypereutrophic plant communities (Ceratophyl-letumdemersi, Hydrocharitetummorsus-ranae, Typhetumangustifoliae) decreased, the former submerged community returned (Potametumlucends) and the area of some existing communities (e.g. nympheids) increased. Slow return of elodeidswas caused by low transparency andlack of submerged vegetation propagules, which are the most probable limiting factors of the recolonization process. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The effluents of the Montpellier wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) represented the main nutrient input. To improve the water quality of these lagoons, this WWTP was renovated and upgraded and, since the end of 2005, its effluents have been discharged 11km offshore into the Mediterranean (total investment Euro150M). Possibilities of ecosystem restoration as part of a conservation programme were explored by a focus group of experts. Their tasks were: (i) to evaluate the impact of the reduction of the nutrient input; (ii) if necessary, to design additional measures for an active restoration programme; and (iii) to predict ecosystem trajectories for the different cases. Extension of Magnoliophyta meadows can be taken as a proxy for ecosystem restoration as they favour the increase of several fish (seahorse) and bird (ducks, swans, herons) species, albeit they represent a trade-off for greater flamingos. Additional measures for active ecosystem restoration were only recommended for the most impaired lagoon Mejean, while the least impaired lagoon Ingril is already on a trajectory of spontaneous recovery. A multiple contingent valuation considering four different management options for the Mejean lagoon was used in a pilot study based on face-to-face interviews with 159 respondents. Three levels of ecosystem restoration were expressed in terms of recovery of Magnoliophyta meadows, including their impact on emblematic fish and avifauna. These were combined with different options for access (status quo, increasing access, increasing access with measures to reduce disturbance). The results show a willingness of local populations to pay per year about Euro25 for the highest level of ecological restoration, while they were only willing to allocate about Euro5 for additional footpaths and hides.

J	Dutertre, M; Ernande, B; Haure, J; Barille, L				Dutertre, Mickael; Ernande, Bruno; Haure, Joel; Barille, Laurent			Spatial and temporal adjustments in gill and palp size in the oyster Crassostrea gigas	JOURNAL OF MOLLUSCAN STUDIES												Spatial and temporal variations in gill and palp size were studied during 1 year in naturally-settled populations of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, reciprocally transplanted between two contrasting sites located along a marked gradient of turbidity conditions. The variability of suspended particulate matter (SPM) and food particles, estimated by the concentration of chlorophyll-a, was measured with in situ water-quality probes. Over a full seasonal cycle, oysters exposed to high-turbidity (HT) conditions exhibited a lower gillto- palp (G:P) ratio, compared with those exposed to low-turbidity (LT) conditions. Seasonal variations in the G: P ratio were observed at the LT site in relation to the spring phytoplanktonic bloom, but differed from those that had been observed previously. In fact, palp enlargement and gill narrowing (lower seasonal G:P ratio) suggest that oysters improved their pre-ingestive selection efficiency as a priority, rather than their filtering capacity. This result indicates that suspension-feeding bivalves do not have independent plastic responses of their foraging structures to either SPM quality or quantity, and that the direction of variations in the G:P ratio depends on the combination of these two factors. At the HT site, no seasonal pattern was observed in the G:P ratio. This can be explained by the strong hourly variations in SPM and chlorophyll-a, associated with tidal cycles, with daily variations that can be similar to those observed over a year. Reciprocal transplantations showed that oysters originating from the same site can differ in their feeding apparatus morphology when they grow in different environments and that temporal variations in the G:P ratio of oysters transplanted to a new environment converge towards that of individuals that have spent their entire life in this environment. Variations in the relative gill and palp sizes of C. gigas appear therefore to be partly the consequence of reversible phenotypic plasticity in response to spatial and temporal variations in SPM quantity and quality. The results also suggest that the limits and dynamics of gill and palp plasticity are dependent on the origin of oyster populations. Considering its role in the exploitation of different trophic conditions, and consequently in the biological performances (growth and reproduction), plasticity in the feeding apparatus morphology of C. gigas could be a determinant in the establishment of invasive populations in new ecosystems or in the management of farmed oysters.

Abstraction can alter the hydrological regime of streams and rivers, reduce in-stream habitats, change water quality and affect fluvial communities. It can also impair ecosystem functioning, although this aspect has been seldom assessed. We experimentally tested the effect of water abstraction on stream functioning in a headwater mountain stream using a before and after control-impact (BACI) design. We quantified changes in water physicochemical properties, biofilm biomass and activity (exo-enzymes and metabolism), and ecosystem processes (nutrient cycling, organic matter retention and breakdown). Water abstraction did not affect water physicochemical properties, but reduced the biomass and the alkaline phosphatase activity of biofilm per surface unit, the areal uptake of nutrients, and the travel distance of organic matter. It did not affect the biofilm metabolism and breakdown of submerged leaf litter, but decreased the total breakdown. The impacts were larger when analysed per unit of channel length. All variables, except benthic chlorophyll-a, were significantly reduced by abstraction, due to the contraction of the wetted channel. The decrease in the biomass and activity of biofilm, as well as in nutrient uptake and total organic matter breakdown observed in this study could increase nutrient concentration in downstream reaches and reduce the energy transfer to higher trophic levels. Ecosystem services of permanent headwater streams are likely to be compromised with the reduction of wetted-channel width.

Pelagic phytoplankton community change-points across nutrient gradients and in response to invasive mussels	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Phytoplankton communities can experience nonlinear responses to changing nutrient concentrations, but the nature of species shifts within phytoplankton is not well understood and few studies have explored responses of pelagic assemblages in large lakes. Using pelagic phytoplankton data from the Great Lakes, we assessed phytoplankton assemblage change-point responses to nutrients and invasive Dreissena, characterising community responses in a multi-stressor environment and determine whether species responses to insitu nutrients can be approximated from nutrient loading. We demonstrate assemblage shifts in phytoplankton communities along major stressor gradients, particularly prominent in spring assemblages, providing insight into community thresholds at the lower end of the phosphorus gradient and species-stressor responses in a multi-stressor environment. We show that responses to water nutrient concentrations could not be estimated from large-scale nutrient loading data likely due to lake-specific retention time and long-term accumulation of nutrients. These findings highlight the potential for significant accumulation of nitrates in ultra-oligotrophic systems, nonlinear responses of phytoplankton at nutrient concentrations relevant to current water quality standards and system-specific (e.g. lake or ecozone) differences in phytoplankton responses likely due to differences in nutrient co-limitation and effects of dreissenids.

Researcher disciplines and the assessment techniques used to evaluate Laurentian Great Lakes coastal ecosystems	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The Laurentian Great Lakes of North America have been a focus of environmental and ecosystem research since the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement in 1972. This study provides a review of scientific literature directed at the assessment of Laurentian Great Lakes coastal ecosystems. Our aim was to understand the methods employed to quantify disturbance and ecosystem quality within Laurentian Great Lakes coastal ecosystems within the last 20 years. We focused specifically on evidence of multidisciplinary articles, in authorship or types of assessment parameters used. We sought to uncover: 1) where Laurentian Great Lakes coastal ecosystems are investigated, 2) how patterns in the disciplines of researchers have shifted over time, 3) how measured parameters differed among disciplines, and 4) which parameters were used most often. Results indicate research was conducted almost evenly across the five Laurentian Great Lakes and that publication of coastal ecosystems studies increased dramatically ten years after the first State of the Great Lakes Ecosystem Conference in 1994. Research authored by environmental scientists and by multiple disciplines (multidisciplinary) have become more prevalent since 2003. This study supports the likelihood that communication and knowledge-sharing is happening between disciplines on some level. Multidisciplinary or environmental science articles were the most inclusive of parameters from different disciplines, but every discipline seemed to include chemical parameters less often than biota, physical, and spatial parameters. There is a need for an increased understanding of minor nutrient, toxin, and heavy metal impacts and use of spatial metrics in Laurentian Great Lakes coastal ecosystems.

Here we apply a climate change "test" to a framework for estimating the amount of agricultural conservation practices needed to achieve desired fish conservation outcomes for four watersheds in the Saginaw Bay region of Michigan, USA. We developed three climate scenarios from global climate model outputs (high emissions scenario, "2080s" timeframe) to provide insight on potential impacts of a climate driver that represents a key uncertainty for this management system, the amount and timing of spring and summer precipitation. These scenarios were used as inputs to agricultural watershed models, which produced water quality outputs that we compared to thresholds in fish biodiversity metrics at the subwatershed scale. Our results suggest that impacts of climate change on evaporation rates and other aspects of hydrology will shift the relative importance of key stressors for fish (i.e., sediment loadings vs. nutrient concentrations) across these different watersheds, highlighting the need to design resilient implementation plans and policies. Overall, we found that changes in climate are likely to increase the need for agricultural conservation practices, but that increasing the implementation rate above current levels will likely remain a good investment under current and future climate conditions.

Mussel-derived stimulation of benthic filamentous algae: The importance of nutrients and spatial scale	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The reoccurrence of benthic filamentous algal (FA) blooms in the Great Lakes, without associated increases in phosphorus loading, has stimulated renewed interest in determining the causes of Great Lakes benthic algal blooms. We investigated the potential roles of invasive mussels and nutrient limitation with experimental substrata within inner Saginaw Bay. FA abundance on live mussel substrata was typically significantly greater than that on inert (empty shell or rock) substrata. Nutrient addition (from an artificial source) significantly increased FA abundance on inert substrata. These results suggest that: 1) mussel nutrient excretion could be a primary stimulatory mechanism; 2) mussel-mediated stimulation may be even stronger in other, more oligotrophic, Great Lakes nearshore zones; and 3) increased nutrient loading to inner Saginaw Bay may exacerbate existing FA blooms. FA abundance on inert substrata was not affected, even in close proximity to mussels, indicating that the observed stimulatory effect of mussel-derived P on live mussels attenuated at very small spatial scales, on the order of centimeters or less.

A depth-adjusted ambient distribution approach for setting numeric removal targets for a Great Lakes Area of Concern beneficial use impairment: Degraded benthos	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We compiled macroinvertebrate data collected from 1995 to 2014 from the St. Louis River Area of Concern (AOC) of Lake Superior. Our objective was to define depth-adjusted cutoff values for benthos condition classes to provide an analytical tool for quantifying progress toward achieving removal targets for the degraded benthos beneficial use impairment. We used quantile regression to model the limiting effect of depth on selected benthos metrics, including taxa richness, percent non-oligochaete individuals, combined percent Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera, and Odonata individuals, and density of ephemerid mayfly nymphs (Hexagenia). We created a scaled trimetric index from the first three metrics. Metric values above the 75th percentile quantile regression model prediction were defined as being in relatively excellent condition in the context of the degraded beneficial use impairment for that depth. We set the cutoff between good and fair condition as the 50th percentile model prediction, and we set the cutoff between fair and poor condition as the 25th percentile model prediction. We examined sampler type, geographic zone, and substrate type for confounding effects. Based on these analyses we combined data across sampler types and created separate models for each of three geographic zones. We used the resulting condition-class cutoff values to determine the relative benthic condition for three adjacent habitat restoration project areas. The depth-limited pattern of ephemerid abundance we observed in the St. Louis River AOC also occurred elsewhere in the Great Lakes. We provide tabulated model predictions for application of our depth-adjusted condition class cutoff values to new sample data.

Condition factor, Length - Weight relationship, and the fishery of Barbus altianalis (Boulenger 1900) in Lakes Victoria and Edward basins of Uganda	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												The condition, fishing effort and environmental parameters signify health of fish populations. This study characterized differences in water quality and fishing effort in the lacustrine and riverine systems of the River Nile, Lake Edward and Kazinga channel in Uganda. One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to test for differences in mean relative condition among populations in the water bodies exposed to different levels of fishing effort and water quality conditions. There were significant differences in the mean relative condition (K-n) of Barbus altianalis between River Nile (mean dif 0.0880, P < 0.004) and Lake Edward and between River Nile and Kazinga channel (mean dif. 0.0796, P < 0.001). No significant difference in the mean relative condition between Kazinga channel and Lake Edward (mean diff. 0.0840, P < 0.95). Lake Edward had the highest condition (1.05), while Kazinga channel and River Nile had 1.04 and 0.96 respectively. The relationship between weight and length for each population, obtained by pooling individuals across systems was significant (P < 0.001), the length-weight allometry between the populations was also significantly different (F (2, 237) = 9.73, P < 0.001). River Nile had the highest number of fishers of 311 +/- 0.88 while the number of fishers in Lake Edward and Kazinga channel were 75 +/- 2.45 and 33 +/- 9.12, respectively. Catch rates varied between River Nile (1.92 +/- 0.59 Kg boat(-1) day(-1)) and the rest of the systems, 6.20 +/- 1.86 and 6.85 +/- 1.49 Kg boat(-1) day(-1) in Lake Edward and Kazinga channel respectively. Water quality varied greatly across all the water bodies. Dissolved oxygen was below the minimum of 5 mgl(-1) required for the physiology of freshwater fish. Conductivity was highest in Lake Edward (312 A mu S cm(-1)), followed by Kazinga channel and least in River Nile. The consistent variation in condition, fishing effort and water quality, indicates differential selective pressures faced by B. altianalis in the systems and therefore calls for concerted efforts for appropriate management measures.

This results in minimal or null water exchange. The sum of fish biomass and microorganisms favors alkalinity consumption and, consequently, pH reduction. It is in this context that the present study evaluates alkalinity and pH maintenance using sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), calcium carbonate (CaCO3) or calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)(2)) on BFT during a Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) nursery. In this study, 25 fishes/tank was distributed in nine experimental units (useful vol. 37.5 L) and the performance was evaluated at 60 days. During the assay, the temperature, oxygen and pH were maintained within the ideal range levels for Nile tilapia growth. All alkalizing compounds were able to pH and alkalinity correction, but when using NaHCO3, the alkalinity and pH were more elevated than the other treatments. Furthermore, at the beginning these assay, the total ammonia (TAN; NH3 + N-4(+)) and NO2--N accumulate and it caused a peak, but mostly experiment remained to very low levels because of the total nitrification activity, resulting in NO3- -N accumulation. Because the non water exchange, at the final experiment the ion Na+ accumulate when utilized NaHCO3, resulting in level similar to brackish water. While using CaCO3 or Ca(OH)(2), the Ca2+ ion accumulate, resulting in extremely hard water. Despite this, the fish survival was similar between treatments (about 80%). Moreover, the final weight, daily growth rate and net yield for NaHCO3 and Ca(OH)(2) they were higher than CaCO3 treatment. This may have been because of the higher total suspended solids (TSS) and lower protein content of the bioflocs in this treatment. In order to assess the possible physiologic alterations of the fish associated with the production system, the hematocrit, glycemia and plasmatic osmolality were evaluated. Furthermore, the antioxidant capacity against peroxy radicals (ACAP), lipid peroxidation (120) and catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities on the gills and liver were also evaluated. There were no differences in biochemical/physiological parameters when the different alkalizing compounds were utilized. The results demonstrate that the use of sodium bicarbonate, hydroxide or calcium carbonate is effective on the alkalinity and pH adjustments of the final proportion of 14.64 +/- 0.49, 7.18 +/- 032 e 24.09 +/- 2.32% in relation to the feed consumption, respectively. Thus, the study demonstrates that the use of NaHCO3 and Ca(OH)(2) are recommended for alkalinity and pH correction during Nile tilapia nursery on BFT systems, because of the higher growth and net yield, and this sum to less amount of these compounds may represent important economic gain. Statement of relevance: The results of this manuscript demonstrate: -Amount of alkalizing compound utilized for maintenance of alkalinity and pH -Best growth to utilize NaHCO3 and Ca(OH)(2) -The importance of evaluate the ionic concentration, specially Na+ and Ca+2, because the imbalance ionic -The difficulty to solids control in BFT system.

Biomonitoring using macroinvertebrates is known to be effective for assessing water quality. The problem, however, is that biomonitoring can be labour intensive and analyses can have a long turnaround time. Rapid bioassessment methods have been developed to overcome these limitations, but it is not known whether they are as sensitive to changes in water quality as are their more time-consuming counterparts. To answer this question, we compared three methods for sampling and measuring macroinvertebrates. We refer to these as the quantitative method, semi quantitative method, and qualitative method respectively. The quantitative method was a single habitat method with taxonomic identification of macroinvertebrates to genus level that counted all taxa The semi-quantitative method involved multi-habitat sampling with identification to family level and quantification as relative abundance. The qualitative method was the same as the semi-quantitative method except that incidence (presence/ absence) was recorded instead of abundance. The study was carried out at three fish farms in Iran with sampling done once per season for a year from the outfall of each farm as well as from the receiving rivers, with one sample taken upstream of the effluent discharge and two samples downstream. Analysis by permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) revealed that the effects of three variables of season, farm, and site on macroinvertebrate communities were significant for all three methods. Qualitative sampling was the only method that showed a statistically significant interaction between farm and season as well as a difference among the sites within each farm. Although the results of a BEST (Bio-Bio) analysis showed that different families were responsible for the differences between the sites, all three methods were able to detect the differences between the sites within each farm. However, pairwise comparisons between sites within farms indicated some differences between the three methods. The quantitative method revealed fewer differences than did the other two methods. The qualitative method did not lose any important information and had the added advantage of saving considerable time and effort in sampling and enumerating. These results suggest that rapid bioassessment could be used to effectively monitor the receiving waters of fish farm effluents. Statement of relevance: This manuscript compares three methods of sampling which are quantitative, semi quantitative and qualitative methods in order to find the most efficient and cost-effective method of sampling. There is no apparent consensus on the appropriate method of collecting and measuring macroinvertebrates, in particular for investigating the effect of fish farms on the rivers. Our manuscript revealed that rapid bioassessment method as a cost-efficient and effective method can be used in order to develop aquaculture in a sustainable manner, both environmentally and economically. Therefore, authors believe that this manuscript is appropriate for publication by the Journal of Aquaculture. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Nile tilapia dominates production (77% of total production), followed by carps (17%) and mullets (11%). Egyptian tilapia farmers are, however, facing challenges with regards to financial viability and poor water quality. Fish farms are also contributing towards water pollution and other environmental impacts. In order to improve the situation, WorldFish launched the IEIDEAS project in 2011 with the ambition to train farmers in best management practices (BMP) and distribute the 9th generation of the Abbassa strain (G9). The present study aimed at evaluating any relative environmental gains that BMP and G9 offers compared to conventional farming using life cycle assessment (LCA). Inventory data representing 137 farmers and four groups (control, BMP, G9 and BMP + G9) were evaluated. Life cycle impact assessment results including quantitative uncertainties were then calculated and statistically tested, using Monte Carlo analysis and Wilcoxon paired significance test. Five impact categories were explored: global warming, eutrophication, acidification, freshwater consumption and land use. The G9 stain offered the greatest improvements across the evaluated impact categories, significantly reducing environmental impacts with between 12% and 36%. BMP, in the meantime, only offered significant improvements compared to the control with regards to eutrophication, acidification, freshwater consumption and land use. Meanwhile, BMP + G9 performed comparably to only G9 except for eutrophication where it had a significantly larger environmental footprint. More efficient feed utilization and higher productivity were the main reasons for the environmental improvements. Additional improvements that should be explored include improved feeds made of sustainably sourced raw materials, and better pond water management, including probiotics and paddle-wheels.

Land based on-growing of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) using Recirculating Aquaculture Systems; a case study from the Basque region (Northern Spain)	AQUACULTURE												Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) is one of the most famous cold-water marine fish species. While the supply of Atlantic cod to European markets is relatively stable, this species continues to represent an interesting, and potentially lucrative, opportunity for commercial-scale aquaculture. Due to fishing restrictions and quota decreases over the last decade, the supply of Spanish-caught cod in European markets has declined, while the local demand for this species has increased. As wild-capture will not grow to meet this increased demand, land-based aquaculture of cod could represent a viable production model to satisfy demand. However, both capital investments and operation costs for a Recirculating Aquaculture System (RAS) farm are expected to be high, and therefore, all economic aspects must be taken into account before embarking on design or planning considerations. The influence of thermal control on growth, mortality and product quality also represent an important landmark when considering land-based aquaculture operations. The following represents a feasibility study to analyze the different economic scenarios and biological factors that can influence the business potential of growing this species in RAS. 2500 cod individuals were reared at two different thermal regimes (i.e., controlled and natural range, respectively) through 2 pilot RAS set up in the Basque region (Northern Spain). The experiment lasted 430 days. Statistical differences were found in survival between different thermal regimes but no significant differences were detected within the fall or winter seasons. Daily specific growth rates were significantly different during the summer season with some compensatory growth patterns being observed in the natural thermal regime set up. Likewise, statistical significances were found between the fat contents from both temperatures after the summer period. Conversely, no significant differences were observed at sensorial level between the samples obtained within our pilot experiment and commercial samples from wild origin. Electricity use was found to be one of the most significant economic costs to be considered. The present study represents the first technical feasibility attempt on cod in land-based aquaculture from the north of Spain and demonstrates the technical feasibility to produce on-land based cod in the region, the equivalence of growth patterns with previous studies, the usefulness of the proposed thermal regime management as a tool for this species production, and the key economic parameters and thresholds for a potential feasible commercial activity in the region. Statement of relevance: This contribution is of help for the modelling and decision-making for on land based recirculating aquaculture initiatives. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

HYDROBIOLOGIA												Shallow lake managers seek strategies to improve water quality and ecological features of these habitats, but lake responses are unpredictable and factors responsible for changes are often unclear. We summarized results of eight whole-lake rehabilitation projects in Minnesota, USA, an area with many shallow waters highly impacted by anthropogenic activities. To assess lake responses, we compared characteristics of managed sites to those of other regional shallow lakes manifesting clear-or turbid-state conditions. Managed lakes showed modest similarity to clear-water reference lakes in terms of phytoplankton (as chlorophyll a), nutrients, and submerged aquatic plants. Responses of aquatic invertebrate communities were more equivocal, with relatively little similarity to clear-water sites following management. These patterns indicate that these lakes either failed to undergo transitions to clear-water states, or that clear-water conditions did not persist throughout the 2-3 year period following treatment and prior to our evaluation. We believe these results show responses of shallow lakes that have been pushed beyond boundaries where they maintain sufficient natural resilience to resist local stressors. This means that shallow lake rehabilitation efforts will not always succeed and that, when improvements occur, management may need to be repeated to maintain favorable ecological conditions in highly modified landscapes.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2017	787	1					45	59		10.1007/s10750-016-2865-9								WOS:000390139200003						
J	Wooldridge, SA				Wooldridge, Scott A.			Preventable fine sediment export from the Burdekin River catchment reduces coastal seagrass abundance and increases dugong mortality within the Townsville region of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												The coastal seagrass meadows in the Townsville region of the Great Barrier Reef are crucial seagrass foraging habitat for endangered dugong populations. Deteriorating coastal water quality and in situ light levels reduce the extent of these meadows, particularly in years with significant terrestrial runoff from the nearby Burdekin River catchment. However, uncertainty surrounds the impact of variable seagrass abundance on dugong carrying capacity. Here, I demonstrate that a power-law relationship with exponent value of -1 (R-2 similar to 0.87) links mortality data with predicted changes in annual above ground seagrass biomass. This relationship indicates that the dugong carrying capacity of the region is tightly coupled to the biomass of seagrass available for metabolism. Thus, mortality rates increase precipitously following large flood events with a response lag of <12-months. The management implications of this result are discussed in terms of climate scenarios that indicate an increased future likelihood of extreme flood events. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Spatial and temporal microbial pollution patterns in a tropical estuary during high and low river flow conditions	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Spatial and temporal patterns of coastal microbial pollution are not well documented. Our study examined these patterns through measurements of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), nutrients, and physiochemical parameters in Hilo Bay, Hawai'i, during high and low river flow. >40% of samples tested positive for the human-associated Bacteroides marker, with highest percentages near rivers. Other FIB were also higher near rivers, but only Clostridium perfringens concentrations were related to discharge. During storms, FIB concentrations were three times to an order of magnitude higher, and increased with decreasing salinity and water temperature, and increasing turbidity. These relationships and high spatial resolution data for these parameters were used to create Enterococcus spp. and C. perfringens maps that predicted exceedances with 64% and 95% accuracy, respectively. Mapping microbial pollution patterns and predicting exceedances is a valuable tool that can improve water quality monitoring and aid in visualizing FIB hotspots for management actions.

The biogeochemical module accounts for nitrogen and phosphorus and includes the water column and upper sediment layer. The simulations showed that water circulation and the seasonal patterns of nutrients, phytoplankton and dissolved oxygen were satisfactorily reproduced. Model results indicate that water circulation in the lagoon is driven mainly by tide and wind. Plankton primary production is co-limited by phosphorus and nitrogen, and is highest in the inner part of the lagoon, due to the combined effects of high water residence time and high nutrient inputs from the boundary. However, a sensitivity analysis highlights the importance of exchanges with the Mediterranean Sea in maintaining a high level of productivity. Intensive use of fertilizers in the catchment area has a significant effect on phytoplankton biomass increase. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Characterizing light attenuation within Northwest Florida Estuaries: Implications for RESTORE Act water quality monitoring	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Water Quality (WQ) condition is based on ecosystem stressor indicators (e.g. water clarity) which are biogeochemically important and critical when considering the Deepwater Horizon oil spill restoration efforts under the 2012 RESTORE Act. Nearly all of the proposed RESTORE projects list restoring WC as a goal, but 90% neglect water clarity. Here, dynamics of optical constituents impacting clarity are presented from a 2009-2011 study within Pensacola, Choctawhatchee, St. Andrew and St Joseph estuaries (targeted RESTORE sites) in Northwest Florida. Phytoplankton were the smallest contribution to total absorption (a(t-w)PAR) at 412 nm (5-11%), whereas colored dissolved organic matter was the largest (61-79%). Estuarine a(t-w)PAR was significantly related to light attenuation (K(d)PAR), where individual contributors to clarity and the influence of climatic events were discerned. Provided are conversion equations demonstrating interoperability of clarity indicators between traditional State-measured WQ measures (e.g. secchi disc), optical constituents, and even satellite remote sensing for obtaining baseline assessments.

Water quality modeling can contribute to the necessary scientific grounding of coastal management. In this paper, some of the dynamic functions and parameters of nitrogen were calibrated based on coastal field experiments covering the dynamic nitrogen processes in Jiaozhou Bay (JZB), including phytoplankton growth, respiration, and mortality; particulate nitrogen degradation; and dissolved organic nitrogen remineralization. The results of the field experiments and box model simulations showed good agreement (RSD = 20% +/- 2% and SI = 0.77 +/- 0.04). A three-dimensional water quality model of nitrogen (3DWQMN) in JZB was improved and the dynamic parameters were updated according to field experiments. The 3DWQMN was validated based on observed data from 2012 to 2013, with good agreement (RSD = 27 +/- 4%, SI = 0.68 +/- 0.06, and K = 0.48 +/- 0.04), which testifies to the model's credibility.

By quantifying the delta N-15 of the common sea fan Gorgonia ventalina sampled from 30 sites throughout Bermuda we show that sewage-derived nitrogen is detectable on nearshore coral reefs and declines across the lagoon to the outer rim. We also sampled gorgonians from two museum collections representing a 50y time-series (1958-2008). These samples revealed an increase in delta N-15 of >4.0%. until the mid-1970s, after which delta N-15 values slowly declined by similar to 2.05 parts per thousand. A delta N-15 chronology from a gorgonian skeleton exhibited a similar decline over the last 30-40 years of approximately 0.6 parts per thousand. We conclude that policies have been effective in reducing sewage impacts to Bermudian reefs. However, significant sources of sewage pollution persist and are likely have a strong impact on harbor and nearshore coral communities and human health. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The relatively high 813Crom values suggested the input of C-13-depleted terrigenous organic matter was low in Daya Bay. There were significant correlations between delta C-13(POM) values and chlorophyll a concentrations both during summer and winter, suggesting the delta C-13(POM) values were mainly controlled by the phytoplankton biomass in the surface water. The distribution of delta N-15(POM) values was more complicated than that of delta C-13(POM) and displayed low values in the outer bay and the Dan'ao River estuary. N-15-depleted ammonia originating from industrial wastewater might have strongly influenced the water quality and stable isotopic signatures of POM near the Dan'ao River estuary.

The optimization calculation may become very time consuming when the number of water quality constraint equations is great. A Trial and Error Method (TEM) to remove the redundant points was first introduced through iterative calculations under structure and non-structure model grids. The TEM was applied for the TPLA in the Bohai Sea in China. The calculation time was reduced to about 2 min under the condition that 103,433 model grids met the water quality standards. In the best case, the optimization efficiency was improved by 98.9%. The allocation results showed that approximately 90% of total nitrogen (TN) load should be reduced in the 56 pollution sources around the Bohai Sea; of these values, roughly 85% of the reduction could come from 10 pollution sources.

A regional-scale predictive model for the Great Barrier Reef, Australia	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												A spatial risk assessment model is developed for the Great Barrier Reef (GBR, Australia) that helps identify reef locations at higher or lower risk of coral bleaching in summer heat-wave conditions. The model confirms the considerable benefit of discriminating nutrient-enriched areas that contain corals with enlarged (suboptimal) symbiont densities for the purpose of identifying bleaching-sensitive reef locations. The benefit of the new system level understanding is showcased in terms of: (i) improving early-warning forecasts of summer bleaching risk, (ii) explaining historical bleaching patterns, (iii) testing the bleaching-resistant quality of the current marine protected area (MPA) network (iv) identifying routinely monitored coral health attributes, such as the tissue energy reserves and skeletal growth characteristics (viz. density and extension rates) that correlate with bleaching resistant reef locations, and (v) targeting region-specific water quality improvement strategies that may increase reef-scale coral health and bleaching resistance.

Plankton bioindicators of environmental conditions in coastal lagoons	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Coastal lagoons are characterised by strong spatial gradient of environmental parameters, especially hypersalinity, and are prone to anthropogenic disturbance. The Coorong (South Australia) is an inverse estuarine coastal lagoon separated from the sea by sand dunes. It is exposed to extreme water quality changes that affect its aquatic communities. Here, we used plankton as indicators of extreme environmental fluctuations to monitor and manage the environmental health of such complex systems. We defined the relationship of different plankton communities with water quality fluctuations and determined plankton species suitable for monitoring the ecosystem health. Two distinct communities of phytoplankton and zooplankton were identified, with salinity and nutrients being the principal factors impacting species distribution. Thus, two sets of indicator species were selected based on the different communities observed. Polychaete and gastropod larvae were positive indicators, showing salinity range restriction of brackish to marine. The distribution Acartia cf. fancetti represented healthy hypersaline conditions (salinity 40-60), while Cyclophora sp. and Scrippsiella sp. were negative indicators, correlating with extreme salinity and ammonia levels. The implementation of planktonic organisms as environmental indicators provided a constructive tool for the management of ecosystem health of the Coorong and will be applicable to similar coastal lagoons.

Despite the small sizes of the watersheds (<16.5 km(2)), a redundancy analysis showed that river water quality explained 62% of the cross-estuary variation in the biogeochemical properties of estuarine tidal flat sediment by the first two ordination axes. We also found that the dissolved nutrient concentrations of river water and pheophytin a content of tidal flat sediment were positively related to agricultural and urbanized land cover in the watersheds. These results indicate that human nutrient inputs significantly increase algae-derived deposits in estuaries with relatively more developed watersheds. The 813C of particulate organic matter (POM) was negatively related to watershed forest cover. This suggests that terrestrially derived-origin POM deposits are substantial in the estuaries connected to watersheds with relatively high forest cover. However, the chemical properties of tidal flat sediment were not related to chemical indicators of POM in the base flow. We hypothesize that substantial terrestrially derived POM is discharged to estuaries of high-forest-cover watersheds during high flow, and this partially controls the chemical properties of estuarine sediments. Our results demonstrate that the chemical properties of estuarine tidal flats are associated with watershed land cover, and that the dominant processes controlling estuarine sediment properties differ among watersheds depending on land cover composition.

REMOVAL OF MICROCYSTIS AERUGINOSA BY CHITOSAN AND ILLITE	VIE ET MILIEU-LIFE AND ENVIRONMENT												In recent years, massive water blooms of cyanobacteria occurred in many freshwater lakes and reservoirs, and cause severe water quality problems including scum formation, toxin production, taste and odors, and hypoxia generation. Therefore, a new environmental friendly method was proposed for cyanobacterial bloom mitigation using chitosan and illite. The effects of particle size of illite, addition of illite, addition of chitosan on Microcystis aeruginosa removal was examined through batch experiments. The results showed that the removal efficiency of cyanobacteria had a strong dependence on the changes of particle size of illite, addition of illite, addition of chitosan. The highest removal efficiency, 97.42 %, was obtained under the optimal conditions. This study demonstrated that there were technically viable methods using chitosan and illite to remove M. aeruginosa cells.																	0240-8759						2017	67	3-4					173	177										WOS:000430788900004

Return of Harbor Porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) to San Francisco Bay	AQUATIC MAMMALS												Harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) were rarely seen in San Francisco Bay prior to 2008 despite numerous marine mammal search efforts beginning in the 1970s. The species inhabited the bay historically before they were functionally extirpated by the early 1940s. Their disappearance correlated with increased anthropogenic disturbances such as dredging, shoreline construction, World War II military defenses, and environmental impacts from industrialization. After observing porpoises throughout the central San Francisco Bay from 2008 to 2010, we documented the porpoises' occurrence by means of a visual count from the Golden Gate Bridge. From 2011 to 2014, we spent 288 h counting porpoises from that unique platform, resulting in 2,698 porpoise group sightings recorded in all months of the year. Group size averaged 2.15, and the maximum group size was 16 animals. Calves comprised 10% of all porpoises sighted and were also seen throughout the year. Porpoises were observed on 96% of 169 survey days, and an average of 34.37 +/- 29.19 were seen per day. Porpoises can now be seen in the central bay daily throughout the year. Stranding records for the bay reflected the general pattern of the porpoises' decades-long absence and their reappearance. Potential reasons for the porpoises' return include decreased water and noise pollution, improved water quality, and increased marine productivity that created conditions in the bay that were favorable for porpoises.																	0167-5427						2017	43	6					691	702		10.1578/AM.43.6.2017.691								WOS:000426041000013						
J	Karthik, R; Padmavati, G				Karthik, Raji; Padmavati, Gadi			Intense rare bloom of Chaetoceros tortissimum (Gran) in relation to water quality assessed using multivariate statistical approach at Chouldari Bay, South Andaman Island	CAHIERS DE BIOLOGIE MARINE												An intense bloom of Chaetoceros tortissimum was observed in Chouldari Bay, South Andaman Island, between 22nd and 28th of May 2013. Physico-chemical parameters, nutrients and phytoplankton composition were studied. Environmental parameters such as surface water temperature (31.5 degrees C), salinity (25-32), pH (7.6-8.3), dissolved oxygen (4.13 mg L-1) and biological oxygen demand (2.34 mg L-1) were recorded. Among nutrients, nitrate varied from 3.36 to 5.38 mu mol L-1, nitrite ranged from 0.20 to 0.60 mu mol L-1, phosphate from 0.02 to 0.52 mu mol L-1 and silicate from 9.62 to 12.22 mu mol L-1. Biomass was expressed in terms of chlorophyll a ranging from 0.17 to 0.21 mu g L-1. Phytoplankton was composed of 95 species belonging to 42 genera and the contribution of C. tortissimum to the total phytoplankton abundance (42,000-76,000 cells. mL(-1)) was 99.4%. High rainfall was found to be the primary causative agent for triggering the bloom of C. tortissimum. Moreover, increase in water temperature and salinity was also found to be an influencing co-factor which had contributed to the bloom. Conclusively, intense fertilization of the farms, coupled with ineffective management strategies is hypothesized to have a direct link on the increase of nutrients found in Chouldari Bay.																	0007-9723	2262-3094					2017	58	4					423	433		10.21411/CBM.A.C3348C08								WOS:000425305300006

In this study, the state of water quality and their effects on some hematological parameters of African Catfish (Clarias gariepinus) was identified. Reserach, in the area under the crest of the Aslantas Dam (station I) located on the Ceyhan River and discharging region on the same river (station II). water temperature, chemical oxygen demand (COD), pH, nitrate (NO3-N), nitrite (NO2-N), ammonia (NH3-N) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) values were determined in these two stations. The study was realised on 45 fish from each station during the summer seasons (June, July, August). The hematological parameters included erythrocyte (RBC) and RBC indices (MCV: mean corpuscular volume, MCH: mean corpuscular hemoglobin, MCHC: mean corpuscular hemoglobin consentration), leukocyte (WBC), haemoglobine (Hb), hematocrit (Hct) values and leukocyte cell formulas (lymphocyte, monocyte, neutrophil, eosinophil), serum glucose and protein levels were evaluated. The physico-chemical parameters observed that the water at station II had higher COD, NH3-N, NO2-N, pH and SRP than at station I. In this study, WBC values and leukocyte cell formulas of C. gariepinus were found increasing by means of environmental stressors and also, RBC, RBC indices, Hb and Hct values were determined decreasing in C. gariepinus collected from station II (p<0.05). On the other hand, serum glucose levels were increased and protein levels were decreased in station II. The study was found to be important in the biomonitoring of pollution of aquatic ecosystems, in terms of rational use of hematological parameters.

J	Filstrup, CT; Downing, JA				Filstrup, Christopher T.; Downing, John A.			Relationship of chlorophyll to phosphorus and nitrogen in nutrient-rich lakes	INLAND WATERS												Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) commonly co-limit primary productivity in lakes, and chlorophyll a (Chl-alpha) is predicted to be greatest under high N, high P regimes. Because land use practices can alter N and P biogeochemical cycles in watersheds, it is unclear whether previously documented phytoplankton-nutrient relationships apply where landscapes are highly disturbed. Here, we analyzed a lake water quality database from an agricultural region to explore relationships among Chl-alpha, total N (TN), and total P (TP) under extreme nutrient concentrations. Chl-alpha was weakly related to TN when TP was <= 100 mu g L-1 but displayed a stronger response to TN at higher TP. When TP exceeded 100 mu g L-1, Chl-alpha increased with increasing TN until reaching a TN threshold of similar to 3 mg L-1 and decreased thereafter, resulting in a high nutrient, low Chl-alpha region that did not coincide with shifts in nutrient limitation, light availability, cellular Chl-alpha content, phytoplankton composition, or zooplankton grazing pressure. Beyond the threshold, nitrate comprised most of TN and occurred with reduced dissolved organic matter (DOM). These observations suggest that photolysis of nitrate may produce reactive oxygen species that damage DOM and phytoplankton. Reduction in N loading at high P could therefore increase Chl-alpha and decrease water clarity, resulting in an apparent worsening of water quality. Our data suggest that monitoring Chl-alpha or Secchi depth may fail to indicate water quality degradation by extreme nutrient concentrations. These findings highlight how extreme nutrient regimes in lakes can produce novel relationships between phytoplankton and nutrients.

J	Osgood, RA				Osgood, Richard A.			Inadequacy of best management practices for restoring eutrophic lakes in the United States: guidance for policy and practice	INLAND WATERS												The policy and practice of restoring eutrophic or phosphorus (P)-impaired lakes that relies heavily on watershed best management practices (BMPs) is mostly inadequate. This strategy has been prevalent in the United States for several decades, but there are few documented positive outcomes. To restore most eutrophic lakes requires external P reductions > 80% in the United States. A review of BMP performance literature with respect to P removal indicates the maximum expected P removal under ideal conditions on a watershed-wide basis approaches 50%, however in practice reductions in P load may be < 25%. The discrepancy between required P reductions and BMP performance explains the observed paucity of positive outcomes. BMPs may be sufficient in cases where watershed size is small (i.e., < 10-times lake surface area) and external and internal P loading rates are modest, or where incremental water quality improvement rather than restoration is the management goal. Guidance for restoring eutrophic lakes is provided here. In cases where BMPs are inadequate as the sole restoration strategy, alternative or supplemental approaches are available. In many cases, effective P inactivation methods to mitigate internal P loading and to intercept dissolved P in inflowing waters are required to restore lakes. Engineering approaches or chemical treatment systems can feasibly, reliably, and effectively provide sufficient external or internal P load reductions.																	2044-2041	2044-205X					2017	7	4					401	407		10.1080/20442041.2017.1368881								WOS:000423406300002

Spatial variability of CO2 concentrations and biogeochemistry in the Lower Columbia River	INLAND WATERS												Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from rivers and other inland waters are thought to be a major component of regional and global carbon cycling. In large managed rivers such as the Columbia River, contemporary ecosystem changes such as damming, nutrient enrichment, and increased water residence times may lead to reduced CO2 concentrations (and emissions) due to increased primary production, as has been shown in another large North American river (Upper Mississippi). In this work, spatial patterns of water quality, including dissolved CO2 concentrations, were assessed in the Lower Columbia River (LCR) and major tributaries using underway measurements from a small research vessel during July 2016. We observed near-equilibrium CO2 conditions and overall weak supersaturation of CO2 in the main channel (average 133.8% saturation) and tributaries. We observed only weak correlations between CO2 saturation, chlorophyll a fluorescence, and turbidity, thus not strongly supporting our hypothesis of primary productivity controls. In general, the LCR was clear (low turbidity, mean = 1.48 FNU) and had low chlorophyll fluorescence (mean = 0.177 RFU) during the sampling period. As a whole, the LCR was homogeneous with respect to biogeochemical conditions and showed low spatial variability at > 100 km scales. Overall, we find that the LCR is likely a weak summertime source of CO2 to the atmosphere, in line with findings from other altered rivers such as the Upper Mississippi.																	2044-2041	2044-205X					2017	7	4					417	427		10.1080/20442041.2017.1366487								WOS:000423406300004

Specific objectives are to (1) evaluate characteristics of spawning habitat in a number of different systems; (2) determine if spawning habitat can be predicted from data on land cover, geology, and physical characteristics in the lake or river; and (3) compare spawning habitat in inland lakes and some Great Lakes locations. In inland lakes, Muskellunge preferred to spawn over fine sediments near emergent and submersed vegetation in protected bays or shorelines, but bay and calm shoreline habitat is not always available and may be degraded, so they may end up spawning over open sand, gravel, or coarse particulate organic matter and spawning in areas without vegetation. For objective two, the best-performing MaxEnt model included shoreline development index, presence of nearby shallow areas, distance from out flowing streams, effective fetch, maximum depth, Carlson's trophic status index, and an indicator of east- or west-facing shoreline as significant factors predicting spawning locations in inland lakes. Overall, 64% of all observed spawning fell within locations predicted by a model, including the most suitable 40% of available habitat for all lakes. For objective 3, we compared habitat selection of Great Lakes-strain Muskellunge with the inland strain. MaxEnt models of habitat for Great Lakes Muskellunge included some similar factors like shallow depth and low slope, but also included river habitat factors like presence of moderate vegetative cover and woody debris. To conclude, we propose a conceptual model of Muskellunge spawning and nursery habitat where survival from egg to larva is limited by water quality, predation on eggs, and abundant food resources.																	0892-2284		978-1-934874-46-2				2017	85						183	201										WOS:000422891800022

Riparian and landscape disturbance effects on stream fish community composition in an agriculturally-dominated drainage	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												We compared historical stream fish community sampling and remote sensing data from 1993-2011 in an agriculturally-dominated drainage basin to determine the effects of varying levels of riparian and landscape disturbances on fish communities. Stream fish guilds were analyzed with National Land Cover Database and aerial imagery products to quantify disturbance levels at a local and watershed scale. Insectivores and benthic insectivores were associated with intact riparian areas, whereas environmentally tolerant and omnivorous species were found in environments with degraded riparian areas. Riparian disturbances had the greatest effect near the stream (0-10 m), and the effects diminished with increasing distance from the stream. This spatial scale corresponds with those reported in the literature whereby allocthonous inputs and riparian filtering influenced stream fish communities and water quality. The landscape disturbance was not a strong predictor for any fish guild, indicating that local riparian conditions were more biologically meaningful. Considering the rapid rates of land conversion to production agriculture across the midwestern United States, ensuring adequate riparian buffering of streams may help protect specialist aquatic species and their habitat. Given the broad temporal and spatial nature of our data, these results suggest that targeted conservation of the 10-m scale of intact riparian vegetation directly adjacent to streams is a sound practice and should be considered the minimum conservation goal for watershed restoration in low-gradient landscapes historically dominated by agricultural land-use practices.																	1463-4988	1539-4077					2017	20	4			SI		445	456		10.1080/14634988.2017.1368831								WOS:000423091000015

An introduction to Lake of the Woods-from science to governance in an international waterbody	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Lake of the Woods (LOW), a vast lake covering over 3850 km(2), is a waterbody of current and historical significance that spans the borders between Minnesota and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Manitoba. Over the past 2 decades, there has been concern for the water quality of LOW, sparked by anecdotal evidence of increased intensity and frequency of algal blooms by the public and resource managers. Minnesota's waters of LOW were declared impaired in 2008 due to exceedances of eutrophication criteria, initiating a Total Maximum Daily Load study. LOW's impairment declaration spurred several contrasting challenges and opportunities for water quality management across this diverse lake and basin. Governance challenges are emphasized by the large number of government agencies (>25) with land or water authorities in the 70,000 km(2) basin, the variability in phosphorus standards applicable to LOW between Minnesota, Ontario, and Manitoba, and unequal funding resources allocated to LOW's water quality management agencies. Despite these challenges, there is a long history of international cooperation among agencies, recent funding increases, and the formation of a new International Joint Commission Board with the mandate to monitor ecosystem health in the entire LOW basin. As highlighted by the studies in this issue, the science of nutrient and algal dynamics in LOW is complex, and water quality restoration may take years to decades because major sources of nutrients to the lake are not subject to reductions by conventional lake restoration methods. An overview of papers in this special issue is provided.																	1040-2381	2151-5530					2017	33	4					325	334		10.1080/10402381.2017.1383539								WOS:000423047200001						
J	James, WF				James, William F.			Internal phosphorus loading contributions from deposited and resuspended sediment to the Lake of the Woods	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												The Lake of the Woods exhibits cyanobacterial blooms despite substantial declines in watershed phosphorus (P) loading since the 1970s, suggesting that internal P loads are contributing to the P budget. A better understanding of internal P loading contributions and dynamics is needed to refine management strategies and water quality goals. Sediment cores were collected from several stations within the US portion to examine potential internal P contributions from deposited and resuspended sediment. Although laboratory-derived diffusive P fluxes were highest under anaerobic conditions (8-12 mg/m(2) d), aerobic conditions at the sediment-water interface may regulate in situ diffusive P fluxes due to frequent polymixis. Although much lower under aerobic conditions, modest fluxes of 0.2-0.6 mg/m(2) d could play an important role in the P budget. Simulated resuspension indicated that the critical shear stress of deposited sediment was relatively low at 1.3-2.3 dynes/cm(2). The wind-exposed long fetches and shallow morphometry of regions of Lake of the Woods could result in frequent resuspension of P-enriched clays and silts that contribute inorganic P to the water column. Resuspended sediments exhibited a low equilibrium P concentration (near zero) and high linear adsorption coefficient (700-3200 L/kg), suggesting they may act more as a sink rather than a source for soluble P. Resuspension could compete with cyanobacterial uptake by sequestering soluble reactive P. Resuspended inorganic P could also constitute a significant portion of the water column total P composition in addition to organic P, incorporated as cyanobacterial biomass, and needs to be considered in the P budget and chlorophyll prediction.																	1040-2381	2151-5530					2017	33	4					347	359		10.1080/10402381.2017.1312647								WOS:000423047200003

Here we analyzed sediments from 6 sites in the southern basin for diverse biogeochemical (loss-on-ignition, biogenic silica, pigments) and microfossil (diatoms, chrysophytes) remains to reconstruct the environmental history of the lake. Our objectives were to quantify the magnitude and direction of historical trophic change and evaluate reasons for an apparent lack of basin recovery following documented nutrient diversion. Evidence came from fossil indicator profiles and comparisons of these long-term trends with historical land use and monitoring data. Results indicate major changes in algal communities during and following peak nutrient loading in the mid-20th century as well as more recent increases in colonial cyanobacteria and high-nutrient diatomtaxa. Combined, fossil indicators reflect an anthropogenically enriched system that has undergone substantial ecological change, particularly since similar to 1980, due to multiple drivers. Physical changes in lake thermal regime resulting from climate warming may be exacerbating internal phosphorus release from sediments, thereby lowering nitrogen: phosphorus ratios and enhancing cyanobacterial abundance. These drivers of lake condition in the lake may apply to other large shallow lakes that exhibit only limited biological recovery from reduced external nutrient loading.

Historical phosphorus dynamics in Lake of the Woods (USA-Canada) - does legacy phosphorus still affect the southern basin?	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												A historical phosphorus (P) budget was constructed for southern Lake of the Woods. Sediment cores from 7 bays were radioisotopically dated and analyzed for loss-on-ignition, P, Si, diatoms, and pigments. Geochemical records for cores were combined using focusing factors for whole-basin estimates of sediment, total P, and P fraction accumulation. Although historical monitoring shows that external P loads decreased since the 1950s, sediment P has continued to increase since the mid-20th century. Much sediment P is labile and may be mobile within the sediments and/or available for internal loading and resuspension. Two mass-balance models were used to explore historical P loading scenarios and in-lake dynamics, a static one-box model and a dynamic multi-box model. The one-box model predicts presettlement external loads were slightly less than modern loads. The dynamic model shows that water-column P was higher in the 1950s-1970s than today, that the lake is sensitive to external loads because P losses from burial and outflow are high, and that the lake is moving to a new steady state with respect to water-column P and size of the active sediment P pool. The active sediment pool built up in the mid-20th century has been depleted through outflow and burial, such that its legacy effects are now minimal. Comparison of historical nutrient dynamics and sediment records of algal production showed a counterintuitive increase in production after external P loads decreased, suggesting other drivers may now regulate modern limnoecology, including seasonality of P loading, shifting nutrient limitation, and climate warming.

Climate as a driver of increasing algal production in Lake of theWoods, Ontario, Canada	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Lake of the Woods (LOW) is a large, transboundary lake that straddles the provinces of Ontario and Manitoba, and the state of Minnesota. Although algal blooms have been reported in the lake since the early 1800s, monitoring data and anecdotal evidence suggest that toxic, cyanobacterial blooms have increased in frequency and intensity in recent years. However, total phosphorus inputs from the lake's primary tributary, the Rainy River, have declined significantly since the late 1960s. We explore this disconnect by examining spectrally-inferred determinations of chlorophyll a (Chl-a) in lake sediment cores, as a measure of past changes in aquatic primary production. Beginning in the late 1970s to early 1980s, inferred Chl-a increased at 5 impact sites in the north end of LOW that currently experience cyanobacterial blooms in late summer and autumn. In contrast, no change in Chl-a was observed at an oligotrophic reference site with much lower cyanobacteria biomass. At the impact sites, Chl-a generally showed no significant relationship to long-term trends in diatom-inferred total phosphorus concentrations, but was significantly and positively correlated to climatic variables, including mean annual air temperature at all sites and total annual precipitation at 4 sites. These data suggest that climate change may exacerbate algal blooms in this moderately-enriched lake. The results also show that the effects of climate change on aquatic production may be enhanced at sites with higher nutrient concentrations, likely because of positive feedbacks between cyanobacteria biomass, water temperature and nutrient availability. The impact of climate change should be considered carefully in future management initiatives.																	1040-2381	2151-5530					2017	33	4					403	414		10.1080/10402381.2017.1379574								WOS:000423047200007						
J	Watson, SB; Kling, H				Watson, Susan B.; Kling, Hedy			Lake of theWoods phyto- and picoplankton: spatiotemporal patterns in blooms, community composition, and nutrient status	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												This study evaluated the phytoplankton and trophic status in Lake of the Woods (LOW; Ontario, Canada), a large, multi-basin waterbody with marked gradients in water quality and annual cyanobacterial blooms. We combined a broad comparison of average total phosphorus (TP)-biomass relationships in LOW and other north temperate lakes with a detailed spatiotemporal analysis of net-, nanno-, and picoplankton, total bacterioplankton, nutrient status, and water quality across six hydrological sectors of the lake between 2008 and 2010. Average total phytoplankton biomass (TB) varied considerably among zones and years but, similar to TP, was highest in the shallower, more eutrophic southern zones with a generally lower than average TB/TP yield within the among-lakes dataset. Summer-fall blooms of N-2-fixing cyanobacteria were dominated by Aphanizomenon across most sectors except in the north, where Dolichospermum predominated. Unlike the larger size fractions, patterns in picoplankton suggested non-nutrient constraints: phycoerythrin-rich picocyanobacteria (<2 mu m) showed a distinct south-north increase correlated with water transparency, while the more abundant phycocyanin-rich fraction was related to dissolved organicmaterial with no distinct spatial patterns. Bacterial numbers were higher in surface layers and significantly related to temperature but not nutrients; spatial distribution indicated they were not directly introduced from riverine inputs. Overall, planktonic P deficiency was higher in the north and increased in late summer concurrent with N co-limitation and increases in N-2-fixers. The combined data suggest that P ultimately limits LOW plankton, but short-term N and Si deficiencies influence the plankton community composition.																	1040-2381	2151-5530					2017	33	4					415	432		10.1080/10402381.2017.1331282								WOS:000423047200008						
J	McDaniel, T; Pascoe, T				McDaniel, Tana; Pascoe, Timothy			Applying the reference condition approach to Lake of the Woods: sediment and benthic invertebrate community assessment for lake-wide management	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Lake of the Woods (LOW) is a large, international lake recently designated as impaired by the State of Minnesota due to excess nutrients and nuisance algal blooms. Concerns regarding the impacts of eutrophication have prompted the need for management tools to help to defines areas of ecosystem impairment and to monitor changes in trophic status. The goal of this study was to assess areas of potential anthropogenic impacts in LOW using a benthic macro-invertebrate reference condition approach model and identify factors correlating with these impacts. We also sought to provide baseline information on sediment chemistry prior to the initiation of increased mining activity in the basin. A Canadian Aquatic Biomonitoring Network (CABIN) reference model was developed for LOW to compare the benthic community structure at a number of potentially stressed or impaired sites. Concentrations of both nutrients and metals in sediments at many sites in LOW exceeded Ontario provincial and Canadian federal effect levels for aquatic life. The benthic community at some locations was found to be divergent from reference sites, with substantial reductions in diversity and abundance associated with stress to the benthic community. As expected, benthic invertebrate diversity appeared to be most affected at sites that were deep, thermally stratified and high in nutrients thus making them prone to hypoxia. Benthic diversity was also negatively associated with higher concentrations of metals such as lead and arsenic. The CABIN approach can provide a useful tool in lake management for the identification of stressed sites.																	1040-2381	2151-5530					2017	33	4					452	471		10.1080/10402381.2017.1379573								WOS:000423047200011

Average concentrations (mu g g(-1) wet weight) in Tersakan: Al (60.81 +/- 58.51), B (27.13 +/- 12.42), Co (0.07 +/- 0.05), Cd (0.01 +/- 0.02), Cu (1.44 +/- 0.51), Cr (0.75 +/- 0.54), Fe (33.49 +/- 30.69), Mn (2.19 +/- 1.35), Ni (0.98 +/- 1.27), Zn (20.71 +/- 20.16) and in Saricay: Al (33.82 +/- 37.19), B(8.15 +/- 8.90), Co (0.04 +/- 0.035), Cd (0.01 +/- 0.01), Cu (0.90 +/- 0.44), Cr (0.40 +/- 0.27), Fe (12.97 +/- 8.17), Mn (3.75 +/- 2.045), Ni (0.54 +/- 0.82), Zn (19.05 +/- 10.65) were found. Lead (Pb) was found below detection limits in all stations or seasons while Al accumulation was found highest. The effects of water quality parameters on essential and non-essential metal-metalloid accumulations in fish tissue were indicated by PCA and Co-inertia analyses. Concentrations of observed non-essential metals did not exceed the consumption limits. The evaluation of the data obtained from the study, in Tersakan and Saricay streams, reveal that the ecological balance can be changed in a negative way in case of continuation of the pollution of these two streams.																	1303-2712						2017	17				SI		1405	1413		10.4194/1303-2712-v17_6_34								WOS:000422959000009

Magdalena Bay is a subtropical coastal lagoon of northwestern Mexico with important ecological considerations and numerous fisheries. Knowledge of hydrodynamics and water quality are essential for establishing best management practices for the Bay. Goals. The aim of the study was to analyze the influence of the tide on the variation and transport of nutrients and chlorophyll a between the inner lagoon and the adjacent ocean as a fertilization mechanism in the area. Methods. Samples were obtained in June, August, and November 2005 at a site close to the mouth (24 degrees 57' N and 112 degrees 03' W). The samples were obtained every 2 hours during each tidal cycle at three different depths (0, 15, and 30 m). Temperature and salinity were measured using a CTD. Nutrients, chlorophyll a, and oxygen were measured at a laboratory. Results. Three climatic-oceanographic conditions were identified: upwelling (June), stratification (August), and negative effects during the ENSO (November). The correlation between tidal range and other variables was significant (p < 0.05) in August, compared to June and November. Conclusions. The transport of net nutrients associated with the tidal cycle depends on the season and the state of the tide and is considered high compared to other smaller systems. This explains the high organic productivity in this coastal region.																	0188-8897						2017	27	2					253	264										WOS:000418486800010

During the study, a total of 33 zooplankton species, 17 species from Rotifera, 13 species from Cladocera and 3 species from Copepoda were identified. Maximum number of zooplankton has been recorded in May (271785 individuals/m(3)). The least the number of individuals were recorded in February (5090 individuals/m(3)). The maximum number of taxa were recorded in October with 17 species and the least were recorded in february with 5 species. All of the zooplanktonic species have been detected for the first time in Boztepe Recai Kutan Dam Lake. Based on the total number of individuals of zooplankton, Rotifera was dominant group in the dam lake (51.5%) followed by Cladocera (39.4 %) and Copepoda (9.1 %). Dominant Rotifera species was Keratella cochlearis followed by K. quadrata. Bosmina longirostris was dominant Cladocera species. Cyclops vicinus was the most observed Copepoda species. Rotifera has showed higher diversity compared to other groups, reaching also high densities throughout the study period. Keratella cochlearis K. quadrata, Bosmina longirostris are indicators of eutrophic character and were recorded frequently in high numbers, suggest that the lake may be eutrophic.					saler, serap/0000-0001-5900-491X												1300-1590	2148-3140					2017	34	3					261	267		10.12714/egejfas.2017.34.3.03								WOS:000418345300003						
J	Campbell, LA; Rice, JA				Campbell, Lindsay A.; Rice, James A.			Development and Field Application of a Model Predicting Effects of Episodic Hypoxia on Short-Term Growth of Spot	MARINE AND COASTAL FISHERIES												In North Carolina and elsewhere, there is concern that excessive nutrient loading and resulting hypoxic conditions in coastal ecosystems are adversely affecting the native fauna, but quantifying the effects on fish can be difficult. Hypoxia may reduce fish growth via direct exposure or indirectly (e.g., cost of low-oxygen avoidance, reduced food availability, and density-dependent effects in oxygenated refuges). Given the fine spatial and temporal scale of oxygen dynamics in estuarine habitats, evaluating the impacts of hypoxia on fish growth requires short-term growth indicators that integrate the effects of rapidly changing environmental conditions. To address this need, we experimentally determined the sensitivity and response time of a suite of bioindicators of recent growth (RNA: DNA ratio and RNA concentration in muscle tissue; insulin-like growth factor-I messenger RNA expression in the liver; hepatosomatic index; and Fulton's condition factor K) to changes in the specific growth rate of juvenile Spot Leiostomus xanthurus. A model based on multiple bioindicators was better at estimating growth rate than models based on single indicators. We used this model to estimate recent growth rates of juvenile Spot collected from the Neuse River estuary and related them to recent dissolved oxygen (DO) conditions. Estimated growth rates of Spot collected after a week of good DO conditions were almost twice those of Spot collected after a week of poor DO conditions. Using these results and DO data from the Neuse River estuary in 2007-2010, we estimated that hypoxia dynamics reduced Spot growth over the summer by 6-18% in these years relative to growth under constant good DO conditions. This approach can be used to evaluate impacts of observed or modeled scenarios of water quality dynamics on growth of juvenile Spot and serves as a template for development of predictive growth models for other species.																	1942-5120						2017	9	1					504	520		10.1080/19425120.2017.1362492								WOS:000417037900012

Improving the performance of the EPT Index to accommodate multiple stressors in Afrotropical streams	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												The EPT index (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera) may be skewed by the wide tolerance to multiple stressors of the Baetid, Caenid and Hydropsychid families, which affects the performance of the EPT index as an indicator of multiple stressors in aquatic ecosystems. The effect of the BCH families on the EPT index was evaluated and alternatives were considered to improve its performance. The hypothesis that the removal of the BCH families improves sensitivity of the EPT index to human-induced stressors in streams and rivers was tested. Macroinvertebrates were collected in January-March 2009 at 22 sites in the Nyando and Nzoia Rivers, Lake Victoria basin, Kenya. Nine derivatives and modifications of the EPT index were tested for responses to a disturbance gradient, ranked into three condition categories (reference, intermediate and impaired). The sensitivity of the proportionate abundance derivative of the EPT index improved when the BCH families were removed, whereas that of the richness derivative improved marginally. Other modifications considered performed poorly when compared with the EPT-BCH metrics. Wide distribution of the BCH across all sites, irrespective of the level of disturbance, reduced the sensitivity of the EPT index in the studied streams. The removal of the BCH families enhanced the sensitivity of the index to multiple stressors in Afrotropical streams and rivers.																	1608-5914	1727-9364					2017	42	3					219	233		10.2989/16085914.2017.1392282								WOS:000416745200002

Key factors that drive phytoplankton biomass and community composition in the urbanised Nahoon Estuary, South Africa	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												Estuaries are under intense pressure, because of urban developments and water abstraction. Water column characteristics of the Nahoon Estuary were examined in 2014-2015 to identify factors that influenced phytoplankton dynamics. The estuary was found to be saline (similar to 33) and remained well-oxygenated (similar to 6 mg l(-1)) throughout the current study. During this period, freshwater inflow into the estuary was minimal and chlorophyll a biomass was low (3.6 +/- 0.3 mu g l(-1) ). Nutrient concentration at Nahoon Estuary showed a linear relationship with salinity, indicative of a conservative behaviour. Phytoplankton dynamics were altered by fluctuations in nutrient levels, not necessarily in response to freshwater inflow. The impact of Nahoon Dam and destructive land-use alongside the Nahoon River decreases freshwater inflow and increases nutrient loading into the estuary. In terms of nutrient loading, the current study showed the importance of microalgae as indicators of the nutrient status of an estuary. The presence of cyanobacteria and high phytoplankton biomass in the upper reaches of the estuary confirms the input of excessive nutrients. The results of the current study clearly show that better management of both the Nahoon River and its catchment is vital to ensure the health of the system.																	1608-5914	1727-9364					2017	42	3					245	257		10.2989/16085914.2017.1373058								WOS:000416745200004

Water quality assessment of the Siluko River, southern Nigeria	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												The water quality of the Siluko River, Edo State, Nigeria was investigated from March to August 2015 to determine its suitability for drinking and usage for domestic purposes. Water samples collected from three stations were tested for thirteen physico-chemical parameters using standard analytical procedures. Temperature, phosphate and chloride were significantly different across the three stations. All other parameters, with the exception of turbidity, dissolved oxygen and phosphate, were within the permissible limits recommended by the Nigerian Standard for Drinking Water Quality (NSDWQ) and World Health Organization (WHO). Water Quality Index (WQI) values ranged from 11.24 to 16.15, indicating excellent water quality. While the quality of the water from the Siluko River is suitable for drinking and domestic usage, to prevent future deterioration of the water, it is recommended that the regulating authorities monitor effluents discharged into the river from human activities.																	1608-5914	1727-9364					2017	42	3					279	286		10.2989/16085914.2017.1371579								WOS:000416745200007

Lake and species specific patterns of non-diadromous recruitment in amphidromous fish: the importance of local recruitment and habitat requirements	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Understanding migratory life histories is critical for the effective management and conservation of migratory species. However, amphidromous migrations (fish hatch in streams, immediately migrate to the sea for a feeding period and return to fresh water as juveniles) remain understudied owing to the difficulties of tracking tiny larval fish. Despite this, it has widely been assumed that amphidromous fish have open, resilient populations, with marine-rearing larvae dispersing widely during their pelagic phase. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that when an alternative freshwater pelagic habitat is available, non-diadromous recruitment will be the dominant process in sustaining amphidromous fish populations, with implications for their connectivity and resilience. Otolith microchemical analyses of five species (three Galaxias (Galaxiidae), two Gobiomorphus (Eleotridae)) from paired systems on the South Island of New Zealand indicated that when a suitable freshwater pelagic habitat existed downstream, non-diadromous recruitment was the primary population-sustaining process, typically contributing >90% of recruits. In addition, not all species recruited from all lakes, indicating the importance of the largely unstudied role of species-specific amphidromous larval requirements. The results of the present study emphasise the need to better understand the dynamics of individual populations of amphidromous fish, and highlight the importance of understanding species-specific early life history requirements to fully understand their distributions and management needs.

Thus, quick and effective methods for detecting the abundance of cyanobacteria in waterbodies are needed to complement conventional laboratory methods. In addition, inadequate control techniques that are applied at times of high cyanobacterial concentrations can cause the cells to lyse and release toxins into the water. In the present study we investigated the behaviour of cyanobacteria by determining phycocyanin and chlorophyll concentrations, using spectroradiometric and fluorometric techniques, in three field campaigns performed at the Nova Avanhandava Reservoir, Brazil. The sampling rate and favourable season for data collected had been determined previously by remote sensing analysis. Seasonal estimates of cyanobacteria were made because fluorometric sensors were able to record low concentrations, whereas the spectral analyses only detected phycocyanin at higher concentrations. Results of spectral analyses highlighted the subtle spectral characteristics indicating the presence of phycocyanin, even without a clear definition of the diagnostic features in the reflectance curve. Therefore, multiscale remote sensing complemented by fluorometric analysis and relevant environmental variables is an effective approach for monitoring cyanobacteria in Brazilian inland waters.																	1323-1650	1448-6059					2017	68	12					2344	2354		10.1071/MF16259								WOS:000416334800016

Cormorant predation overlaps with fish communities and commercial-fishery interest in a Swedish lake	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												The increase of the fish-eating cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis) in Europe has resulted in conflicts with fisheries. In Lake Roxen, Sweden, cormorants are blamed for causing a decrease in fishery catches. To study and describe the potential effects that cormorants may have had on fish in the lake, their diet was analysed in relation to fish catches in gill-net surveys and fishery catches. Estimates of predation were achieved by 'tag and recovery' on eel, pike-perch and perch. Cormorants predated on the most common species and sizes, which were mainly smaller perch, ruffe and roach (mean sizes of 9, 8 and 13 cm respectively). Tag recoveries from perch, eel and pike-perch detected predation estimates of 14, 7 and 15% respectively. From a highly eutrophic state, the lake has shown improvements in water quality and a development towards larger predatory fish was expected, but the results from gill-net surveys did not show this. Results indicated that cormorants and fisheries may both be responsible, but because cormorants remove more fish, they may be the main factor for the lack of recovery of large predatory fish. Their predation keeps recruitment high, but the number of fish that reach large sizes remains low.																	1323-1650	1448-6059					2017	68	9					1677	1685		10.1071/MF16227								WOS:000408576800009

Phytoplankton in two tropical mangroves of Sao Tome Island (Gulf of Guinea): A contribution towards sustainable management strategies	REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE												Phytoplankton are important primary producers in tropical coastal lagoons, with a critical role in sustaining food webs. However, most studies conducted in tropical systems with high anthropogenic influence have focused only on biomass. Water samples were collected, for phytoplankton (pigments and microscopy) and other environmental parameters, from two mangrove lagoons in Sao Tome Island. The highest nutrient concentrations were observed in the mangrove of Praia das Conchas, indicating stronger nutrient inputs in this catchment area. Bottom oxygen deficiency was observed in the mangrove of Malanza, which is likely to be associated with the existence of a bridge that constrains the water exchange with the sea. Pigment analyses showed that overall chlorophyll a concentrations were low, indicating low phytoplankton biomass. The highest values were found at Praia das Conchas. It is suggested that chlorophyll a can be used as an indicator of anthropogenic pressure in this tropical system. Microscopy reveales the presence of Dinophysis sp. and Ostreopsis sp. cells, which can be harmful even at low densities. Water quality could be improved by enhancing oxygen condition in Malanza and by monitoring the occurrence of algal blooms, with potential benefits for public health and tourism.

Distribution of epiphytic diatoms on five macrophytes from a Pampean shallow lake: host-specificity and implications for paleoenvironmental reconstructions	DIATOM RESEARCH												Epiphytic diatoms are an important component of death and fossil assemblages in macrophyte-dominated shallow lakes. In the Argentinean Pampas, the lack of studies on the composition, diversity and distribution of epiphytic diatoms limits the extent of the paleoenvironmental inferences that can be made from their fossil record. We studied the composition of epiphytic diatom biofilms living on five macrophytes in a Pampean shallow lake (Nahuel Ruca, Buenos Aires Province). Samples of emergent, free-floating, rooted-floating and submersed macrophytes were collected in triplicate over one year and analyzed for diatoms. Epiphytic assemblages on the free-floating species Azolla filiculoides and Ricciocarpus natans were dominated by Lemnicola hungarica, whereas the remaining macrophytes (the emergent Schoenoplectus californicus, the submersed Ceratophyllum demersum and the rooted-floating Hydrocotyle ranunculoides) were dominated by Cocconeis placentula. Although all assemblages were dominated by epiphytic taxa, low proportions of planktonic and benthic taxa were also recorded. Composition, diversity, richness and evenness of diatom assemblages found on free-floating macrophytes differed significantly from the rest of the samples analyzed. The strong association of the epiphytic diatom, L. hungarica, with free-floating macrophytes, together with the high dominance of C. placentula on emergent and submersed plants provides a potential method for inferring past fluctuations in aquatic vegetation coverage in the palaeolimnological record of Pampean shallow lakes.																	0269-249X	2159-8347					2017	32	3					263	275		10.1080/0269249X.2017.1378128								WOS:000414949300003

Chaetoceros was the most diverse genus in the diatom assemblage of the study area. A total of 23 Chaetoceros species were identified based on light and scanning electron microscopy. Three taxa, Chaetoceros aequatorialis, C. contortus and C. lorenzianus f. forceps were recorded for the first time in Turkish seas. The most common species were C. affinis, C. curvisetus, C. decipiens and C. holsaticus. The contribution of Chaetoceros species to the number of total phytoplankton species was between 15% and 17%. The highest abundance of Chaetoceros species was 507 x 10(3) cells L-1, dominated by C. affinis, C. constrictus, C. holsaticus, C. lauderi in the middle estuary in spring. Chaetoceros species were more abundant in the middle and lower estuary in April and May. In the upper estuary (UE), Chaetoceros species were rarely observed due to low water transparency caused by suspended particulate materials. Light limitation may be considered one of the most important factors affecting the diversity and spatial distribution of these species in the UE. The present work is the first detailed study on the diversity and distribution of Chaetoceros species for Turkish seas.					, Seyfettin/0000-0002-4660-3937												0269-249X	2159-8347					2017	32	3					309	323		10.1080/0269249X.2017.1360800								WOS:000414949300006

Effects of atmospheric cold fronts on stratification and water quality of a tropical reservoir: implications for aquaculture	AQUACULTURE ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS												Stratification and mixing patterns of a water body are influenced by the variability of atmospheric systems, which can also modify their biogeochemical properties. The primary goal of this study was to analyze the effect of atmospheric cold fronts (CFs) on thermal stratification and water quality parameters in 4 embayments of the Furnas Hydroelectric Reservoir (FHR) (southeastern Brazil), a warm monomictic water body. A secondary goal was to evaluate the implications of this effect on the aquaculture of Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus (L.) in net cages. A 2 yr dataset of meteorological and water quality parameters was used to compute heat flux balance components and buoyancy frequency. These parameters were used to evaluate the influence of CFs on FHR water column stability and water quality. It was observed that the passing of CFs increased net heat loss and wind velocity, resulting in a partial mixture of surface waters with deeper layers. These changes in the physical structure of the water column altered the diel cycle of water temperature, led to a slight decrease in dissolved oxygen concentrations and pH values during the stratification period, and contributed to the increase in dilution power at the fish cultivation sites. However, following CF passages, no significant changes were observed in water quality parameters that influenced Nile tilapia cultivation in the FHR. Nevertheless, the understanding of meteorological systems and their influence on the physical and biogeochemical properties of an aquatic system is important for optimal management of aquaculture activities.																	1869-215X	1869-7534					2017	9						385	403		10.3354/aei00240								WOS:000412233700005

Trace organic compounds in rivers, streams, and wastewater in southeastern Alberta, Canada	INLAND WATERS												We selected 14 anthropogenic organic compounds representing major classes of potential contaminants for analysis to determine their occurrence in the South Saskatchewan River and its tributaries near irrigated farmland and the only urban center in southeast Alberta, Canada. Agriculture and urban runoff and discharges seem to have little impact on the quality of surface water based on samples taken above and below Medicine Hat/Redcliff in the South Saskatchewan River and local tributaries. Samples of river water, tributary water, and raw and treated wastewater taken over a period of 3 years allowed an estimation of the impact of trace organic compounds from urban and agricultural activities on water quality. Of the 14 compounds investigated, 10 were detected in concentrations above the detection limit in at least one surface water sample and 9 at concentrations above the detection limit in sewage samples. The wastewater treatment plant removed indicator compounds to varying degrees, and the volume of treated effluent discharge was <1% of the river, even during the lowest flow conditions, thereby minimizing potential impact. Discharge in the river and tributaries varied by an order of magnitude over the period of study, including 2 major flood events in the South Saskatchewan River. Potential health or environmental effects were difficult to evaluate from a regulatory perspective because few guidelines are available for reference.																	2044-2041	2044-205X					2017	7	3					283	296		10.1080/20442041.2017.1329908								WOS:000412646100006

Land use, soil properties and weather conditions influence nutrient fluxes into a deep oligotrophic lake	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Many streams and rivers in upland watersheds in southern New Zealand drain into deep, oligotrophic lakes with major aesthetic, recreational and conservation values. We examined the effects of increasing pasture cover and weather-related variables on nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in eight streams draining into Lake Wanaka and hypothesised that (1) DOC and N concentrations would increase with increasing land development, but soil characteristics in the watershed would mediate P input and (2) weather-related factors that increase hydrological connectivity in the landscape would enhance the influx of N and DOC. Agricultural development correlated positively with N and DOC concentrations in stream water, but temperature and soil moisture mitigated the influence of pasture cover on surface-water DOC concentration under very dry or very wet conditions. Weather-related factors did not influence N concentrations in streams. Neither land use nor weather-related conditions correlated with concentrations of dissolved P, possibly reflecting good P-binding in soils and lack of sampling during high-flow events. Our results provided evidence that agricultural development in grassland watersheds increases the concentrations of Nand DOC entering Lake Wanaka, and weather and soil conditions mediate the amount of DOC transferred from soils into streams.																	1323-1650	1448-6059					2017	68	10					1830	1844		10.1071/MF16042								WOS:000411826800005

We measured nitrogen and carbon isotope ratios and concentrations in mangrove leaves and muscle tissues of two species of gastropod snails to determine the dispersion and biological assimilation of sewage-derived nutrients in a macro-tidal creek. The values of stable isotope of nitrogen (delta N-15) in mangrove leaves and gastropods from the affected creek were significantly higher than those in samples from an unaffected creek, reflecting a graduated influence of sewage-derived N. The delta N-15 values in mangrove leaves showed high repeatability between sampling rounds and this, coupled with ease of sampling, makes them an effective monitoring tool to trace the influence of sewage effluent in receiving waters. The combined use of values of delta N-15 and stable isotope of carbon in gastropods showed some promise as a monitoring tool, but intra-and inter-specific variations in isotope values due to spatial differences in available food sources may affect their reliability in tracing sewage influence.																	1323-1650	1448-6059					2017	68	10					1855	1866		10.1071/MF16080								WOS:000411826800007

Characterising the variations in phytoplankton communities and the factors affecting these variations in a fluctuating environment are central issues in ecology and essential to developing appropriate conservation strategies. In the present study, seasonal variations in the phytoplankton community and the driving environmental factors were analysed based on data from Lake Nansihu in 2013. In all, 138 phytoplankton species were identified. The phytoplankton community exhibited seasonal variations, with a mean abundance that ranged from 5.00 x 10(5) cells L-1 in winter to 4.57 x 10(6) cells L-1 in summer and a mean biomass that varied from 0.44 mg L-1 in winter to 3.75 mg L-1 in summer. A spring algal bloom did not appear in this warm, temperate monsoon lake, but an algal bloom did appear in summer when the temperature and nutrient concentrations were high. There were substantial seasonal variations in the dominant phytoplankton taxa, from Chlorophyta, Bacillariophyta and Euglenophyta in spring to Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta in summer, followed by dominance of Chlorophyta in autumn and Bacillariophyta in winter. Results of canonical correspondence analysis indicated that although the environmental factors affecting the seasonal variations in different phytoplankton species varied, water temperature, total nitrogen, total phosphorus and ammonia nitrogen appeared to be the most dominant. These four variables were also the main environmental factors driving the seasonal variations in the phytoplankton community in the lake. The results of the present study will be useful in guaranteeing the water quality and ecological security of Lake Nansihu.

Nitrogen nutrients in a subtropical river: temporal variation and analysis at different spatial scales	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Herein we provide a framework for evaluating the spatiotemporal variation of nitrate and ammonium and their relationships with environmental and anthropogenic variables at different scales. Bimonthly samples were collected from 28 sites in the Duero River, Mexico, from May to December 2013. The river flow changed and lost connectivity during the dry season because more water was diverted for irrigation. Four sites had the highest nitrate and ammonium values (7.6 and 22.1 mg L-1 respectively), which were related to direct waste water discharge. The remaining 24 sites were analysed using a multivariate approach. Using hierarchical cluster analysis, seasonal trends were identified with two groupings during July and five in December. Sites were grouped into those with constant discharge and nitrates affected by springs and those with poor water quality (high concentrations of ammonium). Non-metric multidimensional scaling simultaneously revealed the variation in time and space, organised sites into an environmental ammonium gradient and differentiated between seasons according to nitrate levels. Regression tree analysis established a relationship between nutrients and independent variables. At the landscape level, the agricultural area affected nitrate (75%) and urban area affected ammonium (45%); at the basin level, road density influenced both parameters (10.68 km per 25 km(2)).																	1323-1650	1448-6059					2017	68	10					1935	1949		10.1071/MF16344								WOS:000411826800014

The effect of agriculture on cave-stream invertebrate communities	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												The impacts that land-use changes have on cave-stream fauna have not been considered widely in the investigations of land-use impacts on stream ecology. The present study examines how above-ground agriculture may influence cave-stream invertebrate communities. The invertebrate communities in four cave streams and their surface counterparts were sampled in 2014-2015, including two drained predominantly agricultural catchments and two drained forested catchments. These communities were examined alongside habitat and GIS land-use data to determine the relationship between above-ground land use and the stream communities. Invertebrate community composition and ecological health for surface streams was different between the agricultural and forest catchments. These differences were less pronounced within the cave-stream communities. Sedimentation was the principal agricultural stressor in the cave streams. The overall effects of agriculture were lower within the cave streams than on the surface; this is likely to be due to the reduced number of potentially deleterious stressors on cave streams.																	1323-1650	1448-6059					2017	68	11					1999	2007		10.1071/MF16112								WOS:000413690000003

The effect of riparian restoration on channel complexity and soil nutrients	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Restoration of riparian vegetation may reduce nutrient and sediment contamination of waterways while potentially enhancing stream channel complexity. Accordingly, the present study used a paired-site approach to investigate the effects of mature regrowth riparian vegetation on river channel morphology and soil nutrients (i.e. nitrogen and phosphorus), comparing four sites of degraded (pasture) and reforested reaches. A revised rapid assessment of riparian condition (RARC) was used to validate the site pairings. Riparian soil nutrient and elemental geochemistry were compared between paired sites, along with two parameters of channel width complexity and two for channel slope complexity. The RARC analysis confirmed the validity of the paired site design. The elemental geochemistry results indicated that underlying geology may affect the paired site analyses. Reaches with mature regrowth vegetation had greater channel width complexity but no difference in their riverbed slope complexity. In addition, degraded reaches had higher soil nutrient (i.e. nitrogen and phosphorus) concentrations, potentially indicative of the greater nutrient retention of pasture grass sites compared with mature regrowth forested reaches with less ground cover. Overall, the present study indicates that restoring mature regrowth riparian vegetation may increase river channel width complexity, although it may require canopy management to optimise the nutrient retention potential necessary to maximise the effect of riparian restoration strategies on freshwater environments.

To evaluate the possible control of Microcystis-based water blooms using fruit from Macleaya cordata (MC-fruit), the effects of MC-fruit on the growth, polyphasic chlorophyll fluorescence transients, microcystin production and efficacy of in situ cyanobacterial bloom removal were investigated. The results showed that MC-fruit could effectively inhibit the growth of M. aeruginosa PCC7806 at a concentration of 1 mg l(-1). MC-fruit stress caused severe damage to photosynthesis of M. aeruginosa and decreased the content of cellular microcystin-LR. The results of an in situ field test showed that MC-fruit effectively reduced the biomass of Microcystis and improved water quality. Accordingly, MC-fruit may be a useful biologically derived algicide for cyanobacterial bloom control.																	0031-8884						2017	56	4					382	389		10.2216/16-87.1								WOS:000412892800003

Measures enacted to restore degraded freshwater ecosystems often involve the reintroduction of submerged plants and aquatic animals with beneficial ecological functions. In a mesocosm experiment, three treatments (planting with Vallisneria natans, introduction of the snail Bellamya aeruginosa and a combined treatment with both plants and snails) were compared with controls to evaluate their effects on trophic state. The total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations of planktonic and benthic algal samples were determined every two weeks, along with light intensity at the sediment surface. The plant-only treatment significantly reduced the TN levels and planktonic and benthic algal biomass and increased the light intensity at the sediment surface. The snail-only treatment reduced the concentrations of TN and reduced planktonic and benthic algal biomass. The combined treatment decreased the concentrations of TN and TP, reduced planktonic algal biomass and increased the light intensity on the sediment surface. The results indicate that while submerged plants and snails can both improve water quality, the most pronounced effect in aquatic ecosystems is achieved by their presence in combination. A combined reintroduction approach may provide enhanced benefits in restoring the eutrophic ecosystems, following the reduction of external nutrient loading.																	1961-9502						2017		418							44	10.1051/kmae/2017034								WOS:000411616600003

In April 2013, a prodigious storm front caused unprecedented flooding in the city and environs that resulted in extensive loss of life and property, especially in the Del Gato stream basin. Through an analysis of water quality and the conditions of the habitat on the basis of the macroinvertebrates present as bioindicators of environmental quality, this work aims to contribute to a reevaluation of the role of the marshes adjacent to the stream as flood-alleviation elements, and then propose alternatives for flooding management in the basin. Consequently, quantitative seasonal samples of vegetation, sediments, and benthic organic matter were taken and limnologic parameters measured in three sectors of the basin having different land uses: rural, periurban, and urban-industrial. The macroinvertebrate assemblages, as analyzed through the application of ecological indices, exhibited a marked decline in richness and in the Pampean Biotic Index towards the low-lying basin. Principal-components analysis associated Site 1 with the dissolved-oxygen concentration, Site 2 with high nitrate values, and Site 3 with oxygen demands. Redundancy analysis indicated a positive relationship between Baetidae and Aeolosomatidae with the dissolved-oxygen concentration and between Enchytraeidae and Stratiomyidae with the conductivity. These marshes are fundamental in maintaining good environmental conditions and attenuating the effects of the flooding that is predicted to become increasingly catastrophic in this region as the climate changes.																	1961-9502						2017		418							32	10.1051/kmae/2017022								WOS:000410533900002

According to the European Water Framework Directive, the limits between physico-chemical quality classesmust be set consistently with biological quality elements. Onewayto do this consists in analyzing the response of aquatic communities to environmental gradients across monitoring sites and in identifying ecological community thresholds, i.e. zones in the gradients where the species turnover is the highest. In this study, fish data from196 lakes in France were considered to derive ecological thresholds using the multivariate method of gradient forest. The analysis was performed on 25 species and 36 environmental parameters. The results revealed the highest importance of maximal water temperature in the distribution of fish species. Other important parameters includedgeographical factors, dissolved organic carbon concentration and water transparency, while nutrients appeared to have low influence. In spite of the diversity of species responses to the gradients, community thresholds were detected in the gradients of the most important physico- chemical parameters and of total phosphorus and nitrate concentrations as well. The thresholds identified in such macroecological study may highlight new patterns of species natural distribution and improve niche characterization. Moreover, when factors that may be influenced by human activities are involved, the thresholds could be used to set environmental standards for lake preservation.

Assessment of long-term trends for management of Candlewood Lake, Connecticut, USA	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Candlewood Lake, the largest;lake in Connecticut, is a pumped-storage reservoir formed in the 1920s for hydropower generation. Since its inception, the lake has experienced shifts in water quality coupled with watershed development and, in the 1980s, the introduction and spread of the invasive macrophyte, Myriophyllum spicatum. In response, a monitoring program to track water quality, and a winter drawdown program to mitigate growth of M. spicatum were initiated in 1985. Recently it was sugpested that the drawdovvn program exacerbated eutrophication of the lake. To test this hypothesis, statistical analyses of the long-term (1985 to 2012) database was conducted with a focus on trophicrelated variables. We examined the database using principal component analysis (PCA) and multivarite singular spectrum analysis (MSSA). MSSA is an extension of PCA for multivariate time series data that accounts for both temporal and cross-sectional dependencies We found no evidence that the trophic condition declined, or that the drawdowns have deteriorated the water quality. Instead, we found that lower TS, TSIchi, and TSSD values corresponding with improved trophic conditions occurred in summers following deep drawdowns, while significantly higher values correlated with shallow and less effective drawdowns. Overall, there has been a modest improvement in the trophic condition overtime, attributed to a combination of the winter drawdowns and management efforts. In contrast, a steady and significant increase in dissolved salts, likely due to enhanced use of road deicing treatments, was documented.																	1040-2381	2151-5530					2017	33	3					280	300		10.1080/10402381.2017.1335812								WOS:000410569400008

In some regions of the lake, fish habitat that was formerly dominant has disappeared completely. A few areas of desirable habitatpersist as a result of purposeful restoration actions, and these areas provide important conservation and restoration opportunities. In this study, the ecological conditions of Qianling Lale were assessed to identify hydrodynamic conditions, sediment deposition, and fish habitat suitability to recommend strategies for, improving and restoring, these areas. Two restoration strategies, "flood flush" and "add an artificial island were proposed and modeled to predict the restoration effects. Simulation results showed that the restoration scheme "add an artificial island' could improve spinibarbus (Spinibarbus sinensis Bleeker) habitat quality. The analysis also indicated that this restoration strategy could succeed in restoring the fish habitat under natural dynamic processes.																	1040-2381	2151-5530					2017	33	3					301	313		10.1080/10402381.2017.1336739								WOS:000410569400009

Phytoplankton ecology of a culturally eutrophic embayment: Hamilton Harbour, Lake Ontario	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Hamilton Harbour is a chronically eutrophic embayment located at the western end of Lake Ontario that has experienced many decades of agricultural, industrial, and urban contamination. It has been identified as an Area of Concern under the terms of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement between Canada and the United States. This study examines the ecology of the phytoplankton communities at one centrally located station during the ice-free period (May-October) of three non-consecutive years: 2002, 2004 and 2006. This was the first comprehensive study to be conducted since the 1970s. It was found that the phytoplankton communities are diverse and fluctuate throughout the year, along with changing nutrient, physical and environmental conditions. No consistent patterns of seasonal succession were observed throughout the study. Phytoflagellates including Cryptophyceae and Dinophyceae had a tendency to outnumber and out-compete other phytoplankton since they are mobile and able to seek out optimal habitats within the water column. For a highly eutrophic water body, algal biomass (annual mean approximate to 2.0 g m(-3)) was lower than expected and more consistent with mesotrophic conditions-an observation first made by researchers in the 1970s and attributed to the highly variable physical environment. While our study supports these earlier results, we also conclude that zooplankton grazing likely has a significant role in limiting the size of the algal standing crop. Several algal bloom events were captured during our study. In addition to the somewhat predictable blooms of Diatomeae in the spring and Cyanophyta in the summer, we also observed blooms of Cryptophyceae and Dinophyceae. In one case we observed a bloom with no dominant taxon-it contained a diverse mixture of Cryptophyceae, Euglenophyta and Dinophyceae-challenging the commonly held notion that algal blooms are essentially monocultures. Our results show that such a variable and stressed ecosystem requires frequent sampling to capture the rapid changes that occur.																	1463-4988	1539-4077					2017	20	3			SI		201	213		10.1080/14634988.2017.1307678								WOS:000410570900002

Elevated zooplankton production in a eutrophic Lake Ontario embayment: Hamilton Harbour 2002-2014	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Hamilton Harbour is an Area of Concern in western Lake Ontario, long stressed by cultural eutrophication, urbanization and invasive species. Despite high nutrient levels leading to hypolimnetic hypoxia and contaminated sediment, it is a highly productive environment. To better understand zooplankton dynamics in Hamilton Harbour, we conducted biweekly May to October sampling of zooplankton and rotifer composition at open water harbour sites from 2002-2014. May to October zooplankton density, dry biomass and total production averaged 265 +/- 16 animals l(-1), 306 +/- 19 mg m(-3) and 4131 +/- 359 mg m(-3), (+/- SE), respectively. These values are among the highest reported in the Great Lakes, with biomass two to seven times greater than in other eutrophic embayments. Zooplankton populations and taxonomic seasonality have remained relatively stable in Hamilton Harbour since 2002. Biomass is often dominated by smaller taxa such as Bosmina, Eubosmina and juvenile copepods, suggestive of high fish planktivory, but Daphnia retrocurva and D. galeata mendotae are also dominant during the summer, indicating improvements in the zooplankton community since the 1970s when Daphnia and cyclopoids were uncommon. Conversely, rotifers have declined over the last 40 years, though while still numerically dominant, now comprise <4% of total biomass and production compared to 40% in the 1970s. Both adult Dreissenid Mussels and their veliger larvae are less abundant in Hamilton Harbour compared to nearshore Lake Ontario. Zooplankton appear to be effectively utilizing high production rates of edible algae and microorganisms in the harbour. More work is needed to explore trophic interactions in this eutrophic ecosystem and the effects of hypolimnetic hypoxia on the zooplankton community.																	1463-4988	1539-4077					2017	20	3			SI		230	241		10.1080/14634988.2017.1294425								WOS:000410570900004

Monitoring of physicochemical parameters and acute toxicity tests allow us to measure water quality of the influent and effluent of wastewater treatment plants in accordance with the parameters established by the NOM-003-SEMARNAT-1997. Goals. We measured water quality of the influent and effluent of the wastewater treatment plant of the Autonomous University of Aguascalientes during 2007-2008. Methods. Every 15 days physicochemical parameters were taken and acute toxicity tests were conducted with the cladoceran Daphnia magna and the rotifer Lecane quadridentata. Results. The influent showed median lethal concentration to be between 25.71 and 3.88 toxic units with L. quadridentata, while with D. magna the median lethal concentration was between 31.51 and 3.17 toxic units. The effluent showed median lethal concentration to be between 60.71 and 1.64 toxic units with L. quadridentata, whereas the D. magna showed no toxicity. Conclusions. We concluded that the wastewater treatment plant of the Autonomous University of Aguascalientes in 2007-2008 fulfilled Mexico's water quality criteria after treatment.																	0188-8897						2017	27	1					87	92										WOS:000410073900009

From inland to the coastal zone, MORCA's groundwater was considered hard and very hard, with non-dominant hydrochemical facies in the dry season and calcium, magnesium and sodium (cationic), and bicarbonate and chloride (anionic) types, in the rainy season. US Salinity Staff and Wilcox diagrams revealed that MORCA's groundwater is not suitable for use in irrigation. Further, the geochemical processes controlling the chemical composition of MORCA were evaporation and weathering. Conclusions. According to the TDS and water quality index (WQI and PHASECH) classifying just 4.5 % and over 50 % of the samples, respectively, MORCA water can be considered suitable for human consumption; only the groundwater from site EE-1, in the rainy season, was considered suitable for human consumption. US Salinity staff and Wilcox diagrams indicate that almost 50% of MORCA's groundwater is not suitable for irrigation use. MORCA's groundwater composition is dominated by evaporation and weathering of minerals such as anorthite, illite, and kaolinite.																	0188-8897						2017	27	1					103	113										WOS:000410073900011

Physico-chemical limnology and plankton dynamics of Mazvikadei, a tropical reservoir in Zimbabwe	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												The limnology of Mazvikadei Reservoir, northern Zimbabwe, was investigated in 2015 to determine whether it had changed since filling in 1990. The reservoir is characterised by low algal biomass, low nutrients (i.e. N and P) and high water clarity/transparency. Fifty-four species of phytoplankton were recorded, comprising Bacillariophyta, Chlorophyta, Cyanophyta, Desmids, Dinophyta and Euglenophyta. Chlorophyta numerically dominated in the hot dry season, whereas Bacillariophyta, Desmids, Dinophyta and Euglenophyta dominated in the cool dry season. Species richness was highest at the onset of the cool dry season, in response to high nutrient concentrations. Phytoplankton abundance and composition were significantly correlated with temperature, nitrates and total nitrogen. Nineteen zooplankton species were recorded, including Copepoda, Cladocera and Rotifera. Overall, Cladocera were numerically dominant and became most abundant during the cool dry season. Rotifers and copepods dominated during the hot dry season. The zooplankton abundance was correlated with reactive phosphorus and phytoplankton abundance. The trophic state of Mazvikadei Reservoir seems to have stabilised and to have assumed the physico-chemical characteristics and plankton community typical of an oligotrophic lake.																	1608-5914	1727-9364					2017	42	2					93	108		10.2989/16085914.2017.1336074								WOS:000410575700002

ICP-MS and ICP-OES analyses of trace metals based on total concentration of unfiltered lake water samples showed the presence of trace metals. All fish species accumulated Al, Mn and Sr in the highest concentrations in their gills, with Cu, Cd, Co, Cr, Pb and U highest in the liver. Pungu maclareni accumulated Al, Cr, Co, Sr and Pb in the highest concentrations. The highest mean gill Al concentration of 140 mu g g(-1) dry weight was measured in P. maclareni gills, this being one of the critically endangered cichlids of the lake. Stable isotope analyses of carbon delta C-13 and nitrogen delta N-15 showed that P. maclareni had the highest mean delta C-13 (-30.2%) and highest concentrations of Cr, Co, Pb and U in liver, probably linking the carbon source to the accumulation of metals. Though trace metal levels in the lake water were low, their presence in fish tissues suggest they are bioavailable, bioaccumulate and may pose a threat to the aquatic biota, and therefore should be monitored.																	1608-5914	1727-9364					2017	42	2					161	169		10.2989/16085914.2017.1297695								WOS:000410575700008

The ecological integrity of the Lower Olifants River, Limpopo province, South Africa: 2009-2015-Part A: Olifants River main stem	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												The major rivers of the South African 'Lowveld' (low-latitude savanna) suffer numerous impacts from upstream economic activities. Whereas monitoring these rivers is required to detect biodiversity losses, record pollution events and devise mitigation strategies, current monitoring programmes are inadequate. In 2009, the South African Earth Observation Network initiated an intensive long-term research programme on the Lowveld reaches of the Olifants River. Physico-chemical parameters, aquatic macroinvertebrates and fish abundances were recorded at four Lowveld sites in the Olifants River. We review six years of this programme. The results suggest deterioration in the ecological condition of the Olifants River with no discernible improvement through protected areas. Trends could not be detected. The parameters measured, sampling methods and/or sampling frequency might be responsible for the limited trends observed, or alternatively the results simply reflect stable conditions despite on-going pollution. Real time monitoring and an expansion in the parameters monitored would add value to the monitoring programme.																	1608-5914	1727-9364					2017	42	2					171	179		10.2989/16085914.2017.1334501								WOS:000410575700009

Analysis of the 2009-2015 data from four Olifants River sites showed deterioration in the river's ecological condition between where it enters the Lowveld and where it enters the Kruger National Park, with a slight recovery within the Kruger National Park. Physico-chemical, aquatic macroinvertebrate and fish data collected in 2009-2015 at six sites on the Steelpoort, Blyde, Klaserie and Selati tributaries of the Olifants River corroborated the ecological condition of these tributaries. The Selati was the most polluted and was in a critically modified condition, whereas the Klaserie and Steelpoort were in fair condition and the Blyde was in good condition. The Selati appeared to have a significant negative impact on the water quality, macroinvertebrates and fish of the Olifants River within the Kruger National Park.																	1608-5914	1727-9364					2017	42	2					181	190		10.2989/16085914.2017.1353477								WOS:000410575700010

Physico-chemical water characteristics and aquatic macroinvertebrates of Lake Tsimanampesotse, south-western Madagascar	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												Saline lakes are known to be amongst the most productive ecosystems in the world. Tsimanampesotse, a 'conservation hotspot' soda lake in southwestern Madagascar, was integrated into the Ramsar wetland network in 1998. Despite its importance for aquatic birds, knowledge of its water characteristics and aquatic biota is scarce. Water quality and aquatic invertebrates were investigated in April and August 2013 to provide baseline data in order to measure possible changes of the area in the future. Changes in water temperature (19.5-25.9 degrees C) and in dissolved oxygen (9.3-11.3 mg l(-1)) were detected. The water was highly mineralised (EC > 41 000 mu S cm(-1)) and moderately alkaline (pH similar to 8.0). The maximum concentrations of ammonia and phosphate were relatively high (39.1 and 57.6 mg l(-1), respectively). Freshwater runoff from the plateau makes the water quality in the eastern part of the lake better than that in the west. Of the 15 taxa of macroinvertebrate assessed, the crustaceans Grandidierella mahafalensis and Apseudes thaumastocheles were dominant. Decreased water salinity in April increased the abundance and diversity of macroinvertebrates. Despite its incorporation to the protected area, Lake Tsimanampesotse is still impacted by human activities and needs supplementary preservation.																	1608-5914	1727-9364					2017	42	2					191	199		10.2989/16085914.2017.1357532								WOS:000410575700011

Quantifying sustainability indicators in striped catfish Pangasianodon hypophthalmus downstream and upstream ponds	AQUACULTURE ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS												To assess the potential for improving sustainability and efficiency in an important Vietnamese finfish culture, we quantified sustainability indicators for 2 downstream and 2 upstream 3 to 4 m deep ponds for striped catfish Pangasianodon hypophthalmus (Sauvage, 1878) production along the Mekong River, Vietnam. The resources used per kg fish produced were (downstream vs. upstream): 2.8 vs. 7.1 m(3) water, 0.04 vs. 0.14 kWh energy, 0.06 vs. 0.11 h human labour and 0.06 vs. 0.15 g antibiotics (p < 0.05). The feed conversion ratio (kg feed dry matter per kg fish wet weight) was 1.50 vs. 1.65 and feed dry matter utilization efficiency was similar (28 vs. 30%) for both types of ponds (p > 0.05). Nitrogen and phosphorus utilization efficiencies were 44 vs. 40% for nitrogen (p < 0.05) and 17.7 vs. 17.6% for phosphorus (p > 0.05). An advantage of production in deep ponds is the breakdown of organic matter through denitrification and fermentation. Based on the difference between feed input and monitored outputs and sinks, an estimated 29-37% of dry matter volatilized as CO2 and 30-34% of nitrogen was lost as N-2. A major disadvantage of the deep pond production system is its dependency on water exchange with the Mekong River, resulting in low biosecurity, which is aggravated by the lack of availability of disease-free fingerlings. Dealing with disease caused farmers to apply suboptimal feeding rations and to lengthen the culture period. Developing (semi-)closed systems that adopt elements from recirculation technology could improve both culture performance and sustainability.																	1869-215X	1869-7534					2017	9						293	309		10.3354/aei00231								WOS:000409341200001

Epiphytic diatoms as indicators of ecological condition in New Zealand's lowland wetlands	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												The condition of New Zealand's remnant wetlands has been documented by landscape-scale assessments such as the Index of Ecological Integrity and Wetland Condition Index. We explored the potential for microscopic aquatic biota (epiphytic diatoms) to provide complementary information about wetland condition using data from 77 lowland sites (mainly palustrine swamps) with circumneutral pH. In the South Island, correspondence between diatoms and wetland indices or water quality was weak. In the North Island, conductivity and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) together explained 49% of the variance in assemblage composition and several diatom genera were indicative of high or low conductivity, dissolved phosphorus and TDN. Changes in these water quality variables may trigger changes in wetland condition, which are eventually reflected by the landscape-scale indices. Diatoms respond rapidly to water quality changes suggesting potential for diatom indicator taxa to provide early warning of wetland degradation or to track restoration.																	0028-8330	1175-8805					2017	51	4					505	527		10.1080/00288330.2017.1281318								WOS:000409201900004

Additional observations with light and scanning electron microscopy of two later varieties described from the Neotropics are also provided: N. brasiliana var. platensis Frenguelli and N. brasiliana var. guadalupensis Manguin described from Argentina and Guadalupe (French Antilles), respectively. Based on the morphological characteristics of the frustules the three taxa belong to Cosmioneis D.G. Mann & Stickle.

While N. brasiliana var. platensis is widely recorded in several regions of the African continent and Argentina, N. brasiliana is often recorded in Central America, almost certainly because of uncertainty over their identities, to date based only on line drawings.

Herein we present results on some limnological aspects of surface waterbodies in this water-scarce region before shale gas exploration. Thirty-three waterbodies (nine dams, 13 depression wetlands and 11 rivers) were sampled in November 2014 and April 2015. Principal component analysis revealed that depression wetlands and rivers had distinct physicochemical signatures, whereas dams were highly variable in their physicochemical attributes and exhibited characteristics similar to those of either rivers or depression wetlands. Non-parametric multivariate regressions and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) indicated that landscape variables such as underlying geology, altitude and land use poorly explained the physicochemical characteristics of the sampled waterbodies. Waterbody type was the only factor that explained a significant amount of the variation in physicochemistry during both sampling events. These data need to be supplemented by water quality information from additional sites and over longer time periods, as well as supporting data relating to other aspects, such as algae and invertebrates, before they can be used as a baseline for the long-term monitoring of freshwater ecosystems in the region.

Rapid appraisal links feral buffalo with kunkod (Melaleuca spp.) decline in freshwater billabongs of tropical northern Australia	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Freshwater wetlands have great ecological, social, cultural and economic importance and are considered some of the most threatened ecosystems globally, especially in the tropics. In the tropics of northern Australia, much land is owned by Aboriginal people, thus requiring community-based approaches to monitoring and decision making. Herein we present a collaborative community-based rapid appraisal of an observed decline in a culturally and ecologically important tree genus of the freshwater wetlands in northern Australia, locally known as kunkod (Melaleuca spp., Myrtaceae) by Bininj (local Aboriginal people). We conducted collaborative research with the local Aboriginal Djelk Rangers incorporating local and scientific knowledge and preferred research methods. The decline in kunkod was more common in the water zone than in the mud and dry zones of freshwater billabongs in the Djelk Indigenous Protected Area. Kunkod decline and poor regeneration were significantly correlated with high water electrical conductivity, turbidity and ammonium. Feral buffalo activity was also positively correlated with these parameters, suggesting an indirect effect of buffalo on kunkod population health (large and small trees) through reduced water quality rather than direct rubbing on the trees, as was initially expected. Ongoing monitoring will allow assessment of potential recovery of kunkod following planned feral buffalo control.

In each river, we sampled five sites with different types of substrate. These sites were characterised in situ according to the predominant material type (macrophytes, moss, pebbles and sand). A one-way ANOVA was used to test for significant differences in species abundance among substrates, and a nested ANOVA was used to test for significant differences in physical and chemical variables among rivers and sampling sites. A similarity percentage-species contribution analysis was performed to estimate the contribution of each species to the characterisation of each substrate. We observed significant differences in the abundance of seven species (Drusus bolivari, Glossosoma privatum, Larcasia partita, Micrasema longulum, M. servatum, M. gr. moestum and Sericostoma sp.) among substrates, confirming that these species have substrate preferences. According to similarity percentage-species contribution, the species that contributed most to differences were as follows: for sand, Sericostoma sp.; for macrophytes, Rhyacophila adjuncta, Hydropsyche ambigua, Sericostoma sp.; for moss, Micrasema gr. moestum, M. servatum, M. longulum, Hydropsyche tibialis and R. adjuncta; and for pebbles, Sericostoma sp., Larcasia partita and H. tibialis. These preferences can be explained by the fact that different species use different materials from the substrate to build their cases and also as a source of stability, protection and food.																	1323-1650	1448-6059					2017	68	9					1686	1694		10.1071/MF16246								WOS:000408576800010

Determination of the physical drivers of Zostera seagrass distribution using a spatial autoregressive lag model	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Seagrass mapping has become a key tool in understanding the causes of change in seagrass habitats. The present study demonstrates a method for examining relationships between seagrass habitat polygons and environmental data generated by hydrodynamic, wave, catchment and dispersion models. Seagrass abundance data are highly spatially autocorrelated and this effect was corrected using a spatially simultaneous autoregressive lag model (SSARLM). The physical processes that determine the spatial distribution of seagrass in Port Phillip Bay, Australia, were investigated by examining the links between seagrass distribution and abundance and broadscale hydrodynamic (waves, currents), physical (light, depth, salinity and temperature) and catchment (nutrient and suspended sediment concentrations) processes. The SSARLM indicated that the distribution of Zostera spp. meadows is principally constrained by two physical thresholds, namely, wave height or exposure and light. The former excludes seagrasses from colonising wave-exposed coastlines, whereas the latter directly determines the depth profile of seagrasses through its influence on light availability. In total, 95% of all seagrass occurred within grid cells with a mean significant wave height of < 0.38 m and a mean percentage irradiance of > 33% surface levels. By comparison, variation in water quality, represented by variables such as modelled total nitrogen, suspended solids or salinity, had little influence on seagrass distribution.

We report on changes in water quality in these lakes during recent decades. We integrated data on key limnological variables during the last 55 years by supplementing historical literature data with our own field measurements. Our analyses provide strong evidence for a steady increase in nutrient concentrations and decrease in water transparency. Total phosphorus and total nitrogen concentrations in both lakes over the study period increased 5- and 7-fold, respectively. Similarly, water transparency decreased, especially in Lake Chamo, which used to have clear water but is now becoming a sediment-loaded lake similar to Lake Abaya. We reconstructed fertilizer use and land use changes in the region during the past decades. The combined data suggest that the dramatic eutrophication we observed in the lakes is likely associated with increased fertilizer use or other activities related to intensified agricultural practices, and the decline in water transparency is probably associated with low tree cover due to deforestation. The profound changes in the ecology of both lakes may jeopardize the delivery of ecosystem services in the region, including water supply, fisheries, and ecotourism. Our results stress the urgent need for measures that prevent further environmental deterioration of the unique heritage provided by the Ethiopian Rift Valley lakes.																	2044-2041	2044-205X					2017	7	2					129	137		10.1080/20442041.2017.1301309								WOS:000408584600001

Catchment, morphometric, and water quality characteristics differ between reservoirs and naturally formed lakes on a latitudinal gradient in the conterminous United States	INLAND WATERS												Constructed lakes and impoundments (reservoirs) likely exhibit substantial differences in their physics, chemistry, and biology from naturally formed lakes; however, because reservoirs and natural lakes generally have different latitudinal distributions, less is known about quantitative, generalized differences between the 2 waterbody types. We compared a suite of limnological variables among 1033 reservoirs and natural lakes across multiple size classes on a latitudinal gradient in the conterminous United States. In general, reservoirs had significantly greater perimeters, catchment areas, and catchment area: surface area ratios than natural lakes. Interestingly, several lakeshore land use, morphometric, and water quality response variables exhibited significant interactions between waterbody type and latitude. Southern reservoirs were deeper and had higher proportions of forested land and less agriculture and developed land use in their lakeshore than southern natural lakes, whereas northern reservoirs were shallower and had less forest and more agriculture and developed land in their lakeshore than northern natural lakes. Following the waterbody depth and land use data, natural lakes also had greater total phosphorus (TP) concentrations and shallower Secchi disk depths at lower latitudes, whereas reservoirs had greater TP concentrations and shallower Secchi disk depths at higher latitudes. Overall, natural lakes were more eutrophic than reservoirs, having greater total nitrogen and chlorophyll a concentrations, regardless of latitude. Our findings indicate that many physical, chemical, and lakeshore land use characteristics of reservoirs and natural lakes vary on a latitudinal gradient, which has implications for the water quality, ecology, and management of these waterbodies.																	2044-2041	2044-205X					2017	7	2					171	180		10.1080/20442041.2017.1293317								WOS:000408584600005						
J	Spitale, D				Spitale, Daniel			Performance of the STAR_ICMi macroinvertebrate index and implications for classification and biomonitoring of rivers	KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS												Although biomonitoring is the core approach adopted by the European Union's Water Framework Directive (WFD), many biotic indices still lack a thorough analysis of their performance and uncertainty. The multihabitat sampling and the application of STAR_ICMi index on macroinvertebrates are the standard methods to assess the ecological status of rivers in Italy. Ever since the Italians' implementation, dates back to 2010, few studies have tested the index performance with different sampling efforts, and even rarer are those assessing index uncertainty. However, these are worthwhile topics to investigate because all the Environmental Agencies are applying this index with both ecological and economic consequences. Aims of this study were (i) to assess the effect of subsampling on the STAR_ICMi index, (ii) to propose a standard method to calculate the index precision, and (iii) to test several less time-consuming alternatives to census all the individuals in the sample. I showed that the index is strongly affected by subsampling, and unbiased comparisons of ecological status can only be done at the same sampling effort. The index precision, calculated by bootstrapping the observed abundance of taxa, was so low in some circumstances, to increase the risk of misclassification. Finally, I showed that to avoid counting all the individuals in a sample, it is possible to estimate the most abundant taxa using a rank-abundance model. With this less time-consuming method, the STAR_ICMi index is predicted with sufficient precision.																	1961-9502						2017		418							20	10.1051/kmae/2017012								WOS:000406714700001						
J	Tronstad, LM; Hotaling, S				Tronstad, Lusha M.; Hotaling, Scott			Long-term trends in aquatic ecosystem bioassessment metrics are not influenced by sampling method: empirical evidence from the Niobrara River	KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS												Choosing an aquatic invertebrate samplingmethod for biomonitoring depends upon study goals, resources, and ecosystem conditions. In this study, we compared two methods that are widely used in stream ecology, but have not been directly compared: Hester-Dendy (HD) and Hess sampling. Hester-Dendy sampling uses artificial substrate that invertebrates colonize over a specific period of time. In contrast, Hess samplers surround a fixed area of natural substrate with a net. To compare approaches, we combined 5 years of simultaneous HD and Hess data collection (2010-2014) from the Niobrara River with a 14-year (1996-2009) historical HD data set for the same study sites. We used this full 19-year data set to assess how ecosystem health has changed in the Niobrara River over time, while also testing the influence of HD versus Hess data (20102014) on historical trends (1996-2009). Our results showed that HD samples are more taxonomically variable and bias bioassessment metrics because they collect more sensitive taxa versus Hess sampling. However, when combined with the 1996-2009 HD data set, both recent HD and Hess data sets recovered the same trend of declining ecosystem health in the Niobrara River. These results provide empirical evidence that even when historical HD data are combined with recent Hess data, long-term bioassessment trends remain unchanged despite more accurate perspectives of invertebrate assemblages being collected.																	1961-9502						2017		418							28	10.1051/kmae/2017020								WOS:000406714700009

Variations in carbon-to-phosphorus ratios of two Australian strains of Cylindrospermopsis raciborskiis	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												The toxic cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii can form large blooms in freshwater systems, causing water quality problems. The availability of the essential macronutrient phosphorus (P), has a big impact on bloom formation but the variation in physiological response of different strains of C. raciborskii to available P has not previously been examined. This study investigated the carbon:phosphorus (C:P) ratio of two toxic Australian strains of C. raciborskii, AWT205 and NPD, under a range of P concentrations in batch and continuous cultures. P was added as a single dose to batch cultures and in continuous cultures at P concentrations of 0.032, 0.16, 0.64 and 16 mol P l(-1). Cellular carbon and phosphorus content of both strains increased under P-limited conditions (0 mol P l(-1) addition) with zero growth. Strain NPD had a lower C:P ratio (34:1) than AWT205 (150:1) indicating higher P storage capacity, and strain NPD survived P-limited conditions for longer. There was no significant difference in exponential growth rates (0.2 d(-1), P 0.5) under all P concentrations for both strains, with the exception of no P, demonstrating non-P-limited growth even at the lowest concentration (0.032 mu mol P l(-1)) and no increase in growth rate with additional P. P-33 uptake measurements were used to show that these strains both have very low half saturation constants (K-s = 0.02 mol P l(-1)) compared with other phytoplankton and strains of C. raciborskii. This is indicative of high uptake affinities and suggests that these strains are highly adapted to a low P supply. Overall the results of this study are consistent with the P strategy of storage prioritization over growth rate, and demonstrate differences between the strains in the C:P ratio under P-limitation, indicating variation in P storage.

Using historical data we also estimated the internal phosphorus load (IPL) between 1972 and 2015. EPL reached its maximum in the mid-1980s with phosphorus (P) values similar to 21 t yr(-1) compared to the current value close to 6 t yr(-1). IPL was one order of magnitude less and ranged between 0.25 t yr(-)1 (2015) and 3.6 (1985) t yr(-1). The strong reduction of the P load determined a marked decrease of both P (from 200 to 23 mu g L-1) and chlorophyll a (from 18 to 8 mu g L-1) in-lake concentrations. The process of eutrophication and subsequent recovery, however, showed hysteresis between P load and in-lake P concentrations. In recent years, in particular, the P concentrations at winter overturn seem to be independent from the P load, related to modifications in the hydrological management of the lake that favored P flushout in October-November, when the EPL is maximal. This process led to a marked decrease of the total P concentrations at winter overturn (23 mu g L-1), which recently resulted in lower-than-target concentrations (30 mu g L-1) established by the Lombardy Region. The lake, nevertheless, suffers from the presence of the toxic cyanobacterium Planktothrix rubescens, and eradicating this species and further improving water quality will likely require an additional abatement of the EPL.																	2044-2041	2044-205X					2017	7	1					100	108		10.1080/20442041.2017.1294354								WOS:000405859800011

In the present study, 5 experimental polyculture systems combining abalone and sea cucumber (SC) as different inter-species biomass ratios, i.e. 100: 0, 70: 30, 50: 50, 30: 70 and 0: 100 (referred to as Group A, B, C, D and E, respectively), were set up to evaluate the potential of sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus as scavengers to alleviate the farming wastes derived from the co-culture of abalone Haliotis discus hannai. Growth performance and significant isotopic shifts of the SCs in Groups B, C and D demonstrated the uptake of farming wastes, i.e. feces and uneaten feed residues. The proportional contributions of SC assimilated from uneaten feed residues, feces and sea mud were 21.7, 62.5 and 15.8% in Group B, 18.5, 54.3 and 27.2% in Group C, 11.5, 44.4 and 44.1% in Group D, respectively. The results revealed that sea cucumber had great potential to become an effective organic extractive species and aid in the concordant reduction of farming wastes in polyculture systems. The biomass ratio of abalone to sea cucumber 70: 30 was recommended for aquaculture practice as providing the greatest economic and environmental benefits.																	1869-215X	1869-7534					2017	9						223	230		10.3354/aei00226								WOS:000405734400002

The fauna of this river includes an invertebrate fauna composed of both endemic and widespread species, which has, however, been only poorly studied until now. The aim of the present study was to make a review of the ecological role of the benthic inland water crustaceans of the River Cautin, in order to understand their importance in the ecosystem of the river. The literature revealed the presence of abundant populations of amphipods and freshwater crabs as well as of aquatic insects along the river's course. Many of these crustaceans are prey for both introduced salmonids and native fishes. Similar results have been reported for other southern Argentinean and Chilean Patagonian rivers.

In their original status, many of these ecosystems have native vegetation in their surrounding drainage basins, but in the last decades the native vegetation was replaced by agricultural, urban, and industrial zones, with as a result of these human alterations that those aquatic communities changed. The aim of the present study was to make a literature review about the ecological role of crustaceans in Chilean north Patagonian lakes and rivers. The literature mentioned the presence of amphipods (Hyalella), crayfishes (Samastacus spinifrons), and freshwater crabs (genus Aegla), and many of these species hold a conservation risk due to the consequences of habitat damage and/or their high endemism. These crustaceans are important for the degradation of particulate organic matter originating from the surrounding vegetation, and are prey for native and introduced salmonid fishes.

Recent advances derived largely from monitoring lakes treated with aluminum or lanthanum over an extended time have shed light on important factors in dose determination, binding efficiency, application processes, benefits of treatment, and duration of benefits. Advances are embodied in 10 articles in this issue of Lake and Reservoir Management that, along with important literature from the last 2 decades cited in those papers, documents improvement in our knowledge and application of P inactivation as a tool in lake management.																	1040-2381	2151-5530					2017	33	2			SI		103	107		10.1080/10402381.2017.1316064								WOS:000403102200001

Effectiveness of alum in a hypereutrophic lake with substantial external loading	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Brattebo SK, Welch EB, Gibbons HL, Burghdoff MK, Williams GN, Oden JL. 2017. Effectiveness of alum in a hypereutrophic lake with substantial external loading. Lake Reserv Manage. 33:108-118.Water quality conditions in hypereutrophic Lake Ketchum improved to mesotrophic conditions after alum treatments in 2014 and 2015. From 2013 pre-treatment conditions, summer mean epilimnetic total phosphorus (TP) declined from 289 to 34 mu g/L in 2014 and then to 15 mu g/L in 2015 (a total reduction of 95%). Hypolimnetic TP declined 99% overall, and chlorophyll a dropped 70% while there was 135% improvement in transparency over the 2years. Toxic cyanobacteria blooms, a chronic problem in the lake, disappeared in 2015. Maintenance treatment in 2016 continued water quality improvements. The primary driver of water quality changes was a decrease in internal P loading from a mean rate of 25mg/m(2) per day to zero (negative rate) after the alum treatments. The improvements occurred despite application problems with the 2014 treatment, which had to be halted with only 66% of the planned dose (aluminum: 28mg/L or 83.7g/m(2)) applied. The remaining 34% of the original alum dose plus an annual maintenance water column dose and an additional 15% was applied in March 2015. The water quality improvements were achieved even with continuation of a highly enriched (TP: >450 mu g/L) external input from a legacy agricultural source. The changes were consistent with or exceeded predictions of a 2-layer, seasonal mass balance TP model used to evaluate restoration alternatives. These results show that alum treatments can eliminate high internal loading and, when coupled with annual maintenance treatments, provide sustained water quality improvements despite continued external loading.																	1040-2381	2151-5530					2017	33	2			SI		108	118		10.1080/10402381.2017.1311390								WOS:000403102200002

Nine years of phosphorus management with lanthanum modified bentonite (Phoslock) in a eutrophic, shallow swimming lake in Germany. Lake Reserve Manage. 33:119-129.Eutrophication is threatening shallow lakes, their functioning and ecosystem services. In recent years, lanthanum modified bentonite (LMB) has been increasingly applied to eutrophic lakes to enforce recovery processes by increasing sediment phosphorus (P)-sorption capacity and reducing P in the water column. In this long-term study, we examined the water quality characteristics of a polymictic, eutrophic swimming lake in central Germany, Lake Barensee, an artificial, excavated lake suffering from frequent cyanobacterial blooms caused by nutrient enrichment, mostly from swimmers, runoff, and P release from the sediments. Barensee was first treated with LMB in 2007. This restoration method is based on the strong ionic bond formed between lanthanum (La) and phosphate (PO4), which results in the formation of rhabdophane (LaPO(4)nH(2)O) in the sediment. Smaller reapplications of LMB were conducted in 2010 and 2013 when P concentrations exceeded a defined level as a result of frequent nutrient inputs, primarily by swimmers. The intensity of mineralization processes decreased, preventing large algal and cyanobacterial blooms. Post-treatment chlorophyll a, total nitrogen, and ammonium concentrations indicate that the productivity of the lake has been limited by recurrent small treatments with LMB. Because of this P management, the lake could be used continuously for swimming and recreation.																	1040-2381	2151-5530					2017	33	2			SI		119	129		10.1080/10402381.2016.1263693								WOS:000403102200003						
J	Huser, BJ				Huser, Brian J.			Aluminum application to restore water quality in eutrophic lakes: maximizing binding efficiency between aluminum and phosphorus	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Huser BJ. 2017. Aluminum application to restore water quality in eutrophic lakes: maximizing binding efficiency between aluminum and phosphorus. Lake Reserv Manage. 33:143-151.Aluminum (Al), typically added to lakes to reduce internal cycling of legacy phosphorus (P) in sediment, was added to the littoral zone of Lake Harriet (Minnesota) to inhibit the uptake of sediment P by buoyancy regulating species of plankton. Analytical results from sediment collected over an 11-year period showed that the added Al (32 g/m(2)) started to move outside the treatment zone almost immediately after treatment, with <5% remaining within the treatment area after 6 months. Although the original treatment design failed, the application method was, unexpectedly, a success with respect to binding efficiency between Al and P in the sediment. As the Al drifted to deeper areas of the lake, internal P release in non-treated, deeper areas of the lake declined and the binding ratio between Al and Al-bound P decreased, reaching 2.1 (molar) in profundal sediments 10years after treatment. The increased contact with available (mobile) sediment P increased binding efficiency, resulting in a 163-581% increase of P bound per unit Al compared to previous whole-lake aluminum treatments. The binding efficiency exceeded expectations showing that, in addition to the amount of Al added, treatment location and subsequent translocation of the Al floc can substantially affect binding efficiency and treatment effectiveness.

A newly developed injection method for aluminum treatment in eutrophic lakes: Effects on water quality and phosphorus binding efficiency	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Schutz J, Rydin E, Huser BJ. 2017. A newly developed injection method for aluminum treatment in eutrophic lakes: Effects on water quality and phosphorus binding efficiency. Lake Reserv Manage. 33:152-162.Application of aluminum (Al) salts has been used to reduce phosphorus (P) concentrations in lakes since the 1960s. Al is typically applied to the water column where Al-hydroxides form, settle to the sediment surface, and bind P in sediment. Al can be transported to other, non-target areas of the lake, however, potentially limiting treatment effectiveness. To alleviate this problem, a new method has been developed in which the Al salt is injected directly into the sediment as a liquid. In this study, the binding efficiency and application costs were calculated for 2 lakes in Sweden that received injection applications of polyaluminum chloride (PAC). Binding efficiency was similar to previous water column applications, implying there is little difference between the 2 application methods. Other factors, however, such as dissolved organic matter and type of Al salt used (PAC vs. Al sulfate), can also affect binding efficiency. Thus, Al injection may have improved the amount of P bound per unit Al in the study lakes given the in-lake conditions and Al salt used. Treatment cost (cost per kilogram of P bound to Al) for the injection method compared to previous water column treatments was somewhat higher due to increased costs for buffered PAC and time needed for application. Both mobile sediment P and internal loading remained reduced compared to pre-treatment conditions, showing that the Al injection treatments continued to control sediment P release. More study is needed, however, to determine the relative effectiveness of this method in different types of lakes.

Attempted management of cyanobacteria by Phoslock (lanthanum-modified clay) in Canadian lakes: water quality results and predictions	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Nurnberg GK. 2017. Attempted management of cyanobacteria by Phoslock (lanthanum-modified clay) in Canadian lakes: water quality results and predictions. Lake Reserv Manage. 33:163-170.When internal phosphorus (P) loading from the bottom sediments outweighs external P inputs to lakes, lake water quality and cyanobacteria blooms will not respond to external measures alone and therefore require an in-lake restoration treatment. Lake characteristics and governmental regulations do not permit a random choice of such methods. A treatment developed by an Australian research institute (CSIRO) more than 15years ago has recently been introduced to Canada and is licensed in Ontario. The lake water treatment consists of the application of a phosphate adsorbing and sediment capping agent called Phoslock in North America, a clay (bentonite) that has been systematically amended by the phosphate adsorbing element lanthanum. When applied, Phoslock sinks to the lake bottom where it intercepts the upward flux of internal load from sediment P release. Although the number of monitored Canadian applications is still small, suggestions to optimize restoration effects can be made, including the avoidance of high flushing during application, system isolation, and timing to coincide with high levels of inorganic P in the lake water. Initial results in at least 2 cases (Swan Lake, City of Markham, Greater Toronto Area; and Henderson Lake, Lethbridge, Alberta) were promising despite the unexpected external P input from waterfowl and possibly other external sources. Other applications are planned in a Quebec lake and are being discussed in several other provinces.

Aluminum treatments to control internal phosphorus loading in lakes on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Lake Reserv Manage. 33:171-186.Ten lakes on Cape Cod, Massachusetts have been treated with aluminum since 1995, with 2 of those lakes receiving a second treatment. Elimination of cyanobacterial blooms was the goal in each case. Cape Cod lakes are mostly kettleholes with long detention times. Precipitation and groundwater dominated hydrologic inputs, but internal load contributed a major portion of the total phosphorus (TP) load to treated lakes. Aluminum sulfate and sodium aluminate were used in treatments with the intent to maintain a near-neutral pH in low alkalinity waters. Aluminum doses ranged from 10 to 100 g/m(2), depending on mobile P concentrations in the upper 10cm of sediment. Results varied, although all treatments lowered TP, provided relief from blooms, increased water clarity, and reduced oxygen demand for multiple years. Important lessons learned over 2 decades include how to apply aluminum to prevent fish mortality, options for dose calculation, and expectations for duration of benefits. To control internal loading and minimize cyanobacterial blooms at the lowest cost, treatment of Cape Cod lakes should apply aluminum at a concentration at least 10times the mobile P concentration in the upper 10cm of sediment exposed to anoxia and at concentrations that leave no more than 100 mg/kg of iron-bound P in laboratory inactivation assays. Cost of treatment in 2016 dollars averaged $150/g/m(2) of applied aluminum per ha treated. Aluminum treatment has been demonstrated as a valued lake management tool to improve water quality and reduce nuisance algal blooms in Cape Cod lakes.																	1040-2381	2151-5530					2017	33	2			SI		171	186		10.1080/10402381.2017.1308449								WOS:000403102200008

Distribution of aluminum and phosphorus fractions following alum treatments in a large shallow lake. Lake Reserve Manage. 33:198-204.Alum was added to the middle 40% of 5200ha Grand Lake St. Marys (mean depth 1.6m) in western Ohio during 2 successive years. About <8% to 2% of the added aluminum (Al) remained in the water column immediately after treatment, and aluminum-phosphorus (Al-P) was effectively formed in the targeted treated sediment. Sediment Al and Al-P were significantly higher inside than outside the treated area with an Al-added to Al-P-formed ratio of 51, double the initial effectiveness expected (102) from the 2year Al dose of 95g/m(2). Sediment total P was also higher inside than outside the treatment area. The source of P that formed Al-P was more likely undetermined soluble reactive P diffused from deeper sediment and to a lesser extent external P loading. Mobile iron-P (Fe-P), usually the principal mobile fraction, was relatively low with no noticeable depletion (inside-outside), and loosely sorbed P was undetectable. Biogenic P (living algae and detritus) was also relatively low and showed no noticeable depletion. Some of the greater variability in sediment Al outside than inside the treated area may have been caused by resuspension and redistribution of the alum floc. Two of the 3 outside sites on the lee side of the treated area had higher sediment Al, whereas 2 of 3 outside sites on the windward side had lower Al. Nevertheless, the alum floc remained largely in the treated area for at least 3months to >1year, forming sediment Al-P.																	1040-2381	2151-5530					2017	33	2			SI		198	204		10.1080/10402381.2016.1276653								WOS:000403102200010

Acute toxicity of copper, lead, zinc and their mixtures on the sea urchin Evechinus chloroticus	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Coastal pollution is complex, often consisting of multiple contaminants, and it is increasingly recognised that exposure to combinations of pollutants can produce different outcomes than each does separately. This study investigates the toxicity of three major pollutants in coastal environments (copper, lead and zinc) individually and in binary mixtures on larvae of Evechinus chloroticus, a sea urchin endemic to New Zealand. Larval development assays were conducted for 72 h. Median effective concentrations (EC50) for normal larval development for individual metals were 5.4 mu g/L Cu, 52.2 mu g/L Pb and 27.7 mu g/L Zn. Evechinus chloroticus was more sensitive to copper and zinc than most echinoid species tested to date. Effects of metal mixtures were analysed using a toxic unit (TU) approach. Cu + Zn and Cu + Pb had a less-than-additive effect on E. chloroticus larval development. By contrast, Zn + Pb was strictly additive. None of the interactions were strong, with sums of TU ranging from 1.00 to 1.85. These results support the use of criteria based on strictly-additive models to determine whether these three metals exceed water quality thresholds when occurring in a simple mixture.

J	Boys, CA; Pease, B				Boys, Craig A.; Pease, Bruce			Opening the floodgates to the recovery of nektonic assemblages in a temperate coastal wetland	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Tidally active wetlands are important nurseries for fish and crustaceans; however, urban development involving structural flood mitigation has fragmented and destroyed much of this habitat, often leading to losses in fisheries productivity. The present study demonstrated that some of these impacts may be reversible if rehabilitation projects are implemented over a sufficiently long time. The incremental opening of eight floodgates at a temperate coastal wetland in Australia afforded the opportunity to monitor water quality and nekton assemblages in a tidal creek over 11 years, encompassing pre-floodgate opening, opening of one gate, three gates and finally all eight gates. Floodgate opening enhanced both water quality and nektonic assemblages relative to a control creek whose barrier remained in place. A doubling in species richness occurred and many commercially important species increased in abundance, including Metapenaeus macleayi (15 times more), Acanthopagrus australis (62 times more), Liza argentea (10 times more) and Gerres subfasciatus (19 times more). Recovery to a condition similar to unrestricted reference creeks was achieved once all eight gates were opened. The study illustrated that reinstating tidal flushing can recover nursery habitats and enhance populations of economically valuable species.																	1323-1650	1448-6059					2017	68	6					1023	1035		10.1071/MF15445								WOS:000402414700003

Diatom community composition and specific descriptors, including quantification of morphological alterations and mortality, were used to diagnose environmental stress. High abundances of Achnanthidium minutissimum (Kutzing) Czarnecki were observed at the Fe-rich site, which could reflect a response to metal contamination. Diatoms were stressed mostly by the influence of temperature and salinity, which drove species composition and increased mortality.

In contrast, agricultural sampling points were more turbid, and had a greater content of nitrates than urban sampling points. The phytoplankton community was dominated by Cyanobacteria, mainly Microcystis aeruginosa, with densities of up to 20 times higher at urban than at agricultural sampling points. There was an increasing dominance of Cyanobacteria (M. aerugionosa and Merismopedia glauca) and Chlorophyta (Eudorina elegans, Spirogyra sp. and Pediastrum duplex) and a decreasing importance of Bacillariophyta along the agriculture-to-urban gradient. Given the increasing scarcity of water in southern Africa, not only do our findings confirm the importance of land use types as drivers of water quality and phytoplankton community composition and structure. However, they also show that Cyanobacteria, Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta can be indicators of changes in water quality, factors that will prove pertinent to management for effective water quality management using phytoplankton composition as bioindicators.

Multiple Stressors and the Functioning of Coral Reefs	ANNUAL REVIEW OF MARINE SCIENCE, VOL 9	Annual Review of Marine Science											Coral reefs provide critical services to coastal communities, and these services rely on ecosystem functions threatened by stressors. By summarizing the threats to the functioning of reefs from fishing, climate change, and decreasing water quality, we highlight that these stressors have multiple, conflicting effects on functionally similar groups of species and their interactions, and that the overall effects are often uncertain because of a lack of data or variability among taxa. The direct effects of stressors on links among functional groups, such as predator-prey interactions, are particularly uncertain. Using qualitative modeling, we demonstrate that this uncertainty of stressor impacts on functional groups (whether they are positive, negative, or neutral) can have significant effects on models of ecosystem stability, and reducing uncertainty is vital for understanding changes to reef functioning. This review also provides guidance for future models of reef functioning, which should include interactions among functional groups and the cumulative effect of stressors.

Employing indicators for prioritization of fish assemblage with a view to manage freshwater fish diversity and ecosystem health in the tributaries of Ganges basin, India	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												The major tributaries of the river Ganges basin are currently threatened by various anthropogenic activities which are hampering the ecosystem stability and fish biodiversity of the basin. Multiple indicators were used to prioritize the fish assemblages in the tributaries and to develop an index that is responsive to human-induced environmental changes. A high percentage of invasive species was described with the orgin index at the most disturbed sites of rivers Gomti and Betwa which also represented a substantial amount of biological disturbance. The Fisheries Assessment Integrity Index based on ecological integrity of different segments of the rivers was used to prioritize different sampling sites of the tributaries. Some of the sampling sites in Gomti and Betwa rivers are reflecting disturbed fish assemblages, a very low Fisheries Assessment Integrity Index score, few threatened species, and a high proportion of invasive species. Principal components analysis of the sampling sites, along with fish assemblage, reflected the influence of the habitat parameters on structuring the assemblage pattern. This study identified depth, flow, water quality and land uses in shaping fish assemblages. The combination of various indices in this study should provide more accurate measures in identifying sites of high conservation value.																	1463-4988	1539-4077				JAN-JUN	2017	20	1-2			SI		21	29		10.1080/14634988.2017.1270146								WOS:000400410800004

Studies on ecology, fish diversity and fisheries of Ken-Betwa rivers (India): Proposed for inter-linking	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												The Ken and Betwa rivers traversing through Central India are the major tributaries of the river Yamuna. Both rivers originate above 550m above sea level in the Vindhya region. An interlinking project proposed for the rivers envisages diversion of water from Ken basin to the Betwa. The river sediment is alkaline and dominated by sand (78-89%) in both rivers. Oxygen-rich alkaline water and moderate values of chemical parameters show the pollution free and productive nature of both the rivers. There was no statistically significant difference in water quality between the Ken and Betwa rivers, except for total alkalinity. The biotic parameters were observed in similar ranges and moderate condition. A total of 61 planktonic forms were recorded from the rivers out of which 55 were phytoplankton. For the first time, 89 fish species belonging to 10 orders, 26 families, and 62 genera have been recorded in the river Ken, while 81 species classified under 10 orders, 24 families, and 55 genera were found in the Betwa. Exotic fish species were also observed in the downstream stretches of both rivers. Out of the total fish species, 77 were common to both rivers, 12 were found only in the Ken River, and 4 species were restricted to the Betwa. Analysis of relative abundance showed dominance of Labeo boggut in the Ken and Osteobrama cotio in the Betwa River. On comparison of the Shannon-Wiener Diversity and Evenness Indices of fish diversity, these indicated slightly higher values in the Ken (3.76 and 0.842) than the Betwa (3.66 and 0.835). A total of nine near-threatened fish species was recorded in the rivers. Both rivers have already been obstructed by many developmental projects; the proposed interlinking would further negatively impact the ecology and fisheries.																	1463-4988	1539-4077				JAN-JUN	2017	20	1-2			SI		71	85		10.1080/14634988.2017.1261576								WOS:000400410800008

Fish habitat and fisheries of Brahmaputra River in Assam, India	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												River Brahmaputra is a trans-boundary major river flowing through the northeastern state of Assam, India and is the lifeline of its natural fisheries. In the present article, we discuss eco-hydrobiology (including sediment quality and energy flow) of River Brahmaputra and its important tributaries in the state of Assam, India based on extensive synoptic studies conducted from April 1996 to March 1998, duly collated with past and present studies. Salient aspects of fisheries of the river system in the state (ichthyofauna, biogeography, conservation status, migratory and exotic fish species, trends in fish yield and species composition, fishing crafts and gear) are discussed in light of past and present studies conducted by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research-Central Indian Fisheries Research Institute and others. Fisheries of floodplain wetlands (beels) located in the Brahmaputra valley in the state and their interaction with the river system are also discussed.																	1463-4988	1539-4077				JAN-JUN	2017	20	1-2			SI		102	115		10.1080/14634988.2017.1297171								WOS:000400410800010

AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												The Damodar and Subarnarekha Rivers are the first and second largest running waters of Jharkhand, having variable river bed morphology with naturally hard substrates. The riverine biodiversity is outstanding, as it includes endemic taxa on species and subspecies levels. Aquatic habitats are mostly colonized by native species. Macrozoobenthic animals are important bioindicators of the habitat quality of the river and are used for rapid assessment of river quality globally. In order to have preliminary information on the biodiversity of macrobenthos, the first survey was undertaken to find the impact of domestic pollution, mining, and thermal power plants on the aquatic life of the Damodar in May 2004. On the basis of our observations and species records, systematic field sampling for macro-benthic invertebrates in the Damodar and Subarnarekha Rivers was conducted from 2007 to 2012 during different hydrological conditions to cover the seasonal variation. Synoptic sampling was done to allow comparison between the two rivers. Aquatic invertebrate fauna has been inventoried with 124 identified taxa. The highest proportion of functional feeding groups recorded were detritivores, followed by carnivores and herbivores, respectively. This present study demonstrates the seasonal disappearance of macrozoobenthic invertebrates caused by urban and industrial pollution and that the fauna of the two main rivers of Jharkhand are similar in species inventory. This reflects the ecological conditions of the shared ecoregion known as Chota Nagpur Dry Forests. The results of the present research provide an essential database to evaluate the future environmental impact of restoration and changes in water quality.																	1463-4988	1539-4077				JAN-JUN	2017	20	1-2			SI		116	129		10.1080/14634988.2017.1300041								WOS:000400410800011

Effect of river connectivity on hydrochemistry, sediment enzyme activity and biotic communities of wetlands	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Wetlands associated with floodplains of the Ganges and Brahmaputra river systems cover an estimated 0.2million ha and play a vital role in the fisheries, rural economy and environment. In recent years, most wetlands in the states of Bihar, Assam and West Bengal in India have lost connectivity with their parent rivers due to natural and anthropogenic changes. These changes are causing rapid shrinkage of valuable wetlands and threatening their biodiversity and ecological function. The present study was conducted to assess the effect of river connectivity on the hydrochemistry, sediment enzyme activity, and biotic communities of these wetlands. One wetland area having link channels (open) connecting the main river, and another without link channels (closed), were selected from each of the Ganges and Brahmaputra basins for the study. Comparative analysis of open and closed, ecologically distinct wetlands of the Ganges basin revealed greater seasonal reduction in water depth and higher water conductivity (p < 0.04), nutrients (Ca+2, Mg+2, SiO3-Si), sediment microbial activity (p < 0.004), phosphorous cycling enzymes (p < 0.001), carbon cycling enzymes (p < 0.01), organic matter, conductivity, and plankton and macrozoobenthos (p < 0.01) density in the closed wetland. However, the open wetland showed higher diversity of plankton and macrozoobenthos. A profound impact of connectivity on wetland fisheries was observed in the Brahmaputra basin in Assam, where a higher percentage of catch comprised of indigenous fish species with lower fish yield was noted in the open wetland.																	1463-4988	1539-4077				JAN-JUN	2017	20	1-2			SI		140	150		10.1080/14634988.2017.1301095								WOS:000400410800013

A case study of the Narmada River system in India with particular reference to the impact of dams on its ecology and fisheries	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Narmada, the oldest river system in India, originates from Amarkantak in Madhya Pradesh, flows east-west, and joins with the Gulf of Cambay on the Arabian Sea. The river drains 45.64km(3) of annual run-off and a series of dams was proposed to hold some of its water resources for multipurpose use. Currently, three dams have been built in Madhya Pradesh and one is under construction in Gujarat. A comparison of pre- and post-impoundment eco-environment and fisheries revealed changes in water quality, productivity, and aquatic flora and fauna of the river system. Among the fish, species like Tor tor, Labeo fimbriatus and Labeo dyocheilus suffered most. The percentage contributions to total yield of Carp, Catfish, and miscellaneous groups have significantly changed, indicating falls of 17%, 36% and an increase of 410%, respectively. Percentage contributions to catches of Macrobrachium rosenbergii and Tenualosa ilisha have also declined by 46% and about 75% in the estuarine stretch of the river system. Suitable conservation measures for sustenance and development of fishery have been suggested.																	1463-4988	1539-4077				JAN-JUN	2017	20	1-2			SI		151	159		10.1080/14634988.2017.1288529								WOS:000400410800014

Status of the River Krishna: Water quality and riverine environment in relation to fisheries	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												The River Krishna, the second largest peninsular river of India, was investigated during pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon seasons to improve the understanding of its ecology through analysis of physical and chemical parameters of water and sediment. Important tributaries of the river were also studied simultaneously to understand their influence on the main stream of the River Krishna. In addition to 25 sampling sites along the main stream of the River Krishna, sampling was also done in 13 important tributaries at sites upstream of the confluence point. Dams, barrages and anicuts have visible impacts on all of the observed physical and chemical properties of water and soil. Statistical analysis revealed that water parameters have a strong association with sediment parameters. However, the study was unable to find any relation between primary production and water quality parameters. Fish species distribution was strongly influenced by temperature and water depth, as well as specific conductivity, as observed through Canonical Correspondence Analysis.																	1463-4988	1539-4077				JAN-JUN	2017	20	1-2			SI		160	174		10.1080/14634988.2017.1296312								WOS:000400410800015

Estuarine characteristics, water quality and heavy metal contamination as determinants of fish species composition in intermittently open estuaries	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Estuaries are critical aquatic environments that are used by many fish during their life cycle. However, estuaries often suffer from poor water quality as a result of anthropogenic activities. Fish diversity studies in estuaries are common, although few have examined whether correlations exist between water quality, metal contamination and fish assemblages. In the present study we investigated the effect of abiotic conditions, heavy metals and estuary characteristics on the abundance, diversity and composition of fish in four intermittently open estuaries along the Illawarra coast of south-eastern Australia. The heterogeneity of environmental conditions was reflected in the fish assemblages in each estuary. Environmental variables predicted fish species composition, and estuaries in particularly poor condition contained few species (estuarine residents) in high abundance, indicating their ability to acclimatise and survive in conditions that are hostile to other species. Overall, these findings demonstrate that estuarine fish assemblages may be useful indicators of estuary condition and reveal the importance of managing anthropogenic activities in the surrounding catchment to improve water quality so that biodiversity of fish can be restored in these estuarine environments.																	1323-1650	1448-6059					2017	68	5					941	953		10.1071/MF15409								WOS:000400184800014

The area around the lake was impacted by a large wildland fire in 2013 that occurred during a protracted drought. As the mortality event was still unfolding, we collected data in 2014 on water quality, demographic structure, and short-term survivorship of the population. Water quality was poor with low levels of dissolved oxygen and high salinity of up to 45.90 ppt. Many turtles were severely emaciated and coated with a pale mineralized layer on their shells and skin. Estimated survival rate was low leading to a projected 90% decline in 134 days and a high probability of extirpation within a year. The lake was dry in September 2015 with no evidence of live turtles. Necropsies and low volumetric body condition indices suggested death by starvation. Although this semi-aquatic species has the ability to aestivate in upland habitats during periods of low water or move to other nearby water bodies, it is unlikely that many were able to do so because of their extremely poor condition and the severity of the drought conditions throughout the area.																	1961-9502						2017		418							18	10.1051/kmae/2017008								WOS:000399051100018

The imperative need for nationally coordinated bioassessment of rivers and streams	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Declining water quality and ecological condition is a typical trend for rivers and streams worldwide as human demands for water resources increase. Managing these natural resources sustainably is a key responsibility of governments. Effective water management policies require information derived from long-term monitoring and evaluation. Biological monitoring and assessment are critical for management because bioassessment integrates the biological, physical and chemical features of a waterbody. Investment in nationally coordinated riverine bioassessment in Australia has almost ceased and the foci of management questions are on more localised assessments. However, rivers often span political and administrative boundaries, and their condition may be best protected and managed under national policies, supported by a coordinated national bioassessment framework. We argue that a nationally coordinated program for the bioassessment of riverine health is an essential element of sustainable management of a nation's water resources. We outline new techniques and research needed to streamline current arrangements to meet present-day and emerging challenges for coordinating and integrating local, regional and national bioassessment activities. This paper draws on international experience in riverine bioassessment to identify attributes of successful broad-scale bioassessment programs and strategies needed to modernise freshwater bioassessment in Australia and re-establish national broad-scale focus.

Mitigating the effects of barriers to freshwater fish migrations: the Australian experience	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Declining fish communities characterise global freshwater environments, including those in Australia. Lost river connectivity through water resource development is a key cause of decline, disrupting fish migrations and threatening species productivity, viability and fisheries. Millions of dams, weirs and lesser barriers arising from water resources projects, road and rail transport and hydro-electricity schemes obstruct fish passage in rivers worldwide. Fishways are in place at few sites in Australia and globally relative to the numbers of barriers, and few mitigate the effects of barriers adequately. Most constrain the passage of fish communities and few have performed effectively when assessed against appropriate biological standards. Herein we focus on Australian experience within the global context of obstructed fish migrations, declining fish biodiversity and inadequate fishway performance. We review the migratory characteristics of Australian freshwater fish, identify the effects of different in-stream barriers and other habitat changes on the four classes of migratory behaviour and note how Australia's highly variable hydrology presents particular challenges in mitigating fish passage barriers. Mitigation options include: basin-scale approaches; improved management of barriers, environmental flows and water quality; barrier removal; and development of improved fishway designs. Mitigation of fish-passage problems can aid in adapting to climate change effects, reversing fisheries declines and rehabilitating fish communities.																	1323-1650	1448-6059					2017	68	4					614	628		10.1071/MF15284								WOS:000398531000002

It formed a dense bloom (from 16x10(6) to 81x10(6) trichomes L-1), causing a brown colouration of the lake water. When A. favaloroi formed 100% of the total phytoplankton biomass (44 mg L-1), saxitoxins (saxitoxin and neo-saxitoxin) were detected in the lake seston (42 and 17 mu g g(-1) phytoplankton dry weight respectively), which was screened for saxitoxins, cylindrospermopsin, anatoxin-a, microcystins and nodularin. A massive fish kill coincided with the A. favaloroi bloom. This new saxitoxin-producing species of cyanobacteria, with traits for successful dispersal, may pose a health risk to animals and humans and cause adverse effects on water quality and water services because of its expansion potential.

Characterisation of water quality in effluents of land-based abalone farms in the Western Cape, South Africa	AQUACULTURE ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS												Effluent water quality was measured at 9 abalone (Haliotis midae) farms in 2 regional nodes (west and south) along the South African coastline. For most farms, effluent total suspended solids (TSS) exceeded the background reference level (80th percentile), and 3 did not comply with the 5 mg l(-1) standard. Total ammonia nitrogen (NH4+) concentrations were mostly greater than reference levels but well below the 43 mu mol N l(-1) standard. Inflow-corrected concentrations of nitrate, nitrite and phosphate were low compared to NH4 (+) and would not pose a significant eutrophication risk. Similarly, the biochemical oxygen demand measured at 3 of the farms was low (median 1.31 mg l(-1)). Abalone production-specific annual loads of TSS (334 kg per metric tonne [mt]), total N (20.3-38.1 kg N mt(-1)) and total P (3.2-7.5 kg P mt(-1)) agree with what has been found for different land-based aquaculture operations. These figures translate to N-based human population equivalents of 5.4-10.6 persons mt(-1) for both regions. At the broader ecosystem level, the annual TSS loads calculated from 2013 production data of 43 mt yr(-1) (west) and 369 mt yr(-1) (south) are, respectively, 0.35 and 2.8% of that estimated for kelp erosion. Similarly, the dissolved inorganic N loads of 1.9 mt N yr(-1) (west) and 9.4 mt yr(-1) (south) are trivial by comparison with nitrate advected during upwelling. Local abalone farms have a relatively high specific C footprint-conservatively similar to 44 kg CO2 kg(-1) production. Our findings support a relatively low potential impact of farm effluents in this coastal upwelling environment.																	1869-215X	1869-7534					2017	9						87	102		10.3354/aei00217								WOS:000397953200001

This study tested the potential of submerged leaf litter of Rhizophora mucronata and associated biofilm in providing a favorable environment for postlarval shrimp Penaeus monodon. Litter decomposition and assembly of microalgae and epifauna were assessed under exposure to sunlight or shade, and presence or absence of sediment. Litter incubated with sediment and exposed to sunlight was rapidly decomposed and supported the highest biomass and diversity of microalgae and epifauna. The litter also supported the highest abundance of diatoms, polychaetes and nematodes during the 4th week of decomposition. Cyanobacteria of the genus Microcystis dominated litter incubated without sediment, in sunlight, after decom position for 5 wk. Under shaded conditions, diatoms of the genus Navicula and the Cyanobacteria Anabaena spp. and Oscillatoria spp. continued to grow at high total ammonium nitrogen, low dissolved oxygen, low temperature and low pH. Our study illustrates synergy between sediment and direct sunlight in promoting diversity of microalgae and polychaetes (of dietary benefit to shrimps), inhibiting growth of Cyanobacteria and maintaining water quality at levels favorable to culture of post- larval shrimp. Our findings support 4 practices for a healthy environment in fish ponds: (1) locating ecological shrimp culture in less forested areas, (2) promoting sediment conditions in artificial shrimp culture systems, (3) exposing litterderived bio film within ponds to sunlight and incubating with sediment to maintain favorable water quality and control Cyanobacteria blooms, and (4) minimizing the use of pond liners and related sludge removal.

To date, little is known about how biofilm forms in drippers of irrigation systems. In this study, the internal dripper geometry was recreated in 3-D printed microfluidic devices (MFDs). To mimic the temperature conditions in (semi-) arid areas, experiments were conducted in a temperature controlled box between 20 and 50 degrees C. MFDs were either fed with two different treated wastewater (TWW) or synthetic wastewater. Biofilm formation was monitored non-invasively and in situ by optical coherence tomography (OCT). 3-D OCT datasets reveal the major fouling position and illustrate that biofilm development was influenced by fluid dynamics. Biofilm volumetric coverage of the labyrinth up to 60% did not reduce the discharge rate, whereas a further increase to 80% reduced the discharge rate by 50%. Moreover, the biofilm formation rate was significantly inhibited in daily temperature cycle independent of the cultivation medium used.																	0892-7014	1029-2454					2017	33	3					211	221		10.1080/08927014.2017.1285017								WOS:000395648600001	28270050

Forty drainage ditches in the TGR from multiple land use types were extensively investigated for 10 parameters of water quality. The results showed that the concentrations of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) in the TGR drainage ditches were generally far higher than the internationally recognized eutrophication threshold. Based on this study, both ditch water and sediments from residential land and roadside land had the highest concentrations of nutrients. Possible sources of these nutrients include sewage water and septic tank overflow. Forestland had significantly lower concentrations of nutrients. Residential ditches had higher values of electrical conductivity (EC) and total dissolved solid (TDS) values and lower dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations. Forestland had lower values of EC and TDS values and higher DO concentrations. The results indicate that the nutrients that have accumulated in the sediments have significant impacts on the water quality in adjacent ditches. A long-term plan must be developed to more strictly control the external loading of nutrients from surrounding land. Action plans to promote the growth of wetland plants in drainage ditches are important for increasing agrochemical retention in the TGR drainage ditches. TGR drainage ditches from residential zones must be actively managed by cleaning and sediment removal to control the risk of nutrients being released into the reservoir.

However, according to some studies on streams and small rivers, the diatom ecological guilds might be more effective tools for ecological quality assessment in the future, but their usability is not always clear. Our main goal was to compare the robustness of the IPS index and diatom ecological guilds in a large river. For this: i) a temporary study was carried out to investigate if there were some differences between how the nutrient content affected the IPS values and guild proportions in the Danube River; ii) spatial studies were conducted to investigate the effects of the different water depths (different light intensity and current velocity) on biological metrics (such as IPS and guilds); iii) we studied whether the IPS index or guild proportions were influenced more by the substrate type. As for the results of the temporal study, only the motile and planktic guilds had significant connections with phosphate phosphorus concentration. However, the high profile and the low profile taxa showed correlations neither with nutrient concentration nor water discharge. Nevertheless, the higher the abundances of the low profile guild, the lesser the values of the IPS index. In spatial studies, the guild abundances (especially the motile taxa) altered at different water depths. This could be caused by different microhabitats characterised by a disparate current velocity, and by different types of bed material along the cross-section. Contrary to guilds, there were no relevant differences in IPS values along the cross-sections. We experienced similarities in the study on shells and in the spatial study: there were significant differences between guild abundances on different shell surfaces, but not so in the IPS. On the whole, the IPS is robust enough to be a suitable index for ecological water quality assessment, and diatom ecological guilds cannot be used instead of the diatom index (IPS) in large rivers. However, the trait-based methods could be useful supplements to the ecological status assessment.																	1863-9135					JAN	2017	189	2			SI		87	103		10.1127/fal/2016/0933								WOS:000395223500002

We asked whether variability among samples is determined by sampled substrate (macrophyte species) or location (sampling site). Twenty-one samples of eleven species of vascular plants (predominantly aquatic macrophytes) and one charophyte species were collected at three sites within the fishpond during one sampling event in June 2015. Altogether, 129 diatom taxa were identified. Species richness ranged from 14 to 46 taxa per sample, with the highest richness for Elatine hydropiper and the lowest for Chara braunii. Surprisingly, the representation of typically periphytic taxa (attached to the substrate) was very low, and did not exceed 16 %. Genera typical for epiphyton were present only marginally. The exception was Gomphonema parvulum agg. On the other hand, facultatively periphytic species of the Fragilariales were dominant as well as motile raphid taxa of the Naviculales. Species assemblages at the three sampling sites differed significantly, including the subset of periphytic diatoms. Species composition at the fishpond dam was more represented by typically periphytic taxa, while the other two sites (bays of the Babicky and Dehtafslcy streams) were dominated by facultatively periphytic taxa, mainly Pseudostaurosira elliptica. These differences can be explained by the differences in environmental conditions among the sites, especially very intensive and frequent wave action typical for most parts of the Dehtaf fishpond. However, no significant differences in diatom species composition dependent on the species of sampled plant substrate were found.																	1863-9135					JAN	2017	189	2			SI		117	135		10.1127/fal/2016/0936								WOS:000395223500004						
J	Ferriol, C; Miracle, MR; Vicente, E				Ferriol, Carmen; Rosa Miracle, Maria; Vicente, Eduardo			Effects of nutrient addition, recovery thereafter and the role of macrophytes in nutrient dynamics of a Mediterranean shallow lake: a mesocosm experiment	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Eutrophication in coastal wetlands has increased greatly because of human impact, reducing water quality and affecting aquatic plants. The aim of the present study was to investigate the eutrophication of Mediterranean wetlands and their possible recovery. An in situ mesocosm nutrient enrichment experiment was performed in a coastal shallow lake from eastern Spain, holding dense Chara meadows. In this lake, 36 mesocosms were installed and fertilised weekly with four levels of N and P addition over an 8-week period from June to August. Mesocosms fertilised with the two higher levels (N : P >= 5 : 0.5 mg L-1) shifted to turbid status with macrophyte loss before Week 4. Saturation concentrations were similar under these two conditions, with averages, similar to 1.0 mg L-1 total particulate P and 700 mu g L-1 chlorophyll-a reached in the last 3 weeks. After 5 weeks of the experiment, macrophytes were removed from the mesocosms without nutrient addition and those fertilised with 1 : 0.1 mg L-1 N:P. Macrophyte removal resulted in a release of phosphate and ammonium from sediments, enhancing eutrophication. Three months after stopping nutrient addition, high nutrient and chlorophyll concentrations persisted in the highly fertilised mesocosms, but decreased in the low fertilised mesocoms, which shows that restoration of eutrophic Mediterranean shallow lakes depends to a great extent on previous external loads.																	1323-1650	1448-6059					2017	68	3					506	518		10.1071/MF15291								WOS:000396038400010

Effects of small changes in riparian forest complexity on aquatic insect bioindicators in Brazilian subtropical streams	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Riparian forests have positive effects on water quality and biodiversity. However, most studies have only tested the effects of distinct vegetation types or streams with and without forests, despite the fact that riparian forests differ in degrees of complexity. The aim of the present study was to test whether riparian forest complexity affected the composition and abundance of the Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) taxa across a small environmental gradient. Wealso measured whether EPT genera or feeding groups responded to changes in riparian forest complexity. The study was conducted in two protection areas (i.e. Lagoa do Peri Municipal Park, PERI; and the Permanent Protection Area of Ratones, RAT) of Santa Catarina Island, Brazil. Primary production increased in streams with lower canopy percentage, and EPT assemblages differed among streams with different riparian forest complexity. In RAT, the water quality and forest variables affected EPT composition; however, in PERI, only water quality variables were important. Indicator species analysis based on genera suggested Kempnyia (Plecoptera) and Zelusia (Ephemeroptera) to be indicative of streams with greater forest complexity, whereas Farrodes (Ephemeroptera) was significant in streams of intermediate riparian forest complexity; however, no one functional group dominated. The results of the present study show that small changes in riparian forest complexity influence the composition of EPT insects in subtropical streams.

This paper briefly reviews shifts in freshwater policy in New Zealand over the last six years, identifies implications for demands on science, and then offers a framework of topics to help guide freshwater scientists better help water resource managers both develop and implement policy. Key themes include: (i) being clear about the various potential roles of scientists and the particular importance of the `honest broker' role at the interface; (ii) informing policy decisions on capacity for resource use, by predicting consequences of future scenarios; and (iii) integrating and communicating multidisciplinary technical and community-derived knowledge, including handling inevitable uncertainty. Understanding and practising these topics will contribute to improved policy for managing cumulative effects and benefit New Zealand's freshwaters and communities.																	0028-8330	1175-8805					2017	51	1					7	20		10.1080/00288330.2016.1264431								WOS:000396712500003

Finding reference: a comparison of modelling approaches for predicting macroinvertebrate community index benchmarks	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Reference benchmarks are needed to assess the contemporary status of rivers and to establish restoration targets. We developed predictive models to estimate site-specific reference values for a macroinvertebrate community index (MCI), which is used to indicate a range of human impacts on wadeable streams. We compared three statistical modelling approaches - general linear, boosted regression tree (BRT) and random forest (RF) - and tested the effect of spatial scale on predictive accuracy by developing national and regional BRT models. Using fitted flexible models (BRT, RF) and resetting predictors to reflect natural state provided the most accurate predictions of reference condition. Variation in reference MCI predictions from national and regional models was within the range observed from methodological and temporal variability. The proportion of native vegetation in upstream catchments was the primary predictor of MCI scores in all models, while secondary predictors varied regionally.

Multiple lines of evidence determine robust nutrient load limits required to safeguard a threatened lake/lagoon system	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Three independent scientific lines of evidence were sought to determine the nutrient load limits to safeguard the macrophyte community of an intermittently closed and open lake/lagoon (ICOLL): (1) a literature review identified nitrogen load thresholds related to the collapse of macrophytes in similar systems in Australia, Europe and elsewhere, (2) an ICOLL expert carried out an assessment based on current local data and on data from 57 Australian coastal lakes and lagoons, and (3) a deterministic coupled hydrodynamic-ecological model was developed and applied to simulate the ecological outcomes of several nutrient loading scenarios. The three lines of evidence converged on well-defined nitrogen load estimates required to avoid the collapse of the macrophyte community. Uncertainties were slightly greater in relation to required phosphorus load limits, but the evidence still helped set a precautionary phosphorus load limit that accounted for these uncertainties. Thus, despite the challenges in setting load limits for complex ecosystems, multiple lines of evidence helped derive robust nutrient load limits for managing the ICOLL to safeguard values associated with a healthy macrophyte community.

Seagrass rehabilitation: successful transplants and evaluation of methods at different spatial scales	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Seagrass (Zostera muelleri Irmisch ex. Aschers) was historically prolific in Whangarei Harbour, New Zealand, but has since declined. Over two years we compared the survival of mid-intertidal zone transplants (18 x 0.25 m(2) plots) from a remnant meadow to a former site using three methods: (1) intact `sods', (2) unanchored `sprigs' and (3) sprigs amongst `mats' of artificial plants. Before and after transplant, we quantified plant cover in all plots, and in transects across the wider intertidal zone. We also measured plant biomass, irradiance and water quality at each site. We found that sods and sprigs were equally effective with plant cover increased from <1 to 63%, but mats were ultimately not successful. Cover across the wider transplant site increased from 10% to 46% (biomass from 58 to 321 g m(-2)). Donor plots regenerated within 9 months. This study shows that Z. muelleri can be rehabilitated by transplant upon reinstatement of suitable growing conditions at former sites.

Responses of stream macroinvertebrate communities and water quality of five dairy farming streams following adoption of mitigation practices	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Five streams in catchments with pastoral dairy farming as the dominant land use were monitored for periods up to 13 years after adoption of mitigation practices (MPs) to detect changes in stream macroinvertebrate communities and water quality. Water quality and macroinvertebrate community condition was degraded at the start with respect to N, P, suspended solids (SS), Escherichia coli concentrations, and a number of macroinvertebrate metrics, and were typical of catchments with intensive pastoral land use. Trend analysis showed a decrease in SS concentrations for all streams, generally increasing water clarity, and lower E. coli concentrations in two streams. The improvements, attributable to improved stream fencing and effluent disposal, were only sometimes associated with improved macroinvertebrate metrics, and suggest constraints of connectivity, habitat, time, and/or MP effectiveness. Macroinvertebrate species composition had the strongest correlation with total nitrogen at two sites, but changes probably reflected indirect factors associated with TN concentrations were responsible.																	0028-8330	1175-8805					2017	51	1					127	145		10.1080/00288330.2016.1269814								WOS:000396712500010

To evaluate the effects of high seawater temperature and phosphate enrichment on reef-building crustose coralline algae, fragments of Porolithon onkodes were cultured for 1 month under laboratory conditions. The calcification rate of the coralline algae was not affected at 30 degrees C, but it decreased to the negatives at 32 degrees C in comparison to the control treatment of 27 degrees C, indicating that the temperature threshold for maintaining positive production of calcium carbonate lies between 30 and 32 degrees C. Phosphate enrichment of 1-2 mu mol L-1 did not affect the calcification rate. The net oxygen production rate was enhanced by phosphate enrichment, suggesting that the photosynthetic rate was limited by the availability of phosphate. It was concluded that moderate phosphate enrichment does not directly deteriorate algal calcification but instead ameliorates the negative effects of high seawater temperature on algal photosynthesis.

This population density, combined with poor wastewater management, results in aquatic ecosystems receiving a large volume of wastewater which may promote methane (CH4) emission. We measured water quality and CH4 emission from 11 aquatic ecosystems in Mexico City during 1 year, including reservoirs, rivers, lakes, canals and chinampas (system of floating garden on shallow lakes). The total CH4 emission from aquatic ecosystems was estimated as 3679 Mg CH4 year(-1), which represents 3.5 % of the annual CH4 emission of Mexico City. The main contributors are chinampas (33 %), followed by lakes (27 %), reservoirs (19 %), rivers (12 %) and canals (9 %). Water quality indicators were positively correlated with CH4 emission, therefore a decrease in untreated wastewater discharge may result in a significant reduction of the greenhouse gas footprint of Mexico City, after a transitional period during which the organic content of the sediment would be degraded.

Green algae (Chlorophyta) are a diverse and widely occurring group, which may be a good model for studying the factors that influence species richness at local and regional scales. Here, we tested the influence of local (water quality and structural complexity) and regional environmental factors (phyto-ecological regions) on the occurrence and species richness of macroscopic green algae (MGA) in subtropical streams. We sampled algae in 105 streams located in the four major phyto-ecological regions of the Brazilian subtropics. We used cross-transect technique in streams to sample algae and environmental variables. To determine the most important variables in species occurrence and richness, we used Hierarchical Partitioning analysis (HP). We found that canopy cover alone explained 34% of MGA occurrence, regardless of phyto-ecological region. At the sites where MGA occurred, the species richness was determined by both regional and local factors. The species richness was mainly influenced by phyto-ecological region, which explained 34% of the variation in species richness, along with canopy cover and pH which explaining 22% and 15% respectively. The highest richness was found in non-forested regions, in transects without canopy cover, and slightly acidic pH. Our results illustrate how the combination of regional and local factors can shape the spatial distribution of species richness and are pivotal to understanding richness patterns at broad spatial scales.

J	Davis, AM; Pearson, RG; Brodie, JE; Butler, B				Davis, Aaron M.; Pearson, Richard G.; Brodie, Jon E.; Butler, Barry			Review and conceptual models of agricultural impacts and water quality in waterways of the Great Barrier Reef catchment area	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Adequate conceptual frameworks that link land use to water quality and ecosystem health are lacking for tropical and subtropical freshwater systems, so we review here extensive water-quality research undertaken in the Great Barrier Reef catchment area (GBRCA) and present conceptual models synthesising the dynamics of agricultural pollutants and their ecological effects. The seasonal flow regime defines the following key periods of water-quality risk over the annual hydrological cycle for diverseGBRCAecosystems: initial 'pre-flush' flows during the transition from the dry to the wet season; early wet-season 'first flush' flows; peak wet-season flood flows; and sustained base flow or periods of disconnection during the dry season. The level of seasonal contrast varies from the perennial systems of the wet tropics to the intermittent systems of the dry tropics. Major water-quality stressors may be catchment scale (e.g. in streams draining broad-scale agriculture) or more localised (e.g. cattle access, irrigation tail water). Water-quality stressors such as ammonia toxicity and hypoxia (due to organic or nutrient run-off and enhanced plant productivity) are of low relevance to downstream GBR ecosystems but are major threats to fresh waters. Similarly, whereas high contaminant loads in wet-season floods present the highest water-quality risk to marine ecosystems, the greatest risk in fresh waters is often from acute contamination during early wet-season 'pre-flush' flows into lentic waters, or continuous input of contaminants over long periods of base flow. Because of differences in the nature of risk periods, water-quality threats and pollutant-delivery mechanisms, the benefits of different management options to improve water quality can also differ among freshwater habitats and between freshwater and marine environments.																	1323-1650	1448-6059					2017	68	1					1	19		10.1071/MF15301								WOS:000391577700001						
J	Staehr, PA; Testa, J; Carstensen, J				Staehr, Peter A.; Testa, Jeremy; Carstensen, Jacob			Decadal Changes in Water Quality and Net Productivity of a Shallow Danish Estuary Following Significant Nutrient Reductions	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												We utilized an extensive data set (1977-2013) from a water quality monitoring program to investigate the recovery of a Danish estuary following large reductions in total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) loading. Monthly rates of net transport and biogeochemical transformation of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and phosphorus (DIP) were computed in two basins of the estuary using a box model approach, and oxygen-based rates of net ecosystem production (NEP) were determined. Since 1990, nutrient loading was reduced by 58 % for nitrogen and 80 % for phosphorus, causing significant decreases in DIN (60 %) and DIP (85 %) concentrations. Reductions in nutrient loadings and concentrations reduced annual chlorophyll levels by 50 % in the inner estuary and improved Secchi depth by approximately 1 m during the same period, particularly in the summer period. In the outer, deeper region of the estuary trends in water quality was less evident. Improvements in the inner estuary were strongly coupled to declines in DIN. Thresholds of DIN and DIP concentrations limiting phytoplankton growth indicated that both regions of the estuary were nitrogen limited. NEP rates indicated the development of more net autotrophic conditions over time that were likely associated with higher benthic primary production stimulated by improved light conditions. Box model computations revealed a modest reduction in summer net production of DIP over time, despite the persistence of elevated fluxes for several years after external loads were reduced. Since the mid-1990s, nutrient loading and transformation were stable while nutrient concentrations continued to decline and water quality improved in the inner estuary. The oligotrophication trajectory involved an initial fast transformation and modest retention of nutrients followed by a gradual decline in the rate of improvement towards a new stable condition.

The Influence of Storms on Water Quality and Phytoplankton Dynamics in the Tidal James River	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Due to the unpredictable nature of intense storms and logistical constraints of sampling during storms, little is known about their immediate and long-term impacts on water quality in adjacent aquatic ecosystems. By combining targeted experiments with routine monitoring, we evaluated immediate impacts of two successive storm events on water quality and phytoplankton community response in the tidal James River and compared these findings to a non-storm year. The James River is a subestuary of the Chesapeake Bay and sampling was conducted before, during, and after Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm (TS) Lee in 2011 and during the same time period (late summer/early fall) in 2012 when there were no storms. We collected and compiled data on nutrient and chlorophyll a concentrations, phytoplankton abundance, nitrogen uptake, primary productivity rates, and surface salinity, temperature, and turbidity in the meso- and polyhaline segments of the James River. Hurricane Irene introduced significant amounts of freshwater over the entire James River and Chesapeake Bay watersheds, while rainfall from TS Lee fell primarily on the tidal fresh region of the James River and headwaters of the Chesapeake Bay. Dinoflagellates dominated the algal community in the meso- and polyhaline segments prior to the storms in 2011, and a mixed diatom community emerged after the storms. In the mesohaline river segment, cyanobacteria abundance increased after TS Lee when salinities were depressed, likely due to washout from the oligohaline and tidal fresh regions of the river. In 2012, dinoflagellates dominated the community in both segments of the river during late summer but diatoms were also abundant and their biomass fluctuated throughout the summer and fall. Cyanobacteria were not present in either segment. Overall, we observed that the high-intensity rainfall from Hurricane Irene combined with high flushing in the headwaters as a result of TS Lee likely reduced primary productivity and altered community composition in the mesohaline segment but not the more estuarine-influenced polyhaline segment. Understanding the influence of high freshwater flow with a short residence time associated with storms is key to the planning and management of estuarine restoration as such disturbances are projected to increase as a result of climate change.

Removal of cyanobacteria from the water column using a combination of coagulant and ballast is a promising technique for mitigation and an alternative to the use of algaecides. In laboratory, we tested experimentally the efficiency of two coagulants, polyaluminium chloride (PAC) and chitosan (made of shrimp shells), alone and combined with two ballasts: red soil (RS) and the own lagoon sediment, to remove natural populations of cyanobacteria, from an urban brackish coastal lagoon. PAC was a very effective coagulant when applied at low doses (ae<currency>8 mg Al L-1) and settled the cyanobacteria, while at high doses (ae<yen>16 mg Al L-1) large flocks aggregated in the top of test tubes. In contrast, chitosan was not able to form flocks, even in high doses (> 16 mg L-1) and did not efficiently settle down cyanobacteria when combined with ballast. The RS itself removed 33-47 % of the cyanobacteria. This removal was strongly enhanced when combined with PAC in a dose-dependent matter; 8 mg Al L-1 was considered the best dose to be applied. The lagoon sediment alone did not promote any settling of cyanobacteria but removal was high when combined with PAC. Combined coagulant and ballast seems a very efficient, cheap, fast and safe curative measure to lessen the harmful cyanobacteria bloom nuisance in periods when particularly needed, such as around the 2016 Olympics in Jacarepagua Lagoon.

Between 1990 and 2013, an observational study of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) was conducted in the Port River estuary (Adelaide, Australia). The estuary has received pollution from industry, sewage plants and storm water. In recent years, pollution entering the system has reduced and the establishment of the Adelaide Dolphin Sanctuary (ADS) increased dolphin protection from harassment and deliberate attacks. Nevertheless, the estuary remains a busy port. Over a 24 yr period, we conducted boat-based surveys (n = 735) for dolphin groups (n = 3,634) along a predetermined route in the Inner and Outer Estuary of Adelaide's Port River estuary. It is our conjecture that major infrastructure changes and pollution abatement have yielded a more favorable marine environment for dolphins, resulting in an estimated 6% annual increase in sightings, from a near absence of sightings in the 1980s. Increased dolphin numbers were likely the result of improved water quality, augmented by surveillance and education arising from the proclamation of the ADS. This study highlights the importance of long-term monitoring and has implications for dolphin conservation in heavily impacted urban areas and their protection via protected areas.

We obtained and compiled the recent 30 years' field observational data on nutrients and phytoplankton communities to explore the changing ecosystem. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentration (DIN) has significantly increased, while phosphate concentration (DIP) dramatically decreased because of costal anthropogenic influence. The limited factors for phytoplankton have changed from nitrogen in the 1980s to phosphate in the mid-1990s. The net-collected phytoplankton communities has the miniaturized trend, while there is drastic increase of Chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentration. Even though the diatoms still dominate in phytoplankton community, the dominant species have slightly changed. The alga bloom greatly changed from diatoms dominated to dinoflagellates due to changes of nutrient structure. All these changes on nutrients and phytoplankton communities appear to be closely associated with human activities along the coast of the Daya Bay. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Niche-breadth of freshwater macrophytes occurring in tropical southern African rivers predicts species global latitudinal range	AQUATIC BOTANY												The study tested the hypothesis that measurement, using multivariate Principal Components Analysis (PCA), of the niche-breadth of river macrophyte species in southern tropical Africa, may predict their larger-scale biogeographical range. Two measures of niche-breadth were calculated for 44 riverine macrophyte species, from 20 families commonly occurring in Zambia, using an approach based on PCA ordination with 16 bio-physico-chemical input variables. These included altitude, stream order, stream flow, pH, conductivity and soluble reactive phosphate concentration (SRP). In the absence of additional chemical water quality data for Zambian rivers, invertebrate-based measures of general water quality were also used. These were benthic macroinvertebrate Average Score per Taxon (ASPT), and individual abundance of nine macroinvertebrate families with differing water quality tolerance, indicated by their Sensitivity Weightings within the Zambian Invertebrate Scoring System (ZISS). Macrophyte large-scale latitudinal range was derived from world geopositional records held by online databases, and additional records held by the authors. The two niche-breadth metrics divided the species into narrow-niche and intermediate/broad-niche categories, showing significant variation (from one or both of correlation and ANOVA test outcomes) in altitude, stream flow, conductivity, SRP, pH and ASPT, but not stream order. Macrophyte alpha-diversity (as a measure of number of individual niches co-existing per habitat) showed no significant relationship with individual species niche-breadth. Narrow-niche species included a higher proportion of Afrotropical endemics than did species with broader niche size. There were significant predictive relationships between macrophyte niche-breadth and latitudinal range of the target species at global and Afrotropical scales, but not for the Neotropics.

Effects of land use on larval Odonata assemblages in cloud forest streams in central Veracruz, Mexico	HYDROBIOLOGIA												This study analyzes the effect of stream water quality and its relationship with habitat characteristics on larval Odonata assemblages in streams found in tropical montane cloud forests, pastures, and coffee plantations in the upper La Antigua River watershed. The main factors that influenced larval Odonata assemblages in forest streams were low temperatures and high oxygen levels in water, coupled with a high diversity of the substrate and riparian vegetation; in pasture streams and coffee plantation streams, sedimentation strongly affected the composition of larval Odonata assemblages. In all the streams, species richness ((0) D) was higher during the dry season. The highest Shannon alpha diversity ((1) D) values were found in forest streams during the rainy season; however, in pasture and coffee plantation streams, (1) D values were higher during the dry season. The low species turnover in forest streams suggests that these streams provide highly stable conditions for Odonata assemblages; however, in pasture and coffee plantation streams, the higher turnover was related to the more variable water and habitat conditions. Thus, the persistence of Odonata assemblages in the upper La Antigua River watershed is closely related to the conservation status of the tropical montane cloud forests.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN	2017	785	1					19	33		10.1007/s10750-016-2900-x								WOS:000388173000002

Extracellular enzyme activity suggests phosphorus limitation of biofilm productivity in acid mine drainage remediated streams	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Acid mine drainage (AMD) is a global consequence of historical and present day mining activities. Remediation efforts have been successful in improving water quality with elevated pH and decreased dissolved metals. In many streams, there has been chemical and biological recovery, but success is not universal. The goal of restoration should be to improve not only biological diversity but also stream function. We compared biofilm community characteristics and function from three stream categories (AMD-unimpaired, AMD-impaired, and AMD-remediated) in southeastern Ohio. Biofilms of the AMD-impaired and AMD-remediated sites had the lowest concentrations of chlorophyll a and the lowest rates of productivity and respiration. AMD-impaired streams had reduced pH and increased dissolved metal (iron, aluminum, and manganese) concentrations. Specific conductance was elevated in both the AMD-impaired and AMD-remediated streams. Water at the AMD-impacted and AMD-remediated sites had significantly lower soluble reactive phosphorus concentration compared to AMD-unimpaired sites. Biofilm extracellular enzyme activities showed an increase in biomass-specific phosphorus-acquiring enzymes in AMD-impaired and AMD-remediated sites. These results suggest phosphorus limitation is occurring in AMD-impaired and AMD-remediated streams, potentially limiting or delaying biotic recovery even though water chemistry has improved.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN	2017	784	1					225	236		10.1007/s10750-016-2877-5								WOS:000387484100017						
J	Baumgartner, SD; Robinson, CT				Baumgartner, Simone D.; Robinson, Christopher T.			Short-term colonization dynamics of macroinvertebrates in restored channelized streams	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Macroinvertebrate colonization of restored rivers is a function of dispersal into the restored reach and its suitability for population establishment. To maximize potential for colonization success, spatial considerations such as distance to colonizer source pools and dispersal pathways must be included in restoration planning. Unfortunately, the dispersal abilities of macroinvertebrates and ecological importance of different dispersal modes for colonization are still poorly understood. We used a field experiment that controlled colonization by passive drift and allowed distinction between active upstream aquatic and active/passive aerial dispersal, thus testing their differential importance during colonization of experimentally restored stream reaches. Two agricultural streams emanating below culverts were longitudinally separated along the first 30 m and one stream side each was covered with a fine-mesh net to limit aerial dispersal. Colonization of manually disturbed background and experimentally introduced cobble substrate was investigated over 6 months. We found that upstream in-stream dispersal, especially in these agricultural streams, can be rapid (days) and play an important role in the short-term colonization of restored streams. We conclude that a landscape perspective, in addition to in-stream measures, must be considered when attempting to restore streams dominated by agricultural and urban land use that constrains available species pools and limits dispersal pathways.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN	2017	784	1					321	335		10.1007/s10750-016-2886-4								WOS:000387484100023

Behavioural response of bivalve molluscs to calcium hydroxide	AQUACULTURE												Blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) that are cultivated in the marine area around Prince Edward Island, Eastern Canada, are susceptible to the heavy biofouling of their shells by an invasive solitary tunicate, Styela clava, which rapidly proliferates. To mitigate this issue, mussel farmers periodically lift the longlines on which the mussels are suspended out of the water to spray a highly alkaline (similar to 12.7 pH units) calcium hydroxide solution onto fouled individuals. Here, we tested the hypothesis that calcium hydroxide exerts behavioural stress on mussels and other bivalves. Field surveys revealed that the alkalinity of the seawater in the vicinity of longlines increased (9.3-11.7 pH units) immediately after treated mussel sleeves were returned into the water column. Thereafter, pH values declined rapidly, and met federal water quality guidelines (7.0-8.7 pH units) within 3.1 +/- 0.5 min (range 0.3-10.5 min, n = 31 sleeves). Cultivated mussels challenged to both emersion and calcium hydroxide closed their valves for 14.0 +/- 3.3 min (n = 18) compared to 6.5 +/- 1.6min (n = 17) by control mussels (emersion only). We subsequently assessed how three benthic bivalve species (M. edulis, Crassostrea virginica (eastern oyster) and Argopecten irradians (bay scallop)) respond to weak (pH <= 9.2) but sustained (3-h daily for 3 days) alkalinity conditions. All three species consistently responded by completely or partially closing their valves. However, all behavioural responses were short-lived (0.2-4.7 h), and were generally confined to the treatment period. In conclusion, spraying calcium hydroxide onto cultivated mussels has limited impact on seawater alkalinity and the behaviour of nearby bivalves. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.
