J	Wu, Q; Qi, J; Xia, XH				Wu, Qiong; Qi, Jun; Xia, Xinghui			Long-term variations in sediment heavy metals of a reservoir with changing trophic states: Implications for the impact of climate change	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Two dated sediment cores from the Miyun Reservoir of Beijing in China were analyzed to reconstruct the pollution history of heavy metals including cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), and zinc (Zn) as well as phosphorus (P). Enrichment factor (EF) and geoaccumulation index (I-geo) were applied to assess the enrichment status of heavy metals. Average EF and I-geo values indicated that the studied heavy metals in the sediments mainly originated from non-point source pollution and soil-water erosion, showing low ecological risks. In addition, correlation analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) identified that Cd, Zn, and P were mainly from agricultural diffusion pollution caused by utilization of the phosphate fertilizer; Zn, Ni, and Cr originated from soil erosion. PCA analysis was further conducted to investigate the relationships among meteorological factors, algae dominant total organic carbon (TOC), and heavy metals. Results showed that algae-dominant TOC had strong positive correlation with temperature, which can be explained by that increased temperature accelerated the growth of algae. Meanwhile the opposite loadings between algae-dominant TOC and heavy metal suggested that primary production played an important role in migration and transformation of metals. Moreover, stepwise multiple regression models showed that Fe was sensitive to temperature, which accounted for approximately 39.0% and 40.1% of the variations in Fe of two sediment cores, respectively. Fe showed significant decreasing trends during the past 50 years. Reductive environment of water-sediment interface caused by increasing temperature probably contributed to the restoration of ferric iron, resulting in the release of soluble Fe to overlying waters. Future climate change with elevated temperature and extreme weather events will aggravate the ecological risk of heavy metals in water environment due to the enhanced leaching effect and non-point source pollution as well as the release of heavy metals from sediments to water environment.

J	Wu, L; Chang, HY; Ma, XY				Wu, Lei; Chang, Huanyu; Ma, Xiaoyi			A modified method for pesticide transport and fate in subsurface environment of a winter wheat field of Yangling, China	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The Guanzhong region is one of the water resources shortage areas and also an important food producing area in Chinese Loess Plateau. The unreasonable application of irrigation and pesticide not only reduces the utilization rate of pesticides, but also is a potential threat to aquatic environments. In order to explore the reasonable application pattern of irrigation and pesticide, a modified method considering crop water requirement and pesticide transport was established to simulate transport and fate of Triadimefon in subsurface environment of a winter wheat field in Yangling, China. Results indicate that: (1) the modified method introduces the concepts of crop water requirement and irrigation schedule, which can estimate irrigation amount more accurately and achieve the goal of water saving and agricultural diffuse pollution control more efficiently. The method shows good potential applications and implications in predicting pesticide exposure levels of different crops and in reducing pesticide pollution. (2) The changing trends of soil pesticide levels under different pesticide applications are various. The Triadimefon concentration level in surface soil layer (0.005 m) was directly affected by pesticide application and irrigation. The Triadimefon peak below the soil depth of 0.035 m has prominently delayed effects and it is mainly affected by irrigations. The concentration of pesticides decays rapidly with the increase of soil depth, and it can be ignored below the depth of 0.5 m. (3) The soil pesticide levels under different pesticide and irrigation modes show considerable differences, the irrigation is still the most significant factor affecting the level of soil pesticide residues under different time intervals between pesticide application and irrigation. The irrigation scheme of one-day interval and five-divided irrigation can effectively reduce deep soil pollution without affecting the normal growth of crops. Results may provide theoretical basis and guide farmers to choose appropriate irrigation and pesticide application patterns. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Predicting diffuse microbial pollution risk across catchments: The performance of SCIMAP and recommendations for future development	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Microbial pollution of surface waters in agricultural catchments can be a consequence of poor farm management practices, such as excessive stocking of livestock on vulnerable land or inappropriate handling of manures and slurries. Catchment interventions such as fencing of watercourses, streamside buffer strips and constructed wetlands have the potential to reduce faecal pollution of watercourses. However these interventions are expensive and occupy valuable productive land. There is, therefore, a requirement for tools to assist in the spatial targeting of such interventions to areas where they will have the biggest impact on water quality improvements whist occupying the minimal amount of productive land. SCIMAP is a risk-based model that has been developed for this purpose but with a focus on diffuse sediment and nutrient pollution. In this study we investigated the performance of SCIMAP in predicting microbial pollution of watercourses and assessed modelled outputs of E. coli, a common faecal indicator organism (FIO), against observed water quality information. SCIMAP was applied to two river catchments in the UK. SCIMAP uses land cover riskweightings, which are routed through the landscape based on hydrological connectivity to generate catchment scale maps of relative in-stream pollution risk. Assessment of the model's performance and derivation of optimum land cover risk weightings was achieved using a Monte-Carlo sampling approach. Performance of the SCIMAP framework for informing on FIO risk was variable with better performance in the Yealm catchment (r(s) = 0.88; p < 0.01) than the Wyre (r(s) = -0.36; p > 0.05). Across both catchments much uncertainty was associated with the application of optimum risk weightings attributed to different land use classes. Overall, SCIMAP showed potential as a useful tool in the spatial targeting of FIO diffuse pollution management strategies; however, improvements are required to transition the existing SCIMAP framework to a robust FIO risk-mapping tool.

Such models commonly overlook the flow pathways of pollutants across the landscape. This work aims at closing such knowledge gap by developing a Spatially and Temporally Distributed Empirical model for Phosphorus Management (STEM-P) that simulates the daily phosphorus loss from source areas to receiving waters on a spatially-distributed grid-cell basis. STEM-P bypasses the use of complex mechanistic algorithms by representing the phosphorus mobilization and delivery processes with zero-order mobilization and first-order delivery, respectively. STEM-P was applied to a 217 km(2) watershed with mixed forest and agricultural land uses situated in southwestern China. The STEM-P simulation of phosphorus concentration at the watershed outlet approximated the observed data closely: the percent bias (P-bias) was -7.1%, with a Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (ENS) of 0.80 on a monthly scale for the calibration period. The Pbias was 18.1%, with a monthly ENS equal to 0.72 for validation. The simulation results showed that 76% of the phosphorus loadwas transported with surface runoff, 25.2% of which came from 3.4% of the watershed area (classified as standard A critical source areas), and 55.3% of which originated from 17.1% of the watershed area (classified as standard B critical source areas). The standard A critical source areas were composed of 51% residences, 27% orchards, 18% dry fields, and 4% paddy fields. The standard B critical source areas were mainly paddy fields (81%). The calculated spatial and temporal patterns of phosphorus loss and recorded flow pathways identified with the STEM-P simulations revealed the field-scale critical source areas and guides the design and placement of effective practices for non-point source pollution control and water quality conservation.

An area with mixed land-uses, typical of the piedmont-plain recharge area of the North China Plain, was selected to investigate different nitrate sources and the impact of land use on nitrate distribution in groundwater. Multiple environmental tracers were examined, including major ions, stable isotopes of water (delta H-2-H2O, delta O-18-H2O) and nitrate (delta N-15-NO3- and delta O-18-NO3-). Groundwater was sampled from four land-use types; natural vegetation (NV), farmland (FL), economic forestland (EF) and residential areas (RA). A mixing model using delta O-18 and Cl-concentrations showed that groundwater recharge predominantly comprises precipitation and lateral groundwater flow from areas of natural vegetation in the upper catchment, while irrigation return water and wastewater from septic tanks were major inputs in farmland and residential areas, respectively. Land use variation is the major contributing factor to different nitrate concentrations. In total, 80%, 49% and 86% of samples from RA, FL and EF, respectively exceeded the WHO standard (50 mg/L NO3-), compared to 6.9% of samples from NV. Isotopes of delta N-15-NO3- and delta O-18-NO3- verified that nitrate in groundwater of the NV (with delta N-15 ranging from 1.7 parts per thousand to 4.7 parts per thousand) was sourced from soil and precipitation. Examination of delta N-15-NO3- vs delta O-18-NO3- values along with multivariate statistical analysis (principle component and cluster analysis) helped identify sources with overlapping isotopic values in other land-use areas (where delta N-15 values range from 2.5% to 10.2%). Manure and septic waste were dominant sources for most groundwater with high NO3- and Cl-concentrations in both farmland and residential areas. The lack of de-nitrification and fact that the area is a recharge zone for the North China Plain highlight the importance of controlling nitrate sources through careful application of manure and fertilizers, and control of septic leakage.

Coastal stormwater wet pond sediment nitrogen dynamics	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Wet ponds are a common type of stormwater control measure (SCM) in coastal areas of the southeastern US, but their internal nitrogen dynamics have not been extensively studied. Using flow-through intact sediment core incubations, net sediment N-2 fluxes before and after a nitrate addition from five wet ponds spanning a range of ages (3.25-10 years old) were quantified through membrane inlet mass spectrometry during early summer. Multiple locations within a single wet pond (6.16 years old) were also sampled during ambient conditions in late summer to determine the combined effects of depth, vegetation, and flow path position on net N-2 fluxes at the sediment-water interface. All pond sediments had considerable rates of net nitrogen fixation during ambient conditions, and net N-2 fluxes during nitrate-enriched conditions were significantly correlated with pond age. Following a nitrate addition to simulate storm conditions, younger pond sediments shifted towards net denitrification, but older ponds exhibited even higher rates of net nitrogen fixation. The pond forebay had significantly higher rates of net nitrogen fixation compared to the main basin, and rates throughout the pond were an order of magnitude higher than the early summer experiment. These results identify less than optimal nitrogen processing in this common SCM, however, data presented here suggest that water column mixing and pond sediment excavation could improve the capacity of wet ponds to enhance water quality by permanently removing nitrogen.

In Chile, land-use change has drastically intensified over the last decade, with native forests converted to exotic forest plantations and agricultural land. However, the effects thereof on aquatic ecosystems are not well understood. Closing this knowledge gap first requires understanding how human perturbations affect riparian and stream biota. Identified biological indicators could then be applied to determine the health of fluvial ecosystems. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of land-use change on the health of riparian and aquatic ecosystems by assessing riparian vegetation, water quality, benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages, and functional feeding groups. Twenty-one sites in catchment areas with different land-uses (i.e. pristine forests, native forests, exotic forest plantations, and agricultural land) were selected and sampled during the 2010 to 2012 dry seasons. Riparian vegetation quality-was highest in pristine forests. Per the modified Macroinvertebrate Family Biotic Index for Chilean species, the best conditions existed in native forests and the worst in agricultural catchments. Water quality and macroinvertebrate assemblages significantly varied across land-use areas, with forest plantations and agricultural land having high nutrient concentrations, conductivity, suspended solids, and apparent color. Macroinvertebrate assemblage diversity was lowest for agricultural and exotic forest plantation catchments, with notable non-insect representation. Collector-gatherers were the most abundant functional feeding group, suggesting importance independent of land-use. Land-use areas showed no significant differences in functional feeding groups. In conclusion, anthropogenic land-use changes were detectable through riparian quality, water quality, and macroinvertebrate assemblages, but not through functional feeding groups. These data, particularly the riparian vegetation and macroinvertebrate assemblage parameters, could be applied towards the conservation and management of riparian ecosystems through land-use change studies.

Application and validation of a new approach for modelling benthic invertebrate dispersal: First colonisation of a former open sewer system	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Within a heavily modified catchment, formerly polluted streams are now free of untreated wastewater. Additionally, the morphology of streams has been improved by physical habitat restoration. Both water quality and structural improvements offered a unique opportunity to investigate the recolonisation of restored sections by benthic macroinvertebrates. As dispersal is a key mechanism for recolonisation, we developed a method to predict the dispersal of 18 aquatic insect taxa to 35,338 river sections (section length: 2 m) within the catchment. Source populations of insect taxa were sampled at 33 sites. In addition, 14 morphologically restored sites were sampled and constituted the validation dataset. We applied a "least-cost" modelling approach within a raster-based GIS model, combining taxon-specific aquatic and terrestrial dispersal capabilities with the "friction" that physical migration barriers impose on dispersal of aquatic and terrestrial stages. This taxon-specific modelling approach was compared to a conservative modelling approach, assuming a Euclidean distance of 5 km as the maximum dispersal distance for any source population regardless of dispersal barriers. Least-cost modelling showed a significantly better performance in terms of the correct classification rate (CCR) and true predicted absences (specificity), with on average 37% points higher CCR and 42% points higher specificity. Sensitivity was 18% points lower. At 71% of the validation sites, recolonisation was predicted with at least a modest goodness of fit (CCR > 70%). Conversely, the conservative modelling approach achieved a modest goodness of fit for only 14% of the validation sites. For 44% of the taxa, least-cost modelling showed a high CCR (= 100%), whereas the conservative approach showed a high CCR for none of the taxa. Our approach can help water managers select appropriate sites for restoration to increase recolonisation and biological recovery. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

As an implicit consequence of this finding, it has been assumed that there are no long-term increasing trends in nutrient exports from these peatlands after the establishment of forestry. We analysed discharge total nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP) concentration data from 54 catchments with undrained pristine peatlands and 34 catchments with drained peatlands using data with considerably longer drainage history than in previous studies. Our results agree with previous studies in that discharge TN and TP concentrations in areas drained 20-30 years ago did not differ much from those in pristine sites. However, we also observed that the TN and TP concentrations were increasing with years since drainage of these catchments. Discharge TN and TP concentrations were over two times higher in areas drained 60 years ago when compared with more recently drained areas. Our results challenge the current perceptions by showing that forestry-drained peatlands may contribute to water eutrophication considerably more than previously estimated. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, the mechanism on how sulfate-rich mine drainage affects freshwater ecosystems is largely unknown, and its potential ecological risk has not been assessed so far. During 2009-2016, water and macroinvertebrate samples from 405 sample sites were collected along the mine drainage gradient from circum-neutral to alkaline waters in Hun-Tai River, Northeastern China. Results of linear regressions showed that sulfate-rich mine drainage was significantly positively correlated with the constituents typically derived from rock weathering (Ca2+, Mg2+ and HCO3- + CO32-); the diversity of intolerant stream macroinvertebrates exhibited a steep decline along the gradient of sulfate-rich mine drainage. Meanwhile, stressor-response relationships between sulfate-rich mine drainage and macroinvertebrate communities were explored by two complementary statistical approaches in tandem (Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis and the field-based method developed by USEPA). Results revealed that once stream sulfate concentrations in mine drainage exceeded 35 mg/L, significant decline in the abundance of intolerant macroinvertebrate taxa occurred. An assessment of ecological risk posed by sulfate-rich mine drainage was conducted based on a tiered approach consisting of simple deterministic method (Hazard Quotient, HQ) to probabilistic method (Joint Probability Curve, JPC). Results indicated that sulfate-rich mine drainage posed a potential risk, and 64.62-84.88% of surface waters in Hun-Tai River exist serious risk while 5% threshold (HC05) and 1% threshold (HC01) were set up to protect macroinvertebrates, respectively. This study provided us a better understanding on the impacts of sulfate-rich mine drainage on freshwater ecosystems, and it would be helpful for future catchment management to protect streams from mining activity.

Taking discharge as a representative water quantity indicator, as well as total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) as water quality indicators for the twin rivers (i.e., the Chaohe and Baihe rivers) which run into the Miyun Reservoir in North China, this study calculated marginal probability distributions of these indicators, and analyzed the joint probability distribution of discharge and TN/TP concentration by applying the Frank copula function. According to an analysis of various scenario combinations of discharge and TN/TP concentration, the quantitative management intervals including the priority control interval, the key attention interval and the daily maintenance interval, were identified. The results were as follows: (a) a fitting degree evaluation indicated that the Pearson-III distribution for the marginal probability distribution of discharge and the lognormal distribution for that of TN/TP concentration were feasible. Additionally, the Frank copula theory was applicable for their joint probability analysis according to the applicability analysis and goodness-of-fit test; (b) regarding to the water quality of the Miyun Reservoir inflows, it is more important to enhance the control of the Chaohe River and the monitoring of TP concentration; and (c) the TN concentration within division values of discharge (i.e., 16.59, 24.14 m(3)/s) was tend to exceed the class III limitation of the Environmental Quality Standard for Surface Water in China, and the concentrations of TN and TP increased as the discharge increased for the two rivers. The quantitative management intervals based on copula analysis is an intuitive and effective solution for comprehensive risk management of reservoir inflows. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Seena, S; Carvalho, F; Cassio, F; Pascoal, C				Seena, Sahadevan; Carvalho, Francisco; Cassio, Fernanda; Pascoal, Claudia			Does the developmental stage and composition of riparian forest stand affect ecosystem functioning in streams?	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												A common watershed restoration practice to improve water quality and stream ecosystem functions and services is replanting riparian corridors with plant species that may differ from those of natural communities. This restoration practice may have consequences on the aquatic ecosystem processes because organisms obtain energy from leaf litter inputs of the riparian zones. Leaf litter decomposition in streams is a vital ecosystem-level process, which depends on the activity of microorganisms and invertebrates. In the current study, we examined whether the type and developmental stage of riparian forest affect stream ecosystem functioning. We selected three wide-spread tree species in the Northwest Portugal, namely alder (Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn.), oak (Quercus robur L.) and eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus Labill.) and conducted stream litter decomposition experiments with leaf litter from trees differing in developmental stage to assess leaf mass loss, fungal and invertebrate biomass and diversity. Both type and developmental stage of riparian stand significantly affected leaf mass loss, biomass of fungi and benthic invertebrates, sporulation of fungi, and abundance of invertebrates. However, only developmental stage of the riparian stand had an impact on the richness and diversity of fungi, whereas invertebrate diversity and richness was influenced by both stage and type classes. Overall our study provides the novel information that stream ecosystem processes are dictated not only by the composition but also by the developmental stage of the riparian stand. Moreover, this study provides an insight into how by altering riparian forest community composition through restoration practices may have an impact on a key ecosystem process and may have implications for successfully implementing future management strategies.

In this study, we investigated if the oxygen isotope ratios in stream dissolved phosphate delta O-18(P)) can be used to distinguish between the phosphorus (P) originating from agricultural runoff and from rural sewage, at different periods of the year. Water was collected from septic tanks, drainage wells and the stream outlet in a small 7.3 km(2)) agricultural catchment to capture variations in the isotope signature at different flowevents. The d18OP signature in septic tank effluent (+ 13.2 to + 14.5%) was significantly different from that in drainage water (+ 9.0 to + 15.7%). Four different septic tanks had surprisingly similar isotope signature when 24 h composite samples were collected. Most of the water samples were not in oxygen isotope equilibrium. In three drainage wells, the d18OP signature varied from + 7.8 up to + 15.7% with higher values in periods with a larger contribution of superficial streamflow generation. A rainfall soon after manure had been spread resulted in a d18OP of 15.7% in a drainage well, and was also reflected in a similar value at the catchment outlet. This implies that the source isotope signal may be conserved during moderate or high flows. A three end-member model including the geological background would be a useful start to quantify the P contribution from diverse sources. Temporal differences in biological activity and the predominant transport pathways through soil profiles must be considered along with information about fertilisation. In combination with hydrological modelling of water pathways, this may considerably improve our understanding of catchment P losses. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

To evaluate the response of tracemetals in coastal seawater to climatic changes and human disturbances, we report annual-resolution trace element data for a Porites coral core covering similar to 100 years of continuous growth from a fringing reef in Xiaodonghai Bay in the northern South China Sea. The results suggested that the trace metal contents in the coral skeleton demonstrated decadal to interdecadal fluctuations with several large or small peaks in certain years with remarkable environmental significances. All of the trace metals in coastal surface seawater, especially Cr and Pb (related to industrial or traffic emissions), were impacted by terrestrial inputs, except for Sr and U, which were impacted by the surface seawater temperature (SST). Moreover, Mn, Ni, Fe and Co were also contributed by weapons and military supplies during wars, and Cu, Cd and Zn were further impacted by upwelling associated with their biogeochemical cycles. Ba and rare earth element (REE) in coastal surface seawater were dominated by runoff and groundwater discharge associated with precipitation. This study provided the potential for some trace metals (e.g., REE, Ba, Cu, Cd, and Zn) in coral skeletons to be used as proxies of natural (e.g., upwelling and precipitation) and anthropogenic (e.g., war and coastal construction) variability of seawater chemistry to enable the reconstruction of environmental and climatic changes through time.

Water or sediment? Partitioning the role of water column and sediment chemistry as drivers of macroinvertebrate communities in an austral South African stream	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Water pollution is a critical management issue, with many rivers and streams draining urban areas being polluted by the disposal of untreated solid waste and wastewater discharge, storm water and agricultural runoff. This has implications for biodiversity, and many rivers in the developing world are now considered compromised. We investigated benthic macroinvertebrate community structure and composition in relation to physico-chemical conditions of the water column and sediments. The study was conducted in an Austral catchment subject to both urban and agricultural pollutants in two different seasons. We assessed whether sediment characteristics were more important drivers of macroinvertebrate community composition than water column characteristics. We expected clear differences in macroinvertebrate community composition and in the associated community metrics due to distinct flow conditions between the two seasons. A combination of multivariate analyses (canonical correspondence analysis (CCA)) and biological indicator analysis were used to examine these patterns. Chironomidae was the most abundant family (>60%) in the upper mainstem river and stream sites. Stream sites were positively associated with CCA axis 2, being characterised by high turbidity and lower pH, salinity, phosphate concentration, channel width and canopy cover. Canopy cover, channel width, substrate embeddedness, phosphate concentration, pH, salinity and turbidity all had a significant effect on macroinvertebrate community composition. Using CCA variation partitioning, water quality was, however, a better predictor of benthic macroinvertebrate composition than sediment chemical conditions. Furthermore, our results suggest that seasonality had little effect on structuring benthic macroinvertebrate communities in this south-eastern zone of South Africa, despite clear changes in sediment chemistry. This likely reflects the relative lack of major variability in water chemistry compared to sediment chemistry between seasons and the relatively muted variability in precipitation between seasons than the more classic Austral temperate climates.

Surrogate measurements such as turbidity can improve understanding of pollutant behaviour, providing calibrations can be made cost-effectively and with quantified uncertainties. Here, we compared fortnightly and storm intensive water quality sampling with semi-continuous turbidity monitoring calibrated against spot samples as three potential methods for determining SS and PP concentrations and loads in an agricultural catchment over two-years. In the second year of sampling we evaluated the transferability of turbidity calibration relationships to an adjacent catchment with similar soils and land cover. When data from nine storm events were pooled, both SS and PP concentrations (all in log space) were better related to turbidity than they were to discharge. Developing separate calibration relationship for the rising and falling limbs of the hydrograph provided further improvement. However, the ability to transfer calibrations between adjacent catchments was not evident as the relationships of both SS and PP with turbidity differed both in gradient and intercept on the rising limb of the hydrograph between the two catchments. We conclude that the reduced uncertainty in load estimation derived from the use of turbidity as a proxy for specific water quality parameters in long-term regulatory monitoring programmes, must be considered alongside the increased capital and maintenance costs of turbidity equipment, potentially noisy turbidity data and the need for site-specific prolonged storm calibration periods.

Habitat degradation and species introductions are major threats to global biodiversity, and riverine fish are among the most threatened taxa in the world. Our interest was whether the presence of non-native species can affect native fish sensitivity to water quality deterioration in a large region in northeastern Spain (99,700 km(2), 15 catchments, 530 sites). We used a 'basemodel' with geographical and hydro-morphological variables, which are the major shaping factors in rivers. We tested whether water pollution, non-native species, or their interaction provided an improved understanding of patterns of distributions and health measurements of the twelve most common native species. There was little evidence that variation in native species abundance, where they occurred, the presence of diseases and changes in mean fish length or body condition was affected by water deterioration, the presence of non-native species, or their interaction. The disease rate and occurrence of native species might be affected, to a minor degree, by water quality changes and the presence of non-native species. Environmental conditions between sites with and without non-native fish differed in the condition of riparian areas and in water quality. Based on presence-absence data and changes in abundances through weighted average equations we also derived potential safe levels of salinization, nutrient pollution, and pH for the native fish. Overall, additive effects of stressors prevail over interactions, and the restoration of natural hydro-morphology in rivers is likely to be the most effective management approach to improving the prospects for the native fish fauna.

However, the effects of extreme floods of different return intervals on the floodplain and river channelmorphological evolution with the associated sediment transport processes are not well explored. Furthermore, different basin management action plans, such as engineering structure modifications, may also greatly affect the flood inundation, sediment transport, solute transport and morphological processes within extreme flood events. In this study, a coupled two-dimensional hydrodynamic, sediment transport and morphological model is applied to evaluate the impact of different river and basin management strategies on the flood inundation, sediment transport dynamics and morphological changes within extreme flood events of different magnitudes. The 10-year, 50-year, 100-year and 200-year floods are evaluated for the Lower Cache Creek system in California under existing condition and a potential future modification scenario. Modeling results showed that select locations of flood inundation within the study area tend to experience larger inundation depth and more sediment is likely to be trapped in the study area under potential modification scenario. The proposed two dimensional flow and sediment transport modeling approach implemented with a variety of inflow conditions can provide guidance to decision-makers when considering implementation of potential modification plans, especially as they relate to competing management strategies of large water bodies, such as the modeling area in this study.

This study proposes a set of sector-wise characterization factors (CFs), namely consumptive and degradative water stresses, to assess the impact of water withdrawals with a life cycle assessment approach. These CFs consider water availability, water quality, and competition for water between domestic, agricultural and industrial sectors and ecosystem at the watershed level. CFs were applied to a case study of regional water management of industrial water withdrawals in Taiwan to show that both regional or seasonal decrease in water availability contributes to a high consumptive water stress, whereas water scarcity due to degraded water quality not meeting sector standards has little influence on increased degradative water stress. Degradative water stress was observed more in the agricultural sector than in the industrial sector, which implies that the agriculture sector may have water quality concerns. Reducing water intensity and alleviating regional scale water stresses of watersheds are suggested as approaches to decrease the impact of both consumptive and degradative water use. The results from this study may enable a more detailed sector-wise analysis of water stress and influence water resource management policies. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Reuse water: Exposure duration, seasonality and treatment affect tissue responses in a model fish	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Partially remediated gray (reuse) water will likely find increasing use in a variety of applications owing to the increasing scarcity of freshwater. We aimed to determine if a model fish, the goldfish, could sense reuse water using olfaction (smell), and if 30 min or 7 d (acute) and 60 d (sub-chronic) exposures would affect their olfactory responses to natural odorants. We examined olfaction as previous studies have found that numerous chemicals can impair the olfactory sense, which is critical to carrying out numerous life-sustaining behaviors from feeding to mating. We also examined if fish olfactory and liver tissues would mount a response in terms of biotransformation enzyme gene expression, and whether treatment of reuse water with UV/H2O2 ameliorated adverse effects following reuse water exposure. We found that fish olfactory tissue responded to reuse water as it would to a natural odorant and that UV/H2O2 treatment had no influence on this. With acute exposures, olfactory impairment was apparent regardless of water type (e. g. responses of 23-55% of control), but in sub-chronic exposures, only the untreated reuse water caused olfactory impairment. The exposure of fish to reuse water increased the expression of one enzyme (CYP1A; >2.5-6.5 fold change) and reuse water treatment with UV/H2O2 reversed the effect. There was a seasonal effect that was likely due to changes in water quality (60 d summer exposure impaired ol-faction whereas spring and fall exposures did not). Overall, the data suggest that reuse water may be detected by olfaction, impair olfactory responses in fish receiving unavoidable exposures, and that exposure duration and season are important factors to consider regarding adverse effects.

Simulation of targeted pollutant-mitigation-strategies to reduce nitrate and sediment hotspots in agricultural watershed	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												About 50% of U.S. water pollution problems are caused by non-point source (NPS) pollution, primarily sediment and nutrients from agricultural areas, despite the widespread implementation of agricultural Best Management Practices (BMPs). However, the effectiveness of implementation strategies and type of BMPs at watershed scale are still not well understood. In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) ecohydrological model was used to assess the effectiveness of pollutant mitigation strategies in the Raccoon River watershed (RRW) in west-central Iowa, USA. We analyzed fourteen management scenarios based on systematic combinations of five strategies: fertilizer/manure management, changing row-crop land to perennial grass, vegetative filter strips, cover crops and shallower tile drainage systems, specifically aimed at reducing nitrate and total suspended sediment yields from hotspot areas in the RRW. Moreover, we assessed implications of climate change on management practices, and the impacts of management practices on water availability, row crop yield, and total agricultural production. Our results indicate that sufficient reduction of nitrate load may require either implementation of multiple management practices (38.5% with current setup) or conversion of extensive areas into perennial grass (up to 49.7%) to meet and maintain the drinking water standard. However, climate change may undermine the effectiveness of management practices, especially late in the 21st century, cutting the reduction by up to 65% for nitrate andmore for sediment loads. Further, though our approach is targeted, it resulted in a slight decrease (similar to 5%) in watershed average crop yield and hence an overall reduction in total crop production, mainly due to the conversion of row-crop lands to perennial grass. Such yield reductions could be quite spatially heterogeneously distributed (0 to 40%). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The essence of NPS pollution is the transport of nutrients between soil and water. Traditional NPS pollution control strategies, however, are mainly based on the solid and liquid phases, with little focus on the bio-phase between water and soil. The pollutants produced from NPS can be regarded as a resource if recycled or reused in an appropriate way in the agricultural ecosystem. This mini review proposes novel strategies for NPS pollution control based on three phases (liquid, solid and bio-phase) and highlights the regulating services of an agricultural ecosystem by optimizing land use/cover types.

J	Freeman, LA; Ackleson, SG; Rhea, WJ				Freeman, Lauren A.; Ackleson, Steven G.; Rhea, William Joseph			Comparison of remote sensing algorithms for retrieval of suspended particulate matter concentration from reflectance in coastal waters	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING												Suspended particulate matter (SPM) is a key environmental indicator for rivers, estuaries, and coastal waters, which can be calculated from remote sensing reflectance obtained by an airborne or satellite imager. Here, algorithms from prior studies are applied to a dataset of in-situ at surface hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance, collected in three geographic regions representing different water types. These data show the optically inherent exponential nature of the relationship between reflectance and sediment concentration. However, linear models are also shown to provide a reasonable estimate of sediment concentration when utilized with care in similar conditions to those under which the algorithms were developed, particularly at lower SPM values (0 to 20 mg/L). Fifteen published SPM algorithms are tested, returning strong correlations of R-2 > 0.7, and in most cases, R-2 > 0.8. Very low SPM values show weaker correlation with algorithm calculated SPM that is not wavelength dependent. None of the tested algorithms performs well for high SPM values (> 30 mg/L), with most algorithms underestimating SPM. A shift toward a smaller number of simple exponential or linear models relating satellite remote sensing reflectance to suspended sediment concentration with regional consideration will greatly aid larger spatiotemporal studies of suspended sediment trends.

Virus Transfer at the Skin-Liquid Interface	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Understanding virus transfer between liquid and skin is necessary to estimate transmission during water related activities. Here, we modeled virus transfer from liquid-to-skin and skin-to-liquid. We performed human subject studies using three bacteriophages as pathogenic virus surrogates: nonenveloped MS2 and Q beta and enveloped Phi 6. Our study shows that transfer from liquid-to-skin is describable by a single model based on (1) virus concentration and (2) volume of liquid remaining on skin. Contact times (0.1-30 min)) and virus species had little-to-no influence on virus transfer. Likewise, liquid conditions (pH 6-9, ionic strength 10-550 mM) had no influence on transfer as shown for MS2. The model: accounts for both, virus adsorbed onto the skin, and virus in the liquid retained on skin. In comparison, virus transfer from skin-to-liquid was influenced by the wetness of the skin and by liquid type (water, saliva). 90 +/- 19% of the virus inoculated on the skin are transferred to the water when the skin remains wet compared to 30 +/- 17% when the skin is dry. The transfer from skin-to-liquid was 41% higher when the recipient liquid was water as compared with saliva. This study quantifies virus transfer between liquid and skin and guides risk assessments of water-related activities.

Here we investigated the use of microphytobenthos colonizing Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structures (ARMS) to assess the marine environmental quality. We analysed microphytobenthic assemblages in terms of abundance, biomass and species composition on ARMS deployed in northern Adriatic Sea along a gradient of increasing impacts. We show that microphytobenthic variables changed significantly across sites, with lowest abundance and biodiversity in the highly impacted site. Moreover, the specific analysis of Diatoms revealed that genera like Entomoneis and Cylindrotheca could be used as indicators of nutrient enriched and stressed conditions. We provide evidence that the analysis of microphytobenthos colonizing artificial substrates could be used as a tool for detecting altered environmental characteristics. We also show that the ARMS, recreating hot spots of microphytobenthic biodiversity, and protect them from grazing, could be potentially utilized to restore degraded hard substrates. Our result indicates that microphytobenthos can be easily incorporated in future monitoring and restoration programmes to assess and improve marine environmental health.

Effects of suspended sediments and nutrient enrichment on juvenile corals	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Three to six-month-old juveniles of Acropora tennis, A. millepora and Pocillopora acute were experimentally co-exposed to nutrient enrichment and suspended sediments (without light attenuation or sediment deposition) for 40 days. Suspended sediments reduced survivorship of A. millepora strongly, proportional to the sediment concentration, but not in A. tennis or P. acuta juveniles. However, juvenile growth of the latter two species was reduced to less than half or to zero, respectively. Additionally, suspended sediments increased effective quantum yields of symbionts associated with A. millepora and A. tennis, but not those associated with P. acuta. Nutrient enrichment did not significantly affect juvenile survivorship, growth or photophysiology for any of the three species, either as a sole stressor or in combination with suspended sediments. Our results indicate that exposure to suspended sediments can be energetically costly for juveniles of some coral species, implying detrimental longer-term but species-specific repercussions for populations and coral cover.					de Beer, Dirk/0000-0001-5274-1781												0025-326X	1879-3363				DEC 15	2017	125	1-2					166	175		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.08.003								WOS:000418727000031

The surficial sediments were mainly composed of clayey silt and the TOC content in sediments decreased from the river to the shelf. The surficial sediments experienced Pb pollution; Cr only showed a certain level of pollution in the coastal area of the estuary but not in other areas, and Ni, Cu, Zn, and Cd showed no pollution. The heavy metals mainly originated from natural weathering and erosion of rocks and soils in the catchment and enriched near the river mouth. Total organic carbon can promote the enrichment of heavy metals in sediments.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				DEC 15	2017	125	1-2					492	500		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.08.010								WOS:000418727000066	28807422

Some studies showed that DES can be removed by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, However, no one has paid attention to the formation of oestrogenic disinfection by-products (DBPs) and the persistence of DES in surface water remains a mystery. In this study, UV was found to be very effective in removing oestrogenic activity regardless of water quality. Three oestrogenic DBPs were specifically isolated by oestrogen receptor-based affinity chromatography and identified as 9,10-diethylphenanthrene-3,6-diol, cis-DES and Z,Z-dienestrol. Among them, 9,10-diethylphenanthrene-3,6-diol was proved to have stronger oestrogenic activity than E2, but it can be further photodegraded. In addition, DES was also demonstrated to be a photochromic compound, whose UV-induced intermediates can be transformed back to DES under sunlight, which significantly slows down the photodegradation of DES. This study solves the question as to why UV-degradable DES is still detectable in the ambient water and provides a deep understanding of DES removal during UV disinfection.

Riverine discharges to Chesapeake Bay: Analysis of long-term (1927-2014) records and implications for future flows in the Chesapeake Bay basin	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The Chesapeake Bay (CB) basin is under a total maximum daily load (TMDL) mandate to reduce nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment loads to the bay. Identifying shifts in the hydro-climatic regime may help explain observed trends in water quality. To identify potential shifts, hydrologic data (1927-2014) for 27 watersheds in the CB basin were analyzed to determine the relationships among long-term precipitation and stream discharge trends. The amount, frequency, and intensity of precipitation increased from 1910 to 1996 in the eastern U.S., with the observed increases greater in the northeastern U.S. than the southeastern U.S. The CB watershed spans the north-to-south gradient in precipitation increases, and hydrologic differences have been observed in watersheds north relative to watersheds south of the Pennsylvania Maryland (PA-MD) border. Time series of monthly mean precipitation data specific to each of 27 watersheds were derived from the Precipitation-elevation Regression on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) dataset, and monthly mean stream-discharge data were obtained from U.S. Geological Survey streamgage records. All annual precipitation trend slopes in the 18 watersheds north of the PA-MD border were greater than or equal to those of the nine south of that border. The magnitude of the trend slopes for 1927-2014 in both precipitation and discharge decreased in a north-to-south pattern. Distributions of the monthly precipitation and discharge datasets were assembled into percentiles for each year for each watershed. Multivariate correlation of precipitation and discharge within percentiles among the groups of northern and southern watersheds indicated only weak associations. Regional-scale average behaviors of trends in the distribution of precipitation and discharge annual percentiles differed between the northern and southern watersheds. In general, the linkage between precipitation and discharge was weak, with the linkage weaker in the northern watersheds compared to those in the south. On the basis of simple linear regression, 26 of the 27 watersheds are projected to have higher annual mean discharge in 2025, the target date for implementation of the TMDL for the CB basin.

In this study, selected EDCs were measured in water and sediments along two transboundary streams flowing from the Palestinian Authority (PA) into Israel (the Zomar-Alexander and Hebron-Beer Sheva Streams). We assessed how the complicated conflict situation between Israel and the PA and the absence of a coordinated strategy and joint stream management commission influence effective EDC control. Both streams receive raw Palestinian wastewater in their headwaters, which flows through rural areas and is treated via sediment settling facilities after crossing the 1949 Armistice Agreement Line. Four sampling campaigns were conducted over two years, with concentrations of selected EDCs measured in both the water and the sediments. Results show asymmetrical pollution profiles due to socio-economic differences and contrasting treatment capacities. No in-stream attenuation was observed along the stream and in the sediments within the Palestinian region. After sediment settling in treatment facilities at the Israeli border, however, significant reductions in the EDC concentrations were measured both in the sediments and in the water. Differences in sedimentation technologies had a substantial effect on EDC removal at the treatment location, positively affecting the streams' ability to further remove EDCs downstream. The prevailing approach to addressing the Israeli-Palestinian transboundary wastewater contamination reveals a narrow perspective among water managers who on occasion only take local interests into consideration, with interventions focused solely on improving stream water quality in isolated segments. Application of the "proximity principle" through the establishment of WWTPs at contamination sources constitutes a preferable strategy for reducing contamination by EDCs and other pollutants to ensure minimization of public health risks due to the pollution of streams and underlying potable groundwater.

This study investigates the discharge of PAHs present in the untreated wastewater of vehicle-wash stations (VWS) located in district Peshawar, Pakistan. The data obtained was being novel with the detection of 16 USEPA PAHs (both individuals and total) and compared with earlier studies and international standards. The Sigma 16PAHs in wastewater from light vehicle-wash stations (LVWS) and heavy vehicle-wash stations (HVWS) ranged from 245-429 mu g/l and 9571582 mu g/l, respectively. A significant difference (p < 0.01) was observed in PAHs discharged from LVWS and HVWS. The projected Sigma 16PAHs discharge from both HVWS (92% of total generated PAHs) and LVWS (8%) was about 5109.9 g per annum. According to PAH diagnostic ratios, PAHs were both petrogenic (chrysene/benz(a) anthracene, low molecular weight/high molecular weight) and pyrogenic (phenanthrene/anthracene, fluoranthene/pyrene, fluoranthene/fluoranthene + pyrene) in origin. The highest toxic equivalent quotient (TEQ) value was shown by benzo(a) pyrene (21.6 mu g/l) followed by dibenz(ah) anthracene (9.81 mu g/l) in wastewater from HVWS. However, in LVWS the case was reversed with highest value (7.54 mu g/l) for dibenz(ah) anthracene followed by benzo(a) pyrene (3.54 mu g/l). The lowest TEQ value was indicated for phenanthrene (0.007 mu g/l) in wastewater of LVWS, while pyrene showed the lowest value (0.007 mu g/l) in wastewater of HVWS. The results indicated that VWS contribute significant amount of PAHs each year, which is of great concern regarding water quality, ecological and human health risk. This is the first systematic and comprehensive research related with generation of PAHs load per day, week, month and annum from VWS, their source apportionment and health effects in Pakistan.

Spatial prediction of water quality variables along a main river channel, in presence of pollution hotspots	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												In order to treat and evaluate the available data of water quality and fully exploit monitoring results (e.g. characterize regional patterns, optimize monitoring networks, infer conditions at unmonitored locations, etc.), it is crucial to develop improved and efficientmethodologies. Accordingly, estimation ofwater quality along fluvial ecosystems is a frequent task in environment studies. In this work, a particular case of this problem is examined, namely, the estimation of water quality along a main stem of a large basin (wheremost anthropic activity takes place), fromobservational data measured along this river channel. We adapted topological kriging to this case, where eachwatershed contains all the watersheds of the upstreamobserved data ("nested support effect"). Data analysis was additionally extended by taking into account the upstream distance to the closest contamination hotspot as an external drift. We propose choosing the best estimationmethod by cross- validation. Themethodological approach in spatial variability modeling may be used for optimizing the water quality monitoring of a given watercourse. The methodology presented is applied to 28 water quality variables measured along the Santiago River inWestern Mexico. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

Geochemistry and toxicity of a large slag pile and its drainage complex in Sudbury, Ontario	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Slag piles from mining activities are common worldwide, but in contrast to mine tailings the environmental impact of runoff from slag piles is less documented. This study was designed to assess the geochemistry and potential toxicity of water draining a large, 62.2 ha slag pile in Sudbury, Ontario. The Coniston slag pile contains 1220 Mt of slag from smelting local Ni-Cu ore between 1913 and 1972. Slag leaching experiments confirmed slag is a source of sulphate (SO4), heavy metals (including Fe, Al, Ni, Co, Cu, Zn, Pb, Cr, Mn) and base cations (Ca, K, Mg, Na). Concentrations of some metals draining through slag in column experiments were similar to concentrations measured at the base of the slag pile, although base cations, SO4 and pH were much higher, possibly because of water inputs interacting with the surrounding basic glaciolacustrine landscape. The high pH rapidly precipitates metals, leading to high accumulations in surface sediments in the pond-wetland complex draining from the pile. Away from the pile's base, vegetation cover increases, which increases dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nutrient concentrations in runoff along with metals with strong binding affinities (e.g. Cu). Total metal concentration in water and sediment exceed provincial guidelines, particularly near the slag pile, however WHAM7 modeling indicated the free metal ion concentration in water is very low. Nevertheless, 48-h toxicity experiments showed that water with greater concentrations of solutes collected close to the slag negatively impacts D. magna, suggesting water draining the slag pile can adversely impact biota in nearby drainage areas.

Because organic additives can affect the approval test, the additive selected, and its use and validation should be included in the test report. This study assessed the effects of organic carbon additives on the concentration of total residual oxidants (TROs) and the formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs). The concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in test water containing additives varied depending on the type of additive, but all additives, except for methylcellulose, had concentrations similar to or higher than the theoretical values. There was a low concentration of particulate organic carbon (POC) compared to the amount of corn starch added. Over the course of the five-day holding time, TRO concentrations tended to decrease. In general, substances with a large molecular size had a higher DBP concentration than their counterparts with a smaller molecular size, some of which, however produced the highest DBP concentrations due to their molecular structure. The results suggest that the formation of DBPs is affected by the reaction with TROs, molecular size, and molecular structure in a complex manner. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Robinson, HK; Hasenmueller, EA				Robinson, Heather K.; Hasenmueller, Elizabeth A.			Transport of road salt contamination in karst aquifers and soils over multiple timescales	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Road deicing has caused widespread environmental Na+ and Cl- release for decades, yet the transport and retention of these contaminants in karst aquifers and soils are poorly understood. We examined the transport dynamics of Na+ and Cl- from road salt in shallow groundwater during flooding and over seasonal timescales by intensively monitoring an urban and a rural karst spring over approximately 2 years. Furthermore, we used a 20-year dataset for the rural spring to determine how salt retention affected long-term geochemical trends in the shallowgroundwater. Salt transport was governed by hydrologic pathways through karst aquifers: during winter and early spring floods, flow through preferential pathways rapidly transported salty meltwater or stormwater over hours to days, while the remaining salt-contaminated water moved diffusely through the rock matrix on timescales of months to years. Flood hydrograph separations revealed that event water constituted 61.2% of stormflow on average at the urban spring, leading to more extreme variability in salt concentrations during flooding and throughout the year. This variability indicates that baseflow contributions to urban streams overlying karst aquifers with preferential flowpaths are likely less effective at buffering salt concentrations. In contrast, salt concentrations were less variable in the baseflow-dominated rural spring (28.7% event water). Furthermore, salt was episodically released from soils to shallow groundwater throughout the year during first flush events. A Cl- mass balance indicates that Cl- applied during previous winters persists within the springs' recharge basins for more than a year, raising baseline concentrations as road salt is introduced faster than it can be flushed from the basin. Inter-annual salt retention by soils or slow groundwater movement likely caused significant Cl- and specific conductivity (SpC) increases at the rural spring from 1996 to 2016. Accumulation of salt in shallow groundwater can elevate baseflow concentrations in surface waters, where it threatens aquatic organisms.

The approach involves several pioneering modelling aspects: the inclusion of current management practices; an innovative calibration and validation methodology of streamflow and water quality; a sequential calibration starting from crop yields, followed by streamflow and nutrients; and the use of concentrations instead of loads in the calibration. The approach was applied in the Danube River Basin (800,000 km(2)), the second largest river basin in Europe, that is under great nutrients pressure. The model was successfully calibrated and validated at multiple gauged stations for the period 1995-2009. About 70% and 61% of monthly streamflow stations reached satisfactory performances in the calibration and validation datasets respectively. N-NO3 monthly concentrations were in good agreement with the observations, albeit SWAT could not represent accurately the spatial variability of the denitrification process. TN and TP concentrations were also well captured. Yet, local discrepancies were detected across the Basin. Baseflow and surface runoff were the main pathways of water pollution. The main sinks of TN and TP diffuse emissions were plant uptake which captured 58% of TN and 92% of TP sources, then soil retention (35% of TN and 2% of TP), riparian filter strips (2% both for TN and TP) and river retention (2% of TN and 4% of TP). Nitrates in the aquifer were estimated to be around 3% of TN sources. New reliable "state-of-the-art" knowledge of water and nutrients fluxes in the Danube Basin were thus provided to be used for assessing the impact of best management practices and for providing support to the implementation of the European Environmental Directives.

F.; Jin, Baoshi; Bastviken, David; Tan, Lishan; Tong, Chuan			Dynamics of dissolved nutrients in the aquaculture shrimp ponds of the Min River estuary, China: Concentrations, fluxes and environmental loads	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Dissolved inorganic nutrients (NO2--N, NO3--N, NH4+-N, and PO43--P) play a critical role in the effective management ofwater quality and prevention of fish and shrimp diseases in aquaculture systems. In this study, dissolved inorganic nutrient concentrations in the water column and sediment porewater, and the fluxes across the sediment-water interface (SWI) were investigated in three intensive shrimp ponds with zero water exchange to examine nutrient cycling during the different growth stages of shrimps. Distinct changes in the dissolved inorganic nutrient concentrations in both the water column and sediment porewater were observed among the three growth stages. Average NO2--N, NO3--N, NH4+-N, and PO43--P concentrations in the sediment porewater were 3.53, 2.81, 29.68, and 6.44 times higher, respectively, than those in the water column over the study period, indicating that the pond sediment acted as a net source of nutrients to the water column. This was further supported by the net release of nutrients from the sediments to the water column observed during the incubation experiment. Nutrient fluxes were dominated by NH4+-N, while NOx--N (NO2--N and NO3--N) and PO43--P fluxes remained low. The high rates of NH4+-N release from the sediment highlight the need of taking into account the biogeochemical role of sediments in mitigating the problem of water quality degradation in coastal shrimp ponds. Based on a total water surface area of mariculture ponds and a total mariculture production of 2.57 x 10(6) ha and 2.30 x 10(9) kg, respectively, we estimated conservatively that approximately 4.77 x 10(4) tons of total nitrogen and 3.75 x 10(3) tons of total phosphorus are being discharged annually from the mariculture ponds into the adjacent coastal zones across China. Results demonstrated the importance of aquaculture pond effluent as amajor contributor ofwater pollution in the coastal areas of China, and called for actions to properly treat these effluents in alleviating the eutrophication problem in the Chinese coastal zones.

J	Wang, WH; Chen, M; Guo, LD; Wang, WX				Wang, Wenhao; Chen, Min; Guo, Laodong; Wang, Wen-Xiong			Size partitioning and mixing behavior of trace metals and dissolved organic matter in a South China estuary	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The Jiulong River estuary, located in the southeastern China, suffered from metal pollution due to industrial effluent releases. Mixing of effluent and estuarine water may have significantly affected the size distribution of trace metals and their environmental fate. In the present study, colloidal size distribution of organic matter and selected metals were quantified using asymmetric flow field-flowfractionation (AF4) and ICP-MS. We demonstrated a dominance of dissolved metals in the 1-10 kDa fraction, and metals such as Cu, Zn, Ni, Co, Pb, Cd and Mn were mostly regulated by terrestrial fulvic acid. The larger inorganic colloids played a limited role, although Fe reduction was likely to affect the size partitioning of colloidal Mn. The holding pond represented a source of trace metals and chromophoric and humic-like dissolved organic matter to the estuary. Scavenging or removal behavior became evident following the intermittent mixing, and the small sized colloidal organic complexes were responsible for binding and stabilizing trace metals. Variations in particle size distributions indicated different sources, fates and geochemical controls of the metals. Our results highlighted the impacts of both natural and anthropogenic processes on the transformation of trace metals among phases in this dynamic estuary system. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Land use affects total dissolved nitrogen and nitrate concentrations in tropical montane streams in Kenya	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												African tropical montane forests are facing fast and dynamic changes in land use. However, the impacts of these changes on stream water quality are understudied. This paper aims at assessing the effect of land use and physical catchment characteristics on stream water concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), nitrate (NO3-N) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in the Mau Forest, the largest tropical montane forest in Kenya. We conducted five synoptic stream water sampling campaigns at the outlets of 13-16 catchments dominated by either natural forest, smallholder agriculture or commercial tea and tree plantations. Our data show a strong effect of land use on TDN and NO3-N, with highest concentrations in stream water of catchments dominated by tea plantations (1.80 +/- 0.50 and 1.62 +/- 0.60 mg N l(-1), respectively), and lowest values in forested catchments (0.55 +/- 0.15 and 0.30 +/- 0.08 mg N l(-1), respectively). NO3-N concentration increased with stream temperature and specific discharge, but decreased with increasing catchment area. DOC concentrations increased with catchment area and precipitation and decreased with specific discharge, drainage density and topographic wetness index. Precipitation and specific discharge were also strong predictors for DON concentrations, with an additional small positive effect of tree cover. In summary, land use affects TDN and NO3-N concentrations in stream water in the Mau Forest region in Kenya, while DOC and DON were more related to hydrologic regimes and catchment properties. The importance of land use for NO3-N and TDN concentrations emphasizes the risk of increased nitrogen export along hydrological pathways caused by intensified land use and conversion of land to agricultural uses, which might result in deterioration of drinking water quality and eutrophication in surface water in tropical Africa.

Predicting improved optical water quality in rivers resulting from soil conservation actions on land	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Deforestation in New Zealand has led to increased soil erosion and sediment loads in rivers. Increased suspended fine sediment in water reduces visual clarity for humans and aquatic animals and reduces penetration of photosynthetically available radiation to aquatic plants. To mitigate fine-sediment impacts in rivers, catchment-wide approaches to reducing soil erosion are required. Targeting soil conservation for reducing sediment loads in rivers is possible through existing models; however, relationships between sediment loads and sediment-related attributes of water that affect both ecology and human uses of water are poorly understood. We present methods for relating sediment loads to sediment concentration, visual clarity, and euphotic depth. The methods require upwards of twenty concurrent samples of sediment concentration, visual clarity, and euphotic depth at a river site where discharge is measured continuously. The sediment-related attributes are related to sediment concentration through regressions. When sediment loads are reduced by soil conservation action, percentiles of sediment concentration are necessarily reduced, and the corresponding percentiles of visual clarity and euphotic depth are increased. The approach is demonstrated on theWairua River in the Northland region of New Zealand. For this river we show that visual clarity would increase relatively by approximately 1.4 times the relative reduction of sediment load. Median visual clarity would increase from 0.75m to 1.25m( making the river more often suitable for swimming) after a sediment load reduction of 50% associated with widespread soil conservation on pastoral land. Likewise euphotic depth would increase relatively by approximately 0.7 times the relative reduction of sediment load, and the median euphotic depth would increase from 1.5 m to 2.0 m with a 50% sediment load reduction.

Combined effects of water stress and pollution on macroinvertebrate and fish assemblages in a Mediterranean intermittent river	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Water stress is a key stressor in Mediterranean intermittent rivers exacerbating the negative effects of other stressors, such as pollutants, with multiple effects on different river biota. The current study aimed to determine the response of macroinvertebrate and fish assemblages to instream habitat and water chemistry, at the microhabitat scale and at different levels of water stress and pollution, in an intermittent Mediterranean river. Sampling was conducted at high and low summer discharge, at two consecutive years, and included four reaches that were targeted for their different levels of water stress and pollution. Overall, the macroinvertebrate fauna of Evrotas River indicated high resilience to intermittency, however, variation in community structure and composition occurred under acute water stress, due to habitat alteration and change in water physico-chemistry, i.e. water temperature increase. The combined effects of pollution and high water stress had, however, pronounced effects on species richness, abundance and community structure in the pollution impacted reach, where pollution sensitive taxa were almost extirpated. Fish response to drought, in reaches free of pollution, consisted of an increase in the abundance of the two small limnophilic species, coupled with their shift to faster flowing riffle habitats, and a reduction in the abundance of the larger, rheophilic species. In the pollution impacted reach, however, the combination of pollution and high water stress led to hypoxic conditions assumed to be the leading cause of the almost complete elimination of the fish assemblage. In contrast, the perennial Evrotas reaches with relatively stable physicochemical conditions, though affected hydrologically by drought, appear to function as refugia for fish during high water stress. When comparing the response of the two biotic groups to combined acute water stress and pollution, it is evident that macroinvertebrates were negatively impacted, but fish were virtually eliminated under the two combined stressors.

The objectives of the study are (1) assess the present status and spatial distribution of the nitrate contamination (2) identify and distinguish themost likely sources of nitrate, (3) identify the relationship between H-3 and NO3- and F-, and (4) ascertain the potential human risk from exposure to nitrate contamination. The results showed that, nitrate concentrations varied from 0.42 to 431.17, 0.83 to 143.94, 0.03 to 28.94 mg/l with mean values of 36.09, 21.54 and 5.01 mg/l for boreholes, hand dug wells and the surface water respectively. These values showed that, about 95% of boreholes and hand dugwells and 45% of the surface water have nitrate concentration above the baseline value in the area. The NO3-/Cl- ratio showed that, 98.4%, 95% and 64% of the NO3- in the borehole, hand dugwells and the surfacewater are fromanthropogenic activities. The delta N-15, delta O-18-NO3 and H-3- data confirmed that NO3- in the samples was predominantly derived from manure (human and animal waste) and denitrification occurring in some areas. The isotopic data further affirms the hydro- chemical interpretation that, chemical fertilizer and atmospheric deposition are unlikely sources of NO3 in the area. The relationship between H-3 andNO(3)(-) concentrations showed that, higher NO3- values are associated with younger waters.

The monitoring data of water quality in a long-term(19902013) from Dianchi Lake confirmed the increase trend of COD concentration in the lake since 2007. The similarities and differences in the DOC components between the lake and its sources and the contribution from allochthonous and autochthonous DOC to the total DOC in this lake were determined to elucidate the reason of COD increase based on C/N atomic ratios, stable isotope abundance of carbon and nitrogen, UV-visible spectroscopy, three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix (3DEEM) fluorescence spectroscopy. The terrigenous organic matter showed humic-like fluorescence, and the autochthonous organicmatter showed tryptophan-like components. Agricultural runoff (9.5%), leaf litter (7.5%) and urban runoff (13.2%) were themain sources of DOC in the lake. Sewage tail was a major source of organic materials, 3DEEM for the indicates that sewage tail DOC composition did not change markedly over the biodegradation period, indicating that sewage tail contains a high load of DOC that is resistant to further biodegradation and subsequently accumulates in the lake. The change of land use in the catchment and the increase of sewage tail load into the lake are the key factors for the increase in COD concentration in Dianchi Lake. Thus, the lake should be protected by controlling the pollution from the urban nonpoint sources and refractory composition in point sources. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Vitro, KA; BenDor, TK; Jordanova, TV; Miles, B				Vitro, Kristen A.; BenDor, Todd K.; Jordanova, Tania V.; Miles, Brian			A geospatial analysis of land use and stormwater management on fecal coliform contamination in North Carolina streams	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Although non-point source (NPS) pathogen pollution is a leading cause of stream impairment in the United States, the sources of NPS pollution are often difficult to ascertain. While previous studies have employed land use regression methods to develop a greater understanding of the sources and dynamics of microbial NPS pollution, little work has explicitly considered the effects of local, state, and federal stormwater management policies on water quality across multiple watersheds or at larger spatial scales. How do land use and stormwater management efforts collectively influence fecal coliform (FC) levels at a regional or multiple-watershed scale? We construct a unique spatial regression model of stream FC pollution (n = 327 monitoring stations) throughout the state of North Carolina (USA), incorporating both land cover and urban development variables. We then use a subset of our data (n(bmp) = 80 monitoring stations) to incorporate local stormwater control measures and stormwater management policies. Results demonstrate that the inclusion of policy and management variables improves the explanatory capacity for FC levels (R-2 = 0.4412 versus R-2 = 0.5323). Locally, this model can be used to better target stream restoration and water quality mitigation actions and investments, as well as help to predict FC levels at unmonitored locations throughout North Carolina's stream network. More generally, the novel structure of this model can also help examine the large-scale effects of stormwater regulations on surface water pathogen levels, helping researchers and planners better predict water quality in the absence of extensive monitoring station data.

High resolution stream water quality assessment in the Vancouver, British Columbia region: a citizen science study	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Changing land cover and climate regimes modify water quantity and quality in natural stream systems. In regions undergoing rapid change, it is difficult to effectively monitor and quantify these impacts at local to regional scales. In Vancouver, British Columbia, one of the most rapidly urbanizing areas in Canada, 750 measurements were taken from a total of 81 unique sampling sites representing 49 streams located in urban, forest, and agricultural-dominant watersheds at a frequency of up to 12 times per year between 2013 and 2016. Dissolved nitrate (NO3N) and phosphate (PO4-P) concentrations, turbidity, water temperature, pH and conductivity were measured by citizen scientists in addition to observations of hydrology, vegetation, land use, and visible stream impacts. Land cover was mapped at a 15-mresolution using Landsat 8 OLI imagery and used to determine dominant land cover for each watershed in which a sample was recorded. Regional, seasonal, and catchment-type trends in measurements were determined using statistical analyses. The relationships of nutrients to land cover varied seasonally and on a catchment-type basis. Nitrate showed seasonal highs in winter and lows in summer, though phosphate had less seasonal variation. Overall, nitrate concentrations were positively associated to agriculture and deciduous forest and negatively associated with coniferous forest. In contrast, phosphate concentrations were positively associated with agricultural, deciduous forest, and disturbed land cover and negatively associated with urban land cover. Both urban and agricultural land cover were significantly associated with an increase in water conductivity. Increased forest land cover was associated with better water quality, including lower turbidity, conductivity, and water temperature. This study showed the importance of high resolution sampling in understanding seasonal and spatial dynamics of stream water quality, made possible with the large number of measurements taken with the help of trained volunteers. The results underscore the value of citizen science in freshwater research. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A facility location model for municipal solid waste management system under uncertain environment	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												In municipal solid waste management system, decision makers have to develop an insight into the processes namely, waste generation, collection, transportation, processing, and disposal methods. Many parameters (e.g., waste generation rate, functioning costs of facilities, transportation cost, and revenues) in this system are associated with uncertainties. Often, these uncertainties of parameters need to be modeled under a situation of data scarcity for generating probability distribution function or membership function for stochastic mathematical programming or fuzzy mathematical programming respectively, with only information of extreme variations. Moreover, if uncertainties are ignored, then the problems like insufficient capacities of waste management facilities or improper utilization of available funds may be raised. To tackle uncertainties of these parameters in a more efficient manner an algorithm, based on interval analysis, has been developed. This algorithm is applied to find optimal solutions for a facility location model, which is formulated to select economically best locations of transfer stations in a hypothetical urban center. Transfer stations are an integral part of contemporary municipal solid waste management systems, and economic siting of transfer stations ensures financial sustainability of this system. The model is written in a mathematical programming language AMPL with KNITRO as a solver. The developed model selects five economically best locations out of ten potential locations with an optimum overall cost of [394,836, 757,440] Rs.(1) / day ([5906, 11,331] USD/day) approximately. Further, the requirement of uncertainty modeling is explained based on the results of sensitivity analysis. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Fluorescence and Quenching Assessment (EEM-PARAFAC) of de Facto Potable Reuse in the Neuse River, North Carolina, United States	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The Neuse River, North Carolina, U.S., exemplifies a typical de facto potable reuse scenario, where drinking water sources are located downstream of treated wastewater effluent discharges. The study results imply that planned potable water reuse, whether in an indirect or direct potable reuse scenario, might provide better control over water quality than the status quo conditions. Using fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) measurements, anthropo-genic influence of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) discharge was observed in samples near the location of drinking water treatment plant (WTP) intakes, eight or more miles downstream of the WWTP, implying that anthropogenic compounds were not fully removed or degraded by natural processes in this reach of the river. PARAllel FACtor (PARAFAC) analysis supported a two-component model of humic-like and nonhumic-like dissolved organic matter (DOM). A nonmodeled anthropogenic feature was also indicated. Significantly, the quenched fluorescence of humic-like DOM (static and/or dynamic quenching) by nonhumic-like DOM-previously demonstrated for probe molecules but first reported here in a natural/anthropogenic-influenced system-offers exciting insight into studies of humic/nonhumic interactions with important implications for pollutant fate and transport, sensing applications, and water treatment. A molecular spectroscopic explanation for dual fluorescing peaks in amino acids and humic substances is postulated.

Monitoring water quality and quantity is essential as the groundwater is the most important drinkable and agricultural water source in Iran. Traditional groundwater evaluation methods are expensive and time consuming. Newly developed spatial interpolation method is an accurate and non-expensive method which needs fewer samples comparing to tradition methods. The main goal of this study is to choose the best spatial interpolation methods from geostatistical and deterministic interpolation for zoning (locating) of some water quality parameters in Najafabad plain. Several Spatial methods such as. were applied to study TDS, SAR, pH, cl and hco3. The accuracy and efficiency of studied methods were evaluated applying RMSE and MBE. Results showed that simple kiriging is suitable for zoning cl, hco3, TDS and Ec, IDW is more suitable for pH and ordinary kiriging is best method for zoning SAR. Finally the best spatial interpolation method was applied to develop quality parameter zoning maps.																	2363-6203	2363-6211				DEC	2017	3	4					1441	1448		10.1007/s40808-017-0355-3								WOS:000432245800017

Seven (7) water samples were collected which consist of three (3) hand dug wells and four (4) from different river locations beside the dumpsite. Ten (10) soil samples were collected at B horizon in and away from the dumpsite at a random interval. Ten (10) vertical electrical resistivity (VES) stations were established using schlumberger configuration with half-current electrode spacing that ranged from 1 to 150 m while dipole-dipole profiling was carried-out along four (4) profiles. The physico-chemical result shows that the total dissolved solid (TDS) of the three well samples ranges between 785 and 21,600 mg/L. While the TDS for the river samples was between 2030 and 2050 mg/L, both the upper and lower limit of the TDS were above the Nigerian Standard for Drinking Water Quality (NSDWQ 2007) and World Health Organization (WHO 2008) maximum permissible standard. The electrical conductivity (EC) of both well and river samples ranges from 1200 to 3650 mu/cm and 34,200 to 34,350 mu/cm respectively was also above the maximum permissible standard. The elemental concentration of Pb, Fe, Cd and K in the soil samples located within the dumpsite are higher than those of the control point which indicate pollution. The VES interpreted result delineated three subsurface layers comprising, the topsoil, weathered layer and fresh basement. While the dipole-dipole results shows that the topsoil and weathered layer has been virtually merged with characteristic low resistivity of <5 Om, which is attributed to leachate infiltration in and around the zones of the dumpsite. The extent of leachate migration was estimated to be >25 m. The leachate seeped to the bottom in vertical motion as seen in the dumpsite. This could be as a result of the relative permeability of the overburden, possible linear features and the downward sloping of the bedrock topography towards the dumpsite. At the southern part of the dumpsite, the leachate is inferred to migrate laterally, which could imply that the neighboring rocks are relatively porous and permeable. This migration is considered slow because there was no trace of contamination 200 m away from the dumpsite. It could be concluded that the soil and water in the vicinity of the investigated dumpsite has been polluted.																	2363-6203	2363-6211				DEC	2017	3	4					1543	1555		10.1007/s40808-017-0381-1								WOS:000432245800025

The area between the Koycegiz Lake and the sea is covered with four small lakes and numerous canals. The Dalyan Channel network connects lake to the Mediterranean Sea is one of the most important reproduction areas for Mediterranean Sea turtles. The objectives of the present study are to evaluate the influence of channel traffic and Koycegiz Lake on the water quality of Dalyan Channel by evaluating historical water quality data from 2007 to 2011 at three monitoring sites; two located at Dalyan Channel and one in Koycegiz Lake. Specific objectives are to perform trend analysis for; (i) concentration trends; (ii) load estimation (mass of pollutants delivered); (iii) TN: TP Ratio (trophic status trends); (iv) TSI (eutrophication trends); and (v) the WQI (environmental quality trends) for Koycegiz Lake. Results showed that TSI (trophic state index) values of both SD (secchi depth) and TP (total phosphate) remained within the range of eutrophic category for the lake from 2007 to 2011. The calculated TN/TP ratios suggest that Koycegiz Lake can be considered to be P limited with a few exceptions. The lake has poor water quality index (POOR WQI) between 2007 and 2011. This is mainly due to land-based fish farm located on Yuvarlakcay Creek which born within the Koycegiz-Dalyan SEPA and drains directly into Koycegiz Lake. In addition to change in water quality class of the creek before and after fish farming, TP concentration incidence also increased after fish farming from 2008 to 2011. This study also revealed that activities like touristic boat trips performed in Dalyan Channel didn't significantly affect the water quality class of channel in terms of NO2-N, TP concentrations and the number of total coliforms.																	1582-9596	1843-3707				DEC	2017	16	12					2755	2765										WOS:000423792300010

Flooding is one particularly deadly example of its amplifying and expanding effect on public health. This systematic review considered evidence linking green building strategies in the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (R) (LEED) Rating System with the potential to reduce negative health outcomes following exposure to urban flooding events. Queries evaluated links between LEED credit requirements and risk of exposure to urban flooding, environmental determinants of health, co-benefits to public health outcomes, and co-benefits to built environment outcomes. Public health co-benefits to leveraging green building design to enhance flooding resilience included: improving the interface between humans and wildlife and reducing the risk of waterborne disease, flood-related morbidity and mortality, and psychological harm.

Environmental Factors Correlated with Culturable Enterococci Concentrations in Tropical Recreational Waters: A Case Study in Escambron Beach, San Juan, Puerto Rico	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH												Enterococci concentration variability at Escambron Beach, San Juan, Puerto Rico, was examined in the context of environmental conditions observed during 2005-2015. Satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST), turbidity, direct normal irradiance, and dew point were combined with local precipitation, winds, and mean sea level (MSL) observations in a stepwise multiple regression analyses (Akaike Information Criteria model selection). Precipitation, MSL, irradiance, SST, and turbidity explained 20% of the variation in observed enterococci concentrations based upon these analyses. Changes in these parameters preceded increases in enterococci concentrations by 24 h up to 11 days, particularly during positive anomalies of turbidity, SST, and 480-960 mm of accumulated (4 days) precipitation, which relates to bacterial ecology. Weaker, yet still significant, increases in enterococci concentrations were also observed during positive dew point anomalies. Enterococci concentrations decreased with elevated irradiance and MSL anomalies. Unsafe enterococci concentrations per US EPA recreational water quality guidelines occurred when 4-day cumulative precipitation ranged 481-960 mm; irradiance < 667 W.m(2); daily average turbidity anomaly > 0.005 sr(-1);SST anomaly > 0.8 degrees C; and 3-day average MSL anomaly < -18.8 cm.

Comprehensive performance evaluations were carried out for hydrological and nutrient simulation using the HSPF model in the Xitiaoxi watershed in China. Streamflow simulation was calibrated from 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2007 and then validated from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2010 using daily observed data, and nutrient simulation was calibrated and validated using monthly observed data during the period from July 2009 to July 2010. These results of model performance evaluation showed that the streamflows were well simulated over the study period. The determination coefficient (R-2) was 0.87, 0.77 and 0.63, and the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency (Ens) was 0.82, 0.76 and 0.65 for the streamflow simulation in annual, monthly and daily time-steps, respectively. Although limited to monthly observed data, satisfactory performance was still achieved during the quantitative evaluation for nutrients. The R-2 was 0.73, 0.82 and 0.92, and the Ens was 0.67, 0.74 and 0.86 for nitrate, ammonium and orthophosphate simulation, respectively. Some issues may affect the application of HSPF were also discussed, such as input data quality, parameter values, etc. Overall, the HSPF model can be successfully used to describe streamflow and nutrients transport in the mesoscale watershed located in the East Asian monsoon climate area.

This study investigated 168 small-scale pig farms and 29 example pig farms in Yujiang County of China to examine current and potential impacts of pig wastes on soil, water and crop qualities in the hilly red soil region, China. The results indicated that the small-scale pig farms produced considerable annual yields of wastes, with medians of 216, 333 and 773 ton yr(-1) per pig farm for manure, urine and washing wastewater, respectively, which has had significant impact on surface water quality. Taking NH4+-N, total nitrogen (TN) or total phosphorus (TP) as a criterion to judge water quality, the proportions of Class III and below Class III waters in the local surface waters were 66.2%, 78.7% and 72.5%. The well water (shallow groundwater) quality near these pig farms met the water quality standards by a wide margin. The annual output of pollutants from pig farms was the most important factor correlated with the nutrients and heavy metals in soils, and the relationship can be described by a linear equation. The impact on croplands was marked by the excessive accumulation of available phosphorus and heavy metals such as Cu and Zn. For crop safety, the over-limit ratio of Zn in vegetable samples reached 60%, other heavy metals in vegetable and rice samples tested met the food safety standard at present.																	1660-4601					DEC	2017	14	12							1524	10.3390/ijerph14121524								WOS:000423699400087	29211053

Anthropogenic Phosphorus Inputs to a River Basin and Their Impacts on Phosphorus Fluxes Along Its Upstream-Downstream Continuum	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												The increasing trend in riverine phosphorus (P) loads resulting from anthropogenic inputs has gained wide attention because of the well-known role of P in eutrophication. So far, however, there is still limited scientific understanding of anthropogenic P inputs and their impacts on riverine flux in river reaches along the upstream-to-downstream continuum. Here we investigated P budgets in a series of nested watersheds draining into Hongze Lake of China and developed an empirical function to describe the relationship between anthropogenic inputs and riverine P fluxes. Our results indicated that there are obvious gradients regarding P budgets in response to changes in human activities. Fertilizer application and food and feed P import was always the dominant source of P inputs in all sections, followed by nonfood P. Further interpretation using the model revealed the processes of P loading to the lake. About 2%-9% of anthropogenic P inputs are transported from the various sections into the corresponding tributaries of the river systems, depending upon local precipitation rates. Of this amount, around 41%-95% is delivered to the main stem of the Huai River after in-stream attenuation in its tributaries. Ultimately, 55%-86% of the P loads delivered to different locations of the main stem are transported into the receiving lake of the downstream, due to additional losses in the main stem. An integrated P management strategy that considers the gradients of P loss along the upstream-to-downstream continuum is required to assess and optimize P management to protect the region's freshwater resource.					zhang, wangshou/0000-0001-9473-4555												2169-8953	2169-8961				DEC	2017	122	12					3273	3287		10.1002/2017JG004004								WOS:000423221300011

We investigate the hydrologic impacts of 122 ARs that occurred in the Salt and Verde river basins in northeastern Arizona during the cold seasons from 1979 to 2009. We focus on the relationship between precipitation, snow water equivalent (SWE), soil moisture, and extreme flooding. During the cold season (October through March) ARs contribute an average of 25%/29% of total seasonal precipitation for the Salt/Verde river basins, respectively. However, they contribute disproportionately to total heavy precipitation and account for 64%/72% of extreme total daily precipitation (exceeding the 98th percentile). Excess precipitation during AR occurrences contributes to snow accumulation; on the other hand, warmer than normal temperatures during AR landfallings are linked to rain-on-snow processes, an increase in the basins' area contributing to runoff generation, and higher melting lines. Although not all AR events are linked to extreme flooding in the basins, they do account for larger runoff coefficients. On average, ARs generate 43% of the annual maximum flows for the period studied, with 25% of the events exceeding the 10 year return period. Our analysis shows that the devastating 1993 flooding event in the region was caused by AR events. These results illustrate the importance of AR activity on the hydrology of inland semiarid regions: ARs are critical for water resources, but they can also lead to extreme flooding that affects infrastructure and human activities. Plain Language Summary Within the Salt and Verde River basins in the semiarid northeastern Arizona, natural ecosystems and humans compete for over-allocated water resources. The basins are highly dependent on winter precipitation for ecosystem functioning, water supply, fire suppression, and in the case of extreme events, for water quality, flood control and dam safety. Atmospheric Rivers (ARs) are narrow corridors of concentrated water vapor that bring copious amount of rainfall from the Pacific into the region and contribute to its hydrology by increasing snow pack and replenishing soil moisture in the basins. ARs are also responsible for extreme precipitation and streamflow events, such as the 1993 flooding event, which caused human casualties and economic losses. These results illustrate the importance of AR activity on the hydrology of inland semiarid regions: ARs are critical for maintaining natural ecosystem health, but they can also lead to extreme flooding that affects infrastructure and human activities.

Respondents are asked to rate eight photographs that depict varying algae conditions. Our initial results show that Utah resident preferences for benthic algae levels are quite similar to those of Montana residents, thus replicating the Montana study. For the full Utah sample, though, Cronbach's a indicated poor internal consistency in rating the photographs, so a "monotonicity rule'' was used to identify respondents providing monotonic preferences with respect to chlorophyll a densities. Simple graphical analyses are combined with ordered probit analysis to determine the maximum desirable density of chlorophyll a (Chl a). Our analysis indicates that Chl a levels in excess of 150 mg Chl a/m(2) are undesirable, but the regression model suggests that those with strictly monotonic preferences were far more likely favor a more stringent standard. Plain Language Summary Excess nutrients in water can cause eutrophication, a potentially undesirable condition that fosters the growth of nuisance algae. Unlike many other water quality problems, excess algae are easily discerned by those who recreate at streams, rivers, and lakes. EPA has recently tasked state water quality agencies with establishing a numeric criterion for excess nutrients. Some agencies have used public opinion surveys to gauge aesthetic preferences for algae when developing a chlorophyll a-based criterion. This approach implicitly assumes that (1) chlorophyll a densities closely correspond to the quantity and type of benthic algae and (2) preferences for algae are strictly monotonic, i.e., less algae are preferred to more algae. We scientifically replicate a Montana study and find that preferences of Utah residents demonstrate a remarkable similarity to those of Montana residents. However, responses for a significant proportion of the sample were not monotonic. Hence, the water quality criterion implied by survey data may be sensitive to the assumption of monotonicity. Multiple preferred criteria may emerge, each differing according to how researchers treat the monotonicity assumption. We find that respondents whose preferences for chlorophyll a are strongly monotonic are more likely to favor a more stringent criterion.

Estimating Discharge and Nonpoint Source Nitrate Loading to Streams From Three End-Member Pathways Using High-Frequency Water Quality Data	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The myriad hydrologic and biogeochemical processes taking place in watersheds occurring across space and time are integrated and reflected in the quantity and quality of water in streams and rivers. Collection of high-frequency water quality data with sensors in surface waters provides new opportunities to disentangle these processes and quantify sources and transport of water and solutes in the coupled groundwater-surface water system. A new approach for separating the streamflow hydrograph into three components was developed and coupled with high-frequency nitrate data to estimate time-variable nitrate loads from chemically dilute quick flow, chemically concentrated quick flow, and slowflow groundwater end-member pathways for periods of up to 2 years in a groundwater-dominated and a quick-flow-dominated stream in central Wisconsin, using only streamflow and in-stream water quality data. The dilute and concentrated quick flow end-members were distinguished using high-frequency specific conductance data. Results indicate that dilute quick flow contributed less than 5% of the nitrate load at both sites, whereas 8968% of the nitrate load at the groundwater-dominated stream was from slowflow groundwater, and 84625% of the nitrate load at the quick-flow-dominated stream was from concentrated quick flow. Concentrated quick flow nitrate concentrations varied seasonally at both sites, with peak concentrations in the winter that were 2-3 times greater than minimum concentrations during the growing season. Application of this approach provides an opportunity to assess stream vulnerability to nonpoint source nitrate loading and expected stream responses to current or changing conditions and practices in watersheds. Plain Language Summary The input of nutrients, such as nitrogen, to streams has been identified as contributing to the classification of the ecological condition of 42% of wadeable streams in the United States as "poor.'' Elevated nutrients increase the costs of drinking water treatment, and reduction of nutrient loading is necessary for compliance with environmental regulations in many watersheds. Effective mitigation of the impacts of nutrients on stream ecosystems requires an understanding of where nutrients are coming from; for example, in runoff from farm fields or in groundwater. However, when nutrients are delivered to streams from many different parts of a watershed it is difficult to determine how much of the nutrient load measured in a stream is from a given location. We used water quality data measured at 15 min intervals for a period of 2 years in two streams in central Wisconsin to estimate the amount of nitrogen loading to streams from runoff and different parts of the groundwater system. The approach presented here provides an opportunity to assess stream vulnerability to nutrient loading and expected stream responses to current or changing conditions and practices in watersheds.

Sensitivity of Catchment Transit Times to Rainfall Variability Under Present and Future Climates	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Hydrologists have a relatively good understanding of how rainfall variability shapes the catchment hydrograph, a reflection of the celerity of hydraulic head propagation. Much less is known about the influence of rainfall variability on catchment transit times, a reflection of water velocities that control solute transport. This work uses catchment-scale lumped parameter models to decompose the relationship between rainfall variability and an important metric of transit times, the time-varying fraction of young water (<90 days old) in streams (FYW). A coupled rainfall-runoff model and rank StorAge Selection (rSAS) transit time model were calibrated to extensive hydrometric and environmental tracer data from neighboring headwater catchments in Plynlimon, Wales from 1999 to 2008. At both sites, the mean annual FYW increased more than 13 percentage points from the driest to the wettest year. Yearly mean rainfall explained most between-year variation, but certain signatures of rainfall pattern were also associated with higher FYW including: more clustered storms, more negatively skewed storms, and higher covariance between daily rainfall and discharge. We show that these signatures are symptomatic of an "inverse storage effect'' that may be common among watersheds. Looking to the future, changes in rainfall due to projected climate change caused an up to 19 percentage point increase in simulated mean winter FYW and similarly large decreases in the mean summer FYW. Thus, climate change could seasonally alter the ages of water in streams at these sites, with concomitant impacts on water quality. Plain Language Summary Scientists use information about the age of water in streams to help diagnose the source of water and what pollution it may carry. Most stream water originates from rain, and its "age'' is the time that has passed since it fell from the sky. "Old'' water tends to seep into the stream from deep underground where it has been stored and filtered for years or even decades. "Young'' water, on the other hand, comes from recent storms and tends to carry pollution from the land surface directly into streams. This study used stream data and computer simulations to understand how the amount of young water in streams changes in response to wet and dry periods at two small streams in Plynlimon, Wales. We show that the proportion of young water is much higher during wet periods and can be surprisingly sensitive to the rainfall pattern. We also show that changes in rainfall due to climate change could significantly increase the proportion of young stream water in winter and decrease it in summer. We conclude that changes in rainfall under present and future climate conditions can significantly alter the age of water in streams and, in turn, the pollution it carries.

Historical and temporal trends of climatic parameters in North East India	GLOBAL NEST JOURNAL												Accessing temporal trend of different meteorological parameters is essential for understanding the local climate changing pattern of a region. Quantitative estimates of the effect of climate change helps in understanding, planning, and management of water resources systems. In this study, monthly meteorological data were collected from 30 stations of north-east (NE) India for 1971-2010 and nonparametric Mann-Kendall (MK) test and Sen slope were employed for detection and quantification of significant temporal trends, respectively. An ESRI ArcGIS toolbar "ArcTrends" was used for the above mentioned tasks. The results obtained for rainfall were of mixed nature and both increasing and decreasing significant trends were found for different stations in different months. Most of the negative trends were found in the months of July-August (monsoon), whereas, more stations showed positive trends in April-May (pre-monsoon), and October-November (post-monsoon), indicating inter-seasonal shifting of rainfall without much change in the annual total. Number of rainy days was found to have positive trends in March-May (pre-monsoon) and negative trends in September-December. Except some positive trends during June-December in Manipur and Meghalaya, there were no significant trends in maximum temperature. In some stations, minimum temperature was found to have significant increasing trends throughout the year indicating a general rising trend in NE India. Some major towns like Guwahati, Imphal, Agartala and Kailashshahar showed significant positive trends in mean temperature, mostly during June-December. Mean relative humidity was, in general, found to be significantly increasing, especially during February-March. In some stations, wind speed was found to have significant negative trends throughout the year, with Agartala being the most affected.

Combination of low-pressure UF membranes with conventional water treatment systems	GLOBAL NEST JOURNAL												The purpose of the study was to improve drinking water quality of conventional treatment processes by combining with UF-membrane systems. Performances of two membrane systems were evaluated in two different full-scale conventional water treatment plants in Istanbul. Low-pressure UF membranes were combined after settling and filtration units of Buyukcekmece and Emirli water treatment plants. Low-pressure UF systems were operated under vacuum and pressure conditions. The experimental results indicated that combining UF systems enhanced drinking water quality with respect to turbidity, TOC and UV254 removal. In all cases, vacuum-driven UF membranes provided higher treatment performance and low energy consumption comparing to pressure-driven system. Combination with UF membranes also reduced disinfection by-products.																	1790-7632					DEC	2017	19	4					584	591										WOS:000422866200004

The importance and widespread use of petroleum products and the threats posed by these products on surface water resources in Iran necessitates the access to numerical hydrodynamic and water quality simulation models with appropriate capabilities. Simulation the fate and transport of VOC in both flowing and standing water bodies is a fairly complex problem. In this research, CE-QUAL-W2 model is modified to simulate the fate and transport of VOC [i.e., Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), benzene] in standing and flowing water bodies. The performance of the modified CE-QUAL-W2 model is evaluated in a MTBE pollution spill at Khalife-Tarkhan river along the headwaters of Gheshlagh reservoir, Kordestan, Iran. The results show the modified CE-QUAL-W2 model's capability to depict the spatial and temporal variation of MTBE in comparison with recorded data from MTBE spill event of Gheshlagh reservoir. Based on the simulation results of modified CE-QUAL-W2 model, reservoir cleanup time in different meteorological and hydrological scenarios is evaluated. The results show Gheshlagh reservoir cleanup time reduced in scenarios that included air temperature reduction, wind speed increasing, and high inflow condition.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				DEC	2017	76	23							803	10.1007/s12665-017-7108-5								WOS:000418850500003

Groundwater vulnerability mapping for a sub-catchment of the Rio La Venta watershed, Chiapas, Mexico	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Karst systems are particularly vulnerable to overexploitation and pollution due to their high hydraulic conductivity and points of rapid infiltration that allow quick influx of runoff and pollutants into the aquifer. The sustainability of non-contaminated groundwater in these systems is imperative for both humans and groundwater-dependent ecosystems. An important practice in managing groundwater sustainability involves assessing aquifer vulnerability. This study created the first groundwater vulnerability map (GVM) for a sub-catchment of the Rio La Venta watershed in Chiapas, Mexico, using an adaptation of the hazard-pathway-target method. This project also conducted the first tracer study in the Rio la Venta watershed to establish connectivity between the catchment and the Rio La Venta Canyon. Finally, this study evaluated the results of the GVM through a sensitivity analysis. Results of the GVM clearly demarcate areas of very high, high, moderate, and low vulnerability within the study area most of which being classified as low vulnerability. The zones of high vulnerability were successfully validated through two dye tracer tests that measured rapid groundwater flow velocities. With the limited resources available to land managers in this area, a problem common in many developing countries, tools that quickly and inexpensively highlight areas that require special protection to help maintain or improve water quality in their watersheds have great utility. Conveying this information to land managers and policymakers can lead to potential changes in current land use practices and allow for the reallocation of resources in support of reducing future negative human-landscape interactions.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				DEC	2017	76	23							797	10.1007/s12665-017-7113-8								WOS:000418850500004

The majority of the population uses groundwater from shallow, rudimentary dug wells and also surface water from the Mapunda River, which crosses the city. The city has very poor systems for collecting domestic sewage and household wastes. The majority of domestic sewage is dumped directly into the Mapunda River or in pit latrines. In this study, the surface water quality and groundwater quality were assessed. In surface water, the low oxygen contents are related to the high temperature (T) in the warm rainy season and with high contents of oxygen-consuming organic pollution and nutrients, as shown by PCA, in both seasons. Anoxic conditions, with negative ORP values (-55.7 mV), are caused by oxygen-consuming organic pollution, added with low flow regime during the dry, cold season. The very low ecological quality of the surface water is also indicated by the high contents of -PO4 and -Cl-t (up to 2.00 and 0.44 mg L-1, respectively). The phosphate contamination is higher in the warm rainy season, due to higher run-off and higher T, as expressed by PCA, both in river water and groundwater. Most groundwater sampling points are contaminated with nitrate (contents up to 132 mg L-1). The pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), alkalinity, -Clt and K, determined in the surface water reflect the anthropic contribution to the river water. The variations in water bulk parameters (T, TDS, alkalinity, ORP, DO) and chemical species are indicative of pollution by diffuse sources (N-species, phosphates). The PCA shows that non-point sources such as the free discharge of household wastewater, intense laundering in the river, agriculture and animal grazing are the main contributors to low water quality, associated with seasonality and low contents of dissolved oxygen due to its consumption by organic matter. The multivariate analysis allows the evaluation of the changes in water quality, in fast-growing cities where the climate has a clear seasonality.

However, performance data for these facilities are generally lacking, particularly at the field scale. This study investigated the runoff quantity regulation and pollutant removal performance of bioswale and rain garden systems from 2014 to 2017. A performance assessment of these facilities demonstrated that anti-seepage rain garden, bioswale-A, and bioswale-B effectively retained inflow volumes by the filter media, reducing runoff volumes by 54.08, 98.25, and 77.65%, respectively, on average, with only two events of overflowing. According to the water quality data in 24 rainfall events, the main pollutant indexes for the new city include total nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand, and the median values for their respective effluent event median concentrations were 1.29 and 40.13 mg/L for anti-seepage rain garden and 1.68 and 74.00 mg/L for bioswale-B systems. The mean values of pollutant removal of the three bioretention systems, except for infiltration rain garden, were 39.8-59.73% (median = 54.32%), 61.06-72.66% (median = 73.47%), and 76.67%-88.16% (median = 80.64%). Meanwhile, outflow volume of water was found to be most influenced by inflow volumes for the bioswales and anti-seepage rain garden. Mass removals were higher than concentrations owing to water volume attenuation. Based on the data of monitored pollution loads, this study estimated the annual pollutant load removal as 75.45 and 90.7% for anti-seepage rain garden and bioswale-B according to the percent of monitoring rainfall depth in total annual precipitation. This study also established the target pollutant service life model on the basis of accumulated annual load and media adsorption capacity. The results of this study will contribute to a greater understanding of the treatment performance of bioretention systems, assisting in the design, operation, and maintenance of them.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				DEC	2017	228	12							468	10.1007/s11270-017-3636-6								WOS:000419533000005

Tracking the Limnoecological History of Lake Hiidenvesi (Southern Finland) Using the Paleolimnological Approach	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												We examined a sediment record from Lake Hiidenvesi in southern Finland using paleolimnological methods to trace its limnoecological history. In our record, beginning from the 1940s, chironomid (Diptera) assemblages shifted from typical boreal taxa towards mesotrophic community assemblages at similar to 1960-1980 CE being finally replaced by eutrophic taxa from the 1990s onward. The diatom (Bacillariophyceae) assemblages reflected relatively nutrient rich conditions throughout the record showing a further increase in eutrophic taxa from the 1970s onward. A chironomid-based reconstruction of late-winter hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen (DO) conditions suggested anoxic conditions already in the 1950s, probably reflecting increased inlake production due to allochthonous nutrient inputs and related increase in biological oxygen consumption. However, the reconstruction also indicated large variability in long-term oxygen conditions that appear typical for the basin. With regard to nutrient status, chironomid- and diatom-based reconstructions of total phosphorus (TP) showed a similar trend throughout the record, although, chironomids indicated a more straightforward eutrophication process in the benthic habitat and seemed to reflect the intensified human activities in the catchment more strongly than diatoms. The DO and TP reconstructions were mostly similar in trends compared to the measured data available since the 1970s/1980s. However, the increase in TP during the most recent years in both reconstructions was not visible in the monitored data. The results of our multiproxy study emphasize the significance of including both epilimnetic and hypolimnetic systems in water quality assessments and provide important long-term limnoecological information that will be useful in the future when setting targets for restoration.

Theoretical and methodological challenges exist in assessing ecological risk of watershed ecosystem that is imposed by natural changes or human activities. To fill this research gap, this research proposes an interdisciplinary and quantitative methodology based on some techniques such as the Procedure for Ecological Tiered Assessment of Risk (PETAR), the Entropy, and the Celluar Automata Markov (CA-Markov). We focused on six vulnerable environmental variables, namely land-use change, water quantity, water quality, gross domestic product (GDP), environmental pollutants, and soil erosion in the Huai River watershed in the Henan Province in order to build multi-dimensional quantitative method. Further, the Coupling Coordination Degree Model is constructed, and the threshold index is also addressed to reflect the limitation of ecological risk. Our results show that the spatio-temperal distribution of the eco-environmental quality has greatly varied across this study area during different time spans. Natural eco-environmental quality has moderately degraded in 70% of this study area (mainly agricultural region), at a prefectural level from 2000 to 2010, and has slightly improved over the agricultural region (<170 m above sea level) during 2010-2015. However, when considering negative stressors from human social system on the natural ecosystem, the extent and distribution of the ecological risk varied across the whole area during 2000-2015. The results show that there was almost 90.40% of this region under the ecological risk, with varying extents over the study time, e.g., Kaifeng, Shangqiu, Xuchang, and Xinyang, with a moderate deterioration in the eco-environmental quality, and Zhengzhou with a slight deterioration in the eco-environmental quality.

J	Romero, JMP; Hallett, SH; Jude, S				Romero, Juan Manuel Ponce; Hallett, Stephen H.; Jude, Simon			Leveraging Big Data Tools and Technologies: Addressing the Challenges of the Water Quality Sector	SUSTAINABILITY												The water utility sector is subject to stringent legislation, seeking to address both the evolution of practices within the chemical/pharmaceutical industry, and the safeguarding of environmental protection, and which is informed by stakeholder views. Growing public environmental awareness is balanced by fair apportionment of liability within-sector. This highly complex and dynamic context poses challenges for water utilities seeking to manage the diverse chemicals arising from disparate sources reaching Wastewater Treatment Plants, including residential, commercial, and industrial points of origin, and diffuse sources including agricultural and hard surface water run-off. Effluents contain broad ranges of organic and inorganic compounds, herbicides, pesticides, phosphorus, pharmaceuticals, and chemicals of emerging concern. These potential pollutants can be in dissolved form, or arise in association with organic matter, the associated risks posing significant environmental challenges. This paper examines how the adoption of new Big Data tools and computational technologies can offer great advantage to the water utility sector in addressing this challenge. Big Data approaches facilitate improved understanding and insight of these challenges, by industry, regulator, and public alike. We discuss how Big Data approaches can be used to improve the outputs of tools currently in use by the water industry, such as SAGIS (Source Apportionment GIS system), helping to reveal new relationships between chemicals, the environment, and human health, and in turn provide better understanding of contaminants in wastewater (origin, pathways, and persistence). We highlight how the sector can draw upon Big Data tools to add value to legacy datasets, such as the Chemicals Investigation Programme in the UK, combined with contemporary data sources, extending the lifespan of data, focusing monitoring strategies, and helping users adapt and plan more efficiently. Despite the relative maturity of the Big Data technology and adoption in many wider sectors, uptake within the water utility sector remains limited to date. By contrast with the extensive range of applications of Big Data in in other sectors, highlight is drawn to how improvements are required to achieve the full potential of this technology in the water utility industry.

To mitigate this problem, we designed 2 sets (southern and northern) of land-based and farm-scale sequential integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) systems in order to reduce water pollution and to diversify and optimize aquaculture products in coastal southern Taiwan. In each system, the 1st pond cultivated milkfish as the main aquaculture product, the 2nd pond cultivated Portuguese oysters as the product to reduce suspended particles, and the 3rd pond cultivated the seaweed Gracilaria sp. as feed and to absorb nutrients. Photosynthetic bacteria (PSB) were added to the southern system in order to reduce nutrients. The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare performance parameters of the compartments and the overall IMTA systems preliminarily. Our results showed that the southern system with the addition of PSB had lower PO4-3-P, slightly higher turbidity, and higher brown algal biomass than the northern system. In the southern system, PO4-3-P and cyanobacteria levels were lowest at the end of the seaweed pond. In the northern system, NO2--N and phytoplankton levels were lowest at the end of the seaweed pond. Turbidity was reduced in the oyster pond and further reduced in the Gracilaria pond in both systems. The high seaweed yield in the northern system indicated substantial nutrient absorption. Advantages and limitations in terms of water purification and aquaculture production of these IMTA systems are evaluated in the present paper.																	2071-1050					DEC	2017	9	12							UNSP 2173	10.3390/su9122173								WOS:000419231500022

Global warming and other environmental changes have favored the success of invasive species, deeply modifying the structure of aquatic communities in large rivers. Some exogenous species could alter trophic interactions within assemblages by increasing the predation risk for potential prey species (top-down effect) and limiting the dynamics of others via resource availability limitation (bottom-up effect). Furthermore, large transboundary rivers are complex aquatic ecosystems that have often been poorly investigated so that data for assessing long-term ecological trends are missing. In this study, we propose an original approach for investigating long-term combined effects of global warming, trophic resource decrease, predation risk, and water quality variations on the trait-based structure of macroinvertebrate and fish assemblages over 26 yr (1985-2011) and 427-km stretch of the river Meuse (France and Belgium). The study of temporal variations in biological, physiological, and ecological traits of macroinvertebrate and fish allowed identifying community trends and distinguishing impacts of environmental perturbations from those induced by biological alterations. We provide evidence, for this large European river, of an increase in water temperature (close to 1 degrees C) and a decrease in phytoplankton biomass (-85%), as well as independent effects of these changes on both invertebrate and fish communities. The reduction of trophic resources in the water column by invasive molluscs has dramatically affected the density of omnivorous fish in favor of invertebrate feeders, while scrapers became the major feeding guild among invertebrates. Macroinvertebrate and fish communities have shifted from large-sized organisms with low fecundity to prolific, small-sized organisms, with early maturity, as a response to increased predation pressure.

Detecting Eutrophication Symptoms in a Subtropical Semi-Arid Coastal Lagoon by Means of Three Different Methods	WETLANDS												Excess supply of nutrients of anthropogenic origin is one of the main drivers of global change that is affecting the ecological function and provision of ecosystem services by coastal wetlands. This study examines the response of a subtropical semi-arid coastal lagoon to anthropogenic nutrient input, through the use and comparison of eutrophication indices and models, and compares the usefulness of such methods to identify eutrophication symptoms. The Lobos Lagoon is located on the eastern coast of the Gulf of California and receives agricultural and urban wastewater discharges. To identify potential eutrophication symptoms, the Trophic IndeX (TRIX), the Arid Zone Coastal Water Quality Index (AZCI) along with the Assessment of Estuarine Trophic Status (ASSETS) model were used. Lobos Lagoon was found to have good environmental condition; however eutrophication symptoms were identified in the zone where untreated urban and agricultural wastewaters are discharged. Results obtained using the three methods were consistent and, thus, their performance can be considered as good and complementary, and can be used to evaluate the extent of eutrophication in subtropical semi-arid coastal lagoons.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				DEC	2017	37	6					1105	1118		10.1007/s13157-017-0944-y								WOS:000419197800010

Accordingly, the monitoring of the groundwater quality based on different tools and methods becomes a necessity. The aim of this study was to apply several approaches to assess the water quality and to define the main hydrochemical process which affect groundwater of the Maritime Djeffara shallow aquifer. In addition to the hydrochemical approach, two multivariate statistical analyses, hierarchical clusters analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA), were carried out to identify the natural and the anthropogenic processes affecting groundwater chemistry. Hydrochemical approach, based on 47 analyzed groundwater samples, shows that most of samples present a sulfate to mixed chloride, with sodi-potassic tendency facies. According to their chemically composition, the HCA revealed three different groups (C1, C2 and C3) according to their electrical conductivity (EC) values: C1 (average EC = 4500 mu S/cm), C2 (average EC = 7040 mu S/cm) and C3 (average EC = 9767 mu S/cm). Furthermore, PCA results show two principal factors account 84.05% of the total variance: (1) F1 represents the natural component, and (2) F2 symbolizes the anthropic component. Moreover, the groundwater quality map of the Maritime Djeffara shows three categories: suitable, doubtful and unsuitable water for irrigation. These different results should be taken to protect water resources in arid and semiarid regions, especially at the alluvial coastal regions. Also, they help to make a suitable planning to manage and protect the groundwater resources.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				DEC	2017	76	24							821	10.1007/s12665-017-7168-6								WOS:000418851700018

Combined hydrochemical, isotopic, and multivariate statistics techniques to assess the effects of discharges from a uranium mine on water quality in neighboring streams	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The Caldas Uranium Mine (CUM), located on the Pocos de Caldas Plateau in the southeastern region of Brazil, is presently undergoing a decommissioning process. The aim of the present investigation is to identify and characterize the effects of acid mine drainage (AMD) originating from the CUM on surface water quality. To achieve these aims, sampling stations were located at two AMD sources: the retention pond at the foot of waste rock pile#4 (WRP#4) and the settling pond that receives effluents from the tailings dam (TD). Ten additional sampling stations were located along watercourses in the vicinity, both downstream and upstream of the mine. Sampling was performed during the rainy and dry seasons in 2010 and 2011. The water analysis detected significant changes in pH, electrical conductivity, F-, Cd, U, Zn, Al, Mn, As, Ca, -SO4 2-, Pb, U-238, Ra-226, Pb-210, Th-232, Ra-228, and Mo in waters downstream of both pond discharge sites. It was demonstrated that the disequilibrium between Ra-226 and U-238 can be used to trace the extent of AMD impacts in nearby streams. Variations in O-18 and H-2 enabled the flow of mining-impacted water to be traced from the ponds to nearby streams. Multivariate analysis yielded a three-factor model: Factor 1 was interpreted as being associated with AMD (from WRP# 4) and Factor 2 with a Ca-Mo relationship associated with the chemical constitution of the ore and with the treatment of tailings wastes in the area (from TD); Factor 3 was interpreted as being associated with the natural influence of geogenic processes on water quality in the area. The results of this study provide a scientific basis for recommending appropriate remedial actions during mine decommissioning.

J	de Souza, MM; Gastaldini, MDC; Pivetta, GG				de Souza, Marielle Medeiros; Cauduro Gastaldini, Maria do Carmo; Pivetta, Glaucia Ghesti			Nonpoint pollution load in river catchments with different anthropic impacts: a case study in Southern Brazil	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Diffuse or nonpoint source (NPS) pollution results in different pollutant concentrations, which depend on river catchments, land use and precipitation events and may vary along a single event. This study aimed to assess NPS pollution loads of organic matter, nutrients, bacteria and heavy metals in four river catchments associated with different types of land use in Southern Brazil. Cluster analysis was used to identify similarities between basins and main component analysis (PCA) to identify the main variables that characterize diffuse pollution in each basin. The use and occupation of the soil were determinant in the formation of the clusters. The basins with rural characteristics formed one group, whereas the basin with urban characteristic generated another group. PCA suggests that changes in the water quality of the catchments in this study can be explained by organic pollutants and farming activities. The Rancho do Amaral catchment, with 55.8% of native forest, displayed the lowest NPS pollution load for all tested parameters. The Alto da Colina catchment, with the largest urban area and largest agricultural land use (50%), showed the highest NPS for all variables in the study, even though it has the smallest area. The differences in pollutant loads can be attributed to the intense degradation processes associated with anthropic activities, such as urbanization, agricultural activity and the discharge of effluents, which are different for each catchment.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				DEC	2017	76	24							833	10.1007/s12665-017-7111-x								WOS:000418851700005						
J	Reisch, CE				Reisch, Chad E.			Potential use of low-cost data loggers for groundwater temperature in a regulatory program for public water supply: impact of measurement frequency at a karst spring	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												A simple low-cost procedure for data collection and evaluation was developed to investigate the utility of continuous data loggers and the impact of measurement frequency on a water-quality monitoring method for use in a regulatory program for public water supply and groundwater under the direct influence of surface water (GWUDI). Data loggers were utilized to continuously measure groundwater temperature, descriptive statistics and the coefficient of variation to demonstrate rapid and significant variations. Temperature data were collected from a karst spring located in the Great Valley section of Pennsylvania and reported on daily and 15-min measurement frequencies. In response to five summer rain events, thermographs constructed with the 15-min measurements indicated rapid large-magnitude temperature variations. The average magnitude of change across the five events was 5.3 degrees C, but the shifts operated on quick timescales; thus, variations were not captured when data were reported on the daily frequency. This resulted in a distorted evaluation on how significant the groundwater temperature variations were, because results were dependent on measurement frequency. The average coefficient of variation percentage for the 15-min datasets was 12%, compared to 3% for the dataset of daily measurements. These findings could have important implications to a public water-supply regulatory program, because the regulatory definition for GWUDI includes those groundwater sources that display rapid and significant variations in water quality. Without high-frequency measurements, one alarming result could be that GWUDI sources, particularly those located in fast-acting hydrogeologic settings, are misevaluated when maximum or minimum water-quality variations are not included in the evaluation. Advancement in science and technology has resulted in data loggers for groundwater temperature that are economical, robust, and easy to install. Thus, their application in regulatory programs should no longer be underutilized, especially in karst spring settings where source construction deficiencies and focused recharge features can result in rain-induced rapid infiltration and waterquality variations on the minute-to-hour timescale.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				DEC	2017	76	24							813	10.1007/s12665-017-7164-x								WOS:000418851700014						
J	Gurevin, C; Erturk, A; Albay, M				Gurevin, Cenk; Erturk, Ali; Albay, Meric			Predicting the effects of sediment based internal nutrient loads on eutrophication in Kucukcekmece Lagoon for rehabilitation planning	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEDIMENT RESEARCH												In deep stratified coastal lagoons, hypoxic waters that result from phytoplankton decomposition in the stratified bottom waters are often associated with eutrophication. Decomposing biomass reaches the bottom sediments and enriches them with nutrients and organic matter. Nutrients trapped in sediments are released with time and promote excessive phytoplankton growth in the surface water. Because eutrophication in lentic ecosystems progresses in a self-fuelling cycle, outflow is the only available process for exporting excess nutrients to recover from eutrophication. Thus, rehabilitation of eutrophic coastal lagoons that have limited seawater interactions is a long term process. The importance of nutrient release from sediments on eutrophication and the delay effect of internal nutrient loading on the rehabilitation of a eutrophic coastal lagoon with limited seawater exchange were analysed in this study. An ecological model that couples the water column and the sediment diagenesis processes, was developed for water quality management purposes. Our findings indicate that the recovery of the Lagoon from eutrophication will be taken decades even in the absence of external nutrient loading. Therefore, we suggest applying rehabilitation strategies that control the nutrient fluxes from sediments for a faster recovery from heavily eutrophic conditions. Land-based nutrient sources must also be controlled because they feed water column and the bottom sediments with nutrients.

J	Cavus, I; Kalin, L; Kara, F				Cavus, Ilkim; Kalin, Latif; Kara, Ferhat			Impacts of urban headwater disturbances on downstream sediment loading where streamside management zones for forest harvesting activities are present downstream	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEDIMENT RESEARCH												Watershed disturbances caused by land use/land cover (LU/LC) change, intensive forestry practices, and other forms of watershed disturbance are known to negatively affect water quality, if best management practices (BMPs) are not present. Disturbances near or around headwaters where BMPs are absent or are inadequate may impact downstream water quality and stream ecology regardless of the presence of downstream BMPs. In this study, the recovery of two small forest-dominated watersheds (W-w and E-w) in Auburn, Alabama, USA, was monitored 6-years after a partial clearcut was done. The streamside management zone (SMZ) in W-w was also partially harvested shortly after the partial clearcut to improve its sediment trapping effectiveness over the long-term. The hydrology and sediment transport in these watersheds were expected to stabilize over this period, however, new disturbances in the headwaters of both watersheds changed the watershed dynamics. Streamflow and sediment load were examined over a 15-month period from February 2014 to May 2015. The clearcut in W-w and E-,(w) and the partially harvested SMZ in W-w seemed to have recovered; however, substantial amount of sediment load were measured across all monitoring sites in both watersheds as a result of upstream disturbances. This study emphasizes the necessity of watershed management as a whole, and the importance of BMP applications within the entire watershed. It also highlights the fact that watershed management and BMP implementation is a dynamic process, thus, strategies and techniques need to be continuously adapted in response to environmental changes.

In the paper the methodology of determining the risk associated with threat to technical infrastructure was considered. The concept was studied on the basis of real operational data from the water treatment plant. The probability of exceeding the individual parameters for WTPI is slightly larger than for WTPII, which means that this water treatment process may cause lack of chemical stability in the water supply network. Operators should anticipate in the process of designing water distribution system, using proper materials, as to ensure an adequate level of safety from the water source to the water recipient. It should be noted that it is necessary to adjust the material of internal installation of water supply networks to the parameters of the water. At present, there are no correlations between the designing step and water parameters. It was concluded that to protect the water supply infrastructure, which belongs to critical infrastructure, water company should put more emphasis on distribution of stable water that has not potentially corrosion properties. Some suggestions were made for the protection of WDS and to ensure safety of system functioning and long-term usability of water pipes.																	2083-4772	2083-4810				DEC	2017	43	4					3	12		10.1515/aep-2017-0043								WOS:000418438200001

Hydro-sedimentary Dynamics of a Drained Agricultural Headwater Catchment: A Nested Monitoring Approach	VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL												Soil erosion and sediment transfer are extensive in lowland agricultural catchments. In these environments, high-frequency datasets of both water discharge and suspended sediment concentrations are often lacking. In particular, the impact of tile drainage networks on sediment fluxes in these catchments is poorly understood. Our research quantified sediment fluxes between 2013 and 2016 at five nested stations including a tile drain outlet across a small (25-km(2)) agricultural catchment (located in the Loire River basin, France) representative of lowland cultivated environments of the middle part of this basin. Sediment fluxes varied from 1 to 38 t km(-2) yr(-1) across the monitored subcatchments. Most of sediment fluxes (79 +/- 9%) were measured during flood events (n = 44), mostly occurring in winter (75%) and spring (20%). Seasonality controlled most of the variations of sediment fluxes. Sediment transfers in tile drains occurred episodically. Flows were measured during 11.4% of the monitoring time. A mean time lag of 80 min was recorded between the peak discharge at the drain outlet and the downstream river station. At the event scale, sediment fluxes exported from the tile drain varied between 1.1 x 10(-4) and 2.5 t km(-2) and remained of the same order of magnitude as those measured at the downstream river station, although the latter were on average 53% lower. Results suggest significant storage of sediment material in the river channel and its export during the most intense flood events. Our research emphasizes the need for continuous monitoring of water and sediment transfers in agricultural catchments equipped with tile drains.																	1539-1663					DEC	2017	16	12								10.2136/vzj2017.05.0113								WOS:000418354300006

Review: Sediment-Related Controls on the Health of the Great Barrier Reef	VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL												Linking terrestrial soil erosion to the degradation of marine ecosystems relies on a long chain of evidence. Here, this chain of evidence is reviewed for Australia's Great Barrier Reef and its catchments. Excessive sediment delivery to the marine environment is one component of an interlinked group of stressors that include coral bleaching, damage by storms, and plagues of crown-of-thorns starfish. Sediment and the pollutants they carry are one of the drivers of marine ecosystem decline and adversely impact recovery following disturbance by other stressors. Significantly, a portion of the N species carried by fine sediment in the freshwater system is released in the marine environment, thereby perturbing marine ecology. Available controls on sediment and pollutant delivery are hillslope erosion rates, gully and streambank erosion rates, sediment deposition rates in sediment sinks including footslopes, floodplains, and water reservoirs, and the application rates of pesticides and fertilizers. By reducing sediment fluxes through the combined strategies of erosion control and deposition enhancement, near- and offshore impacts can be reduced. Gully and streambank erosion are more significant sources of fine sediment than hillslope erosion. Fertilizer and non-fertilizer N and pesticides carried by sediment play an important role in coral reef degradation. A graphic summary of the spatial configuration the sources and sinks is provided to guide the prioritization of interventions. The scale of intervention required to achieve the desired marine outcome is so large that a combined voluntary and regulatory approach is needed.																	1539-1663					DEC	2017	16	12								10.2136/vzj2017.05.0115								WOS:000418354300002

Spatial and Temporal Variation of Water Quality in the Bertam Catchment, Cameron Highlands, Malaysia	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												The spatio-temporal variability of water quality associated with anthropogenic activities was studied for the Bertam River and its main tributaries within the Bertam Catchment, Cameron Highlands, Malaysia. A number of physico-chemical parameters of collected samples were analyzed to evaluate their spatio-temporal variability. Nonparametric statistical analysis showed significant temporal and spatial differences (p<0.05) in most of the parameters across the catchment. Parameters except dissolved oxygen and chemical oxygen demand displayed higher values in rainy season. The higher concentration of total suspended solids was caused by massive soil erosion and sedimentation. Seasonal variations in contaminant concentrations are largely affected by precipitation and anthropogenic influences. Untreated domestic wastewater discharge as well as agricultural runoff significantly influenced the water quality. Poor agricultural practices and development activities at slope areas also affected the water quality within the catchment. The analytical results provided a basis for protection of river environments and ecological restoration in mountainous Bertam Catchment.																	1061-4303	1554-7531				DEC 1	2017	89	12					2088	2102		10.2175/106143017X14839994522740								WOS:000418398800004	28087920

In this study, we investigate the socio-cultural preferences of stakeholders in the Niger Delta to understand how different stakeholder groups value socio-cultural differences. We used a modified, mixed-methods stakeholder engagement approach to capture this information, combining stakeholder workshops and interviews. Community groups, regulators, experts in contaminated land management, and oil exploration operators participated in this study, and our results revealed a general consensus concerning the ranked priority of issues. Top issues included water quality, soil quality for agriculture, food production, and human health and wellbeing. Despite this consensus, differences in how stakeholder groups arrived at their rankings might pose a challenge for policy makers. Other potential barriers to effective policy transfer identified in this study include political and cultural differences, regulatory structure, and corruption. In sum, this study provides insights about the socio-cultural preferences of stakeholders from the Niger Delta; information that could be used by policy makers to contextualise contaminated land management policy transfer.

Reports on health concerns and possible migration of chemicals from the plastic material into the water have driven the current investigation. This study aims to address the extent of antimony (Sb) leaching from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) water bottles subject to temperature variations (24-50 degrees C) due to Qatar's hot climate and improper storage conditions. A representative basket including 66 different imported and locally produced water bottles was considered. The concentrations of Sb in bottled water ranged from 0.168 to 2.263 mu g/L at 24 degrees C and from 0.240 to 6.110 mu g/L at 50 degrees C. Antimony concentrations in PET bottles at 24 degrees C was significantly lower than those at 50 degrees C (p = 0.0142), indicating that the temperature was a principal factor affecting the release of Sb from the plastic into the water. Although the detected Sb amounts were below the guidelines endorsed by WHO and Qatar (standard 5 mu g/L) at 24 degrees C, the concentration measured at 50 degrees C was higher than the recommended WHO values (6.11 mu g/L).																	0167-6369	1573-2959				DEC	2017	189	12							631	10.1007/s10661-017-6342-3								WOS:000418244300014	29129001					
J	Costa, CR; da Costa, MF; Barletta, M; Alves, LHB				Costa, Cibele Rodrigues; da Costa, Monica Ferreira; Barletta, Mario; Bezerra Alves, Luis Henrique			Interannual water quality changes at the head of a tropical estuary	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Waters entering the small estuaries of the Brazilian north-east originate from drainage basins that cross semi-arid and tropical rainforest areas at various levels of use and conservation. Such rivers are often under heavy demand for water supply and other services, such as effluent dilution. The present study examines four consecutive years (2006-2009) of water quality-monitoring data divided by season (rainy and dry) just before the Goiana River enters its estuary. The environmental variables are largely controlled by rainfall patterns. The water temperatures are consistently above 25 degrees C, which impairs dissolved oxygen levels (3.1 to 6.7 mg L-1) and may suggest eutrophication. By contrast, biochemical oxygen demand, percentage O-2 saturation and total phosphorous (which are eutrophication indicators) do not show non-compliant levels, according to local legislation. Although the monitoring stations surround a municipal centre, the estuary is downstream from this area, the main uses of which are artisanal fisheries, nature conservation, leisure and aquaculture. Therefore, continuous monitoring and long-term analysis of the resulting water quality are important.

Trace-metal contamination in the glacierized Rio Santa watershed, Peru	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The objective of this research is to characterize the variability of trace metals in the Rio Santa watershed based on synoptic sampling applied at a large scale. To that end, we propose a combination of methods based on the collection of water, suspended sediments, and riverbed sediments at different points of the watershed within a very limited period. Forty points within the Rio Santa watershed were sampled between June 21 and July 8, 2013. Forty water samples, 36 suspended sediments, and 34 riverbed sediments were analyzed for seven trace metals. The results, which were normalized using the USEPA guideline for water and sediments, show that the Rio Santa water exhibits Mn concentrations higher than the guideline at more than 50% of the sampling points. As is the second highest contaminating element in the water, with approximately 10% of the samples containing concentrations above the guideline. Sediments collected in the Rio Santa riverbed were heavily contaminated by at least four of the tested elements at nearly 85% of the sample points, with As presenting the highest normalized concentration, at more than ten times the guideline. As, Cd, Fe, Pb, and Zn present similar concentration trends in the sediment all along the Rio Santa. The findings indicate that care should be taken in using the Rio Santa water and sediments for purposes that could affect the health of humans or the ecosystem. The situation is worse in some tributaries in the southern part of the watershed that host both active and abandoned mines and ore-processing plants.

J	Havlikova, P; Chuman, T; Jansky, B				Havlikova, Petra; Chuman, Tomas; Jansky, Bohumir			Comparative study of fluvial lakes in floodplains of the Elbe, Luznice and Svratka Rivers based on hydrochemical and biological approach	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The aim of the thesis was to specify key differences in chemistry and biota (zooplankton communities) among fluvial lakes in three regions of the Czech Republic: the central part of the Elbe River, the upper part of the Luznice River and the upper part of the Svratka River. The ten studied lakes of the three regions differ in size, geology, shading, connection with the river and the level of anthropogenic impact. The following hypotheses were tested: (1) The water chemistry of fluvial lakes significantly differs in different floodplains. In the central Elbe River floodplain, there are the highest values of conductivity and concentrations of organic matter and nutrients. Fluvial lakes of the Svratka River floodplain show the lowest level of these parameters, and fluvial lakes of the upper Luznice River have levels intermediate between the two previous regions. (2) The chemistry of fluvial lakes that have contact with the river through surface connection is significantly influenced by the river. (3) The structure of zooplankton differs in different lakes due to the geographical distance between locations, their different altitude and water chemistry. The PCA analysis of selected parameters of the water chemistry revealed a close relationship of locations in the central Elbe River floodplain on the one side and close relationship of the locations in the upper Luznice River and Svratka River on the other. However, the amount of organic matter, nitrogen (with the exception of nitrates) and phosphorus was independent of the region. The relationship between the extent of the lake-river connection and the water chemistry was not significant. The hypothesis that the zooplankton differ in different lakes was not proved-the species composition was similar in all the lakes.

The result showed that farmland and urban land were determined as the source of the pollutants, while forestland and grassland were identified as the sink of the pollutants. The temporal differences of relationships between land use types and concentrations of dissolved trace metals mainly due to the discrepancy of rainfall characteristics. Land use type close to river was a better indicator for the effectiveness of concentrations of trace metals, especially at scale of 0-200 m. Forestland and grassland on lower slopes greatly affected the water quality, and the former had no significant or weak influences on higher slopes. Urban land had the greater positive correlations with concentrations of dissolved trace metals on higher slopes, which are mainly due to frequent mining activity. Further analysis suggested that the buffer zones with low slope needed to be seriously taken into consideration for effective land use management in similar basin.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				DEC	2017	189	12							633	10.1007/s10661-017-6356-x								WOS:000418244300026	29134327					
J	Humphrey, CP; Iverson, G; O'Driscoll, M				Humphrey, Charles P., Jr.; Iverson, Guy; O'Driscoll, Michael			Nitrogen Treatment Efficiency of a Large Onsite Wastewater System in Relation to Water Table Dynamics	CLEAN-SOIL AIR WATER												The objective of this study is to determine if the nitrogen treatment efficiency of a large onsite wastewater system (OSW) in the coastal plain of North Carolina is influenced by changes in the elevation of the water table. Groundwater readings including depth to water, pH, temperature, specific conductance, and dissolved oxygen are recorded eight times over a 15-month period (May 2013-August 2014) encompassing typically "wet" (two sampling events) and "dry" (three sampling events) seasons, and a water table fluctuation of 1.7 m. Groundwater from piezometers (n = 7) near the OSW and septic tank effluent samples are collected for analyses of total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) during each field visit to determine if the TDN treatment efficiency is influenced by the water table elevation. The treatment efficiency of the OSW is directly correlated with wastewater strength (r = 0.882; p = 0.004) and inversely correlated to water table elevation (r = -0.754; p = 0.031). The TDN treatment efficiency at this site decreases with increases in water table elevation, and groundwater TDN concentrations beneath the OSW are typically higher when wastewater concentrations of TDN are higher. Sea level rise and climate change are projected to increase groundwater levels and therefore may have negative effects on water quality adjacent to OSW. Ensuring that OSW are installed with the maximum practical vertical separation to groundwater and setback distances to surface waters, designed with long trenches and oriented perpendicular to the dominant groundwater flow direction will help to maximize TDN treatment.																	1863-0650	1863-0669				DEC	2017	45	12							1700551	10.1002/clen.201700551								WOS:000417491100004

Decomposing the Bulk Electrical Conductivity of Streamflow To Recover Individual Solute Concentrations at High Frequency	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY LETTERS												The ability to evaluate stream hydrochemistry is often constrained by the capacity to sample streamwater at an adequate frequency. While technology is no longer a limiting factor, costs and sample management can still be a barrier to high-resolution water quality instrumentation. We propose a new framework for investigating the electrical conductivity (EC) of streamwater, which can be measured continuously through inexpensive sensors. We show that EC embeds information about individual ion content that can be isolated to retrieve solute concentrations at high resolution. The essence of the approach is the decomposition of the EC signal into its "harmonics", i.e., the specific contributions of the major ions that conduct current in water. The ion contribution is used to explore water quality patterns and to develop algorithms that reconstruct solute concentrations starting from EC during periods where solute measurements are not available. The approach is validated on a hydrochemical data set from Plynlimon, Wales, showing that improved estimates of high-frequency solute dynamics can easily be achieved. Our results support the installation of EC probes to complement water quality campaigns and suggest that the potential of EC measurements in rivers is currently far from being fully exploited.

However, it's necessary to determine whether regional nutrient criteria can be defined in stream ecosystems with a poor ecological status. A database of periphytic diatom samples was collected in July and August 2011 and 2012. In total 172 samples were included in the database with matching environmental variables. Here, percentile estimates, nonparametric change-point analysis (nCPA) and Threshold Indicator Taxa ANalysis (TITAN) were conducted to detect the reference conditions and ecological thresholds along a total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) gradient and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) for the development of nutrient criteria in the streams of the Lake Dianchi basin. The results highlighted the possibility of establishing regional criteria for nutrient concentrations, which we recommended to be no more than 1.39 mg L-1 for TN, 0.04 mg L-1 for TP and 0.17 mg L-1 for NH3-N to prevent nuisance growths of tolerant taxa, and 0.38 mg L-1 for TN, 0.02 mg L-1 for TP and 0.02 mg L-1 for NH3-N to maintain high quality waters in streams. Additionally, the influence of excessive background nutrient enrichment on the threshold response, and the ecological interaction with other stressors (HQI, etc.) in the nutrient dynamic process need to be considered to establish the eventual nutrient criteria, regardless of which technique is applied.

J	Hossain, SZ; Mumford, KG; Rutter, A				Hossain, S. Zubair; Mumford, Kevin G.; Rutter, Allison			Laboratory study of mass transfer from diluted bitumen trapped in gravel	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS												Diluted bitumen (dilbit) spilled to rivers has the potential to sink and become trapped in coarse bed sediments. Hyporheic flow through the river bed can then lead to the dissolution of hydrocarbons from this trapped oil, and subsequent risks to water quality and aquatic life. It is important to understand the concentrations of dissolved hydrocarbons in water, relative to aqueous solubility, that may result from mass transfer under these conditions, particularly under conditions where coarse sediments lead to faster hyporheic flow that could promote rate-limited mass transfer conditions. In this study, the dissolution of dilbit (Cold Lake Blend) trapped in gravel was measured using one-dimensional columns at flow rates representative of fast hyporheic flow. Dissolved concentrations in the column effluent were found to be less than 20% of effective solubility (equilibrium) concentrations and decreased with increasing flow rate, indicative of rate-limited conditions. These results show that risks posed by the contamination of gravel-bedded rivers by trapped dilbit may be lower, but persist for a longer period of time, than those estimated assuming dissolution at concentrations near solubility limits.																	2050-7887	2050-7895				DEC	2017	19	12					1583	1593		10.1039/c7em00457e								WOS:000418094400012	29199292

Due to the strong and size-dependent adsorption capability of soil particles to radio-nuclides, a better understanding of erosion and transport of soil particles and identification of erosion prone areas within watersheds are significant for contaminant management. For this purpose, we simulated soil erosion and transport in a partially forested catchment for multiple particle size classes. Critical erosion areas were identified by the spatial distribution of net soil erosion. Comparisons between simulated and measured suspended solids concentration at multiple locations throughout the catchment demonstrated successful model performance. For the period Mar. 12, 2011 through Dec. 31, 2014, model results indicated that 5500 tonnes of clay, 52000 tonnes of silt, and 22000 tonnes of sand are transported from the catchment. The results showed that soil erosion in the middle part of the catchment is greater mainly because of steep slopes and large fraction of agricultural lands. These simulations suggest that soil decontamination of erosion-prone agricultural lands in the mid- catchment areas would be effective in reducing radiocesium migration with soil particles.																	1570-6443	1876-4444				DEC	2017	17						18	29		10.1016/j.jher.2017.09.003								WOS:000418105600003

The scale problem in tackling diffuse water pollution from agriculture: Insights from the Avon Demonstration Test Catchment programme in England	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS					National Meeting of the British-Hydrological-Society (BHS)	JUL, 2016	Loughborough Univ, Loughborough, ENGLAND	British Hydrol Soc	Loughborough Univ			Mitigation of diffuse water pollution from agriculture is of concern in the United Kingdom, so that freshwater quality can be improved in line with environmental objectives. Targeted on-farm mitigation is necessary for controlling sources of pollution to rivers; a positive impact must also be delivered at the subcatchment and catchment scales before good ecological status can be achieved. A farm on the River Sem in the Hampshire Avon Demonstration Test Catchment was selected for monitoring due to its degraded farmyard, track, and drainage ditch, which was targeted by the Demonstration Test Catchment programme for improvement using a treatment train of interventions. The river was monitored before and after, upstream and downstream, of the potential sources of pollution and subsequent mitigation, both locally at farm scale, and downstream at the subcatchment scale. Sediment was obtained from the riverbed using a conventional disturbance technique, and source samples were collected from across the subcatchment. Samples were analysed for geochemistry, mineral magnetism, and environmental radionuclide activity using the <63-m fraction, before sediment source fingerprinting was conducted to apportion sources. Source tracing revealed that, although the degraded farm track was experiencing channelized flow and erosion in the pre-mitigation period, it was not a major sediment source even at farm scale. Repeat source apportionment during the pre- and post-mitigation periods showed that the targeted treatment train did not result in statistically significant decreases in predicted contributions from the farm track sources at either scale. Sediment sources must be determined at a range of spatial scales to support effective mitigation.																	1535-1459	1535-1467				DEC	2017	33	10			SI		1527	1538		10.1002/rra.3222								WOS:000417916000003

Assessing the Mechanistic Basis for Fine Sediment Biomonitoring: Inconsistencies among the Literature, Traits and Indices	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS					National Meeting of the British-Hydrological-Society (BHS)	JUL, 2016	Loughborough Univ, Loughborough, ENGLAND	British Hydrol Soc	Loughborough Univ			Classification of species sensitivity for biomonitoring has been approached under two different frameworks, using either empirical data or expert opinion. Two tools for fine sediment (i.e. clogging and colmation) biomonitoring in the UK tend towards these contrasting approaches. The Proportion of Sediment-sensitive Invertebrates (PSI) index was developed using expert judgement. Empirical weightings were subsequently added at genus or species (EPSI) and mixed (EPSImixed) taxonomic levels, but scores remain constrained by the original categories. In contrast, the Combined Fine Sediment Index, composed of separate taxon scores along organic matter and total fine sediment gradients, was developed using a purely empirical approach. We tested the mechanistic bases for these indices by relating taxon scores to species traits. We compared the results with those for the well-established Whalley Hawkes Paisley Trigg index of organic pollution. After controlling for varying sample sizes, Whalley Hawkes Paisley Trigg could be better predicted by a linear combination of all available traits (mean R-2=0.92) than any of the fine sediment indices (0.68<mean R-2<0.76). When only traits expected to respond to fine sediment were offered as independent variables, the goodness of fit was substantially reduced for all fine sediment indices (0.27<mean R-2<0.46). Our findings demonstrate the lack of integration between the literature on macroinvertebrate responses to fine sediment, the available trait data and taxon scores. Refinement of the trait database is recommended to build on the valuable work performed to date. As the UK has taken the lead in embedding fine sediment into routine biomonitoring programmes, these findings have important international implications. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The present work aims to assess the degree to which common annual periodic behavior is present (1994-2010) in the meteorological parameters (global radiation, air temperature, cloud cover), streamflow; and five primary nutrients (e.g. total phosphorus, nitrate-nitrogen) as possible indicators of ecosystem vulnerability in four different ecosystems using wavelet coherence analysis. The cascade system is located in the mouth of a shallow river where the water flows through a eutrophic pond then a disturbed/undisturbed macrophyte covered wetland reaching a large shallow lake. The results highlight the differing abilities of the elements of the cascade of ecosystems to follow seasonality. The changes in water quality (nutrient cycle) in the eutrophic pond most closely mirror meteorological seasonality. The vulnerability of the wetland ecosystem was expressed by its decreased capacity to follow seasonal changes due to high algae loads and additional inflows. Moreover, the wetland proved to be weak and unstable regarding phosphorus and nitrogen retention. With the successful application of wavelet coherence analysis to the "black-box" cascade system the study sets an example for the implications of the method in such combined or stand-alone natural/partially-constructed ecosystems.

An emerging public concern on lake eutrophication has heightened the need to assess and predict the trophic status in floodplain lakes, particularly for those with high spatial heterogeneity. In this study, combined multivariate statistical techniques and random forests model were used to characterize the water quality and trophic status of Poyang Lake. By classifying and characterizing seasonal water samples comprising 11 water quality parameters collected from 13 sampling sites in Poyang Lake between 2008 and 2014, the dataset was divided into the central and northern lake groups, which corresponded to lentic and lotic regions in Poyang Lake, respectively. The spatial water quality variations and underlying patterns were investigated by performing discriminant analysis and principal component analysis (PCA). Lastly, random forests (RF) were used to predict the chlorophyll a (Chl-a) variations of the central and northern lakes. The PCA results indicated that the water quality of the central and northern areas of the lake was controlled by different environmental variables and underlying pollutant sources. The RF model outperformed the artificial neural network and linear regression and was robust with strong predictive capabilities. It was determined that the most important predictors of the Chl-a variations in the northern lake were water temperature (T) and water level, whereas transparency, T, and water level were the most efficient predictors in the central lake. The RF model can also be applied to trophic prediction in other large lakes with considerable spatial variations. This study will have implications on water quality management and eutrophication prevention in floodplain lakes with high spatial heterogeneity.																	1470-160X	1872-7034				DEC	2017	83						74	83		10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.07.033								WOS:000417551800008

It was recently selected as a reference river for a pilot biomonitoring assessment within the European Union-China River Basin Management Programme. As the outcome of the project, a pilot multimetric index (MMI-CS) was developed for future assessment of the ecological status of the Chishui River basin. In this study, eight core metrics were selected and used to build the multimetric system. These metrics included the total number of taxa (TotalTax), the number of taxa of sprawlers (SprwlTax), the number of intolerant taxa (IntolTax), the Hilsenhoff biotic index (HBI), the percentage of Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera and Plecoptera (EPTPct), the number of Ephemeroptera taxa (EphemTax), the percentage of collectors (ClictPct) and the average score per taxon (ASPT). Five ecological status ratings ("Excellent", "Good", "Fair", "Poor" and "Very Poor") were established. The results of the evaluation showed that the index was reasonable and effective. The results of the assessment showed that sites with higher ecological status were distributed mainly in the upper and middle reaches of the region and that sites with lower ecological status were centrally distributed in the lower reaches. Moreover, the index should be refined and validated using additional datasets obtained in different seasons in the future for routine bioassessment within the framework of sustainable management.																	1470-160X	1872-7034				DEC	2017	83						84	95		10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.07.015								WOS:000417551800009

The objectives of this study were to; 1) create baseline farm-level sustainability indices for smallholder shrimp farms in Sri Lanka using both content-based and system-based frameworks adapted from agriculture; 2) determine whether arranging indicators within both content- and system-based sustainability frameworks would provide additional insight into relative farm sustainability (rather than using just one framework); and 3) seek differences between the North Western Province (NWP) and the Eastern Province (EP) in sustainability index, subindex, or indicator scores that might be used to create province-specific policies and education programs designed to potentially improve sustainable practices at the farm level. Since little has been published on the development of practical indicators and evaluation of farm-level sustainability in aquaculture, this study adapted two types of frameworks used for measuring sustainability in agriculture: content- and system-based. Using both frameworks, along with expert opinion, indicators of farm level sustainability were developed into a questionnaire and measured on 225 farms in two provinces of Sri Lanka. Indicators primarily included modifiable practices that farmers could influence to improve the chances of their farms' survival. The farm indicators were normalized using "min-max" normalization, where scores of zero and one were assigned for the least and most sustainable options, respectively. Farm indicators in each province were then aggregated into sub-indices as well an overall aggregated sustainability index score. Similar themes were gleaned from both the content-based and system-based sustainability frameworks, and there was no significant difference between mean overall sustainability scores for the two different frameworks. Farms in the NWP scored significantly higher on the overall sustainability indices of both models despite the NWP's history of severe disease outbreaks while the EP farms had no disease. Possible reasons for this difference were explored with an in-depth analysis of sub-indices as well as individual indicators. An overall aggregated sustainability index score was a useful baseline measure for monitoring changes in sustainability over time; however, its use was limited when attempting to identify gaps in sustainable management practices and provide practical information for farmers and stakeholders to improve farm-level sustainability. It was important to evaluate individual indicators in addition to sub-indices and overall index scores when making recommendations or identifying gaps in sustainable practices at the farm level.

J	Camargo, JA				Camargo, Julio A.			Multimetric assessment of macroinvertebrate responses to mitigation measures in a dammed and polluted river of Central Spain	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												In this research, structural and functional responses of benthic macroinvertebrates to mitigation measures (carried out in the dammed and polluted Duraton River, Central Spain, during the 1990s and 2000s) were examined by comparing physicochemical and biological data from the summer of 1987 with data from the summer of 2014. Mitigation measures resulted in significant increases in dissolved oxygen concentrations, as well as in significant reductions of fluoride (F-) pollution and short-term flow fluctuations. The macrobenthic community responded positively to improvements in river environmental conditions, exhibiting significant increases in abundance (total density, total biomass and EPT density) and diversity (total family richness and EPT richness) at impacted sampling sites. Furthermore, the presence of relatively sensitive benthic macro invertebrates after mitigation measures (as indicated by increased values of BMWQ biotic indices) also was the main cause for observed reductions in the environmental impact caused by disturbance points (as indicated by decreased values of the El index), and for the observed recovering of the trophic structure of the macrobenthic community, with macroinvertebrate scrapers as the functional feeding group most favored. These macro invertebrate responses to mitigation measures were more marked at sampling sites that initially were more impacted (i.e., nearest to disturbance points), and less apparent at the sampling site that initially was less impacted (i.e., farthest to disturbance points). Within the hydropsychid assemblage, improvements in river environmental conditions clearly favored the presence of Hydropsyche pellucidula and Cheumatopsyche lepida at the expense of the other hydropsychid species. In spite of all monitored environmental improvements and macroinvertebrate positive responses, the need for additional mitigation measures was evident, particularly to reduce high turbidity levels and sedimentation of fine inorganic matter negatively affecting benthic macro invertebrates downstream from the industrial effluent. Overall, it is concluded that the multimetric approach is an effective technique to assess macroinvertebrate responses to mitigation measures in river ecosystems.																	1470-160X	1872-7034				DEC	2017	83						356	367		10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.08.027								WOS:000417551800035

Excavation of wells and exploiting water resources of aquifers have long been known as ordinary solutions to supply water demands for drinking, agricultural and industrial purposes. In many agricultural areas such as the above mentioned region, extraction wells have been utilized for both drinking and agricultural consumptions, while measures taken for water quality monitoring and protecting public health are seriously limited. On the other hand, most of the shared extraction wells in the region used for drinking purpose have been located near the agricultural lands and they are highly under the risk of getting polluted by Agricultural pesticides. The current paper firstly intends to demonstrate the results obtained from Drinking water Quality Index (DWQI) as well as Irrigation Water Quality Index (IWQI) and secondly determines probable conflicts that may be aroused in ranking of water wells using these two methods Subsequently, Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques such as Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA), Compromise Programing (CP) and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) were employed to decrease effects of the conflicts. It was clarified that MCDMs, to some extent, alleviated contradictions in wells' ranks determined by DWQI/IWQI-and authenticated this procedure as an appropriate method for water quality ranking in agricultural societies.																	1470-160X	1872-7034				DEC	2017	83						368	379		10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.08.017								WOS:000417551800036

Building a potential wetland restoration indicator for the contiguous United States	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Wetlands provide key functions in the landscape from improving water quality, to regulating flows, to providing wildlife habitat. Over half of the wetlands in the contiguous United States (CONUS) have been converted to agricultural and urban land uses. However, over the last several decades, research has shown the benefits of wetlands to hydrologic, chemical, biological processes, spurring the. creation of government programs and private initiatives to restore wetlands. Initiatives tend to focus on individual wetland creation, yet the greatest benefits are achieved when strategic restoration planning occurs across a watershed or multiple watersheds. For watershed-level wetland restoration planning to occur, informative data layers on potential wetland areas are needed. We created an indicator of potential wetland areas (PWA), using nationally available datasets to identify characteristics that could support wetland ecosystems, including: poorly drained soils and low-relief landscape positions as indicated by a derived topographic data layer. We compared our PWA with the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) from 11 states throughout the CONUS to evaluate their alignment. The state-level percentage of NWI-designated wetlands directly overlapping the PWA ranged from 39 to 95%. When we included NWI that was immediately adjacent to the overlapping NWI, our range of correspondence to NWI ranged from 60 to 99%. Wetland restoration is more likely on certain landscapes (e.g., agriculture) than others due to the lack of substantive infrastructure and the potential for the restoration of hydrology; therefore, we combined the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) with the PWA to identify potentially restorable wetlands on agricultural land (PRW-Ag). The PRW-Ag identified a total of over 46 million ha with the potential to support wetlands. The largest concentrations of PRW-Ag occurred in the glaciated corn belt of the upper Mississippi River from Ohio to the Dakotas and in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley. The PRW-Ag layer could assist land managers in identifying sites that may qualify for enrollment in conservation programs, where planners can coordinate restoration efforts, or where decision makers can target resources to optimize the services provided across a watershed or multiple watersheds.																	1470-160X	1872-7034				DEC	2017	83						463	473		10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.07.026								WOS:000417551800044	29706804					
J	Blaise, C; Gagne, F; Burgeot, T				Blaise, Christian; Gagne, Francois; Burgeot, Thierry			Three simple biomarkers useful in conducting water quality assessments with bivalve mollusks	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												While biomarkers are undeniably key tools in aquatic ecotoxicology to measure adverse effects linked to contamination events, their application is often inhibited by monetary constraints negating the possibility of having access to dedicated equipment, special wares, and/or expensive reagents. To offset this bottleneck, we propose three simple physiological biomarkers, quantifiable in bivalves, that are free of cost considerations and that can provide basic knowledge on animal health and water quality. Indeed, condition index (CI), growth index (GI), and SOS response (air-time survival) comprise measurements straightforward enough to perform by any laboratory or science body on the planet. Long-term monitoring or screening studies can be carried out with these biomarkers and they are able to provide robust information notably after exposure of bivalves to either singular or multiple agents of contamination. By highlighting examples of data generated in aquatic studies conducted in Eastern Canada under both laboratory and field situations with different species of marine and freshwater mollusks, we establish the suitability of these biomarkers for assessing environmental contamination. Their relationships with other biomarkers are also shown which further corroborate their value as reliable indicators of ecosystem health.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				DEC	2017	24	36			SI		27662	27669		10.1007/s11356-016-6908-6								WOS:000417874400005

Untreated AMD can contaminate surface and groundwater and pose severe ecological risk. Both active and passive methods have been developed for AMD treatment consisting of abiotic and biological techniques. Abiotic techniques are expensive and can create large amounts of secondary wastes. Passive biological treatment mainly consists of aerobic or anaerobic constructed wetlands. While aerobic wetlands are economical, they are not effective if the pH of the AMD is < 5. Anaerobic wetlands use organic-rich substrates to provide carbon source to iron- and sulfate-reducing bacteria. The efficiency of these systems declines overtime and requires continuous maintenance. Our objective is to develop an alternative, low-cost, and sustainable floating wetland treatment (FWT) system for AMD for the abandoned Tab-Simco coal mining site in Illinois using vetiver grass (Chrysopogon zizanioides). Tab-Simco AMD is highly acidic, with mean pH value of 2.64, and contains high levels of sulfate and metals. A greenhouse study was performed for a 30-day period in order to screen and optimize the necessary parameters to design a FWT system. Water quality and plant growth parameters were continuously monitored. Results show significant SO4 (2-) removal, resulting in increased pH, particularly at higher planting densities. Vetiver also helped in metal removal; high amounts of Fe, Zn, and Cu were removed, with relatively lower amounts of Pb, Al, and Ni. Iron plaque formation on the root was observed, which increased metal stabilization in root and lowered root to shoot metal translocation. Vetiver was tolerant of AMD, showing minimal change in biomass and plant growth. Results obtained are encouraging, and a large scale mesocosm study is now in progress, as the next step to develop the vetiver-based system for AMD treatment.

In this regard, both observed and forecasted time series are incorporated as input variables of the models when applied for more than one lead time. Secondly, least-square ensemble models employing multiple wavelet-ANN models are developed to increase the performance of the single model. For this purpose, different wavelet families are linked with the ANN model and performance of each model is evaluated using error measures. The Skagit River near Mount Vernon in Washington county is selected as the case study. The daily flow discharge and suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in the current day are considered as input variables to predict suspended sediment concentration in the next day. For more lead times, the input structure is updated by adding the forecast of SSC in the previous time step. Results of this study demonstrate that incorporating both observed and predicted variables in the input structure improves performance of conventional models in which those only employ observed time series as input variables. Moreover, ensemble model developed for each lead time outperforms the best single wavelet-ANN model which indicates superiority of the ensemble model over the other one. Findings of this study reveal that acceptable forecasts of daily suspended sediment concentration up to 3 days in advance can be achieved using the proposed methodology.

Total phosphorus (TP), chlorophyll a (Chl-a), and total suspended matter (TSM) are important indexes of water quality and important factors influencing eutrophication and algal blooms. In this study, remote sensing was used to monitor these indexes to investigate the effects of river discharge on the estuary of Taihu Lake by the largest inflow river which is Chendong River using a total of 136 Geostationary Ocean Color Images (GOCI). In situ datasets collected during the four cruise experiments on Taihu Lake between 2011 and 2015 were used to develop the TP, Chl-a, and TSM inversion models based on simple empirical algorithms: 154 points for TP (mg/L), 114 for Chl-a (mu g/L), and 181 for TSM (mg/L). The spatial and temporal changes of the concentration of the three parameters in the Chendong River estuary were analyzed by combining the GOCI data, the flow of the Chendong River, and meteorological data throughout the year in 2014. The several key findings are as follows: (1) In summer and autumn, TP, Chl-a, and TSM contents were significantly higher than in winter and spring. TP and Chl-a have a few similar distribution characteristics. And organic suspended matter in summer was the main reason for the increase of the TSM concentration. (2) The severe surface erosion in the rivers cannot be ignored; the high erodibility is an important factor in the increase of TP and TSM concentrations in the estuary. The concentration of the water quality parameter showed exponential decay with distance from the shore. The concentration decreased slowly after 12 km and then remained essentially constant. (3) TP content in the Chendong River estuary decreased under steady flow inputs and dramatically increased when the flow became large. The increase in Chl-a content was linked to higher levels of TP and good weather conditions after the rain event. Higher flow rates mainly play a dilution role for the Chl-a concentration. Erosion of the surface soil via rainfall is a major source of TSM to the estuary. This paper firstly analyzes tempo-spatial dynamics of water quality and its response to river flow in estuary of Taihu Lake, helps to further understand the impact of river input on lake water quality, and is important for lake eutrophication.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				DEC	2017	24	36			SI		28079	28101		10.1007/s11356-017-0305-7								WOS:000417874400045	28994019

A stochastic methodology using Monte Carlo simulations is proposed for assessing annual pollutant load, as well as the associated uncertainties, from a few event sampling campaigns and/or continuous turbidity measurements (representative of the total suspended solids concentration (TSS)). Indeed, in the latter case, the proposed method takes into account the correlation between pollutants and TSS. The developed method was applied to data acquired within the French research project "INOGEV" (innovations for a sustainable management of urban water) at the outlet of three urban catchments drained by separate storm sewers. Ten or so event sampling campaigns for a large range of pollutants (46 pollutants and 2 conventional water quality parameters: TSS and total organic carbon (TOC)) are combined with hundreds of rainfall events for which, at least one among three continuously monitored parameters (rainfall intensity, flow rate, and turbidity) is available. Results obtained for the three catchments show that the annual pollutant loads can be estimated with uncertainties ranging from 10 to 60%, and the added value of turbidity monitoring for lowering the uncertainty is demonstrated. A low inter-annual and inter-site variability of pollutant loads, for many of studied pollutants, is observed with respect to the estimated uncertainties, and can be explained mainly by annual precipitation.					gasperi, Johnny/0000-0003-4083-9698; Moilleron, Regis/0000-0001-8876-7123												0944-1344	1614-7499				DEC	2017	24	36			SI		28205	28219		10.1007/s11356-017-0384-5								WOS:000417874400055

Source water switch may cause physiochemical and microbiological de-stabilization of pipe material, biofilms, and loose deposits in drinking water distribution system (DWDS). Great sulfate alteration during source water switch had been deemed as the main cause of a red water case that occurred in a northern China city. To ascertain the relationship between water quality changing and bacterial communities of biofilms in DWDS and possible bacteria risk in a red water case, water quality changing experiments in simulated DWDSs were conducted for approximately 2 years. Twenty-five corrosion scale samples and eight water samples collected from pipe harvest sites or during experimental periods were analyzed for their bacterial community composition by 454-pyrosequencing technology. Taxonomy results together with redundancy analysis (RDA) or canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis all indicated that bacterial community of samples with groundwater (GW) or surface water (SW) supply history and their variations under high sulfate water were rather different owing to different water source histories and the original pipe scale characteristics. Potential opportunistic pathogens: Burkholderia, Escherichia-Shigella, Mycobacterium, Serratia, Ralstonia, Novosphingobium, Flavobacterium, Sphingomonas, and Sphingopyxis were observed in scale or water samples.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				DEC	2017	24	36			SI		28220	28238		10.1007/s11356-017-0370-y								WOS:000417874400056	29022243

Mercury bioavailability, transformations, and effects on freshwater biofilms	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Mercury (Hg) compounds represent an important risk to aquatic ecosystems because of their persistence, bioaccumulation, and biomagnification potential. In the present review, we critically examine state-of-the-art studies on the interactions of Hg compounds with freshwater biofilms, with an emphasis on Hg accumulation, transformations, and effects. Freshwater biofilms contain both primary producers (e.g., algae) and decomposers (e.g., bacteria and fungi), which contribute to both aquatic food webs and the microbial loop. Hence they play a central role in shallow water and streams, and also contribute to Hg trophic transfer through their consumption. Both inorganic and methylated mercury compounds accumulate in biofilms, which could transform them mainly by methylation, demethylation, and reduction. Accumulated Hg compounds could induce diverse metabolic and physiological perturbations in the microorganisms embedded in the biofilm matrix and affect their community composition. The bioavailability of Hg compounds, their transformations, and their effects depend on their concentrations and speciation, ambient water characteristics, biofilm matrix composition, and microorganism-specific characteristics. The basic processes governing the interactions of Hg compounds with biofilm constituents are understudied. The development of novel conceptual and methodological approaches allowing an understanding of the chemo- and biodynamic aspects is necessary to improve the knowledge on Hg cycling in shallow water as well as to enable improved use of freshwater biofilms as potential indicators of water quality and to support better informed risk assessment.

J	Heritier, L; Duval, D; Galinier, R; Meistertzheim, AL; Verneau, O				Heritier, Laurent; Duval, David; Galinier, Richard; Meistertzheim, Anne-Leila; Verneau, Olivier			Oxidative stress induced by glyphosate-based herbicide on freshwater turtles	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Freshwater ecosystems face very strong anthropogenic pressures, among which overexploitation, habitat degradation, flow modification, species invasion, and water pollution lead to growing threats on biodiversity. Urbanization through wastewater treatment, industry through the release of inorganic and organic chemicals, and agriculture through the use of pesticides and herbicides are the main factors involved in water pollution. In France, more precisely in the Pyrenees-Orientales department, the poor quality of the watercourses is attributable overall to the use of glyphosate-based herbicides in agricultural activities. Because these chemicals can impact individuals, populations, and biodiversity, we investigated, under experimental conditions, the physiological response of animals facing abiotic contaminants. We selected as a model, juveniles of the freshwater turtle Trachemys scripta elegans. We measured the gene expression and activity of the catalase and superoxide dismutase enzymes as well as the levels of lipid peroxidation, which are all oxidative stress biomarkers, in turtles challenged with high concentrations of glyphosate-based herbicides, on the one hand, and with degraded waters collected from a local watercourse, on the other. We also measured the acetylcholinesterase activity across the same animals. We showed through variations in gene expression and enzyme activity that a glyphosate commercial formulation induced a stress in turtles. A similar outcome was obtained when turtles faced degraded waters. The results indicated that the poor quality of regional waters could be a real threat for animal health. Because turtles are globally less sensitive to contaminants than amphibians, which are lacking in the degraded waters of the Pyrenees-Orientales department, they could constitute an excellent model to follow the evolution of water quality through the study of oxidative stress biomarkers.

A shoreline divided: Twelve-year water quality and land cover trends in Lake Ontario coastal wetlands	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Water quality in Great Lakes coastal wetlands has been studied for decades, but few studies look at water quality changes in multiple sites over many years and relate that to land cover. In this study, water quality at 22 sites in two regions along the north shore of Lake Ontario (Bay of Quinte in the east and Durham Region in the west) was compared over a period of 12 years (2003-2014) and related to land cover data from two time periods (1999-2002 and 2009-2011) at four spatial scales; 500 m, 1000 m, 2000 m wetland buffers, and the quaternary watershed. Water Quality Index (WQI) scores significantly increased over time in both regions, and turbidity and pH both significantly decreased over time in both regions. Land cover data showed regional differences between east and west, with the western sites having higher percentage of urban land at all scales. There were significant relationships between land cover (% Natural and % Urban) and WQI score at several scales, but the relationships were strongest at the watershed scale. We found that sites in the western region showed a greater amount of change in land cover between the two time periods, compared to the eastern sites. The results of this study provide some key insights on the impact of urbanization on Great Lakes coastal wetlands, and on how they can be managed in the future.

The contribution of double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) to silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) DNA loads in the Chicago Area Waterway System	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Waterfowl and colonial waterbirds can have significant impacts on water quality in lakes and reservoirs by depositing feces that contribute to nitrogen and phosphorus loads. Piscivorous birds can also contribute the DNA of prey species to a water body. Here, we develop and apply a loading model to estimate the number of silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) DNA target marker copies that are potentially deposited by nesting double crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) in the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS). The model assumes a conservative breeding population estimate ranging between 6000 and 8000 cormorants distributed among three large colonies in the Chicago metropolitan area. The model also assumes that cormorants are distributing feces randomly throughout the CAWS in proportion to the amount of time spent at each location. Results show that cormorants may be contributing 2.6 to 113 target marker copies/m(2)/day if birds are spending 22% of their time on open water and 6.4 to 291 target marker copies/m2/day if birds are spending 56% of their time on open water. Over the entire CAWS, cormorants may contribute tens of millions to billions of silver carp DNA copies each day. These target marker loads may be contributing to positive detections of silver carp environmental DNA (eDNA) in the CAWS. This study does not address other potential sources of silver carp genetic material in the CAWS, including live fish, and provides no indication as to whether or not the loads attributed to cormorants are large or small in relation to these other potential sources.

Spatiotemporal variation of bacterial water quality and the relationship with pasture land cover	JOURNAL OF WATER AND HEALTH												Pathogens are a major cause of water quality impairment and public health concern world-wide. In the United States, each state is tasked with developing water quality standards (WQS) to protect the designated use(s) of waterbodies. Several streams in the Illinois River Watershed in northwest Arkansas are currently listed as impaired due to elevated levels of pathogens. Our objective was to evaluate Escherichia coli (E. coli) numbers at 29 stream sites, compare these numbers to the applicable WQS, and investigate the relationship between E. coli numbers and land cover variables. E. coli numbers in samples collected at most sites were within allowable limits, although there were several instances of violations of the WQS. Violations were variable from year to year at some sites, and elevated levels of E. coli were spatially localized during baseflow. Violations also were positively related to pasture land cover in the drainage area, and particularly within the riparian buffer area. This relationship was non-linear, or threshold based, where there was a significant increase in the mean E. coli exceedances when riparian pasture land cover was greater than approximately 50%. These results can be used to identify specific stream reaches where E. coli numbers might be elevated and the implementation of best management practices can be geographically targeted.																	1477-8920					DEC	2017	15	6					839	848		10.2166/wh.2017.101								WOS:000417269400001	29215349					
J	Marie, V; Lin, J				Marie, Veronna; Lin, Johnson			Viruses in the environment - presence and diversity of bacteriophage and enteric virus populations in the Umhlangane River, Durban, South Africa	JOURNAL OF WATER AND HEALTH												Due to the continued persistence of waterborne viral-associated infections, the presence of enteric viruses is a concern. Notwithstanding the health implications, viral diversity and abundance is an indicator of water quality declination in the environment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of viruses (bacteriophage and enteric viruses) in a highly polluted, anthropogenicinfluenced river system over a 6-month period at five sampling points. Cytopathic-based tissue culture assays revealed that the isolated viruses were infectious when tested on Hep-G2, HEK293 and Vero cells. While transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that the majority of the viruses were bacteriophages, a number of presumptive enteric virus families were visualized, some of which include Picornaviridae, Adenoviridae, Polyomaviridae and Reoviridae. Finally, primer specific nested polymerase chain reaction (nested-PCR)/reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) coupled with BLAST analysis identified human adenovirus, polyomavirus and hepatitis A and C virus genomes in river water samples. Taken together, the complexity of both bacteriophage and enteric virus populations in the river has potential health implications. Finally, a systematic integrated risk assessment and management plan to identify and minimize sources of faecal contamination is the most effective way of ensuring water safety and should be established in all future guidelines.																	1477-8920					DEC	2017	15	6					966	981		10.2166/wh.2017.066								WOS:000417269400012	29215360					
J	Zhang, ZC				Zhang, Zhenchao			Treatment of oilfield wastewater by combined process of micro-electrolysis, Fenton oxidation and coagulation	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												In this study, a combined process was developed that included micro-electrolysis, Fenton oxidation and coagulation to treat oilfield fracturing wastewater. Micro-electrolysis and Fenton oxidation were applied to reduce chemical oxygen demand (COD) organic load and to enhance organic components gradability, respectively. Orthogonal experiment were employed to investigate the influence factors of micro-electrolysis and Fenton oxidation on COD removal efficiency. For micro-electrolysis, the optimum conditions were: pH, 3; iron-carbon dosage, 50 mg/L; mass ratio of iron-carbon, 2: 3; reaction time, 60 min. For Fenton oxidation, a total reaction time of 90 min, a H2O2 dosage of 12 mg/L, with a H2O2/Fe2+ mole ratio of 30, pH of 3 were selected to achieve optimum oxidation. The optimum conditions in coagulation process: pH, cationic polyacrylamide dosage, mixing speed and time is 4.3, 2 mg/L, 150 rpm and 30 s, respectively. In the continuous treatment process under optimized conditions, the COD of oily wastewater fell 56.95%, 46.23%, 30.67%, respectively, from last stage and the total COD removal efficiency reached 83.94% (from 4,314 to 693 mg/L). In the overall treatment process under optimized conditions, the COD of oily wastewater was reduced from 4,314 to 637 mg/L, and the COD removal efficiency reached 85.23%. The contribution of each stage is 68.45% (micro-electrolysis), 24.07% (Fenton oxidation), 7.48% (coagulation), respectively. Microelectrolysis is the uppermost influencing process on COD removal. Compared with the COD removal efficiency of three processes on raw wastewater under optimized conditions: the COD removal efficiency of single micro-electrolysis, single Fenton oxidation, single coagulation is 58.34%, 44.88% and 39.72%, respectively. Experiments proved the effect of combined process is marvelous and the overall water quality of the final effluent could meet the class III national wastewater discharge standard of petrochemical industry of China (GB8978-1996).																	0273-1223	1996-9732				DEC	2017	76	12					3278	3288		10.2166/wst.2017.486								WOS:000417838300012	29236007

Spatio-temporal variations of water quality in Nova Ponte Reservoir, Araguari River Basin, Brazil	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												Multivariate techniques, like cluster analysis (CA) and principal component analysis (PCA), were used to evaluate the spatial and temporal variability of surface water quality in a large neotropical hydroelectric reservoir (Nova Ponte Reservoir). The dataset, obtained during the period of 1995-2011 from the Energy Company of Minas Gerais State (CEMIG), contains 14 parameters surveyed quarterly in 14 sites, at different depths. The CA grouped the 14 sites in three main groups: lotic sites, half of the photic zone sites and bottom sites. Statistical tests showed that only three parameters (total dissolved solids, nitrate and chemical oxygen demand) have no significant difference between cluster groups. The PCA results showed temporal changes of the water quality in all groups, illustrating modifications to the importance of the parameters over time. PCA also revealed the major causes of water deterioration from 1995 to 2005 were related to agricultural and livestock activities. Currently, the water quality parameters related to organic pollution are also highlighted. Generally, this study shows that possible optimization of the monitoring network should consider temporal variation of water quality parameters.																	1606-9749					DEC	2017	17	6					1507	1514		10.2166/ws.2017.055								WOS:000417947000002						
J	Wu, SF; Zhang, X; She, DX				Wu, Shaofei; Zhang, Xiang; She, Dunxian			Joint occurrence of water quality indexes in relation to river streamflow in the heavily polluted Huai River Basin, China	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												Effective joint management of water quantity and quality of rivers requires a good understanding of the interrelationships between these variables. This study aims to quantitatively evaluate the impact of river streamflow on the joint occurrence of water quality variables in the heavily polluted Huai River Basin (HRB). Using data from three representative stations, joint distributions were set up for two key water quality indexes, CODMn and NH3-N, for three different streamflow scenarios: low, medium and high streamflows, and the joint probabilities of different water quality combinations were calculated. The results showed that there was a significant negative relationship between streamflow and the water quality index, while the water quality indexes were significantly positively correlated. In general, the higher the river streamflow, the lower the joint probability of water quality variables under the three scenarios in each station. It is concluded that, in both the main stream and the tributary, high streamflow scenarios do help to improve the joint probability of water quality combination under a higher water quality grade, compared with a decrease under a lower quality grade. This study is expected to provide scientific references for water quality management and implementation of water pollution prevention in the HRB.				she, dunxian/B-4667-2018	she, dunxian/0000-0003-4660-3301												1606-9749					DEC	2017	17	6					1602	1615		10.2166/ws.2017.046								WOS:000417947000011

Simulation of multiple water source ecological replenishment for Chagan Lake based on coupled hydrodynamic and water quality models	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												Chagan Lake serves as an irrigation storage reservoir for the Qianguo Irrigation Area and an important ecological barrier in western Jilin. The coupled TUFLOW-FV and Aquatic Ecodynamic (AED2) models were used to simulate the hydrodynamic and water quality of Chagan Lake, and propose the water diversion scheme that could improve the water quality to reach Grade III and maintain the ecological water level. The simulation results showed a satisfactory agreement with observations. The total carrying loads of NH3-N, total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) for Chagan Lake were 1,147.6, 3,686.2 and 100.8 t from May to October. The range of the minimum amounts of water diversion to keep the water quality as Grade III and maintain the maximum ecological water level of 131.5 m for TN, TP were separately [32.60, 49.84, 57.19, 63.70, 70.91], [117.25, 135.26, 168.17, 190.65, 218.32] million m(3) and the corresponding reduction amounts of farmland drainage for TN, TP were separately [4.03, 0, 0, 0, 0], [73.08, 61.88, 50.23, 40.94, 31.98] million m(3) under the rainfall guarantee rates of 10%, 20%, 50%, 75%, 90%, respectively. The simulation results provide a scientific basis for the water quality improvement and ecological water supplement required for the interconnected river-lake system network (IRLSN) in Western Jilin Province.																	1606-9749					DEC	2017	17	6					1774	1784		10.2166/ws.2017.079								WOS:000417947000027

Simulation of NOM events in pilot plant evaluation of DAF/Ozone/BAC for drinking water treatment	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												Pilot plant testing is invaluable for ascertaining the robustness of water treatment processes against raw water quality events such as turbidity and colour spikes, whether it be for stress testing of an existing process or designing of a new process. Unfortunately, the natural occurrence of such events (particularly colour) can be difficult to predict and commercial humic materials generally fail to closely match the indigenous natural organic matter (NOM) present in the raw water. Therefore, it is highly desirable to be able to simulate NOM event conditions. This paper describes a simple brewing method that we developed and used in our recent pilot plant evaluation of a proposed DAF/Ozone/BAC process for drinking water treatment. Using this method we successfully prepared, by using fallen leaves etc. collected from the local catchment area, large quantities of a concentrated NOM stock solution with its specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA), when diluted, very close to the median SUVA of historical NOM events. The brewed solution showed broadly similar NOM characteristics to those of the raw water encountered during the pilot investigation period in terms of molecular weight distribution and fractionation. The coagulation behaviour was also examined for the spiked and non-spiked raw water.																	1606-9749					DEC	2017	17	6					1793	1800		10.2166/ws.2017.086								WOS:000417947000029						
J	Cao, QQ; Song, Y; Zhang, YR; Wang, RQ; Liu, J				Cao, Qingqing; Song, Ying; Zhang, Yiran; Wang, Renqing; Liu, Jian			Risk analysis on heavy metal contamination in sediments of rivers flowing into Nansi Lake	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												In order to understand the risk of heavy metals in sediments of the rivers flowing into Nansi Lake, 36 surface sediments were sampled from six rivers and seven heavy metals (Cr, Cu, Ni, Zn, As, Pb, and Cd) were determined. Potential ecological risk index (RI) of the six rivers showed significant differences: Xinxue River, Jiehe River, and Guangfu River were at medium potential risk, whereas the risk of Chengguo River was the lowest. Jiehe River, Xuesha River, and Jiangji River were meeting the medium potential risk at river mouths. Geo-accumulation index (I (geo)) of the seven heavy metals revealed that the contamination of Cu and Cd was more serious than most other metals in the studied areas, whereas Cr in most sites of our study was not polluted. Moreover, correlation cluster analysis demonstrated that the contamination of Cu, Ni, and Zn in six rivers was mainly caused by local emissions, whereas that of As, Pb, and Cd might come from the external inputs in different forms. Consequently, the contamination of Cu and Cd and the potential risk in Xinxue River, Jiehe River, and Guangfu River as well as the local emissions should be given more attention to safeguard the water quality of Nansi Lake and the East Route Project of South to North Water Transfer.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				DEC	2017	24	35					26910	26918		10.1007/s11356-015-4655-8								WOS:000417545800004

In this study, we aimed (i) to study the processes by which water quality might affect freshwater mussels in situ and (ii) to provide insights into the ecotoxicological significance of water pollution to natural populations in order to provide necessary information to enhance conservation strategies. M. margaritifera specimens were sampled in two close sites located upstream or downstream from an illegal dumping site. The renal transcriptome of these animals was assembled and gene transcription determined by RNA-seq. Correlations between transcription levels of each single transcript and the bioaccumulation of nine trace metals, age (estimated by sclerochronology), and condition index were determined in order to identify genes likely to respond to a specific factor. Amongst the studied metals, Cr, Zn, Cd, and Ni were the main factors correlated with transcription levels, with effects on translation, apoptosis, immune response, response to stimulus, and transport pathways. However, the main factor explaining changes in gene transcription appeared to be the age of individuals with a negative correlation with the transcription of retrotransposon-related genes. To investigate this effect further, mussels were classified into three age classes. In young, middle-aged and old animals, transcription levels were mainly explained by Cu, Zn and age, respectively. This suggests differences in the molecular responses of this species to metals during its lifetime that must be better assessed in future ecotoxicology studies.

This societal change is a consequence of a national drive toward economic prosperity. However, accelerated urban development resulting from rapid population migration from rural to urban lands has led to high levels of untreated sewage entering aquatic ecosystems directly. Consequently, many of these regions have been identified as hot spots of riverine nitrogen (N) pollution because of the increasing level of urban point-source discharge. In order to address this concern, we assessed effects of urban development on ammonia-nitrogen (AN) loads using a panel data regression model. The model, expressed as an exponential function of anthropogenic N inputs multiplied by a power function of streamflow, was applied to 20 subwatersheds of the Huai River Basin for the years 2003-2010. The results indicated that this model can account for 81% of the variation in annual AN fluxes over space and time. Application of this model to three scenarios of urban development and sewage treatment (termed urbanization priority, sustainable development, and environmental priority) suggests that future N pollution will inevitably deteriorate if current urban environmental management and investment are not significantly improved. Stronger support for environmental management is very critical to alleviate N pollution and improve water quality. More effort should focus on improving sewage treatment and the N removal rate of the current sewage system in light of the increasing degree of urbanization.					zhang, wangshou/0000-0001-9473-4555												0944-1344	1614-7499				DEC	2017	24	35					27201	27214		10.1007/s11356-017-0322-6								WOS:000417545800026

The present study quantifies exposure and health risk for the Ecuadorian population from the ingestion of arsenic in white rice. Estimated exposure is correlated with published data on tap water quality and biomarkers of exposure for the population of two towns in the metropolitan area of Quito. Estimated daily intake (EDI) of arsenic for infants living in urban areas of Ecuador is around four times that of European infants, being equal for those livings in rural areas. EDI for the population as a whole is almost twice that of Europe, but between a half and a third of that of Brazil, Bangladesh, and India. Estimated excess lifetime risk (ELTR) for adults is 3 per 10,000, while for infants varies between 10 per 10,000 in rural areas and 20 per 10,000 in urban areas. Future research on arsenic impacts on human health in Ecuador should consider in particular poor populations living in regions where environmental arsenic concentrations are highest, including cross-sectional and longitudinal epidemiologic studies.

Towfiqul; Ahmed, Nasir; Bodrud-Doza, Md.; Chu, Ronghao			Characterizing groundwater quality ranks for drinking purposes in Sylhet district, Bangladesh, using entropy method, spatial autocorrelation index, and geostatistics	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Drinking water is susceptible to the poor quality of contaminated water affecting the health of humans. Thus, it is an essential study to investigate factors affecting groundwater quality and its suitability for drinking uses. In this paper, the entropy theory, multivariate statistics, spatial autocorrelation index, and geostatistics are applied to characterize groundwater quality and its spatial variability in the Sylhet district of Bangladesh. A total of 91samples have been collected from wells (e.g., shallow, intermediate, and deep tube wells at 15-300-m depth) from the study area. The results show that NO3-, then SO42-, and As are the most contributed parameters influencing the groundwater quality according to the entropy theory. The principal component analysis (PCA) and correlation coefficient also confirm the results of the entropy theory. However, Na+ has the highest spatial autocorrelation and the most entropy, thus affecting the groundwater quality. Based on the entropy-weighted water quality index (EWQI) and groundwater quality index (GWQI) classifications, it is observed that 60.45 and 53.86% of water samples are classified as having an excellent to good qualities, while the remaining samples vary from medium to extremely poor quality domains for drinking purposes. Furthermore, the EWQI classification provides the more reasonable results than GWQIs due to its simplicity, accuracy, and ignoring of artificial weight. A Gaussian semivariogram model has been chosen to the best fit model, and groundwater quality indices have a weak spatial dependence, suggesting that both geogenic and anthropogenic factors play a pivotal role in spatial heterogeneity of groundwater quality oscillations.

Previous studies have mostly concentrated on evaluating the impacts of climate change on non-point source pollution in agricultural watersheds. Few studies have assessed the impacts of climate change on the water quality of river basins with complex point and non-point pollution sources. In view of the gap, this paper aims to establish a framework for stochastic assessment of the sensitivity of water quality to future climate change in a river basin with complex pollution sources. A sub-daily soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model was developed to simulate the discharge, transport, and transformation of nitrogen from multiple point and non-point pollution sources in the upper Huai River basin of China. A weather generator was used to produce 50 years of synthetic daily weather data series for all 25 combinations of precipitation (changes by -10, 0, 10, 20, and 30%) and temperature change (increases by 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 degrees C) scenarios. The generated daily rainfall series was disaggregated into the hourly scale and then used to drive the subdaily SWAT model to simulate the nitrogen cycle under different climate change scenarios. Our results in the study region have indicated that (1) both total nitrogen (TN) loads and concentrations are insensitive to temperature change; (2) TN loads are highly sensitive to precipitation change, while TN concentrations are moderately sensitive; (3) the impacts of climate change on TN concentrations are more spatiotemporally variable than its impacts on TN loads; and (4) wide distributions of TN loads and TN concentrations under individual climate change scenario illustrate the important role of climatic variability in affecting water quality conditions. In summary, the large variability in SWAT simulation results within and between each climate change scenario highlights the uncertainty of the impacts of climate change and the need to incorporate extreme conditions in managing water environment and developing climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				DEC	2017	24	34					26545	26561		10.1007/s11356-017-0257-y								WOS:000417372600033	28952024

The results showed that contents of heavy metals had great temporal and spatial heterogeneity among studied reservoirs. Zn, Pb, and As presented significant enrichment ratio in reservoirs of Dou Shui (DS) and Feng Tang (FT), as well as Ti in reservoirs of DZ and GT. The content of Cd in reservoir of FT reservoirs was characterized with high health risk with the significantly highest value of 52.43 mg/kg. Furthermore, Pb was identified with high health risk in reservoirs of SFM, Ouyang Hai (OYH), FT, and DS, and As was in OYH and ZX. Multivariate statistical analysis suggested high consistency in the variations of Cr, Ni, and Cu; moreover, Cd, Zn, and Pb were characterized with great homogeneity in their sources. In addition, agricultural activities might exert less effect on variations of heavy metals in studied reservoirs, considered that there was a weak relationship between heavy metals and nutrients. These results could improve our understanding of the spatial variations of heavy metals and their potential sources in reservoirs in this ecologically fragile region.

Although covers containing geomembranes such as high-density polyethylene (HDPE) exhibit the attributes to be highly effective, there are few, if any, published studies monitoring their performance at full-scale WRPs. In 2011, a HDPE cover was installed over the Scotchtown Summit WRP in Nova Scotia, Canada, and extensive field performance monitoring was conducted over the next five years. A range of parameters within the atmosphere, cover, waste rock, groundwater and surface water, were monitored and integrated into a comprehensive hydrogeochemical conceptual model to assess (i) atmospheric ingress to the waste rock, (ii) waste rock acidity and depletion and (iii) evolution of groundwater and surface water quality. Results demonstrate that the cover is effective and meeting site closure objectives. Depletion in oxygen influx resulted in slower sulphide oxidation and AMD generation, while a significant reduction in water influx (i. e. 512 to 50 mm/year) resulted in diminished AMD release. Consistent improvements in groundwater quality (decrease in sulphate and metals; increase in pH) beneath and downgradient of the WRP were observed. Protection and/or significant improvement in surface water quality was evident in all surrounding watercourses due to the improved groundwater plume and elimination of contaminated runoff over previously exposed waste rock. A variably saturated flow and contaminant transport model is currently being developed to predict long-term cover system performance.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				DEC	2017	24	34					26744	26762		10.1007/s11356-017-0288-4								WOS:000417372600049

In this study, the impact of geothermal waste water on surface water has been investigated in the up-Buyuk Menderes River, Turkey. Thermal return water from district heating and from thermal bath in the Sandikli region were the most important source of major solutes and trace elements to the up-Buyuk Menderes River and tributaries. The thermal contribution causes a drastic increase in Na, SO4 ions, EC, and temperature of surface waters. The concentrations of As, Al, B, Fe, Cr, Li, S, P, Pb, U, Mn, and Zn are increasing dramatically downstream of thermal water inputs in the Kufi Creek tributary. In addition to natural thermal water inputs, water quality was impacted by anthropogenic trace and major element inputs from surface waters. The increased of some trace elements (Al, As, B, Cu, Cd, Fe, Mn, P, U) in surface water are related to anthropogenic activities such as agricultural activities, sewage effluents, and stockyards in the study area. Additionally, surface water quality of the up-Buyuk Menderes River and tributaries was evaluated according to standards given by the Environmental Protection Agency of both Turkey and USA.

Designing a watershed scorecard as a performance evaluation tool for Ur River watershed, Tikamgarh District, Madhya Pradesh	INTERNATIONAL SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION RESEARCH												The study is an attempt to design a watershed scorecard by identifying and evaluating selected set of indicators, such as surface water quality, ground water quality, soil condition, agriculture condition, and forest condition, which accurately reflect the health of the watershed. Ur River Watershed in Tikamgarh District, Madhya Pradesh was taken as a case study to assess the watershed health. Evaluation was done by calculating different indices for the selected set of indicators and comparing them with the National standards and guidelines. Based on the performance of each indicator, the grades were assigned to the indicators which helped in designing the watershed scorecard. The results revealed that within the watershed, the forest and soil conditions need a considerable plan for improvement in order to maintain the ecosystem whereas the surface water quality, groundwater quality and the agricultural conditions requires protection as well as enhancement in certain areas.

However, the installation of these systems is outpacing the research regarding the comparative effectiveness of specific design features. Monitoring is a required component of many stormwater regulatory programs, and can provide vital feedback to designers and engineers, lower costs, and determine long-term effectiveness and maintenance requirements, yet very few bioretention systems are monitored. For professionals that are interested in performance assessment, there are very few descriptions of monitoring infrastructure for small drainage areas that are detailed enough to replicate during new bioretention construction projects. This research describes the innovative infrastructure used at the University of Vermont (UVM) Bioretention Laboratory to accurately measure pollutant mass load reduction by roadside bioretention systems. The inflow and outflow monitoring infrastructure designs are provided in enough detail to be adapted and/or replicated in other field settings. The steps taken to integrate the infrastructure into new construction are also provided. Ninety degree v-notch and compound weirs were installed at the inflow and outflow of eight bioretention systems, respectively. Differential pressure transducers related water height to flow rate. A time-based discrete sampling methodology was tested and found to adequately sample multiple points throughout the inflow and outflow hydrographs. This allowed for the comparison of pollutant mass removal among different bioretention designs on an equal volume basis.

Effect of Artificial Circulation on the Removal Kinetics of Cyanobacteria in a Hypereutrophic Shallow Lake	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												This study consisted of two parts. First, pre-aeration tests were conducted to assess the space-time variability of water quality in a shallow lake. Chlorophyll-a concentration and cyanobacteria cell density varied from 40 to 80 mu g L-1 and 0.5-2.0 x 10(6) cells/mL, respectively. In the second and major part of the study, aeration tests were carried out to investigate the influence of artificial circulation on the flow hydrodynamics and water quality. Comparison of the measurements taken inside and outside the bubble plumes showed that artificial circulation promotes a faster decay of chlorophyll-a concentration over time. First-order kinetics fitted well the time-variation of depth-averaged chlorophyll-a, cyanobacteria, and pheophytin-a. The net reduction rate of chlorophyll-a and cyanobacteria could be described as a function of a dimensionless parameter beta that controls bubble plume hydrodynamics or, alternatively, as a function of the rate of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy epsilon. This net reduction rate of chlorophyll-a could also be linearly related to the net growth rate of pheophytin-a. This suggests that algal removal was caused mainly by cellular death. Finally, the relationships obtained in this study were used to predict the impact of artificial circulation on algal removal in water-supply reservoirs.

Good performance was achieved with a hydraulic loading rate of 0.1 m(3)/m(2).d, indicating that the effluent water quality could meet the primary grade A values as put forth by the 'Cities Sewage Treatment Plant Pollutant Discharge Standard' (GB18918-2002). In addition, the results of three inflow total phosphorus (TP) concentrations (5 mg L-1, 15 mg L-1, and 30 mg L-1) indicated that high-levels of phosphorus were more advantageous in regards to improving the activity of denitrifying bacteria in soil and strengthening the effect of nitrogen removal, suggesting that the effluent total nitrogen (TN) concentration could meet the primary grade A standard (TN <= 15 mg L-1). It was further observed that soil depth was less crucial when inflow TP concentrations were higher. Therefore, the results indicated that inflow phosphorus concentrations could greatly influence nitrogen migration and transformation in deep subsurface wastewater infiltration systems.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				DEC	2017	76	11					3086	3093		10.2166/wst.2017.483								WOS:000417163700021	29210694

Riparian and microhabitat factors determine the structure of the EPT community in Andean headwater rivers of Ecuador	ECOHYDROLOGY												This research was conducted in the high-Andean basin of the Zhurucay River in southern Ecuador. In 4 river reaches, 19 sampling campaigns were conducted per reach spread over a period of 35months. The biotic samples were selected in the periods with greatest flow stability. Parallel to each sampling, 37 environmental variables grouped into 3 factors (riparian corridor, hydromorphology, and water quality) were recorded. The study aimed to analyse during periods of stable flow the influence of these environmental factors on the structure and density of the EPT community (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera) in a quasi-pristine aquatic ecosystem. Multivariate statistical analysis revealed that the Froude number, gravel type, and width/depth ratio are the most relevant hydromorphological variables explaining variations in EPT density. Xiphocentronidae, Contulma, and Helicopsyche were observed to have a relationship with the order of the river, while Ochrotrichia, Nectopsyche, and Phylloicus varied with the type of riparian vegetation. Phylloicus, Ochrotrichia, and Nectopsyche were common in lentic sites, while the proportion of gravel and the width/depth ratio restricted the genus Helicopsyche. The only relevant water quality factor was the total phosphorus, which was related with 2 taxa. In conclusion, although macroinvertebrates are currently employed in water quality studies, riparian vegetation and hydromorphological factors are determinant for their communities in pristine Andean rivers. Such factors are therefore crucial in the study of environmental flows and the assessment of the ecological integrity.																	1936-0584	1936-0592				DEC	2017	10	8							UNSP e1894	10.1002/eco.1894								WOS:000417099800009

Ecosystem services mapping for detection of bundles, synergies and trade-offs: Examples from two Norwegian municipalities	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES												The main objective of this work was to analyse how increased harvesting for bioenergy production might affect other Ecosystem Services (ES) in two Norwegian municipalities (Ringsaker and Voss). The aim was to identify locations where synergies or conflicts between ES could be expected. The spatial distribution of eight different ES (3 provision, 3 regulation and 2 cultural services) was modelled using information provided by land use spatial databases and additional data sources. Model parameters were set by integrating existing research and expert knowledge. Maps showing the level of provision of ES were analysed using a moving window to analyse scale dependence in the spatial distribution of ES provision. Map algebra was then used to identify areas providing multiple ES, thus defining the most important areas on which to focus the management of both synergies and trade-offs. Finally, specific 'binary bundles' maps, where bioenergy provision was compared with each of the other ES, were developed. The methodology proved its utility to assess the compatibility of bioenergy uses with other services. This straightforward approach is readily replicable in other regions and can be used as a decision support tool for planning and designing provision areas, and to ensure sustainable forest management approaches.

High sedimentary oxygen consumption indicates that sewage input from small islands drives benthic community shifts on overfished reefs	ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION												Small-island coral reef ecosystems are usually closely coupled to the activities of human inhabitants. Ahus Island (Papua New Guinea) is an isolated Pacific island with a rapidly growing population, heavy reliance on marine resources and limited infrastructure. We hypothesized that untreated sewage was driving distinct benthic assemblages around Ahus and neighbouring uninhabited Onetah. At sites with varying proximities to beach toilets, fore-reef herbivorous fish biomass and benthic composition were measured alongside reef-flat sedimentary oxygen consumption (SOC); a high SOC rate reflects high organic input into coastal waters, thus serving as a potential indicator of sewage input. Fish biomass was low (17.1-20.1 g m(-2)), but consistent between sites. However, cyanobacteria dominated the fore-reef closest to toilets (62 +/- 3%) with highest reef-flat SOC, whereas hard corals dominated furthest away (63 +/- 1%), where SOC was lowest. To our knowledge, this is the first study that used SOC to detect local differences in sewage pollution. The results indicate that whilst corals can maintain their dominance on overfished reefs, additional sewage stress may drive pronounced benthic shifts, highlighting the urgency to improve small-island waste management.

J	Turner, RE				Turner, R. Eugene			The mineral sediment loading of the modern Mississippi River Delta: what is the restoration baseline?	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												A restoration baseline for river deltas establishes a framework for achieving goals that can be thwarted by choosing an improper historical background. The problem addressed here is identify the size of the modern Mississippi River delta that restoration should use as that baseline. The sediment loading to the Mississippi River main stem delta fluctuated over the last 160 years with a consequential dependent plasticity in delta size. A visual time series of the delta size is presented, and the area: sediment loading ratio is calculated. This ratio ranged from 1.8 to 3.9 km(2) per Mmt sediment y(-1) during the pre-European colonization of the watershed in the 1800s, a maximum size in the 1930s, and then lower after soil conservation and dam construction decades later. This land building rate is similar to the 1.3 to 3.7 km(2) per Mmt sediment y(-1) for the Wax Lake and Atchafalaya sub-deltas located to the west, which receives some of the Mississippi River sediment and water from the main channel below St. Francisville, LA. The significance to restoration of delta land lost since the 1930s is that the baseline for the 1930s was conditioned on previous sediment loading that has since declined. Most sediment is trapped in the delta, and so the existing situation is close to a zero-sum land balance. The restoration potential should be based on the delta land area that could be built from the current sediment loading, not from those of the era during peak agricultural expansion and soil erosion in the watershed. Sediment diversions upstream will, therefore, deplete sediment supply downstream where delta land will be lost. The choice of which baseline is used can be seen as a choice between unrealistic perceptions that leads to unachievable goals and agency failures, or, the realism of a delta size limited by current sediment loading.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				DEC	2017	21	6					867	872		10.1007/s11852-017-0547-z								WOS:000416870600012

Estimation of potential zones for offshore mariculture in the Indian Sea using geographical information system as a management tool	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												Coastal mariculture is now facing tremendous pressures, especially from the anthropogenic activities, variable environment, and multi-user conflict. Hence, offshore mariculture is envisioned to enhance the production by promoting the commercial farming (floating cages) of cobia (Rachycentron canadum) and other fin fishes. Essential environmental parameters for mariculture have been selected and converted into thematic layers using Geographical Information System (GIS) tool. Weights of relative importance were assigned to each layer and integrated together through overlay analysis to provide a final model suggesting possible offshore floating marine fish cage deployment sites. In the present study, it is estimated that from 368,009 km(2) area within 100 m depth of Indian Exclusive Economic Zone available for mariculture activities, about 161,188 km(2) area is appropriate for deploying cages. There are 76,396 km(2) of highly suitable and approximately 84,792 km(2) of suitable areas available for mariculture in India including Andaman & Nicobar and Lakshadweep Islands. Analysis of variance (ANOVA-one way) showed significant (p < 0.05) spatial variation for sea surface current, total suspended matter, and chlorophyll-a. This study is an attempt to integrate the weighing criteria and GIS to derive a suitable criterion for deployment of floating cages in the offshore environment, which could serve as a model for similar cases, particularly in the maritime nations for sustainable mariculture.

The in-situ data of water nutrient concentration was collected during the period 2002-2010 by COMAPS from the coastal waters of Gujarat and Maharashtra for the development of algorithms as a part of the application of remote sensing for biochemical cycling in the ocean. Multiple regression analysis was used to develop models for the nutrients and suspended sediments and the results showed the strong correlation between the water nutrients under study and suspended sediment variables with the remote sensing data, having the validated R-2 value of 0.7472 (Total Nitrogen),0.8744 (Total Phosphorus) and 0.971 (Suspended Sediment) respectively in marine waters. The models helped understand the seasonal variability and were also applied to one of the latest sensor VIIRS, which came up with the same results as those derived from MODIS. Thus the models can be used for the real time monitoring of water quality and for the development of an alert system using remote sensing data from both MODIS and VIIRS sensor systems.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				DEC	2017	21	6					917	927		10.1007/s11852-017-0561-1								WOS:000416870600017

Evaluation of water quality is normally based on time consuming and expensive in situ measurements. Remotely sensed data is an efficient alternative for field monitoring because of its spatial and temporal coverage. In this study, remote sensing imagery combined with in situ measurements of water quality were used to estimate an empirical relationship between water surface reflectance and water quality parameters including water turbidity and Total Suspended Sediment (TSS). Surface reflectance values is obtained from MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard the Aqua satellite. The empirical equations were derived from data over summers 2011-13 and show high correlation coefficients of equal to 0.83 and 0.87 for TSS and turbidity respectively. The validity of the proposed equations was tested for summer 2014 data. The NRMSE for prediction of measured data by the proposed equations are 0.36 and 0.3 for TSS and turbidity. Remotely sensed data was also used to produce water quality maps to improve our understanding of the spatiotemporal variations of Fox River turbid plume. The proposed approach can be extended to other coastal regions of Great Lakes and provide a framework to study pollution transportation in coastal areas.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				DEC	2017	21	6					939	950		10.1007/s11852-017-0564-y								WOS:000416870600019

Although riverbeds are known to attenuate nitrate, it is not known if large woody debris (LWD) can increase this ecosystem service through enhanced hyporheic exchange and streambed residence time. Over a year, we monitored the surface water and pore water chemistry at 200 points along a similar to 50 m reach of a lowland sandy stream with three natural LWD structures. We directly injected N-15-nitrate at 108 locations within the top 1.5 m of the streambed to quantify in situ denitrification, anammox and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia, which, on average, contributed 85, 10 and 5% of total nitrate reduction, respectively. Total nitrate reducing activity ranged from 0 to 16 A mu M h(-1) and was highest in the top 30 cm of the stream bed. Depth, ambient nitrate and water residence time explained 44% of the observed variation in nitrate reduction; fastest rates were associated with slow flow and shallow depths. In autumn, when the river was in spate, nitrate reduction (in situ and laboratory measures) was enhanced around the LWD compared with non-woody areas, but this was not seen in the spring and summer. Overall, there was no significant effect of LWD on nitrate reduction rates in surrounding streambed sediments, but higher pore water nitrate concentrations and shorter residence times, close to LWD, indicated enhanced delivery of surface water into the streambed under high flow. When hyporheic exchange is too strong, overall nitrate reduction is inhibited due to short flow-paths and associated high oxygen concentrations.

The results suggested that almost 60% of these water bodies were supersaturated with CO2 with respect to atmosphere, and the collected reservoirs samples exhibited higher mean pCO(2) than lakes. The mean pCO(2) in fresh water lakes was about 3.5 times of the value in saline lakes. The lakes and reservoirs were divided into five groups (Inner Mongolia -Xinjiang plateau region, Tibetan Plateau region, Northeastern plain and mountainous region, Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau region, and Eastern plain region). The Yunnan- Guizhou Plateau region showed the highest pCO(2) compared with other regions, most likely due to the typical karst landforms, karst processes may promote aqueous CO2 concentration, and karstification has a significant effect on the capture of atmospheric CO2. Inner Mongolia -Xinjiang plateau and Tibetan Plateau region reserviors showed negative CO2 flux to atmosphere, other waters in this study all supersaturated with CO2 with respect to the atmosphere. A which We analyzed the relationship between pCO(2) and environmental variables, and results showed that some indicators had correlations with pCO(2) in individual region such as total phosphorus, dissolved organic matter, and total suspended solids, but the relationship could not be observed with all surveyed waters. This indicated that it might be much more effective in a smaller regional scale than the broadened scale when the environmental factors were used as the predictor of pCO(2) in lakes. Therefore, the common algorithm that extrapolates CO2 concentration or emission flux from the study region to a wider scale might not be accurate because of the changes in the environmental and water quality conditions.

WQI was calculated using 14 physico-chemical parameters while HPI determination used nine heavy metals like As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb and Zn. WQI revealed that Kanjli wetland contained medium quality water (irrigation and aquatic life). Cr, Cd and Co exceeded desirable limits of World Health Organization (WHO, Guidelines for drinking-water quality, World Health Organization, Geneva, 2011) and Indian drinking water standard (2012) during all the three seasons (monsoon, post monsoon and winter). HPI values from all sites exceeded critical pollution index value of 100 during monsoon season. Few sites were unsuitable for normal fish life as per ATI. The study recommends planned spatial, temporal and periodic monitoring of wetland using WQI and HPI to sustain good water quality (drinking, irrigation and aquatic life).																	0007-4861	1432-0800				DEC	2017	99	6					735	742		10.1007/s00128-017-2194-3								WOS:000416178800014	29038941

In search of an alternative organic fertilizer for fish culture, the nutrient potential of HU was evaluated. Fries of Indian carps and larvae of freshwater prawn were reared for 120 days under six conditions: (a) aerated and (b) non-aerated fresh HU (0.01%), (c) cattle manure (CM; 1.8 kg tank(-1)), mixed treatment with CM and HU under (d) iso-phosphorus and (e) iso-nitrogenous condition and (f) control. Monitoring of water quality and biological parameters revealed that total fish yield was the highest in CM (621.5 g tank(-1)) followed by mixed treatments under iso-nitrogenous (428 g tank(-1)) and iso-phosphorus (333 g tank(-1)) conditions, aerated HU (321 g tank(-1)) and HU (319 g tank(-1)). The gross primary productivity (GPP) in HU was satisfactory (601.8 mg C m(-2) h(-1)) and superior to all but CM treatment. The abundance of heterotrophic bacteria (HB) was highest in CM and lowest in HU. Both GPP and HB population were correlated positively with fish yield per tank. Although pH in all treatments remained high (pH 8.4-8.9), no ammonia toxicity was observed. No E. coli infestation in any fish muscle was encountered. The concentrations of cadmium and lead in fish muscle were within respective safe level. The study established that high fertilizer potential of HU could be exploited as an alternative organic fertilizer or as a candidate to be blended with cattle manure.

Evaluation of the water quality of the upper reaches of the main Southern Brazil river (Iguacu river) through in situ exposure of the native siluriform Rhamdia quelen in cages	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Increase in industrial growth, urban and agricultural pollution, with consequent impacts on aquatic ecosystems are a major focus of research worldwide. Still, not many studies assess the impacts of contamination through in situ studies, using native species, also considering the influence of seasonality on their responses. This study aimed to evaluate the water quality of the basin of the Upper Iguacu River, the main source of water supply to Curitiba, a major capital of Southern Brazil, and its Metropolitan area. Several biomarkers were evaluated after in situ exposure of the native catfish Rhamdia queien inside cages for 7 days. Ten study sites were chosen along the basin, based on a diffuse gradient of contamination, corresponding to regions upstream, downstream, and within "great Curitiba". In each site, fish were exposed in Summer and Winter. The complex mixture of contaminants of this hydrographic basin generated mortality, and ion-, osmoregulatory and respiratory disturbances in the catfish as, for example, reduction of plasma osmolality and ionic concentrations, increased hematocrit levels and gill water content, altered branchial and renal activities of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, as well as raised levels of plasma cortisol and glucose. Biomarkers were mostly altered in fish exposed in Great Curitiba and immediately downstream. There was a notable influence of season on the responses of the jundia. A multivariate redundancy analysis revealed that the best environmental variables explained 30% of the variation in biomarkers after controlling for spatial autocorrelation. Thus, this approach and the chosen parameters can be satisfactorily used to evaluate contamination environments with complex mixtures of contaminants, in other urban basins as well.

Aquatic eutrophication indicators in LCA: Methodological challenges illustrated using a case study in New Zealand	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Objective: The objective of this work was to determine the effects and implications of generic and site-specific aquatic eutrophication potential indicators in the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of livestock farm systems using a New Zealand (NZ) lake catchment case study.& para;& para;Method: Average dairy and sheep & beef farm systems in the Lake Taupo catchment were studied. Emissions of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) to waterways, and ammonia and nitrogen oxides to air from these farms were calculated using the site-specific OVERSEER (R) nutrient budget model. These emissions data were then used to calculate the increase in nutrients in water bodies and aquatic Eutrophication indicators with a range of Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) methods.& para;& para;Results: Eutrophication indicator results varied considerably depending on the environmental mechanisms modelled by the LCIA method for the fate of N and P, accentuated by different choices for the inventory modelling. Using default emission factors instead of site-specific ones overestimated eutrophication impact results. The most recent methods are not only spatially-explicit and applicable beyond Europe, but they also account for more environmental mechanisms for the fate of the nutrients, giving relatively lower calculated impact results. However, the appropriate scale and spatial resolution is still a crucial question to address for these methods since they greatly affect results. Regarding eutrophication damage assessment, when the actual background nutrient concentration is very low, the end-point assessment method for freshwater eutrophication is not applicable. In this case, LCA fails to account for a high standard of water quality that is in a near-pristine state, but deteriorating.& para;& para;Conclusions: The inventory of nutrient flows at a farm scale and fate factors modelled at a catchment scale should be site-specific. Freshwater eutrophication indicators should be based on a site-specific (and globally-valid) LCIA model rather than a generic one. Currently-accepted freshwater eutrophication indicators focus only on P, thus capturing only part of the problem for freshwater bodies that are co-limited by N and P (in terms of algal growth) such as Lake Taupo in NZ. Lake Taupo water quality concerns and regulations are not focused on P, but solely on N due to increasing N levels over time. Conclusions from this study are valid beyond NZ and beyond agricultural systems. Future work needs to investigate coupling N and P fate modelling based on the most recent globally-valid and spatially-explicit LCIA methods. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We focus on total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and dissolved silica (DSi) inputs to the Bay of Bengal Large Marine Ecosystem (BOB LME) in the years 2000, 2030, and 2050. In 2000, rivers exported 7.1 Tg N and 1.5 Tg P to the BOB LME. Three rivers (Ganges, Godavari, Irrawaddy) account for 75-80% of the total river export of N and P. For 2050, we calculate an increase in river export of N to 8.6 Tg, while P export stabilizes at the 2000 level. Future trends are the net effect of increasing river export of dissolved N (by 40%) and P (by 80%), and decreasing river export of particulate N and P. The increases in dissolved N and P loads are associated primarily with increased N and P losses from agriculture and sewage systems. The decreasing export of particulate N and P is associated with damming of rivers and increased human water consumption. There are large differences in nutrient export among rivers. Rivers draining into the western BOB LME generally export more N and P than eastern BOB LME rivers. Most N and P in western BOB LME rivers are from anthropogenic sources. Future increases in dissolved inorganic N and P (DIN and DIP) export can be large for individual rivers: up to more than a factor of five for DIP and more than a doubling for DIN. The calculated nutrient export ratios (N and P relative to DSi) indicate an increasing risk for blooms of non-siliceous algal species, which can potentially produce toxins and otherwise disrupt coastal ecosystems. Our results indicate that basin-specific management may be the most effective approach towards reducing the risk of coastal eutrophication in the BOB LME.

Widespread legacy brine contamination from oil production reduces survival of chorus frog larvae	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Advances in drilling techniques have facilitated a rapid increase in hydrocarbon extraction from energy shales, including the Williston Basin in central North America. This area overlaps with the Prairie Pothole Region, a region densely populated with wetlands that provide numerous ecosystem services. Historical (legacy) disposal practices often released saline co-produced waters (brines) with high chloride concentrations, affecting wetland water quality directly or persisting in sediments. Despite the potential threat of brine contamination to aquatic habitats, there has been little research into its ecological effects. We capitalized on a gradient of legacy brine-contaminated wetlands in northeast Montana to conduct laboratory experiments to assess variation in survival of larval Boreal Chorus Frogs (Pseudacris maculata) reared on sediments from 3 local wetlands and a control source. To help provide environmental context for the experiment, we also measured chloride concentrations in 6 brine-contaminated wetlands in our study area, including the 2 contaminated sites used for sediment exposures. Survival of frog larvae during 46- and 55-day experiments differed by up to 88% among sediment sources (Site Model) and was negatively correlated with potential chloride exposure (Chloride Model). Five of the 6 contaminated wetlands exceeded the U.S. EPA acute benchmark for chloride in freshwater (860 mg/L) and all exceeded the chronic benchmark (230 mg/L). However, the Wetland Site model explained more variation in survival than the Chloride Model, suggesting that chloride concentration alone does not fully reflect the threat of contamination to aquatic species. Because the profiles of brine-contaminated sediments are complex, further surveys and experiments are needed across a broad range of conditions, especially where restoration or remediation actions have reduced brine-contamination. Information provided by this study can help quantify potential ecological threats and help land managers prioritize conservation strategies as part of responsible and sustainable energy development.

We assessed catchments surrounding the Gold Ridge gold mine (Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands) and found that extensive changes in river course, and water and sediment quality have occurred downstream of the gold mine since its development. Sediment run-off from exposed areas associated with the mine pit has increased, elevating turbidity (up to 2450 NTU) and metal and arsenic levels, with levels of the latter being up to 0.141 mg/L in surface waters and 265 mg/kg in sediments. An overfull, inoperative tailings storage facility associated with the currently inactive gold mine with fluctuating arsenic levels (up to 0.087 mg/L in the water; 377 mg/kg in the sediment) presents an ongoing threat to the environment. Arsenic, due to its toxicity, appears to be the greatest threat, with sediment and water guideline levels in rivers exceeded 10-fold and exceeded nearly 20-fold in the tailings dam sediments. Despite elevated metal and arsenic content in the area, no toxic inorganic arsenic was found to have bioaccumulated in locally harvested food. In summary, the natural environment surrounding the Gold Ridge mine has been modified substantially and requires an ongoing monitoring program to ensure the ecosystem services of food and water for the local communities continue to be safe. This study informs not only the local area but also provides a microcosm of the broader global challenges facing the regulation of extractive industries in proximity to subsistence communities.

Study on the aquatic macrophytes decomposition may help reusing the aquatic macrophytes litters, as well as controlling the water pollution caused by the decomposition process. This study verified that the decomposition processes of three different kinds of aquatic macrophytes (water hyacinth, hydrilla and cattail) could exert significant influences on water quality of the receiving water, including the change extent of pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), the contents of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus, etc. The influence of decomposition on water quality and the concentrations of the released chemical materials both followed the order of water hyacinth > hydrilla > cattail. Greater influence was obtained with higher dosage of plant litter addition. The influence also varied with sediment addition. Moreover, nitrogen released from the decomposition of water hyacinth and hydrilla were mainly NH3-N and organic nitrogen while those from cattail litter included organic nitrogen and NO3--N. After the decomposition, the average carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N) in the receiving water was about 2.6 (water hyacinth), 5.3 (hydrilla) and 20.3 (cattail). Therefore, cattail litter might be a potential plant carbon source for denitrification in ecological system of a constructed wetland. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aims to evaluate the response of mitochondrial activity in spores of the autochthonous fern Cyathea costaricensis as a bioassessment tool concurrently with land use and physicochemical evaluation in 11 sites along Bobos River, Veracruz, Mexico, to assess river water quality. Bobos River is located in the Nautla basin, northeastern Veracruz (Mexico); the upper river runs through a protected natural area (Filobobos River and adjacent areas). The study involved three monitoring periods: February, June and September 2014. In each study site, physicochemical water quality parameters were recorded to calculate the Water Quality Index (WQI); also, study sites were characterized in terms of land use. Water samples were collected to perform bioassays where spores of C costaricensis were exposed to samples to assess mitochondrial activity; a positive control exposure test was run under controlled conditions to maximize mitochondrial activity. A Principal Component Analysis was performed to correlate land-use attributes with environmental variables and mitochondrial activity. Three river sections were identified: the upper portion was characterized by the dominance of native vegetation, the highest WQI (in September), and the lowest mitochondrial activity (63.87%-77.47%), related to the geological nature of the basin and high hardness levels. Mitochondrial activity peaked in September (98.32% +/- 9.01), likely resulting from nutrient enrichment in the rainy season, and was lowest in February (74.54% +/- 1.60) (p < 0.05). Mitochondrial activity was found to be a good benchmark for the assessment of water quality, reflecting the effects of physicochemical characteristics. Mitochondrial activity showed changes along the river and between seasons, associated with environmental characteristics such as land use and the geological nature of the basin, as well as with those related to human impacts.

Thus, this study aimed to assess the water quality of two sites of the Ilha River (source and mouth, S1 and S2 respectively) in five sampling periods using water physicochemical and microbiological analyses, biomarkers, such as condition factor, micronucleus test, gill histopathological analysis, and metal bioaccumulation in the native fish Bryconamericus iheringii. Mean values of BOD5, thermotolerant coliforms, aluminum, iron and lead exceeded the limits established by the Brazilian legislation for surface waters at both sampling sites. Significant higher micronucleus, nuclear abnormalities and mucous cells frequencies were found at S2 in, at least, one sampling period, whereas fish from S1 presented significant lower condition factor, higher frequencies of lamellar alterations and higher concentrations of chromium and nickel in muscle. Additionally, concentrations of cadmium, chromium and lead in fish muscle exceeded the limits considered safe for human consumption at both sites in at least one sampling period. Data from our study evidenced the mouth of the Ilha River suffers from point genotoxic effects, whereas the source is also contaminated by metals, despite being located in an area under minor anthropic activities.

J	Opare, S				Opare, Service			Practising the past in the present: using Ghanaian indigenous methods for water quality determination in the contemporary era	ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY												Surface water sources remain the dominant sources of water supply for a significant proportion of poor communities. These water supply sources tend to have low water quality levels. Application of water quality determination and purification measures could minimize water-related diseases associated with direct consumption of water with poor quality levels. A number of simple measures have been devised and utilized by indigenous communities based on their resource conservation knowledge to improve water quality levels. However, scientific approaches that are more in tune with modern demands for reliability and exactness are the preferred, mainstream approaches for determining water quality. Growing recognition of the relevance of indigenous knowledge has led to renewed interest in the possibility of utilizing it for such tasks. Research conducted in 2007 and 2008 in two indigenous communities in Ghana revealed a diversity of indigenous methods for water quality determination and purification including straining, settling and use of special seeds which could still be useful in this contemporary era. This paper recommends that knowledge co-production and transdisciplinary approaches be employed to enable indigenous communities and experts to collaborate and develop measures that tap both knowledge systems for improving water quality levels for human use.																	1387-585X	1573-2975				DEC	2017	19	6					2217	2236		10.1007/s10668-016-9851-2								WOS:000414459300005						
J	Sheikhzeinoddin, A; Esmaeili, A				Sheikhzeinoddin, Azar; Esmaeili, Abdoulkarim			Ecological and economic impacts of different irrigation and fertilization practices: case study of a watershed in the southern Iran	ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY												Best management practices, such as conservation tillage, the optimum level of irrigation, fertilization, are frequently used to reduce non-point source pollution from agricultural land and improve water quality. In this study, we used the soil and water assessment tool to model the impacts of different irrigation (adjusted to crop need), cropping and fertilization practices on total nitrogen loss. The economic impacts of these practices on crop net farm income were also evaluated. For this purpose, the model was calibrated through comparing model outputs with observations to ensure reliable hydrologic, crop yield and nitrate leaching simulations. The results showed that by reducing water or fertilizer or combination of both, we can reduce nitrate leaching. For wheat and corn, the best scenario was S1n1 (combination between reduction by 10 % of water and nitrogen fertilizer application, simultaneously) and S2n3 (combination of 20 and 30 % reduction in water and fertilizer application), respectively. These scenarios are both ecologically and economically desirable. Also, decreasing nitrogen fertilization by 50 % for corn would decrease the nitrate pollution from 101.1 to 32.3 kg N ha(-1); therefore, this strategy is ecologically desirable but economically unsound. So, there are opportunities for environmental decision makers to encourage farmers to implement these strategies. Also, since the nitrogen leaching cannot decrease without a reduction in net farm income for crops such as corn; hence, the losses of farmers should be compensated.																	1387-585X	1573-2975				DEC	2017	19	6					2499	2515		10.1007/s10668-016-9868-6								WOS:000414459300020

Although a key feature of urban areas is their higher temperature (urban heat islands), adaptive thermal evolution in organisms inhabiting urban areas has rarely been studied. We tested for evolution of a higher heat tolerance (CTMAX) in urban populations of the water flea Daphnia magna, a keystone grazer in freshwater ecosystems, by carrying out a common garden experiment at two temperatures (20 degrees C and 24 degrees C) with genotypes of 13 natural populations ordered along a well-defined urbanization gradient. We also assessed body size and haemoglobin concentration to identify underlying physiological drivers of responses in CTMAX. We found a higher CTMAX in animals isolated from urban compared to rural habitats and in animals reared at higher temperatures. We also observed substantial genetic variation in thermal tolerance within populations. Overall, smaller animals were more heat tolerant. While urban animals mature at smaller size, the effect of urbanization on thermal tolerance is only in part caused by reductions in body size. Although urban Daphnia contained higher concentrations of haemoglobin, this did not contribute to their higher CTMAX. Our results provide evidence of adaptive thermal evolution to urbanization in the water flea Daphnia. In addition, our results show both evolutionary potential and adaptive plasticity in rural as well as urban Daphnia populations, facilitating responses to warming. Given the important ecological role of Daphnia in ponds and lakes, these adaptive responses likely impact food web dynamics, top-down control of algae, water quality, and the socio-economic value of urban ponds.																	1354-1013	1365-2486				DEC	2017	23	12					5218	5227		10.1111/gcb.13784								WOS:000414969000022	28614592

Unexpected stasis in a changing world: Lake nutrient and chlorophyll trends since 1990	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												The United States (U.S.) has faced major environmental changes in recent decades, including agricultural intensification and urban expansion, as well as changes in atmospheric deposition and climate-all of which may influence eutrophication of freshwaters. However, it is unclear whether or how water quality in lakes across diverse ecological settings has responded to environmental change. We quantified water quality trends in 2913 lakes using nutrient and chlorophyll (Chl) observations from the Lake Multi-Scaled Geospatial and Temporal Database of the Northeast U.S. (LAGOS-NE), a collection of preexisting lake data mostly from state agencies. LAGOS-NE was used to quantify whether lake water quality has changed from 1990 to 2013, and whether lake-specific or regional geophysical factors were related to the observed changes. We modeled change through time using hierarchical linear models for total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), stoichiometry (TN:TP), and Chl. Both the slopes (percent change per year) and intercepts (value in 1990) were allowed to vary by lake and region. Across all lakes, TN declined at a rate of 1.1% year(-1), while TP, TN:TP, and Chl did not change. A minority (7%-16%) of individual lakes had changing nutrients, stoichiometry, or Chl. Of those lakes that changed, we found differences in the geospatial variables that were most related to the observed change in the response variables. For example, TN and TN:TP trends were related to region-level drivers associated with atmospheric deposition of N; TP trends were related to both lake and region-level drivers associated with climate and land use; and Chl trends were found in regions with high air temperature at the beginning of the study period. We conclude that despite large environmental change and management efforts over recent decades, water quality of lakes in the Midwest and Northeast U.S. has not overwhelmingly degraded or improved.

A highly specific Escherichia coil qPCR and its comparison with existing methods for environmental waters	WATER RESEARCH												The presence of Escherichia coil in environmental waters is considered as evidence of faecal contamination and is therefore commonly used as an indicator in both water quality and food safety analysis. The long period of time between sample collection and obtaining results from existing culture based methods means that contamination events may already impact public health by the time they are detected. The adoption of molecular based methods for E. coil could significantly reduce the time to detection. A new quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay was developed to detect the ybbW gene sequence, which was found to be 100% exclusive and inclusive (specific and sensitive) for E. coil and directly compared for its ability to quantify E. coil in environmental waters against colony counts, quantitative real-time NASBA (qNASBA) targeting clpB and qPCR targeting uidA. Of the 87 E. coil strains tested, 100% were found to be ybbW positive, 94.2% were culture positive, 100% were clpB positive and 98.9% were uidA positive. The qPCR assays had a linear range of quantification over several orders of magnitude, and had high amplification efficiencies when using single isolates as a template. This compared favourably with qNASBA which showed poor linearity and amplification efficiency. When the assays were applied to environmental water samples, qNASBA was unable to reliably quantify E. coil while both qPCR assays were capable of predicting E. coli concentrations in environmental waters. This study highlights the inability of qNASBA targeting mRNA to quantify E. coli in environmental waters, and presents the first E. coli qPCR assay with 100% target exclusivity. The application of a highly exclusive and inclusive qPCR assay has the potential to allow water quality managers to reliably and rapidly detect and quantify E. coli and therefore take appropriate measures to reduce the risk to public health posed by faecal contamination.

In the present study, the toxicity removal during wastewater treatment at seven municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) was investigated using an effect-based approach. A battery of eight bioassays was applied comprising of cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, endocrine disruption and fish embryo toxicity assays. Human cell-based CALUX assays, transgenic larval models and the fish embryo toxicity test were particularly sensitive to WWTP effluents. The results indicate that most effects were significantly reduced or completely removed during wastewater treatment (76-100%), while embryo toxicity, estrogenic activity and thyroid disruption were still detectable in the effluents suggesting that some harmful substances remain after treatment. The responsiveness of the bioassays was compared and the human cell-based CALUX assays showed highest responsiveness in the samples. Additionally, the fish embryo toxicity test and the transgenic larval models for endocrine disrupting effects showed high responsiveness at low sample concentrations in nearly all of the effluent samples. The results showed a similar effect pattern among all WWTPs investigated, indicating that the wastewater composition could be rather similar at different locations. There were no considerable differences in the toxicity removal efficiencies of the treatment plants and no correlation was observed with WWTP characteristics, such as process configuration or sludge age. This study demonstrated that a biotest battery comprising of multiple endpoints can serve as a powerful tool when assessing water quality or water treatment efficiency in a holistic manner. Rather than analyzing the concentrations of a few selected chemicals, bioassays can be used to complement traditional methods of monitoring in the future by assessing sum-parameter based effects, such as mixture effects, and tackling chemicals that are present at concentrations below chemical analytical detection limits.

Removal of selected emerging PPCP compounds using greater duckweed (Spirodela polyrhiza) based lab-scale free water constructed wetland	WATER RESEARCH												Greater duckweed (Spirodela polyrhiza) based lab-scale free water constructed wetland (CW) was employed for removing four emerging pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) (i.e. DEET, paracetamol, caffeine and triclosan). Orthogonal design was used to test the effect of light intensity, aeration, E.coli abundance and plant biomass on the target compounds. Synthetic wastewater contaminated with the target compounds at concentration of 25 mu g/L. was prepared, and both batch and continuous flow experiments were conducted. Up to 100% removals were achieved for paracetamol (PAR), caffeine (CAF) and tricolsan (TCS) while the highest removal for DEET was 32.2% in batch tests. Based on orthogonal Duncan analysis, high light intensity (240 mu molmm(-2)s(-1)), full aeration, high plant biomass (1.00 kg/m(2)) and high E.coli abundance (1.0 x 10(6) CFU/100 mL) favoured elimination of the PPCPs. Batch verification test achieved removals of 17.1%, 98.8%, 96.4% and 95.4% for DEET, PAR, CAF and TCS respectively. Continuous flow tests with CW only and CW followed by stabilization tank (CW-ST) were carried out. Final removals of the PPCP contaminants were 32.6%, 97.7%, 98.0% and 100% for DEET, PAR, CAF and TCS, respectively, by CW system alone, while 43.3%, 97.5%, 98.2% and 100%, respectively, were achieved by CW-ST system. By adding the ST tank, PPCP concentrations decreased significantly faster (p < 0.05) compared with continuous flow CW alone. In addition, after removing aerators during continuous flow CW experiments, the treatment systems presented good stability for the PPCP removals. CW-ST showed better chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC) removals (89.3%, 91.2%, respectively) than CW only (79.4%, 85.2%, respectively). However, poor DEET removal (<50%) and high E.coli abundance (up to 1.7 log increase) in the final treated water indicated further treatment processes may be required. Statistical analysis showed significant correlations (p < 0.05) between PPCPs and water quality parameters (e.g. COD, nitrate, phosphate), and between the four PPCP compounds for the continuous flow CW and CW-ST systems. Positive results encourage further test of Greater duckweed at pilot scale ON using real wastewater. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

A risk-based approach for developing standards for irrigation with reclaimed water	WATER RESEARCH												A generalised quantitative risk assessment (QRA) is developed to assess the potential harm to human health resulting from irrigation with reclaimed water. The QRA is conducted as a backward calculation starting from a pre-defined acceptable risk level at the receptor point (defined as an annual infection risk of 10(-4) for pathogens and by reference doses (RfD) for chemical hazards) and results in an estimate of the corresponding acceptable concentration levels of the given hazards in the effluent. In this way the QRA is designed to inform the level of water treatment required to achieve an acceptable risk level and help establish reclaimed water quality standards. The QRA considers the exposure of human receptors to microbial and chemical hazards in the effluent through various exposure pathways and routes depending on the specific irrigation scenario. By considering multiple pathways and routes, a number of key aspects relevant to estimating human exposure to recycled water can be accounted for, including irrigation and crop handling practices (e.g., non-edible vs edible, spray vs. drip, withholding time) and volumes consumed (directly vs indirectly). The QRA relies on a large number of inputs, many of which were found to be highly uncertain. A possibilistic approach, based on fuzzy set theory, was used to propagate the uncertain input values through the QRA model to estimate the possible range of hazard concentrations that are deemed acceptable/safe for reclaimed water irrigation. Two scenarios were considered: amenity irrigation and irrigation of ready-to-eat food crops, and calculations were carried out for six example hazards (norovirus, Cryptosporidium, cadmium, lead, PCB118 and naphthalene) and using UK-specific input values. The human health risks associated with using reclaimed water for amenity irrigation were overall deemed low, i.e. the calculated acceptable concentration levels for most of the selected hazards were generally far greater than levels typically measured in effluent from wastewater treatment plants; however the predicted acceptable concentration levels for norovirus and Cryptosporidium suggested that disinfection by UV may be required before use. It was found that stricter concentration standards were required for hazards that are more strongly bound to soil and/or are more toxic/infectious. It was also found that measures that reduce the amount of effluent directly ingested by the receptor would significantly reduce the risks (by up to 2 orders of magnitude for the two pathogens). The results for the food crop irrigation scenario showed that stricter concentration standards are required to ensure the effluent is safe to use. For pathogens, the dominant exposure route was found to be ingestion of effluent captured on the surface of the crops indicating that risks could be significantly reduced by restricting irrigation to the non-edible parts of the crop. The results also showed that the exposure to some organic compounds and heavy metals through plant uptake and attached soil particles could be high and possibly pose unacceptable risk to human health. For both scenarios, we show that the predicted acceptable concentration levels are associated with large uncertainty and discuss the implications this has for defining quality standards and how the uncertainty can be reduced.

Nutrient loading impacts on culturable E. coil and other heterotrophic bacteria fate in simulated stream mesocosms	WATER RESEARCH												Understanding fecal indicator bacteria persistence in aquatic environments is important when making management decisions to improve instream water quality. Routinely, bacteria fate and transport models that rely on published kinetic decay constants are used to inform such decision making but may not adequately represent instream conditions. The objective of this work was to evaluate bacterial responses to applied nutrient amendments and provide additional information regarding bacterial response to applied changes that can be incorporated into future modeling efforts. Re-created stream mesocosms were established in laboratory-based, repurposed algae raceways filled with water and sediment from a small, 3rd order Southeast Texas stream. Mesocosm treatments consisted of low (10x) or high (50x) nutrient doses above ambient water concentrations operated at low (0.032 m/s) or high (0.141 m/s) flow rates. Escherichia coli and heterotrophic bacterial concentrations were quantified in water and sediment over 22 days. No significant differences in kinetic constants were observed among E. coli in water or sediment, and only E. coli in sediment showed any growth response. Heterotrophic plate counts revealed a pronounced growth response in water and sediment within 24 h of nutrient addition but did not differ significantly from control mesocosms. Significant kinetic constant differences between E. coli and heterotrophic bacteria in water were identified (p < 0.01) but did not differ significantly in sediment (p > 0.48). Results indicate that nutrient addition does affect microbial numbers instream, but competition from heterotrophic bacteria may prevent an E. coli growth response. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Our study employed the concepts of technological path and aeration frame to analyze the extensive restoration and aeration history of the hypertrophic Tuusulanjarvi in southern Finland. Continuously aerated since 1972, it has the longest history of aeration in Finland. Qualitative analysis of documentary and archival sources revealed that the longstanding preference for aeration in the context of increasing scientific controversy was based on its functional versatility and seemingly unproblematic applicability in regard to shifting emphasis and goal setting of restoration. Additionally, the stability of the aeration frame has been supported by the practical and emotional attachment of local residents to lake restoration, particularly aeration, and finally the problems and contradicting interests related to alternative restoration methods.																	0044-7447	1654-7209				DEC	2017	46	8					865	877		10.1007/s13280-017-0926-6								WOS:000412998600004	28623630

Here we studied the historical (1983-2007) metal contamination in the Ulla river (NW Iberian Peninsula) watershed impacted by a Cu mine that was in operation from 1973 until 1988 by means of the analysis of major and trace elements in salmon scales. Results indicate the presence of a significant contamination for several metals (especially Cu, Au, Ag, Sb, Zn) during the 1980's. Concentrations of Cu in salmon scales during the influence of the mine (1983-1990) were 20 +/- 5 mu g/g, exceeding the values for the recent years (1995-2007): 1.8 +/- 0.4 mu g/g. Concentrations for Au in these two periods were 31 +/- 12 and 2.1 +/- 1.2 ng/g; for Ag: 21 +/- 4 and 4 +/- 2 ng/g; for Sb: 48 +/- 21 and 15 4 ng/g; and for Zn: 133 +/- 16 and 93 +/- 10 mu g/g. The estimated concentrations of dissolved copper during the operation of the mine indicate a scenario of toxic effects due to sensory impairinents in the salmon, and a reduction in scales calcification. The results presented here demonstrate that the analysis of trace elements in archived fish scales is a suitable tool for the reconstruction of the past contamination in aquatic systems, and it can be also used as a non-lethal approach for biomonitoring purposes.

Disinfection byproduct precursor dynamics and water treatability during an extreme flooding event in a coastal blackwater river in southeastern United States	CHEMOSPHERE												Coastal blackwater rivers, characterized by high concentrations of natural organic matter, are source water for millions of people in the southeastern US. In October 2015, large areas of coastal South Carolina were flooded by Hurricane Joaquin. This so-called "thousand-year" rainfall mobilized and flushed large amounts of terrestrial organic matter and associated pollutants (e.g. mercury) into source water, affecting water quality and safety of municipal water supply. To understand the dynamics of water quality and water treatability during this extreme flood, water samples were collected from Waccamaw River (a typical blackwater river in the southeastern US) during rising limb, peak discharge, falling limb, and base flow. Despite decreasing water flow after peak discharge, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) levels (increased by up to 125%), and formation potentials of trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids (increased by up to 150%) remained high for an extended period of time (>eight weeks after peak discharge), while variation in the N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) FP was negligible. Coagulation with alum and ferric at optimal dosage significantly reduced concentrations of DOC by 51-76%, but up to 10 mg/L Of DOC still remained in treated waters. For an extended period of time, elevated levels of THMs (71-448 mu g/L) and HAAS (88-406 mu g/L) were quantified in laboratory.chlorination experiments under uniform formation conditions (UFC), exceeding the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) maximum contaminant level of 80 and 60 mu g/L, respectively. Results demonstrated that populations in coastal cities are at high risk with disinfection by-products (DBPs) under the changing climate. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The reservoir, which supplies drinking water for nearly half of Shanghai's population, is located in Yangtze Delta. The integrated model was built by Delft3D suite, a fully integrated multidimensional modeling software. Atrazine and Bisphenol A (BPA) were selected as two representative emerging contaminants for the study in this reservoir. The hydrodynamic model was calibrated and validated against observations from 2011 to 2015 while the integrated model was calibrated against observations from 2014 to 2015 and then applied to explore the potential risk of high atrazine concentrations in the reservoir driven by agriculture activities. Our results show that the model is capable of describing the spatial and temporal patterns of water temperature, salinity and the dynamic distributions of two representative emerging contaminants (i.e. atrazine and BPA) in the reservoir. The physical and biodegradation processes in this study were found to play a crucial role in determining the fate and transport of atrazine and BPA in the reservoir. The model also provides an insight into the potential risk of emerging contaminants and possible mitigation thresholds. The integrated approach can be a very useful tool to support policy-makers in the future management of Qingcaosha Reservoir. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we developed a multiple-endpoints gene alteration-based (MEGA) assay, a real-time PCR-based transcriptomic analysis, to assess the water quality of wastewater effluents for human health risk assessment and management. Twenty-one genes from the human hepatoblastoma cell line (HepG2), covering the basic health-relevant stress responses such as response to xenobiotics, genotoxicity, and cytotoxicity, were selected and incorporated into the MEGA assay. The genes related to the p53-mediated DNA damage response and cytochrome P450 were selected as markers for genotoxicity and response to xenobiotics, respectively. Additionally, the genes that were dose-dependently regulated by exposure to the wastewater effluents were chosen as markers for cytotoxicity. The alterations in the expression of an individual gene, induced by exposure to the wastewater effluents, were evaluated by real-time PCR and the results were validated by genotoxicity (e.g., comet assay) and cell-based cytotoxicity tests. In summary, the MEGA assay is a real-time PCR-based assay that targets cellular responses to contaminants present in wastewater effluents at the transcriptional level; it is rapid, cost-effective, and high-throughput and can thus complement any chemical analysis for water quality assessment and management.

In this study, water quality and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption and fluorescence were investigated in different seasons to elucidate how hydraulic connectivity and evaporation may affect the water quality and variability of CDOM in the lake. Mean suspended solids and turbidity were significantly higher in the upstream tributaries than in the lake, the difference being notably more pronounced in the wet than in the dry season. A markedly higher mean first principal component (PC1) score, which was significantly positively related to protein-like components, and a considerably lower fluorescence peak integration ratio -I-C:I-T, indicative, of the terrestrial humic-like CDOM contribution percentage, were observed in the lake than in the upstream tributaries. Correspondingly, notably higher contribution percentages of terrestrial humiclike components were observed in the river mouth areas than in the remaining lake regions. Furthermore, significantly higher mean turbidity, and notably lower mean conductivity and salinity, were recorded in the southwestern Kaidu river mouth than. in the remaining lake regions in the wet season. Notably higher mean salinity is recorded in Lake Bosten than in upstream tributaries. Autochthonous protein-like associated amino-acids and also PC1 scores increased significantly with increasing salinity. We conclude that the dynamics of water quality and CDOM composition in remote arid Lake Bosten are strongly driven by evaporation and also the hydraulic connectivity between the upstream tributaries and the downstream lake.

Removal of nutrients, trace organic contaminants, and bacterial indicator organisms in a demonstration-scale unit process open-water treatment wetland	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												A demonstration-scale unit process open-water wetland system was built to treat water from an effluent-dominated river (i.e., a river in which the flow consisted almost entirely of municipal wastewater effluent from May to October). Monitoring of the system over a two-year period indicated effective removal of nitrate, with concentrations decreasing by over 90% during summer. The temperature-independent areal first-order nitrate removal rate constant, k(20), ranged from 61.7 to 68.1 m yr(-1) after the microbial community was established, which is significantly higher than values typically observed in full-scale surface flow wetlands. The beta-adrenergic blockers, atenolol and propranolol, as well as the antiviral drug, acyclovir, were removed by photolysis and biotransformation in the wetland biomat, whereas the antiepileptic drug, carbamazepine, exhibited little removal. The bacterial indicators E. coli and enterococci decreased substantially during summer, mainly through sunlight exposure. Models of contaminant removal based upon measured flow rates and performance data collected at a similar pilot-scale system agreed well with measured data for nitrate and the trace organic contaminants. The model accurately predicted removal of enterococci but systematically over-predicted the removal of E. coli. During the two-year study period, routine maintenance was necessary to prevent colonization of the water surface with duckweed (Lemna spp.). Unit process open-water (UPOW) wetlands may offer a low-cost means of improving water quality in natural treatment systems that can be integrated with conventional surface-flow wetlands and other managed natural systems. The quantitative models of contaminant removal described in this study can be used to design natural treatment systems that balance the needs for local water quality requirements, available land and site-specific requirements.																	0925-8574	1872-6992				DEC	2017	109		A				76	83		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.09.017								WOS:000413737800010

Use of Fish Telemetry in Rehabilitation Planning, Management, and Monitoring in Areas of Concern in the Laurentian Great Lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Freshwater ecosystems provide many ecosystem services; however, they are often degraded as a result of human activity. To address ecosystem degradation in the Laurentian Great Lakes, Canada and the United States of America established the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement (GLWQA). In 1987, 43 highly polluted and impacted areas were identified under the GLWQA as having one or more of 14 Beneficial Use Impairments (BUIs) to the physical and chemical habitat for fish, wildlife and humans, and were designated as Areas of Concern (AOC). Subnational jurisdictions combined with local stakeholders, with support from federal governments, developed plans to remediate and restore these sites. Biotelemetry (the tracking of animals using electronic tags) provides information on the spatial ecology of fish in the wild relevant to habitat management and stock assessment. Here, seven case studies are presented where biotelemetry data were directly incorporated within the AOC Remedial Action Plan (RAP) process. Specific applications include determining seasonal fish-habitat associations to inform habitat restoration plans, identifying the distribution of pollutant-indicator species to identify exposure risk to contamination sources, informing the development of fish passage facilities to enable fish to access fragmented upstream habitats, and assessing fish use of created or restored habitats. With growing capacity for fish biotelemetry research in the Great Lakes, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of incorporating biotelemetry into AOC RAP processes to improve the science and practice of restoration and to facilitate the delisting of AOCs.																	0364-152X	1432-1009				DEC	2017	60	6					1139	1154		10.1007/s00267-017-0937-x								WOS:000413777700010	28939998

H.			Do Riparian Buffers Protect Stream Invertebrate Communities in South American Atlantic Forest Agricultural Areas?	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												We investigated the influence and relative importance of insecticides and other agricultural stressors in determining variability in invertebrate communities in small streams in intensive soy-production regions of Brazil and Paraguay. In Paraguay we sampled 17 sites on tributaries of the Pirapo River in the state of Itapua and in Brazil we sampled 18 sites on tributaries of the San Francisco River in the state of Parana. The riparian buffer zones generally contained native Atlantic forest remnants and/or introduced tree species at various stages of growth. In Brazil the stream buffer width was negatively correlated with sediment insecticide concentrations and buffer width was found to have moderate importance in mitigating effects on some sensitive taxa such as mayflies. However, in both regions insecticides had low relative importance in explaining variability in invertebrate communities, while various habitat parameters were more important. In Brazil, the percent coverage of soft depositional sediment in streams was the most important agriculture-related explanatory variable, and the overall stream-habitat score was the most important variable in Paraguay streams. Paraguay and Brazil both have laws requiring forested riparian buffers. The ample forested riparian buffer zones typical of streams in these regions are likely to have mitigated the effects of pesticides on stream invertebrate communities. This study provides evidence that riparian buffer regulations in the Atlantic Forest region are protecting stream ecosystems from pesticides and other agricultural stressors. Further studies are needed to determine the minimum buffer widths necessary to achieve optimal protection.

This study aimed to reveal the spatial pattern and sources of phosphorus export and loading from the watershed. We applied an export coefficient model and the Dillon-Rigler model to quantify contributions of different sub-watersheds and sources to the total phosphorus (TP) export and loading in 2010. Together, the upper and lower reaches of the Xiang River watershed and the Dongting Lake Area contributed 60.9% of the TP exported from the entire watershed. Livestock husbandry appeared to be the largest anthropogenic source of TP, contributing more than 50% of the TP exported from each secondary sub-watersheds. The actual TP loading to the lake in 2010 was 62.9% more than the permissible annual TP loading for compliance with the Class III water quality standard for lakes. Three primary sub-watersheds-the Dongting Lake Area, the Xiang River, and the Yuan River watersheds-contributed 91.2% of the total TP loading. As the largest contributor among all sources, livestock husbandry contributed nearly 50% of the TP loading from the Dongting Lake Area and more than 60% from each of the other primary sub-watersheds. This study provides a methodology to identify the key sources and locations of TP export and loading in large lake watersheds. The study can provide a reference for the decision-making for controlling P pollution in the Dongting Lake watershed.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				DEC	2017	189	12							602	10.1007/s10661-017-6293-8								WOS:000414460100003	29101549

Mussels may accumulate contaminants of public health concern, including pathogenic bacteria and viruses. Microbiological monitoring of harvesting areas is based on count of Escherichia coli in bivalve molluscs in the European Union. It is assumed that E. coli does not reflect contamination with enteric viruses. A structured field study was undertaken at six locations in Bay of Kotor, Montenegro, in order to investigate plausible influence of environmental factors on the variability of E. coli and norovirus (NoV). From July 2015 to July 2016, a total of 72 samples of mussels were collected in coastal harvesting areas of the Montenegro. The samples were screened for NoV of genogroups GI and GII using reverse transcription-qPCR (RT-qPCR). There were 43% NoV positive samples with higher presence of genogroup GII (74.2%). With regard to influence of environmental conditions on Norovirus presence, we have proved seasonal pattern of virus occurrence i.e., the largest number of positive samples was noticed during winter, while other physico-chemical factors were not of great significance. It was found that count of E. coli did not correlate with Norovirus prevalence. From the aspect of food safety, an upgrade of monitoring plans could lead to obtaining safer products.

Pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) is one of the most abundant RNA viruses associated with human feces, making it a viable indicator for tracking fecal pollution in aquatic environments, including groundwater. In this study, groundwater samples collected from a karst aquifer from fresh and brackish water locations were analyzed for fecal indicator bacteria, somatic and male F+ specific coliphages, and PMMoV during the rainy and dry seasons. Total coliform bacteria were detected at all sites, whereas Escherichia coli were found at relatively low levels < 40 MPN/100 ml. The highest average concentrations of somatic and male F+ specific coliphages were 920 and 330 plaque forming units per 100 ml, respectively, detected in freshwater during the rainy season. PMMoV RNA was detected in 85% of the samples with gene sequences sharing 99-100% of nucleotide identity with PMMoV sequences available in GenBank. Quantification of PMMoV genome copies (GC) by quantitative real-time PCR indicated concentrations ranging from 1.7 x 10(1) to 1.0 x 10(4) GC/L, with the highest number of GC detected during the rainy season. No significant correlation was observed between PMMoV occurrence by season or water type (p > 0.05). Physicochemical and indicator bacteria were not correlated with PMMoV concentrations. The abundance and prevalence of PMMoV in the karst aquifer may reflect its environmental persistence and its potential as a fecal indicator in this karst aquifer system.																	1867-0334	1867-0342				DEC	2017	9	4					487	497		10.1007/s12560-017-9309-1								WOS:000414377300012	28646449					
J	Perni, A; Martinez-Paz, JM				Perni, Angel; Martinez-Paz, Jose Miguel			Measuring conflicts in the management of anthropized ecosystems: Evidence from a choice experiment in a human-created Mediterranean wetland	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Economic valuation of ecosystem services provides valuable information for the management of anthropized environments, where individual preferences can be heterogeneous and even opposed. Here, we discuss how these ecosystem services were approached in the literature and we address the main issues in relation to their economic valuation. We consider that avoiding misspecifications in economic valuation surveys requires considering the linkages between anthropized ecosystems and human intervention. To illustrate, we analyse the case study of a human-created Mediterranean wetland (El Hondo, SE Spain) using a Choice Experiment. Our findings suggest that management strategies in El Hondo should be oriented to improve the water ecological status, to enhance blodiversity and to develop ecotourism, whereas hunting should be strictly limited and controlled. Our measures of conflict (trade-off between ecosystem services and willingness to pay values) can help to find the optimal allocation of public and private goods and services and for the implementation of compensation schemes in the area. According to public preferences, a conservationist management strategy would generate 331,100 (sic)/year in terms of environmental benefits, whereas a tourism-based management strategy would benefit society with 805,200 (sic)/year.

J	Higashino, M; Stefan, HG				Higashino, Makoto; Stefan, Heinz G.			Oxygen uptake prediction in rivers and streams: A stochastic approach	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Dissolved oxygen fluctuations in a river over a short period of time were assumed to be caused by the microbial growth dynamics, and a stochastic model was built for oxygen uptake. As a case study, biochemical oxygen demand (BUD) was measured in water from the Ura River, Oita River, and Otozu River flowing through the urban district of Oita, Japan. Water samples were taken from each river and partitioned into BOD bottles. BOD was measured in five of these bottles on each of nine days. The experimental results show that the average daily BOD decreased exponentially as expressed by the Streeter-Phelps equation. A wide range of the measured five daily BOD-values was expressed by the difference between the maximum and minimum BOD-values on each day for each river. After the first few days the range became smaller. The proposed stochastic model describes the observed experimental fluctuation of BOD over time. Eighty to ninety percent of the experimental BUD plots are within the 80% probability range given by the model. The uncertainty of BUD prediction can be expressed by the error which is the non-dimensional ratio of the range to the median. Modeled and experimental results reveal that the error is about 0.5-1 (50-100% of expected value) after a few days. This suggests that the BUD predicted by deterministic water quality models can include uncertainty, i.e. the actual BOD can be a quarter or double of the simulated value, for the time scale of a few days. For a longer period, e.g. more than a week, the error can become even more significant. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Comparison of sediment and nutrient export and runoff characteristics from watersheds, with centralized versus distributed stormwater management	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Stormwater control measures (SCMs) are used to retain stormwater and pollutants. SCMs have traditionally been installed in a centralized manner using detention to mitigate peak flows. Recently, distributed SCM networks that treat runoff near the source have been increasingly utilized. The aim of this study was to evaluate differences among watersheds that vary in SCM arrangement by assessing differences in baseflow nutrient (NOx-N and PO4-) concentrations and fluxes, stormflow export of suspended sediments and particulate phosphorus (PP), and runoff characteristics. A paired watershed approach was used to compare export between 2004 and 2016 from one forested watershed (For-MD), one suburban watershed with centralized SCMs (Cent-MD), and one suburban watershed with distributed SCMs (Dist-MD). Results indicated baseflow nitrate (NOx-N) concentrations typically exceeded 1 mg-N\L. in all watersheds and were highest in Dist-MD. Over the last 10 years in Dist-MD, nitrate concentrations in both stream baseflow and in a groundwater well declined as land use shifted from agriculture to suburban. Baseflow nitrate export temporarily increased during the construction phase of SCM development in Dist-MD. This temporary pulse of nitrate may be attributed to the conversion of sediment control facilities to SCMs and increased subsurface flushing as infiltration SCMs came on line. During storm flow, Dist-MD tended to have less runoff and lower maximum specific discharge than Cent MD for small events (<1.3 cm), but runoff responses became increasingly similar to Cent-MD with increasing precipitation (>1.3 cm). Mass export estimated during paired storm events indicated Dist-MD exported 30% less sediment and 31% more PP than Cent-MD. For large precipitation events, export of sediment and PP was similar among all three watersheds. Results suggest that distributed SCMs can reduce runoff and sediment loads during small rain events compared to centralized SCMs, but these differences become less evident for large events when peak discharge likely leads to substantial bank erosion.

The city of Jacksonville (Florida), the location for this study, owns the dubious distinction of being ranked among the worst major American cities in water quality according to water quality tests conducted between 2005 and 2009 by the Environmental Working Group (EWG). This report of toxic chemicals in the Jacksonville water supply generated considerable negative publicity and coincides with a frequent and common complaint among residents of foul-smelling water. System revenues from water supply and program subsidies from government are often inadequate in mitigating the problems, perceived or real, with water quality. Therefore, this paper investigates how much residents will be willing to pay for improvements in the quality of tap water. The commonly known economic metric willingness-to-pay (WTP) is applied to estimate any possible rate hikes public utility can assess in any effort to improve real or perceived water quality. The study shows that the estimated weighted average of WTP is $6.22, which can be added to the regular water bill without eliciting much negative reaction from residents. Evidence shows that factors such as trust in authorities, health concerns, family structure, and education significantly impact the WTP.

Shadow prices of emerging pollutants in wastewater treatment plants: Quantification of environmental externalities	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are designed to remove mainly the organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorus compounds and suspended solids from wastewater but are not capable of removing chemicals of human origin, such as pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs). The presence of PPCPs in wastewater has environmental effects on the water bodies receiving the WWTP effluents and renders the effluent as unsuitable as a nonconventional water source. Considering PPCPs as non-desirable outputs, the shadow prices methodology has been implemented using the output distance function to measure the environmental benefits of removing five PPCPs (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen, carbamazepine and trimethoprim) from WWTP effluents discharged to three different ecosystems (wetland, river and sea). Acetaminophen and ibuprofen show the highest shadow prices of the sample for wetland areas. Their values are 128.2 and 11.0 (sic)/mg respectively. These results represent a proxy in monetary terms of the environmental benefit achieved from avoiding the discharge of these PPCPs in wetlands. These results suggest which PPCPs are urgent to remove from wastewater and which ecosystems are most vulnerable to their presence. The findings of this study will be useful for the plant managers in order to make decisions about prioritization in the removal of different pollutants. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Wastewater treatment process includes energy intensive equipment such as pumps and blowers to move and treat wastewater. Presently, a data-driven approach has been applied for aeration process modeling and optimization of one large scale wastewater in Midwest. More specifically, aeration process optimization is carried out with an aim to minimize energy usage without sacrificing water quality. Models developed by data mining algorithms are useful in developing a clear and concise relationship among input and output variables. Results indicate that a great deal of saving in energy can be made while keeping the water quality within limit. Limitation of the work is also discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The amounts of tritium released into the environment are kept within the legal requirements, which minimize the noxious effects of radioactivity, but the activity concentration is well measurable in surface water of the recipient. This study compares amount of tritium activity in waste water from nuclear power plants and the tritium activity detected at selected relevant sites of surface water quality monitoring. The situation is assessed in the catchment of the Vltava and Elbe Rivers, affected by the Temelin Nuclear Power Plant as well as in the Jihlava River catchment (the Danube River catchment respectively), where the waste water of the Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant is discharged. The results show a good agreement of the amount of released tritium stated by the power plant operator and the tritium amount detected in the surface water and highlighted the importance of a robust independent monitoring of tritium discharged from a nuclear power plant which could be carried out by water management authorities. The outputs of independent monitoring allow validating the values reported by a polluter and expand opportunities of using tritium as e.g. tracer. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Coal mining industry in the area may influence the water quality evolution. To provide primary characterization of the hydrogeo-chemical processes and paths that control the water quality evolution, a complex multi-layer groundwater system in a coal mining area is investigated. Multivariate statistical methods involving hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA) are applied, 6 zones and 3 new principal components are classified as major reaction zones and reaction factors. By integrating HCA and PCA with hydrogeochemical correlations analysis, potential phases, reactions and connections between various zones are presented. Carbonates minerals, gypsum, clay minerals as well as atmosphere gases -CO2, H2O and NH3 are recognized as major reactants. Mixtures, evaporation, dissolution/precipitation of minerals and cation exchange are potential reactions. Inverse modeling is finally used, and it verifies the detailed processes and diverse paths. Consequently, 4 major paths are found controlling the variations of groundwater chemical properties. Shallow and deep groundwater is connected primarily by the flow of deep groundwater up through fractures and faults into the shallow aquifers. Mining does not impact the underlying aquifers that represent the most critical groundwater resource. But controls should be taken to block the mixing processes from highly polluted mine water. The paper highlights the complex hydrogeochemical evolution of a multi-layer groundwater system under mining impact, which could be applied to further groundwater quality management in the study area, as well as most of the other coalfields in North China.

China is currently one of the largest countries to engage in this practice. In this study, a representative mariculture zone, the Weihai coastal area in China, was explored to determine the temporal variations in regional nutrients, N/P ratio, dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, chlorophyll a (Chl-a), and cellular abundance of diatoms and dinoflagellates in response to the rapid growth in mariculture activities between 2006 and 2014. The temporal variations in inorganic and organic nitrogen concentrations in the surface water presented significantly increasing trends during August, between 2009 and 2014. A marked increase in the ratios of dinoflagellate to diatom abundance, concurrently with ascending N/P ratios, was also observed during August between 2011 and 2014. In addition, dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphate variations revealed the highest concentrations during October and lower levels during May and August, which was attributed in part to the seasonal growth characteristics of kelp cultivated in the study area. Moreover, the nutrient concentrations in Sanggou, Rongcheng, Wulei, and Rushan bays were affected significantly by the various cultured organisms in these bays. The intensive mariculture activity in the Weihai coastal area is likely one of the causes of the negative effects on water quality, such as eutrophication and future ocean acidification. The exploration of effective strategies is quite necessary in the future for keeping good quality of coastal environment and sustainable mariculture development. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Variation partitioning of benthic diatom community matrices: Effects of multiple variables on benthic diatom communities in an Austral temperate river system	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												This study explores diatom community dynamics in a highly modified semi-arid temperate region river system characterised by inconsistent river flow. Various water and sediment environmental variables were assessed using amulti-faceted analysis approach to determine the spatio-temporal drivers of benthic diatom communities in the river system. Overall, the diatom community was generally dominated by pollution tolerant species, reflecting the anthropogenic intensity and activities on the river system. Diatom community composition was found to be largely determined by water column chemistry variables particularly nutrient concentrations in comparison to sediment chemistry and physical variables. Strong seasonal diatom species composition was also observed and this was driven by strong seasonal variations in nutrient loads and metal concentrations, a result of the variable water flow across the two seasons. However, the greater temporal variation in communities was observed in the smaller systems with the mainstream river system being more homogenous over time. In addition, diatom community composition and environmental variables were found to be different and more pronounced between streams and mainstream sites, than between canals and streams. The study highlights the complex interaction between water column, sediment and physical variables in determining the diatom species composition in small river systems. It also highlights the importance of river flow inconsistency as an indirect variable that alters primary drivers such as nutrient concentrations in the water column and heavy metal levels in the sediment.

Although mortality and immobilisation are the main endpoints used for determination of toxicity, detection of subtle alterations induced by some chemicals particularly at lower levels may require more sensitive biomarkers. As a number of studies indicated that swimming behaviour may be altered by pesticides, nanoparticles, bacterial products or other chemicals, analysis of its various parameters is considered as a novel methodological approach for toxicity assessment and monitoring of water quality.

Dyes can be considered as emergent contaminants and were detected in waters, under the influence of textile activities. The objective of this study was to evaluate the contribution of 9 azo dyes to the mutagenicity of representative environmental samples. Samples were collected along one year in the largest conglomerate of textile industries of Brazil. We analyzed water samples from an important water body, Piracicaba River, upstreamand downstreamtwo main discharges, the effluent of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and the tributary Quilombo River, which receives untreated effluent from local industries. Samples were analyzed using a LC-MS/MS and tested for mutagenicity in the Salmonella/microsome microsuspension assay with TA98 and YG1041. Six dyes were detected in the collected samples, Disperse Blue 291, Disperse Blue 373, Disperse Orange 30, Disperse Red 1, Disperse Violet 93, and Disperse Yellow 3. The most sensitive condition for the detection of the mutagenicity was the strain YG1041 with S9. The concentration of dyes and mutagenicity levels varied along time and the dry season represented the worst condition. Disperse Blue 373 and Disperse Violet 93were the major contributors to the mutagenicity. Weconclude that dyes are contributing for the mutagenicity of Piracicaba River water; and both discharges, WWTP effluent and Quilombo River, increase themutagenicity of Piracicaba Riverwaters in about 10-fold. The combination of chemical analysis and bioassays were key in the identification the main drivers of the water mutagenicity and allows the selection of priority compounds to be included inmonitoring programs aswell for the enforcing actions required to protect the water quality for multiple uses.

J	Zafra, C; Temprano, J; Suarez, J				Zafra, Carlos; Temprano, Javier; Suarez, Joaquin			A simplified method for determining potential heavy metal loads washed-off by stormwater runoff from road-deposited sediments	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												A simplified method is proposed for determining the potential load of heavy metals (HMs) derived from the wash-off caused by surface runoff on road-deposited sediment (RDS). The method consists of three phases: (i) characterization of RDS load wash-off, (ii) assessment of HM load in dry weather, and (iii) application of a wash-off equation. Two processes were included in the wash-off equation: HM transport (solid fraction) and HM leaching (dissolved fraction). The average wash-off of HMs ranges from 16.6 to 46.3%, relative to the total mass ofHMs associatedwith dry-weather RDS (Pb, Zn, Cu, Cr, Ni, Cd, Fe, Mn, Co, and Ba). Cd, Mn, and Zn presented the highest wash-off in the areas studied. The size fraction below 250 mu m contributed an average of 86.7% of potential HMload washed-off fromRDS. Based on the phenomena included in the wash-off equation, it was observed the following order of precedence: transport of RDS b 250 mu m, leaching of RDS < 250 mu m, and leaching of RDS >= 250 mu m. Solid and dissolved fractions contributed 70.7 and 29.3% of the potential HM load washed-off by runoff from RDS, respectively. The proposed method serves as a management tool for road HM pollution during rain. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Vrebos, D; Beauchard, O; Meire, P				Vrebos, Dirk; Beauchard, Olivier; Meire, Patrick			The impact of land use and spatial mediated processes on the water quality in a river system	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												River systems are highly complex, hierarchical and patchy systems which are greatly influenced by both catchment surroundings and in-stream processes. Natural and anthropogenic land uses and processes affect water quality (WQ) through different pathways and scales. Understanding under which conditions these different river and catchment properties become dominant towards water chemistry remains a challenge. In this study we analyzed the impact of land use and spatial scales on a range of WQ variables within the Kleine Nete catchment in Belgium. Multivariate statistics and spatial descriptors (Moran's and Asymmetric Eigenvector Maps) were used to assess changes in water chemistry throughout the catchment. Both land use and complex mixes of spatial descriptors of different scales were found to be significantly associated to WQ parameters. However, unidirectional, upstream-downstream changes in water chemistry, often described in river systems, were not found within the Kleine Nete catchment. As different sources and processes obscure and interact with each other, it is generally difficult to understand the correct impact of different pollution sources and the predominant pathways. Our results advocate for WQ management interventions on large and small scales where needed, taking the predominate pathways in to account. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The brackish Black Sea waters reach the Dardanelles Strait with modified biochemical properties. The salinity and phosphates of the surface waters increased westwards. Biologically labile nutrients of Black Sea origin are utilized through biological processes in the Marmara Sea. On the other hand, increase of nutrients due to land based sources has led to eutrophication problems in the area. The sub surface water layer of Mediterranean origin is oxygen depleted (saturation < 30%) and rich in nutrients. Higher oxygen values indicated water mixing of the Sea of Marmara during winter 2012. Ammonium was the predominant form of inorganic nitrogen. The study area has been classified from Moderate to Bad trophic status. Izmit Bay also faced serious eutrophication problems together with hypoxic conditions below the halocline. Nutrient fluxes through the TSS showed temporal variation in the upper and lower layers related to changes in both nutrient concentrations and the water mass volume fluxes. Surface nitrates and phosphates outflux from the Sea of Marmara to the Aegean Sea was higher than the influx from the Black Sea through Bosporus strait, indicating high enrichment of nutrients in the Sea of Marmara from anthropogenic sources.

Estimates of water and solute release from a coal waste rock dump in the Elk Valley, British Columbia, Canada	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Long term (1999 to 2014) flow and water quality data from a rock drain located at the base of a coal waste rock dump constructed in the Elk Valley, British Columbia was used to characterize the release of three solutes (NO3-, Cl-and SO42-) from the dump and obtain whole dump estimates of net percolation (NP). The concentrations of dump derived solutes in the rock drain water were diluted by snowmelt waters from the adjacent natural watershed during the spring freshet and reached a maximum concentration during the winter baseflow period. Historical peak baseflow concentrations of conservative ions (NO3- and Cl-) increased until 2006/07 after which they decreased. This decrease was attributed to completion of the flushing of the first pore volume of water stored within the dump. The baseflow SO42- concentrations increased proportionally with NO3- and Cl- to 2007, but then continued to slowly increase as NO3- and Cl-concentrations decreased. This was attributed to ongoing production of SO42- due to oxidation of sulfide minerals within the dump. Based on partitioning of the annual volume of water discharged from the rock drain to waste rock effluent (NP) and water entering the rock drain laterally from the natural watershed, the mean NP values were estimated to be 446 +/- 50 mm/a (area normalized net per-colation/year) for the dump and 172 +/- 71 mm/a for the natural watershed. The difference was attributed to greater rates of recharge in the dump from summer precipitation compared to the natural watershed where rainfall interception and enhanced evapotranspiration will increase water losses. These estimates included water moving through subsurface pathways. However, given the limitations in quantifying these flows the estimated NP rates for both the natural watershed and the waste rock dump are considered to be low, and could be much higher (e.g. similar to 450 mm/a and similar to 800 mm/a).

Increasing numbers of BMPs have been studied in research projects and implemented in watershed management projects, but a gap remains in quantifying their effectiveness through time. In this paper, we review the current knowledge about BMP efficiencies, which indicates that most empirical studies have focused on short-term efficiencies, while few have explored long-term efficiencies. Most simulation efforts that consider BMPs assume constant performance irrespective of ages of the practices, generally based on anticipated maintenance activities or the expected performance over the life of the BMP(s). However, efficiencies of BMPs likely change over time irrespective of maintenance due to factors such as degradation of structures and accumulation of pollutants. Generally, the impacts of BMPs implemented in water quality protection programs at watershed levels have not been as rapid or large as expected, possibly due to overly high expectations for practice long-term efficiency, with BMPs even being sources of pollutants under some conditions and during some time periods. The review of available datasets reveals that current data are limited regarding both short-term and long-term BMP efficiency. Based on this review, this paper provides suggestions regarding needs and opportunities. Existing practice efficiency data need to be compiled. New data on BMP efficiencies that consider important factors, such as maintenance activities, also need to be collected. Then, the existing and new data need to be analyzed. Further research is needed to create a framework, as well as modeling approaches built on the framework, to simulate changes in BMP efficiencies with time.

In this study, groundwater uptake on a peninsula where only one aquifer system-the Cambrian-Vendian (Cm-V) - is available for drinking water uptake is observed for a period of four years for relevant radionuclides and chemical parameters (Cl, Mn, Fe, delta O-18). Intensive groundwater uptake from the Cm-V aquifer system may lead to water inflow either from the sea, through ancient buried valleys or from the under-laying crystalline basement rock which is rich in natural radionuclides. Changes in the geochemical conditions in the aquifer may in turn bring about desorption of Ra from sediment surface. Knowing the hydrogeological background of the wells helps to predict possible changes in water quality which in turn are important for sustainable groundwater management and optimization of water treatment processes. Changes in Cl and Ra concentrations are critical parameters to monitor for sustainable management of the Cm-V groundwater. Radionuclide activity concentrations in groundwater are often considered rather stable, minimum monitoring frequency of the total indicative dose from drinking water is set at once every ten years. The present study demonstrates that this is not sufficient for ensuring stable drinking water quality in case of aquifer systems as sensitive as the Cm-V aquifer system. Changes in Cl concentrations can be used as a tool to predict Ra activity concentrations and distribute the production between different wells opening to the same aquifer system.

J	Lin, L; Jiang, WB; Xu, P				Lin, Lu; Jiang, Wenbin; Xu, Pei			Comparative study on pharmaceuticals adsorption in reclaimed water desalination concentrate using biochar: Impact of salts and organic matter	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The synergistic impact of salts and organic matter on adsorption of ibuprofen and sulfamethoxazole by three types of biochar and an activated carbon was investigated using reclaimed water reverse osmosis (RO) concentrate and synthetic solutions spiked with target organic compounds and non-target water constituents (e.g., Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Cl-, SO42-, alkalinity, humic acid (HA), and bovine serum albumin (BSA)). Kinetic modeling was used to better understand the adsorption process between the carbon adsorbents and pharmaceuticals and to elucidate the impact of water chemistry on pharmaceuticals adsorption. The adsorption capacity of pharmaceuticals by biochar was affected by their physicochemical properties including ash content, specific surface area, charge, pore volume, as well as hydrophobicity, pi-energy, and speciation of pharmaceuticals. The adsorption of pharmaceuticals in concentrate was pH-dependent, the kinetic rate constant increased with deceasing pH due to the electrical interactions between pharmaceutical molecules and adsorbents. High salinity and electrolyte ions in RO concentrate improved adsorption, whereas the presence of carbonate species, HA, and BSA hindered the removal of ibuprofen and sulfamethoxazole. This study revealed the correlation of concentrate water quality on adsorption of pharmaceuticals by biochar and activated carbon. Biochar provides a promising alternative to activated carbon for removal of organic contaminants of emerging concerns in various wastewater and concentrate streams. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Lessons learned from Khartoum flash flood impacts: An integrated assessment	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												This study aims at enabling the compilation of key lessons for decision makers and urban planners in rapidly urbanizing cities regarding the identification of representative, chief causal natural and human factors for the increased level of flash flood risk. To achieve this, the impacts of flash flood events of 2013 and 2014 in the capital of Sudan, Khartoum, were assessed using seven integrated approaches, i.e. rainfall data analysis, document analysis of affected people and houses, observational fieldwork in the worst flood affected areas, people's perception of causes and mitigation measures through household interviews, reported drinking water quality, reported water-related diseases and social risk assessment. Several lessons have been developed as follows. Urban planners must recognize the devastating risks of building within natural pathways of ephemeral watercourses. They must also ensure effective drainage infrastructures and physio-geographical investigations prior to developing urban areas. The existing urban drainage systems become ineffective due to blockage by urban waste. Building of unauthorized drainage and embankment structures by locals often cause greater flood problems than normal. The urban runoff is especially problematic for residential areas built within low-lying areas having naturally low infiltration capacity, as surface water can rapidly collect within hollows and depressions, or beside elevated roads that preclude the free flow of floodwater. Weak housing and infrastructure quality are especially vulnerable to flash flooding and even to rainfall directly. Establishment of services infrastructure is imperative for flash flood disaster risk reduction. Water supply should be from lower aquifers to avoid contaminant ground water. Regular monitoring of water quality and archiving of its indicators help identify water-related diseases and sources of water contamination in the event of environmental disasters such as floods. Though the understanding of risk perception by the locals is an important aspect of the decision making and planning processes, it should be advanced enough for proper awareness.

Integrative assessment of river damming impacts on aquatic fauna in a Portuguese reservoir	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The impacts of river damming on aquatic fauna are assessed and then integrated across hierarchical scales, portrayed as nested circles. The outer circles characterize the studied site for habitat disturbance and hydrologic regimeduring the construction and filling phases. The inner circles characterize the construction and filling phase zones for water quality parameters and aquatic fauna. The procedure for integrating the impacts comprises two consecutive stages: in the task stage, inner circles are characterized through field and laboratory work involving sampling and analyses of water aliquots and aquatic fauna; in the impact assessment stage, circle data are processed in ecological and statistical algorithms, which allow identification of changes in abundance and composition of aquatic fauna communities and their integration with changes in water quality parameters across the construction and filling phase zones. The integrative assessment of river damming impacts on aquatic fauna was carried out in the Sabor River dam (Portugal). This dam created two reservoirs: primary and secondary. Changes in water quality caused by dam construction and stream water impoundment were significant, marked by increases in temperature and electric conductivity downstream, accumulation of phosphorus and nitrogen in the reservoirs triggering the growth of algae and the increase of chlorophyll a, and drop of transparency. These changes were aggravated in the secondary reservoir. The consequences of water deterioration for aquatic fauna were severe, marked by abrupt declines of native fish species and invasion of exotic species even upwards the reservoirs. The ecological status determined from ecological quality ratios of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages were also affected, changing from good-fair in the unaffected watercourses to fair-poor in the lakes.

However, the interplay between community and biogeochemical responses under different flow regimes in streams is less understood. In this study, we investigated the structural and functional responses of periphyton and macroinvertebrates to different densities of the Mediterranean barbel (Barbus meridionalis, Cyprinidae) in two stream reaches differing in flow regime. The study was conducted in Lemena Stream, a small calcareous Mediterranean stream with high nutrient levels. We selected a reach with permanent flow(permanent reach) and another subjected to flow regulation (regulated reach) with periods of flow intermittency. At each reach, we used in situ cages to generate 3 levels of fish density. Cages with 10 barbels were used to simulate high fish density (> 7 ind m(-2)); cages with open sides were used as controls (i.e. exposed to actual fish densities of each stream reach) thus having low fish density; and those with no fish were used to simulate the disappearance of fish that occurs with stream drying. Differences in fish density did not cause significant changes in periphyton bio-mass and macroinvertebrate density. However, phosphate uptake by periphyton was enhanced in treatments lacking fish in the regulated reach with intermittent flow but not in the permanent reach, suggesting that hydrologic alteration hampers the ability of biotic communities to compensate for the absence of fish. This study indicates that fish density can mediate the effects of anthropogenic alterations such as flow intermittence derived from hydrologic regulation on stream benthic communities and associated biogeochemical processes, at least in eutrophic streams.

Optimal implementation of green infrastructure practices to minimize influences of land use change and climate change on hydrology and water quality: Case study in Spy Run Creek watershed, Indiana	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Nutrient loading from the Maumee River watershed is a significant reason for the harmful algal blooms (HABs) problem in Lake Erie. The nutrient loading from urban areas needs to be reduced with the installation of green infrastructure (GI) practices. The Long-Term Hydrologic Impact Assessment-Low Impact Development 2.1 (L-THIA-LID 2.1) model was used to explore the influences of land use (LU) and climate change on water quantity and quality in Spy Run Creek watershed (SRCW) (part of Maumee River watershed), decide whether and where excess phosphorus loading existed, identify critical areas to understand where the greatest amount of runoff/pollutants originated, and optimally implement GI practices to obtain maximum environmental benefits with the lowest costs. Both LU/climate changes increased runoff/pollutants generated from the watershed. Areas with the highest runoff/pollutant amount per area, or critical areas, differed for various environmental concerns, land uses (LUs), and climates. Compared to optimization considering all areas, optimization conducted only in critical areas can provide similar cost-effective results with decreased computational time for low levels of runoff/pollutant reductions, but critical area optimization results were not as cost-effective for higher levels of runoff/pollutant reductions. Runoff/pollutants for 2011/2050 LUs/climates could be reduced to amounts of 2001 LU/climate by installation of GI practices with annual expenditures of $0.34 to $2.05 million. The optimization scenarios that were able to obtain the 2001 runoff level in 2011/2050, can also reduce all pollutants to 2001 levels in this watershed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Sensitivity of the glochidia (larvae) of freshwater mussels (Bivalvia: Unionida: Hyriidae) to cadmium, cobalt, copper, lead, nickel and zinc: Differences between metals, species and exposure time	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Freshwater mussels (Bivalvia: Unionida) are among the most threatened freshwater faunal groups worldwide. Metal contamination is one threat that has been linked to declining mussel population distribution and abundance. This study determined the sensitivity (valve closure) of the glochidia (larvae) of six species of Australian freshwater mussels to cadmium (Cd), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), nickel (Ni) and zinc (Zn), keymetal contaminants impacting urbanized coastal rivers in south-eastern Australia (home to similar to 50% of the population), in a soft reconstituted freshwater (hardness 42 mg CaCO3 L-1; alkalinity 22 mg CaCO3 L-1 and pH 7.0) over 72 h. The sensitivity of each mussel species to each metal increased 2.5-fold with increasing exposure time from 24 to 72 h. The most sensitive mussel species (Cucumerunio novaehollandiae), across all metals and exposure times, was similar to 60% more sensitive than the least sensitive species (Velesunio ambiguus). The relative sensitivity of glochidia to the six selected metals, across all mussel species and exposure times, was: Cu > Cd > Pb > Co = Ni > Zn. Glochidia were most sensitive to Cu and least sensitive to Zn. Quantitatively, the toxicity of Cu was 3-fold more than Cd, 8-fold more than Pb, 14-fold more than Co or Ni and 16-fold more than Zn. The cell surface binding affinities (conditional log K values) of Cd (range 6.65-6.94), Co (6.04-6.29), Cu (7.17-7.46), Ni (6.02-6.29), Pb (6.24-6.53) or Zn (5.96-6.23), pooled for all mussel species after 72 h exposure, were positively related to metal sensitivity. The chronic no effect concentrations (NECs) of Cu, Ni and Zn were below (i.e. glochidia were more sensitive than) their national freshwater guideline values, indicating that freshwater mussels may not be adequately protected for these metals in urbanized coastal rivers within south-eastern Australia.

Private-well stewardship among a general population based sample of private well-owners	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Private well stewardship, including on-going testing and treatment, can ensure private well users are able to maintain source-water quality and prevent exposures to potentially harmful constituents in primary drinking water supplies. Unlike municipal water supplies, private well users are largely responsible for their own testing and treatment and well stewardship is often minimal. The importance of factors influencing regular testing, and treatment behaviors, including knowledge, risk perception, convenience and social norms, can vary by geography and population characteristics. The primary goals of this study were to survey a general statewide population of private well users in Wisconsin in order to quantify testing and treatment patterns and gather data on motivations and barriers to well stewardship. The majority of respondents reported using and drinking well water daily but only about one half of respondents reported testing their wells in the last ten years and of these, only 10% reported testing in the last 12 months. Bacteria and nitrates were contaminants most often tested; and, a private laboratory most often conducted testing. The most commonly reported water treatment was a water softener. Living in a particular geographic region and income were the most significant predictors of water testing and treatment. Iron and hardness, which influence water aesthetics but not always safety, were the most commonly reported water quality problems. Health concerns or perceived lack thereof were, respectively, motivators and barriers to testing and treatment. Limited knowledge of testing and treatment options were also identified as barriers. Results confirm previous findings that well stewardship practices are minimal and often context specific. Understanding the target population's perceptions of risk and knowledge are important elements to consider in identifying vulnerable populations and developing education and policy efforts to improve well stewardship.

J	Ji, NN; Wang, SR; Zhang, L				Ji, Ningning; Wang, Shengrui; Zhang, Li			Characteristics of dissolved organic phosphorus inputs to freshwater lakes: A case study of Lake Erhai, southwest China	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												In this study, we made the first estimate of the annual dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) load to Lake Erhai, a typical mesotrophic-eutrophic lake in China. We also evaluated what proportion of DOP was bioavailable using enzymatically hydrolyzable phosphorus (EHP), and further assessed the potential impacts of DOP on lake water quality. We estimated that the annual DOP load into Lake Erhai accounted for nearly 50% of total dissolved phosphorus, while EHP accounted for about 30% of the bioavailable phosphorus (BAP) pool. The DOP load increased and accounted for a greater proportion of total dissolved phosphorus and BAP loads during the wet season, and helped maintain algal blooms. Inflowing rivers were the main source of DOP with high bioavailability to Lake Erhai, especially in the wet season. The EHP concentrations of the inflowing rivers were positively correlated with algal biomass. The observation suggests that, as a significant source of BAP, the contribution of the DOP load to eutrophication of the lake should not be ignored, especially given the low soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations in the lake water during the algal biomass period. Information on the contributions from different pollution sources is needed to support the development of effective P pollution control strategies. Short-term strategies to protect Lake Erhai include better management of the inflowing rivers, especially in the northern part during the wet season, while, over the long-term, strategies to decrease P release from lake sediments should be considered.

Projected impact of climate change and chemical emissions on the water quality of the European rivers Rhine and Meuse: A drinking water perspective	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Low river discharges of the rivers Rhine and Meuse are expected to occur more often and more prolonged in a changing climate. During these dry periods the dilution of point sources such as sewage effluents is reduced leading to a decline in chemical water quality. This study projects chemical water quality of the rivers Rhine and Meuse in the year 2050, based on projections of chemical emissions and two climate scenarios: moderate and fast climate change. It focuses on specific compounds known to be relevant to drinking water production, i.e. four pharmaceuticals, a herbicide and its metabolite and an artificial sweetener. Hydrological variability, climate change, and increased emission show a significant influence on the water quality in the Rhine and Meuse. The combined effect of changing future emissions of these compounds and reduced dilution due to climate change has leaded to increasing ( peak) concentrations in the river water by a factor of two to four. Current water treatment efficiencies in the Netherlands are not sufficient to reduce these projected concentrations in drinking water produced from surface water below precautionary water target values. If future emissions are not sufficiently reduced or treatment efficiencies are not improved, these compounds will increasingly be found in drinking water, albeit at levels which pose no threat to human health.

Functional indicators (e.g. river metabolism) have been proposed as a valuable tool to evaluate ecosystem impairment. In the present study we monitored river metabolism in spring (few days after a major flood) and in summer (after 35 days of low flow conditions) using both single-station and two-stations methods over a 24 h period up and downstream of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents on three Atlantic river reaches located in northern Spain (Europe). Concurrently with river metabolism, we characterized environmental characteristics (flow, velocity, depth, pH, water temperature, nutrients, etc.), benthic macroinvertebrate communities and biofilm (algae and epilithic biomass). Ecosystem Respiration (ER24) was similar at the different periods and locations, but Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) tended to decrease in impacted reaches (downstream WWTPs) and in summer (except in the Saja River). However, the balance of the metabolic processes showed a trend towards autotrophy in the largest river, while WWTP effluents increased its autotrophy. Chlorophyll a concentration was >4 times larger in spring than in summer in all river reaches, while epilithic biomass followed a similar but less obvious pattern. Increase of invertebrate scraper densities (mainly, Potamopyrgus antipodarum) seems to be a plausible explanation for biofilm biomass temporal patterns in all sites (higher in spring than in summer), altering GPP and ER24 patterns. Thus, metabolism rates show different responses to WWTP effluents depending on season and on the relationships among functional and structural components, with special focus on the composition and structure of macroinvertebrate communities. Increasing our understanding of cause-effect relationships on the impairment of aquatic ecosystems needs to account for both structural and functional components and their interactions.

The degree of phosphorus saturation of agricultural soils in Germany: Current and future risk of diffuse P loss and implications for soil P management in Europe	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Decades of intensive agricultural production with excessive application of P fertilizer have resulted in the accumulation of P in soils, threatening water bodies in most industrialized countries with eutrophication. In our study, we elucidated the risk of P loss of German agricultural soils by transforming provided monitoring data of plant-available P determined by the calcium-acetate-lactate (PCAL) and double-lactate method (PDL) into the degree of phosphorus saturation (DPS). As water-soluble phosphorus (WSP) is correlated to DPS, we derived a pedotransfer function (PTF) between PCAL and WSP for different soil types. Considering all soils together resulted in WSP = 0.1918 x PCAL (R-2 = 0.80, n = 54). Subsequently, risk parameters DPS and EPC0 were calculated from PCAL and PDL monitoring data (n > 337,000) by using the determined PTF and soil type-independent correlations with WSP, as published in an earlier study. Calculated DPS values from monitoring data indicated high risks of dissolved P loss for >76% of German arable soils. Recent suggestions by the Association of German Agricultural Analytical and Research Institutes (VDLUFA) to reduce recommended PCAL levels are crucial for the reduction of P loss risks in the future. The accuracy of predicted DPS and EPC0 values by CAL and other methods used in Europe to estimate plant-available P is limited by the soil type-dependency of these methods. Consequently, we recommend considering WSP as an agri-environmental soil P test across Europe. Our results indicate that a WSP level in soils can be defined that constitutes a reasonable compromise between the securing of agronomic production and the fulfillment of environmental goals.

Yet, predicting the responses of macroinvertebrates to these stressors combination is quite challenging due to the reduced available information, especially if biotic and abiotic seasonal variations are taken under consideration. This study focused on the response of macroinvertebrates by drift to single and combined effects of water scarcity and dissolved oxygen (DO) depletion over two seasons (winter and spring). A factorial design of two flow velocity levels - regular and low (vL) - with three levels of oxygen depletion - normoxia, medium depletion (dM) and higher depletion (dH) - was carried out in a 5-artificial channels system, in short-term experiments. Results showed that both stressors individually and together had a significant effect on macroinvertebrate drift ratio for both seasons. Single stressor effects showed that macroinvertebrate drift decreased with flow velocity reduction and increased with DO depletion, in both winter and spring experiments. Despite single stressors opposing effects in drift ratio, combined stressors interaction (vL x dM and vL x dH) induced a positive synergistic drift effect for both seasons, but only in winter the drift ratio was different between the levels of DO depletion. Stressors interaction in winter seemed to intensify drift response when reached lower oxygen saturation. Also, drift patterns were different between seasons for all treatments, which may depend on individual's life stage and seasonal behaviour. Water scarcity seems to exacerbate the oxygen depletion conditions resulting into a greater drifting of invertebrates. The potential effects of oxygen depletion should be evaluated when addressing the impacts of water scarcity on river ecosystems, since flow reductions will likely contribute to a higher oxygen deficit, particularly in Mediterranean rivers.

While plot scale experiments have focused on mobilisation processes, many catchment scale studies have hitherto concentrated on the controls of dominant flow pathways on nutrient delivery. To place mobilisation and delivery at a catchment scale, this study investigated their relative influence on contrasting nitrate-N and soluble P concentrations and N:P ratios in two shallow groundwater fed catchments with different land use (grassland and arable) on the Atlantic seaboard of Europe. Detailed datasets of N and P inputs, concentrations in shallow groundwater and concentrations in receiving streams were analysed over a five year period (October 2010-September 2015). Results showed that nitrate-N and soluble P concentrations in shallow groundwater give a good indication of stream concentrations, which suggests a dominant control of mobilisation processes on stream exports. Near-stream attenuation of nitrate-N ( 30%), likely through denitrification and"dilution, and enrichment in soluble P (+ 100%), through soil-groundwater interactions, were similar in both catchments. The soil, climate and land use controls on mobilisation were also investigated. Results showed that grassland tended to limit nitrate-N leaching as compared to arable land, but grassland could also contribute to increased P solubilisation. In the context of land use change in these groundwater fed systems, the risk of pollution swapping between N and P must be carefully considered, particularly for interactions of land use with soil chemistry and climate.

Groundwater quality in the alluvial aquifer system of northwest India: New evidence of the extent of anthropogenic and geogenic contamination	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Groundwater depletion has been widely studied in northwest India, but water quality concerns are still poorly constrained. In this study, we explore the hydrochemistry of the top 160 m of the aquifer system, through detailed field studies in the Bist-Doab region, considering both anthropogenic and geogenic controls. A detailed comparison is made between sites dominated by urban and agricultural landuse. Salinity, nitrate, chloride and lead concentrations are significantly higher in the shallow (0-50 m) groundwater system due to surface anthropogenic contaminant loading from agricultural and urban sources. The widespread occurrence of oxic groundwater within the aquifer system means that denitrification potential is limited and also enhances the mobility of selenium and uranium in groundwater. Geogenic trace elements (e.g. As, Se, F), are generally found at concentrations below WHO guideline drinking water values, however elevated U concentrations (50-70 mu g/L) are found within the deeper part of the aquifer and shallow urban aquifers associated with higher bicarbonate waters. Higher concentration of Se (10-40 mu g/L) are found exclusively in the shallow groundwater system where Se is mobilised from soils and transported to depth in the shallow aquifer due to the prevailing Oxidising aquifer conditions. New evidence from a range of environmental tracers shows elevated concentrations of anthropogenic contaminants in the deeper part of the aquifer (50-160 m deep) and demonstrates vulnerability to vertical migration of contaminants. Continued intensive groundwater abstraction. from >100 m deep means that water quality risks to the deep aquifer system need to be considered together with water quantity constraints.

J	Abraham, J; Dowling, K; Florentine, S				Abraham, Joji; Dowling, Kim; Florentine, Singarayer			Risk of post-fire metal mobilization into surface water resources: A review	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												One of the significant economic benefits to communities around the world of having pristine forest catchments is the supply of substantial quantities of high quality potable water. This supports a saving of around US$ 4.1 trillion per year globally by limiting the cost of expensive drinking water treatments and provision of unnecessary infrastructure. Even low levels of contaminants specifically organics and metals in catchments when in a mobile state can reduce these economic benefits by seriously affecting the water quality. Contamination and contaminant mobility can occur through natural and anthropogenic activities including forest fires. Moderate to high intensity forest fires are able to alter soil properties and release sequestered metals from sediments, soil organic matter and fragments of vegetation. In addition, the increase in post-fire erosion rate by rainfall runoff and strong winds facilitates the rapid transport of these metals downslope and downstream. The subsequent metal deposition in distal soil and water bodies can influence surface water quality with potential impacts to the larger ecosystems inclusive of negative effects on humans. This is of substantial concern as 4 billion hectares of forest catchments provide high quality water to global communities. Redressing this problem requires quantification of the potential effects on water resources and instituting rigorous fire and environmental management plans to mitigate deleterious effects on catchment areas. This paper is a review of the current state of,the art literature dealing with the risk of post-fire mobilization of the metals into surface water resources. It is intended to inform discussion on the preparation of suitable management plans and policies during and after fire events in order to maintain potable water quality in a cost-effective manner. In these times of climate fluctuation and increased incidence of fires, the need for development of new policies and management frameworks are of heighted significance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, to what extent the public can identify specific environmental problems and whether people are ready to cope with potential risks is to a great extent unknown. Public environmental awareness of factors underpinning the pollution of rivers and approaches for reducing it were studied in Rasht City of Guilan Province in northern Iran, with Zarjub and Goharrud rivers as a case study. Data were collected from residents on the banks of the studied rivers using a questionnaire. Industrial areas, hospitals, and poultry farms were perceived as the main factors deteriorating water pollution of Zarjub and Goharrud rivers in Guilan Province. The discharge of urban sewage into the rivers was the second most important polluting factor. Most residents on the banks of Zarjub and Goharrud rivers showed high interest in the conservation of the environment. Overall, 62.7% of the residents had moderate, 20% had high, and 4% had very high environmental awareness. Families and mass media (TV and radio) were perceived of being the most important sources of information of family members concerning environmental awareness. According to the residents, the main approach for alleviating the pollution of Zarjub and Goharrud rivers were creating green spaces, dredging the rivers, establishing a water purifying system, and establishing a waste incinerator with a separation system (based on municipal planning). The public in the study area appeared well prepared to cope with the risks of water pollution, but further improving environmental awareness of the community can be a first step for preventing environmental degradation. The positive attitudes of the residents towards environmental conservation, the use of proper information sources, and practical training in the context of extension services can be effective in conserving water resources in urban areas.

Influence of land development on stormwater runoff from a mixed land use and land cover catchment	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Mitigating for the negative impacts of stormwater runoff is becoming a concern due to increased land development. Understanding how land development influences stormwater runoff is essential for sustainably managing water resources. In recent years, aggregate low impact development-best management practices (LID-BMPs) have been implemented to reduce the negative impacts of stormwater runoff on receiving water bodies. This study used an integrated approach to determine the influence of land development and assess the ecological benefits of four aggregate LID-BMPs in stormwater runoff from a mixed land use and land cover (LULC) catchment with ongoing land development. It used data from 2011 to 2015 that monitored 41 storm events and monthly LULC, and a Personalized Computer Storm Water Management Model (PCSWMM). The four aggregate LID-BMPs are: ecological (S1), utilizing pervious covers (S2), and multi-control (S3) and (S4). These LID-BMPs were designed and distributed in the study area based on catchment characteristics, cost, and effectiveness. PCSWMM was used to simulate the monitored storm events from 2014 (calibration: R-2 and NSE > 0.5; RMSE <11) and 2015 (validation: R2 and NSE > 0.5; RMSE <12). For continuous simulation and analyzing LID-BMPs scenarios, the five-year (2011 to 2015) stormwater runoff data and LULC change patterns (only 2015 for LID-BMPs) were used. Results show that the expansion of bare land and impervious cover, soil alteration, and high amount of precipitation influenced the stormwater runoff variability during different phases of land development. The four aggregate LID-BMPs reduced runoff volume (34%61%), peak flow (6%-19%), and pollutant concentrations (53%-83%). The results of this study, in addition to supporting local LULC planning and land development activities, also could be applied to input data for empirical modeling, and designing sustainable stormwater management guidelines and monitoring strategies.

We developed a novel data analysis approach, using self-organizing maps and non-linear projection methods, to approximate the TCC dynamics using the multivariate data sets of abiotic parameter time-series, thus providing a method that could be implemented in an online water quality management system for water suppliers. The (TCC) data, obtained over several months, provided a good basis to study the microbiological dynamics in detail. Alongside the TCC measurements, online abiotic parameter time-series, including spring discharge, turbidity, spectral absorption coefficient at 254 nm (SAC254) and electrical conductivity, were obtained. High-density sampling over an extended period of time, i.e. every 45 min for 3 months, allowed a detailed analysis of the dynamics in karst spring water quality. Substantial increases in both the TCC and the abiotic parameters followed precipitation events in the catchment area. Differences between the parameter fluctuations were only apparent when analyzed at a high temporal scale. Spring discharge was always the first to react to precipitation events in the catchment area. Lag times between the onset of precipitation and a change in discharge varied between 0.2 and 6.7 h, depending on the spring and event. TCC mostly reacted second or approximately concurrent with turbidity and SAC254, whereby the fastest observed reaction in the TCC time series occurred after 2.3 h. The methodological approach described here enables a better understanding of bacterial dynamics in karst springs, which can be used to estimate risks and management options to avoid contamination of the drinking water.

Effects of inequality of supply hours on consumers' coping strategies and perceptions of intermittent water supply in Kathmandu Valley, Nepal	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												To investigate the effects of unequal supply hours on consumers' coping strategies and perceptions of the intermittent water supply (IWS) in the Kathmandu Valley (KV), Nepal we conducted a randomized household survey (n = 369) and on-site water quality tests. Half of the households received piped water for 6 or fewer hours per week. To augment or cope with the inadequate supply, 28% of the households used highly contaminated and expensive tanker-delivered water. Half of the piped water samples (n = 13) were contaminated with Escherichia coli. Free chlorine concentration in all piped water samples was below the national standards (0.1-0.2 mg/L), but combined chlorine was detected at an average of 0.24 mg/L, indicating ingression of contaminants in the network. Point-of-use devices could increase access to safe water in the KV from 42% to 80%. The use of Lorenz curves and Gini coefficients revealed inequality of piped water supply hours per week both between and within service areas in the IN, due mainly to a small percentage of households who receive longer supply hours. To cope with reduced supply hours, home owners pay more to get water from alternative sources, while tenants compromise their water consumption. Under IWS, expectations for improvements in piped water quality and supply regularity are higher than those for supply volume. Consumers' perceptions of the piped water services worsen with the reduction in supply hours, but perceptions of piped water tariff are independent of supply hours. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This dam was built in the context of steelmaking to constitute a water reservoir for blast furnace cooling and wet cleaning of furnace smokes. The dam also enhanced sediment deposition in the upstream zone. This study was performed to unravel the contamination status of sediments and to evidence possible contribution sources. The sediment layers were analyzed for water content, grain size, chemical composition, crystalline phases at a bulk scale and poorly crystalline and amorphous phases at a sub-micrometer scale. Visual aspect, texture, color, and chemical and mineralogical analyses showed that the settled sediments were mainly composed of fine black matter, certainly comprising steelmaking by-products. Those materials were highly enriched with Fe, Zn, Pb and other trace metals, except for a relatively thin layer of surficial sediments that had settled more recently. Bulk mineralogy revealed crystalline iron minerals, such as magnetite, goethite, wuestite and pyrite, in the deep layers of the sediment cores. Furthermore, microscopic investigations evidenced the presence of ferrospheres, goethite nanoparticles and newly formed Fe-aluminosilicates; all originating from the former steelmaking facilities. The variation of iron mineralogy, combined with specific chemical profiles and other sediment features, demonstrate the different contributions that constitute the sediment deposit. Furthermore, chemical and mineralogical features of goethite and Fe-aluminosilicates could be used as a fingerprint for such contaminated sediments. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, an effective watershed management method is explored, in which water quality is first assessed using the heavy metal pollution index and the human health risk index, and then by classifying the pollution and management grade based on cluster analysis and GIS visualization. Three marine reserves in Tianjin were selected and analyzed, namely the Tianjin Ancient Coastal Wetland National Nature Reserve (Qilihai Natural Reserve), the Tianjin DaShentang Oyster Reef National Marine Special Reserve (DaShentang Reserve), and the Tianjin Coastal Wetland National Marine Special Reserve (BinHai Wetland Reserve) which is under construction. The water quality and potential human health risks of 5 heavy metals (Pb, As, Cd, Hg, Cr) in the three reserves were assessed using the Nemerow index and USEPA methods. Moreover, ArcGIS10.2 software was used to visualize the heavy metal index and display their spatial distribution. Cluster analysis enabled classification of the heavy metals into 4 categories, which allowed for identification of the heavy metals whose pollution index and health risks were highest, and, thus, whose control in the reserve is a priority. Results indicate that heavy metal pollution exists in the Qilihai Natural Reserve and in the north and east of the DaShentang Reserve; furthermore, human health risks exist in the Qilihai Natural Reserve and in the BinHai Wetland Reserve. In each reserve, the main factor influencing the pollution and health risk were high concentrations of As and Pb that exceed the corresponding standards. Measures must be adopted to control and remediate the pollutants. Furthermore, to protect the marine reserves, management policies must be implemented to improve water quality, which is an urgent task for both local and national governments. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Much controversy exists about the factors that control the release of P from sediments (internal P loading). One of the main debates concerns the role of oxygen deficit (anoxia) in the regulation of water quality. Our results based on a comprehensive set of lakes worldwide demonstrate that internal P loading (IPtot) plays a significant role in water quality regulation. Internal P loading due to anoxia (IPanox) contributes significantly to the IPtot. However, this contribution is insufficient to significantly increase the chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration in stratifying lakes. In the lakes of the north temperate and boreal zone, this is because the IPanox reaches surface water layer in the end of the growing season. Observed water quality implications of IPtot are most likely caused by the sedimentary P that actually originates from the shallow areas. These findings suggest limitations for the use of aeration (improvement of the oxygen conditions in the hypolimnion) in lake water quality restoration. Moreover, lake ecosystem managers can benefit from our model that enables to predict anoxia triggered sedimentary P release from the combination of lake characteristics. The final decision on the use of aeration is indeed unique to each lake, and lake specific targets should be considered. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Episodic acidification of 5 rivers in Canada's oil sands during snowmelt: A 25-year record	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Episodic acidification during snowmelt is a natural phenomenon that can be intensified by acidic deposition from heavy industry. In Canada's oil sands region, acid deposition is estimated to be as much as 5% of the Canadian total and large tracks of northeastern Alberta are considered acid-sensitive because of extensive peatland habitats with poorly weathered soils. To identify the frequency, duration and severity of acidification episodes during snowmelt (the predominant hydrological period for delivery of priority pollutants from atmospheric oil sands emissions to surface waters), a 25-year record (1989 to 2014) of automated water quality data (pH, temperature, conductivity) was assembled for 3 rivers along with a shorter record (2012-2014) for another 2 rivers. Acidic episodes (pH < 7, ANC < 0) were recorded during 39% of all 83 snowmelt events. The severity (duration x magnitude) of episodic acidification increased exponentially over the study period (r(2) = 0.56, P < 0.01) and was strongly correlated (P < 0.01) with increasing maximum air temperature and weakly correlated with regional land development (P = 0.06). Concentrations of aluminum and 11 priority pollutants (Sb, As, Be, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Se, Ag, TI and Zn) were greatest (P <0.01) during low (<6.5) pH episodes, particularly when coincident with high discharge, such that aluminum and copper concentrations were at times high enough to pose a risk to juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Although low pH (pH < 6.5) was observed during only 8% of 32 acidification episodes, when present, low pH typically lasted 10 days. Episodic surface water acidification during snowmelt, and its potential effects on aquatic biota, is therefore an important consideration in the design of long-term monitoring of these typically alkaline (pH = 7.72 +/- 0.05) rivers.

Interspecies comparison of selected pollution biomarkers in dreissenid spp. inhabiting pristine and moderately polluted sites	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Stress biomarkers, which can outline impacts of contaminants in aquatic biota at the biochemical level, are increasingly used as early warning tools in environmental monitoring. Reliable biomarker based assessment schemes, however, request appropriate knowledge of baseline levels of selected endpoints, and the potential influence of a range of natural influencing factors (both abiotic and biotic) as well. In this study, we examined the interspecies variability of various biomarkers (metallothioneins (MT), ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity (EROD), lipid peroxidation (LPO), DNA strand breaks (DNA_sb), vitellogenin-like proteins (Vtg)) in Dreissena polymorpha and Dreissena bugensis inhabiting either pristine- or moderately impacted sites of Lake Balaton (Hungary). Levels of all biomarkers considered revealed low interspecies variability in the two dreissenid species at all sampling sites, with consistently higher (but statistically insignificant) values in Dreissena polymorpha. Levels of all biomarkers varied within the two investigated seasons, with significant influence of the reproduction cycle particularly on the levels of metallothioneins and vitellogenin-like proteins. Each biomarker considered was elevated by October, with significantly higher values in the mussels inhabiting harbours. Insignificant spatial and temporal variability in the general health indicators (condition index, total protein content) of dreissenids was observed, which, in parallel with evident rise in biomarker levels, apparently suggest that the anthropogenic impactsin harbours affect mussel fitness yet at sub organismal level. Our data might serve useful basis for future environmental monitoring surveys, especially in habitats where the progressive replacement of Dreissena polymorpha by Dreissena bugensis is taking place, as the interspecies variability in susceptibility to chemical stress of the two species is well comparable.

Recent evidence from molecular data and mating experiments has shown that some traditional diatom morphospecies represent species complexes, containing several to many cryptic species. This case study is based on epiphytic diatom and environmental data from shallow fishponds, investigating whether the recognition and use of fine taxonomic resolution (cryptic species) can improve assessment of community response to environmental drivers and increase sharpness of classification, compared to coarse taxonomic resolution (genus level and species level with unresolved species complexes). Secondly, trophy bioindication based on a species matrix divided into two compartments (species complexes and remaining species) was evaluated against the expectation that species complexes would be poor trophy indicators, due to their expected wide ecological amplitude. Finally, the response of species complexes and their members (cryptic species) to a trophic gradient (phosphorus) were compared. Multivariate analyses showed similar efficiency of all three taxonomic resolutions in depicting community patterns and their environmental correlates, suggesting that even genus level resolution is sufficient for routine bio-assessment of shallow fishponds with a wide trophic range. However, after controlling for coarse taxonomic matrices, fine taxonomic resolution (with resolved cryptic species) still showed sufficient variance related to the environmental variable (habitat groups), and increased the sharpness of classification, number of indicator species for habitat categories, and gave better separation of habitat categories in the ordination space. Regression analysis of trophic bioindication and phosphorus concentration showed a weak relationship for species complexes but a close relationship for the remaining taxa. GLM models also showed that no species complex responded to phosphorus concentration. It follows that the studied species complexes have wide tolerances to, and no apparent optima for, phosphorus concentrations. In contrast, various responses (linear, unimodal, or no response) of cryptic species within species complexes were found to total phosphorus concentration.

Predicting criteria continuous concentrations of metals or metalloids for protecting marine life by use of quantitative ion characteristic-activity relationships-species sensitivity distributions (QICAR-SSD)	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN					8th International Conference on Marine Pollution and Ecotoxicology (ICMPE)	JUN 20-24, 2016	Hong Kong, HONG KONG					Marine pollution by metals has been a major challenge for ecological systems; however, water quality criteria (WQC) for metals in saltwater is still lacking. Especially from a regulatory perspective, chronic effects of metals on marine organisms should receive more attention. A quantitative ion characteristic-activity relationships-species sensitivity distributions (QICAR-SSD) model, based on chronic toxicities for eight marine organisms, was established to predict the criteria continuous concentrations (CCCs) of 21 metals. The results showed that the chronic toxicities of various metals had good relationships with their physicochemical properties. Predicted CCCs of six metals (Hg2+, Cu2+, Pb2+, Cd2+, Ni2+ and Zn2+) were in accordance with the values recommended by the U.S. EPA, with prediction errors being less than an order of magnitude. The QICAR-SSD approach provides an alternative tool to empirical methods and can be useful for deriving scientifically defensible WQC for metals for marine organisms and conducting ecological risk assessments.

The bleaching affected eight species of corals with different growth forms. Bleaching at seven of the eight study sites was minor, affecting only 0.4-5.2% colonies and 0.8-10.0% coral-covered area. Sharp Island East, however, suffered from a moderate level of bleaching, with 13.1% colonies and 30.1% coral-covered area affected. Examination of the government's environmental monitoring data indicated abnormal water quality conditions preceding and during the bleaching event. Follow-up field surveys of tagged colonies showed that 76% of them had fully recovered, 12% partially recovered, and 12% suffered from mortality. These results indicate that the subtropical corals of Hong Kong are not immune to bleaching, and there is a need to study their responses under climate change scenarios. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Taiwanese marine microbenthic algal communities remain similar yet chlorophyll a concentrations rise in mesocosms with elevated CO2 and temperature	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN					8th International Conference on Marine Pollution and Ecotoxicology (ICMPE)	JUN 20-24, 2016	Hong Kong, HONG KONG					The effects of increasing CO2 concentrations and temperature on microalgal assemblages were examined in Taiwan using mesocosms that simulate coral reef ecosystem. We assessed changes in abundance and diversity of benthic algae grown at 25 degrees C and 28 degrees C, under ambient (similar to 400 mu atm) and at high CO2 conditions (800-1000 mu atm). Total alkalinity, pCO(2), and the aragonite saturation state, were all significantly different between control and high CO2 treatments in both temperature treatments. Chl a concentration increased significantly in CO2-treated groups at 25 degrees C, but benthic microalgal abundance was not significantly different. The number of microalgal species and the microalgal community structure did not differ between control and CO2-treated groups at both temperatures. Our results suggest that increasing CO2 may boost benthic microalgal primary productivity if sufficient nutrients are available, although site-specific responses are difficult to predict.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				NOV 30	2017	124	2			SI		929	937		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.06.050								WOS:000417964500045	28669477

Water quality was monitored at each site to evaluate the environmental impact caused by the resulting oil spills. The results show that the PAHs, turbidity, and other nutrients increased shortly after oil spill, however levels of these parameters eventually returned to baseline levels. On the other hand, DO saturation, pH and chl a decreased initially, reached maxima after 10 days, and returned to the baseline levels after 14 days. The chl a concentration, pH and DO saturation fluctuated in a similar pattern at both sites during the oil spills, likely driven by algal blooms. In this study, we documented a full environmental recovery at coastal areas before, during and after the oil spills. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Stimulation of Phytoplankton Production by Anthropogenic Dissolved Organic Nitrogen in a Coastal Plain Estuary	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												There is increased focus on nitrogen (N) containing dissolved organic matter (DOM) as a nutrient source supporting eutrophication in N-sensitive estuarine ecosystems. This is particularly relevant in watersheds undergoing urban and agricultural development, leading to increased dissolved organic N (DON) loading. To understand how this shift in N-loading influences estuarine phytoplankton production, nutrient addition bioassays were conducted in the N-limited Neuse River Estuary, North Carolina from 2014 to 2015. Additions included N-rich DOM sources characteristic of urban and agricultural development, including chicken and turkey litter leachate, wastewater treatment facility effluent, and concentrated river DOM (used as a reference). Each DOM addition was coupled with an inorganic nutrient treatment to account for inorganic nutrient concentrations (NO2/3, NH4, PO4) in each respective DOM addition. Repeated measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) showed that chicken litter leachate stimulated phytoplankton growth greater than its coupled inorganic nutrient treatment. Wastewater treatment facility effluent, turkey litter leachate, and concentrated river DOM did not stimulate phytoplankton growth greater than their respective inorganic nutrient controls. DOM fluorescence (EEM-PARAFAC) indicated the chicken litter contained a biologically reactive fluorescent DOM component, identified as the nonhumic, biologically labile, "N-peak", which may be responsible for stimulating the observed phytoplankton growth in the chicken litter leachate treatments.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				NOV 21	2017	51	22					13104	13112		10.1021/acs.est.7b03538								WOS:000416496700005	29083877

Modeling the Concentration of Volatile and Semivolatile Contaminants in Direct Contact Membrane Distillation (DCMD) Product Water	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) is an emerging water treatment technology that has high salt rejection; however, its commercialization potential for applications such as seawater desalination or industrial wastewater reuse may be limited by low rejection of volatile and semivolatile contaminants. In this manuscript, a contaminant concentration (CC) model describing the transport of volatile and semivolatile contaminants for DCMD systems was developed and validated using data from the bench-scale DCMD treatment of synthetic wastewaters. The DCMD tests showed that the more volatile contaminants (methyl-tert-butyl ether, acetone, pentanone, butanol, and hexanol) accumulated in the permeate collection stream at greater concentrations than in the feed stream. The validated CC model (average normalized root mean squared error <= 11.3%) was then used to evaluate the product water quality from the large-scale DCMD treatment of oil and gas produced waters. The modeled product water contaminant concentrations exceeded the Environmental Protection Agency limits for discharging to publicly owned treatment works. This indicated that DCMD treatment of produced waters may require additional processing to meet discharge requirements.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				NOV 21	2017	51	22					13113	13121		10.1021/acs.est.6b05663								WOS:000416496700006	29111695

We evaluated the suitability of the methodology to assess complex field contaminations through its application in the framework of a regional river monitoring network. Thanks to the high throughput acquisition of biomarker levels in G. fossarum exposed in four reference and 13 contaminated sites, we analyzed the individual responses of 38 peptides reporting for 25 proteins of interest in 170 organisms. Responses obtained in contaminated sites included inductions of vitellogenin-like proteins in male organisms, inductions of Na+K+/ATPases, and strong inhibitions of molt-related proteins such as chitinase and JHE-carboxylesterase. Proteins from detoxification and immunity processes were also found modulated in abundance. Summarizing, the results presented here show that the SRM strategy developed for multibiomarker measurement paves a very promising way to define multiple indicators of the health status of sentinel organisms for environmental hazard assessment.

Therefore, the knowledge about the distribution of nitrate in groundwater and its source has an effective role in protecting health. The study aimed to optimize an interpolation method to predict the nitrate concentration and assessment of aquifer vulnerability in Qazvin plain. Methods: One hundred sixty-two deep wells in Qazvin plain aquifer were randomly selected and nitrate concentration was analyzed in four different lands including agricultural, residential, steppe and mixed-use areas. Interpolation was done by IDW, Spline, Kriging and National neighbor methods using ArcGIS software. To select the best interpolation method, errors of predicted values were determined by Mean Relative Error (RME) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). For analysis of potential vulnerability of aquifer to nitrate pollution due to agricultural activity and sewage leaks, hazard factors and control factors were used for identification of hazard indexes (HI) using IPNOA and IPNOC model. Results: The results showed that in 8.82% and 18.52% of samples in agricultural and residential areas, the detected nitrate was above the acceptable level at 50 mg/L. National neighbor method with the lowest RME and Spline method with the lowest RMSE were provided the most accurate estimates of nitrates in the aquifer. The highest hazard was obtained in agricultural areas (HI = 6.11). Also, the most influential parameters on aquifer vulnerability were mineral fertilizer (HFf = 3), organic fertilizers (HFm = 3), irrigation systems (CFi = 1.04) and tillage patterns (CFap = 1.04). Conclusions: According to the results, National neighbor with the lowest RME was preferable than the other spatial interpolation methods for prediction of nitrate concentration in the aquifer. This method provided similar spatial distribution maps of nitrate in groundwater and that was an efficient method for assessing water quality. Hazard index as a result of agricultural activities (IPNOA) was ranged from "very low" to "low" which was in accordance with detected and predicted nitrate concentration in the aquifer. In addition he hazard of nitrate contamination from household (IPNOC) was in very low (class 2).

Assessing the chemical contamination dynamics in a mixed land use stream system	WATER RESEARCH												Traditionally, the monitoring of streams for chemical and ecological status has been limited to surface water concentrations, where the dominant focus has been on general water quality and the risk for eutrophication. Mixed land use stream systems, comprising urban areas and agricultural production, are challenging to assess with multiple chemical stressors impacting stream corridors. New approaches are urgently needed for identifying relevant sources, pathways and potential impacts for implementation of suitable source management and remedial measures. We developed a method for risk assessing chemical stressors in these systems and applied the approach to a 16-km groundwater-fed stream corridor (Grindsted, Denmark). Three methods were combined: (i) in-stream contaminant mass discharge for source quantification, (ii) Toxic Units and (iii) environmental standards. An evaluation of the chemical quality of all three stream compartments stream water, hyporheic zone, streambed sediment made it possible to link chemical stressors to their respective sources and obtain new knowledge about source composition and origin. Moreover, toxic unit estimation and comparison to environmental standards revealed the stream water quality was substantially impaired by both geogenic and diffuse anthropogenic sources of metals along the entire corridor, while the streambed was less impacted. Quantification of the contaminant mass discharge originating from a former pharmaceutical factory revealed that several 100 legs of chlorinated ethenes and pharmaceutical compounds discharge into the stream every year. The strongly reduced redox conditions in the plume result in high concentrations of dissolved iron and additionally release arsenic, generating the complex contaminant mixture found in the narrow discharge zone. The fingerprint of the plume was observed in the stream several km downgradient, while nutrients, inorganics and pesticides played a minor role for the stream health. The results emphasize that future investigations should include multiple compounds and stream compartments, and highlight the need for holistic approaches when risk assessing these dynamic systems.

To this end, the Locmariaquer site, where Crassostrea gigas is extensively cultivated, was selected to perform a one-year follow-up of tissular glutathione S-transferase and acetylcholinesterase specific activities in this filter feeder organism. Calculation of an integrated index, corresponding to the ratio of the two enzymes activities, allowed to discriminate from the environmental noise, several clusters which could be representative environmental stress, potentially latent pollution. Moreover, the estrogenic activity was assessed in water samples collected at Locmariaquer and other strategic sites of the gulf. The results evidenced a low estrogenic-disrupting compound contamination of waters.

Bloom dynamics and hydrographical conditions were examined by field survey. The bloom initially developed in the eastern area of Imari Bay, subsequently after rainfall during the neap tides, cell density exceeded over 10,000 cells ml. Vertical distribution of K. mikimotoi was primarily controlled by the light intensity and secondarily by the water quality during the daytime. Almost all cell-density maxima occurred in depths with weak daytime light intensities of < 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). In some cases of weak light intensity, cell-density maxima occurred in depths with favorable hydrodynamic conditions for the growth. Spatially classified areas were identified by cluster analysis using the growth rate calculated from seawater temperature and salinity. This study quantitatively evaluated the environmental factors of the eastern area, where the bloom initially occurred, during the development of the bloom.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				NOV 15	2017	124	1					130	138		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.07.019								WOS:000415391200028	28712772

Metals can be either toxic or beneficial to health, inducing many different responses. The response mechanism depends on the class of metals to which organisms are exposed: essential, nonessential, and borderline. To analyze the influence of metals from different classes on the protective mechanisms of an ascidian, we investigated the production of nitric oxide (NO) after exposure to various concentrations of Mg, Mn and Pb over different time periods. We also determined the amounts of each metal in the hemocytes. Our results indicated that especially Pb could stimulate NO production. Although Pb induced the highest NO production, cell viability was not severely altered in all Pb concentrations and time periods. Ascidians might serve as biomonitor for Pb, since their vanadocytes accumulate Pb.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				NOV 15	2017	124	1					441	448		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.06.043								WOS:000415391200061	28779885

Assessment of drinking water quality at the tap using fluorescence spectroscopy	WATER RESEARCH												Treated drinking water may become contaminated while travelling in the distribution system on the way to consumers. Elevated dissolved organic matter (DOM) at the tap relative to the water leaving the treatment plant is a potential indicator of contamination, and can be measured sensitively, inexpensively and potentially on-line via fluorescence and absorbance spectroscopy. Detecting elevated DOM requires potential contamination events to be distinguished from natural fluctuations in the system, but how much natural variation to expect in a stable distribution system is unknown. In this study, relationships between DOM optical properties, microbial indicator organisms and trace elements were investigated for households connected to a biologically-stable drinking water distribution system. Across the network, humic-like fluorescence intensities showed limited variation (RSD = 3.5-4.4%), with half of measured variation explained by interactions with copper. After accounting for quenching by copper, fluorescence provided a very stable background signal (RSD < 2.2%) against which a similar to 2% infiltration of soil water would be detectable. Smaller infiltrations would be detectable in the case of contamination by sewage with a strong tryptophan-like fluorescence signal. These findings indicate that DOM fluorescence is a sensitive indicator of water quality changes in drinking water networks, as long as potential interferents are taken into account.

Control strategies for nitrous oxide emissions reduction on wastewater treatment plants operation	WATER RESEARCH												The present paper focused on reducing greenhouse gases emissions in wastewater treatment plants operation by application of suitable control strategies. Specifically, the objective is to reduce nitrous oxide emissions during the nitrification process. Incomplete nitrification in the aerobic tanks can lead to an accumulation of nitrite that triggers the nitrous oxide emissions. In order to avoid the peaks of nitrous oxide emissions, this paper proposes a cascade control configuration by manipulating the dissolved oxygen set-points in the aerobic tanks. This control strategy is combined with ammonia cascade control already applied in the literature. This is performed with the objective to take also into account effluent pollutants and operational costs. In addition, other greenhouse gases emissions sources are also evaluated. Results have been obtained by simulation, using a modified version of Benchmark Simulation Model no. 2, which takes into account greenhouse gases emissions. This is called Benchmark Simulation Model no. 2 Gas. The results show that the proposed control strategies are able to reduce by 29.86% of nitrous oxide emissions compared to the default control strategy, while maintaining a satisfactory tradeoff between water quality and costs.

Climate change change risks, extinction debt, and conservation implications for a threatened freshwater fish: Carmine shiner (Notropis percobromus)	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Climate change is affecting many freshwater species, particularly fishes. Predictions of future climate change suggest large and deleterious effects on species with narrow dispersal abilities due to limited hydrological connectivity. In turn, this creates the potential for population isolation in thermally unsuitable habitats, leading to physiological stress, species declines or possible extirpation. The current extent of many freshwater fish species' spatio-temporal distribution patterns and their sensitivity to thermal impacts from climate change critical information for conservation planning are often unknown. Carmine shiner (Notropis percobromus) is an ecologically important species listed as threatened or imperilled nationally (Canada) and regionally (South Dakota, United States) due to its restricted range and sensitivity to water quality and temperature. This research aimed to determine the current distribution and spatio-temporal variability in projected suitable habitat for Carmine shiner using niche-based modeling approaches (MaxEnt, BIOCLIM, and DOMAIN models). Statistically down scaled, bias-corrected Global Circulation Models (GCMs) data was used to model the distribution of Carmine shiner in central North America for the period of 2041-2060 (2050s). Maximum mean July temperature and temperature variability were the main factors in determining Carmine shiner distribution. Patterns of projected habitat change by the 2050s suggest the spatial extent of the current distribution of Carmine shiner would shift north, with >50% of the current distribution changing with future projections based on two Representative Concentrations Pathways for CO2 emissions. Whereas the southern extent of the distribution would become unsuitable for Carmine shiner, suitable habitats are predicted to become available further north, if accessible. Importantly, the majority of habitat gains for Carmine shiner would be in areas currently inaccessible due to dispersal limitations, suggesting current populations may face an extinction debt within the next half century. These results provide evidence that Carmine shiner may be highly vulnerable to a warming climate and suggest that management actions - such as assisted migration - may be needed to mitigate impacts from climate change and ensure the long-term persistence of the species.

Differences in nitrate and phosphorus export between wooded and grassed riparian zones from farmland to receiving waterways under varying rainfall conditions	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Agricultural activities in catchments can cause excessive nutrient loads in waterways. Catchment nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) flows may be intercepted and assimilated by riparian vegetation. While prior studies suggest that woody vegetation is preferable for reducing P loads, the question remains: is woody vegetation or grass cover more effective at reducing catchment N and P exports to waterways. To address this we investigated the relative importance of vegetation type, hydrologic and soil microbial processes on N and P losses from soil to a stream. The study involved the analysis of data from two soil microcosm experiments, and a field case study. We found P leaching loss from riparian zones depended significantly on vegetation type (woody vs. grass cover), with lower P exported from wooded riparian, zones, irrespective of the scale of rainfall. For N leaching losses, the scale of rainfall had an effect. During high rainfall, vegetation type had a major effect on N leaching loss, with lower N exported from grassed verses wooded riparian zones. However, under low rainfall conditions, soil type and soil C and N stores, potential indicators of soil microbial activity, rather than vegetation cover, affected N leaching. It is hypothesized that soil microbes were reducing N removal under these conditions. We reason that nitrifiers may have played an important role in soil N cycling, as increased soil ammonium had a strong positive effect on nitrate leaching loads, mediated through soil nitrate stores. Whereas, N immobilization, via incorporation into microbial biomass, and denitrification processes appeared to be limited by C availability, with increased C associated with reduced N leaching. Overall, this study identified that N leaching losses from riparian zones appeared to be affected by two different processes, vegetative uptake and soil microbial processes, the relative importance of which was driven by hydrological conditions.

In hydro-geochemically dis-homogeneous areas, the use of a unique regional NBL, higher than TV, could arise problems to distinguish between natural occurrences and anthropogenic contaminant sources. Hence, the goal of this study is to improve the NBL definition employing a geostatistical approach, which reconstructs the contaminant spatial structure accounting geochemical and hydrogeological relationships. This integrated mapping is fundamental to evaluate the contaminant's distribution impact on the NBL, giving indications to improve it. We decided to test this method on the Drainage Basin of Venice Lagoon (DBVL, NE Italy), where the existing NBL is seven times higher than the TV. This area is notoriously affected by naturally occurring arsenic contamination. An available geochemical dataset collected by 50 piezometers was used to reconstruct the spatial distribution of arsenic in the densely populated area of the DBVL A cokriging approach was applied exploiting the geochemical relationships among As, Fe and NH4 +. The obtained spatial predictions of arsenic concentrations were divided into three different zones: i) areas with an As concentration lower than the TV, ii) areas with an As concentration between the TV and the median of the values higher than the TV, and iii) areas with an As concentration higher than the median. Following the BRIDGE suggestions, where enough samples were available, the 90th percentile for each zone was calculated to obtain a local NBL (LNBL). Differently from the original NBL, this local value gives more detailed water quality information accounting the hydrogeological and geochemical setting, and contaminant spatial variation. Hence, the LNBL could give more indications about the distinction between natural occurrence and anthropogenic contamination. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Xie, HI; Shen, ZY; Chen, L; Qiu, JL; Dong, JW				Xie Hui; Shen Zhenyao; Chen Lei; Qiu Jiali; Dong Jianwei			Time-varying sensitivity analysis of hydrologic and sediment parameters at multiple timescales: Implications for conservation practices	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Environmental models can be used to better understand the hydrologic and sediment behavior in a watershed system. However, different processes may dominate at different time periods and timescales, which highly complicate the model interpretation. The related parameter uncertainty may be significant and needs to be addressed to avoid bias in the watershed management. In this study, we used the time-varying and multi-timescale (TVMT) method to characterize the temporal dynamics of parameter sensitivity at different timescales in hydrologic and sediment modeling. As a case study, the first order sensitivity indices were estimated with the Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (FAST) method for the Hydrological Simulation Program - Fortran (HSPF) model in the Zhangjiachong catchment in the Three Gorge Reservoir Region (TGRR) in China. The results were compared to those of the traditional aggregate method to demonstrate the merits of the TVMT method. The time-varying nature of the hydrologic and sediment parameters was revealed and explained mainly by the variation of hydro-climatic conditions. The baseflow recession parameter, evapotranspiration (ET) parameter for the soil storage, and sediment wash off parameter showed high sensitivities almost across the whole period. However, parameters related to canopy interception and channel sediment scour varied notably over time due to changes in the climate forcing. The timescale-dependent characteristics was observed and was most evident for the baseflow recession parameter and ET parameter. At last, the parameters affecting the sediment export and transport were discussed together with the inferred conservation practices. Reasonable controls for sediment must be storm-dependent. Compared to management practices on the land surface, practices affecting channel process would be more effective during storm events. Our results present one of the first investigations for sediment modeling in terms of the importance of parameter sensitivity in both time periods and evaluation timescales for the model calibration, diagnostic evaluation, and prioritizing efforts for conservation practices.

Microbial use of low molecular weight DOM in filtered and unfiltered freshwater: Role of ultra-small microorganisms and implications for water quality monitoring	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays a central role in regulating productivity and nutrient cycling in freshwaters. It is therefore vital that we can representatively sample and preserve DOM in freshwaters for subsequent analysis. Here we investigated the effect of filtration, temperature (5 and 25 degrees C) and acidification (HCI) on the persistence of low molecular weight (MW) dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrogen (DON) and orthophosphate in oligotro-phic and eutrophic freshwater environments. Our results showed the rapid loss of isotopically-labelled glucose and amino acids from both filtered (0.22 and 0.45 mu m) and unfiltered waters. We ascribe this substrate depletion in filtered samples to the activity of ultra-small (<0.45 mu m) microorganisms (bacteria and archaea) present in the water. As expected, the rate of C, N and P loss was much greater at higher temperatures and was repressed by the addition of HCI. Based on our results and an evaluation of the protocols used in recently published studies, we conclude that current techniques used to sample water for low MW DOM characterisation are frequently inadequate and lack proper validation. In contrast to the high degree of analytical precision and rigorous statistical analysis of most studies, we argue that insufficient consideration is still given to the presence of ultra-small microorganisms and potential changes that can occur in the low MW fraction of DOM prior to analysis.

Since only very intensive and farreaching environmental policies could result in water quality improvements, valuing the restoration of the river presents many unique challenges. We develop a choice modeling approach to valuation of the restoration of this river, with general tightening of environmental policy as the policy, and an increase in prices as the payment vehicle. The estimation is performed in willingness to pay space, adjusting for heterogeneity of tastes. We find that respondents, who are primarily low income, exhibit higher willingness to pay for complete restoration than moderate restoration, higher for moderate restoration in comparison to minimal restoration, and that they prefer restoration sooner, rather than later.

J	Zhai, XY; Xia, J; Zhang, YY				Zhai, Xiaoyan; Xia, Jun; Zhang, Yongyong			Integrated approach of hydrological and water quality dynamic simulation for anthropogenic disturbance assessment in the Huai River Basin, China	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Detailed depiction of hydrological process and its associated pollution processes plays a critical role in environment improvement and management at basin scale. It also provides a useful tool to assess impact of potential factors on hydrological and water quality conditions. However, it was still difficult to well capture some typical characteristics of these complicated processes including built-in nonlinearity and time-variation, water infrastructure regulations, particularly for highly regulated basins. In this study, an integrated approach of hydrological and water quality dynamic simulation was proposed to solve these difficulties and assess the impacts of several anthropogenic disturbances. The Huai River Basin which was highly disturbed and seriously polluted, was selected as the study area. The main anthropogenic activities considered were point source pollution emissions, diffuse pollutant losses and dam regulations. Results showed that the integrated simulation could well capture the variations in water level, water discharge, concentrations of permanganate index (CODMn) and ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N) in high (2007), normal (2008) and low (2004) flow years at 15 stations in the upper and middle streams of Huai River Basin. The regulation rules of downstream sluices played negative roles on water quality improvement if keeping current pollution sources, while those of middle stream sluices played positive roles on water quality improvement. However, the water quality deterioration was mainly attributed to emission of point source pollution (12%-43%), followed by diffuse pollutant loss (0-23%) and water quantity-oriented dam regulation (-29%-20%). The study was expected to provide technical supports for the implementation of water pollution control and sustainable water resources management in the Huai River Basin, and give a reference of integrated hydrological and hydrodynamic simulation.

J	Gustavsson, M; Kreuger, J; Bundschuh, M; Backhaus, T				Gustavsson, Mikael; Kreuger, Jenny; Bundschuh, Mirco; Backhaus, Thomas			Pesticide mixtures in the Swedish streams: Environmental risks, contributions of individual compounds and consequences of single-substance oriented risk mitigation	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												This paper presents the ecotoxicological assessment and environmental risk evaluation of complex pesticide mixtures occurring in freshwater ecosystems in southern Sweden. The evaluation is based on exposure data collected between 2002 and 2013 by the Swedish pesticide monitoring program and includes 1308 individual samples, detecting mixtures of up to 53 pesticides (modal = 8). Pesticide mixture risks were evaluated using three different scenarios for non-detects (best-case, worst-case and using the Kaplan-Meier method). The risk of each scenario was analyzed using Swedish Water Quality Objectives (WQO) and trophic-level specific environmental thresholds. Using the Kaplan-Meier method the environmental risk of 73% of the samples exceeded acceptable levels, based on an assessment using Concentration-Addition and WQOs for the individual pesticides. Algae were the most sensitive organism group. However, analytical detection limits, especially for insecticides, were insufficient to analyze concentrations at or near their WQO's. Thus, the risk of the analyzed pesticide mixtures to crustaceans and fish is systematically underestimated. Treating non-detects as being present at their individual limit of detection increased the estimated risk by a factor 100 or more, compared to the best-case or the Kaplan-Meier scenario. Pesticide mixture risks are often driven by only 1-3 compounds. However, the risk-drivers (i.e., individual pesticides explaining the largest share of potential effects) differ substantially between sites and samples, and 83 of the 141 monitored pesticides need to be included in the assessment to account for 95% of the risk at all sites and years. Single-substance oriented risk mitigation measures that would ensure that each individual pesticide is present at a maximum of 95% of its individual WQO, would also reduce the mixture risk, but only from a median risk quotient of 2.1 to a median risk quotient of 1.8. Also, acceptable total risk levels would still be exceeded in more than 70% of the samples. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Storm event-scale nutrient attenuation in constructed wetlands experiencing a Mediterranean climate: A comparison of a surface flow and hybrid surface-subsurface flow system	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Among different Water Sensitive Urban Design options, constructed wetlands (CWs) are used to protect and restore downstream water quality by attenuating nutrients generated by stormwater runoff. This research compared the nutrient attenuation ability during a diverse population of storm events of two CWs: (a) a hybrid CW with multiple alternating surface flow (SF) and laterite-based subsurface flow (SSF) compartments, and (b) a single stage SF CW. Within storm variability, nutrient concentrations were assessed at 2 to 3-h intervals at both the main inlet and outlet of each CW. Dissolved oxygen concentrations of the surface waters were also monitored at 10-min intervals using high frequency in situ sensors. Nutrient loads into the CWs were observed to be higher when a high rainfall event occurred, particularly after longer antecedent dry conditions. Longer hydraulic retention times promoted higher attenuation at both sites. However, the relative extent of nutrient attenuation differed between the CW types; the mean total nitrogen (TN) attenuation in-the hybrid and SF CW was 45 and 48%, respectively. The hybrid ON attenuated 67% total phosphorus (TP) loads on average, while the SF ON acted as a net TP source. Periodic storm events transitioned the lentic ON into a lotic CW and caused riparian zone saturation; it was therefore hypothesized that such saturation of organic matter rich-riparian zones led to release of TP in the system. The hybrid CW attenuated the released TP in the downstream laterite-based SSF compartments. Diel oxygen metabolism calculated before and after the storm events was found to be strongly correlated with water temperature, solar exposure and antecedent dry condition during the pre-storm conditions. Furthermore, the SF ON showed a significant relationship between overall nutrient load attenuation and the change in oxygen metabolism during the storm perturbation, suggesting oxygen variation could be a useful proxy indicator of ON function.

Therefore, there is a need to develop efficient wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), which can be operated in remote communities under extreme climatic conditions. WWIPs have been identified as reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). The objective of this work was to quantify the presence of nine different ARG markers (int1, sul1, sul2, tet(O), erm(B), mecA, blar(CIX-M), bla(TEM), and qnr(S)) in two passive systems (waste stabilization ponds [WSPs]) and one mechanical filtration plant operating in two smaller and one large community, respectively, in Nunavut, Canada. Measurement of water quality parameters (carbonaceous oxygen demand, ammonia, total suspended solids, Escherichia coli and total coliforms) showed that the WWTPs provided only primary treatment Low levels of the ARGs (2 log copies/mL) were observed in the effluent, demonstrating that bacteria residing in three northern WWTPs harbour ARGs conferring resistance to multiple clinically -relevant classes of antibiotics. Our results indicate that long-term storage in WSPs benefitted removal of organic material and some ARGs. However, one WSP system showed evidence of the enrichment of sul1, sul2, mecA, tet(O) and qnr(S). Further research is needed to fully understand if these ARG releases pose a risk to human health, especially in the context of traditional hunting and fishing activities. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The ditch receives runoff of agriculture and domestic wastewater from an adjacent community. During 2013, the occurrence of 38 organic pollutants (pesticides, poly cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), artificial sweeteners and pharmaceutical residues) was monitored monthly at five selected points in the ditch water. Additionally, sediment and Typha domingensis (cattail) plants were collected in March, June, and September 2013 and investigated concerning their ability to absorb and accumulate pollutants. The concentrations of the selected pollutants in the ditch water ranged from sub ng L-1 (metolachlor, atrazine) tow (metalaxyl, acesulfame). The metabolites endosulfan sulfate and endosulfan lactone exceeded mostly the concentration of the precursor insecticide endosulfan. Sorption on sediments was of minor relevance for accumulation of pollutants in the ditch system. Concentrations in the sediments varied seasonally and ranged from 0.2 to 12,432 mu g kg(-1) dry weight (d.w.). T. domingensis accumulated ten of the studied pollutants mainly in roots (5-1065 lig kg(-1) d.w.). Overall, the monitoring results of the ditch compartments indicated that downstream the concentrations of the target pollutants decreased. Under no -flow conditions in the hot season, the ditch revealed a noticeable potential to mitigate pollutants. Among the high microbial activity in the water and the subtropical climate conditions, the ditch vegetation contributed to natural attenuation of the selected pollutants. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Allocation of monitoring stations is the first step in the design of a water quality network. For this task, planning objectives are identified and a Multi-Objective Artificial Bee Colony-based optimization algorithm is designed and implemented in a Geographic Information System framework. Specifically, the number of stations is minimized in a range of values at the same time that the detection of lower compliance areas, the affected population and the relative importance of the river stretches are maximized. The estimation of pollutant parameters such as Biochemical Oxygen Demand, Faecal Coliform Bacteria or Total Dissolved Solids is performed by using the WorldQual model. This allows to objectively allocate monitoring stations to rivers where no real measurements are available, and thus it is especially relevant to allocate water quality stations for the first time. This approach has been tested on the Great Fish River basin (South Africa), finding networks improving the values of the objective functions between 22.22% and 47.83% with respect to the ones of the current network. Moreover, the solution analysis provides insightful and valuable information to the decision maker. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

One promising technology to address this issue is in situ healing of compromised membranes via healing agents that are added to the feed side of a membrane system and seal the defect site because of increased hydraulic drag through damage site during filtration. We herein introduce an improved in situ membrane healing method using amine-functionalized silica microparticles that is effective under varying operating conditions, overcoming limitations faced by previous healing agents such as chitosan agglomerates. The silica microparticles are functionalized with branched polyethylenimine (PEI) molecules for efficient interparticle cross-linking with glutaraldehyde. The PEI-decorated silica microparticles (SiO2@PEI MPs) were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, and zeta potential analysis. This study investigates the selective deposition of the SiO2@PEI MPs on the damage area using confocal laser scanning microscopy under variable cross-flow rate (0.5-2.0 L/min) and flushing time (10 to 30 min) conditions. The in situ healing technique recovered the particle rejection of compromised membranes to 99.1% of the original membrane's performance without any flux decline. The results of this study show that the use of SiO2@PEI MPs is a promising and practical approach to ensure membrane process integrity.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				NOV 7	2017	51	21					12630	12637		10.1021/acs.est.7b03436								WOS:000414887200065	29064689

This synergism in mixtures containing an azole has mostly been studied by effect measurements, while the underlying mechanism has been less well investigated. In this study, six azole fungicides (cyproconazole, epoxiconazole, ketoconazole, prochloraz, propiconazole, and tebuconazole) were selected to investigate their synergistic potential and their CYP inhibition strength in the aquatic invertebrate Gammarus pulex. The strobilurin fungicide azoxystrobin was chosen as co-occurring substrate, and the synergistic potential was measured in terms of internal concentrations of azoxystrobin and associated biotransformation products (BTPs). Azoxystrobin is biotransformed by various reactions, and 18 BTPs were identified. By measuring internal concentrations of azoxystrobin and its BTPs with high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry in the presence and absence of azole fungicides followed by toxicokinetic modeling, we showed that the inhibition of CYP-catalyzed biotransformation reactions indeed played a role for the observed synergism. However, synergism was only observed for prochloraz at environmentally realistic concentrations. Increased uptake rate constants, an increase in the total internal concentration of azoxystrobin and its BTPs, in vivo assays for measuring CYP activities, and G. pulex video-tracking suggested that the 2-fold increase in bioaccumulation, and, thereby, the raised toxicity of azoxystrobin in the presence of prochloraz is not only caused by inhibited biotransformation but even more by increased azoxystrobin uptake induced by hyperactivity.

Modeling nutrient removal using watershed-scale implementation of the two-stage ditch	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Western Lake Erie Basin (WLEB) is the most intensively farmed region of the Great Lakes. Because of the flat topography and poorly-drained soils many farmers rely on drainage management practices (e.g., subsurface tile drainage, ditch channelization) to maintain productive agriculture. However, these practices also facilitate the delivery of excess nutrients and sediments to Lake Erie, which have been linked to recurring harmful algal blooms (HABs) and associated environmental degradation. Implementation of inset floodplains in formerly channelized waterways via the two-stage ditch can improve water quality but the efficacy has been tested using only implementation in short reaches. Watershed models are critical tools for assessing watershed-scale implementation and as such can guide effective management. We evaluated the effectiveness of the two-stage ditch in improving water quality in the River Raisin Watershed (RRW), a major subbasin in the WLEB, combining empirical measurements for nutrient reductions from two-stage ditches across the Midwest with output from a Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. We modeled two-stage implementation in 25, 50, and 100% of headwater reaches in the RRW, and found that the practice could reduce total annual NO3--N export by 2, 5 and 10%, respectively. The two-stage was even more effective at reducing total phosphorus (TP) export, which was reduced by 12, 20 and 31%, respectively. Compared to other conservation practices, nutrient reduction efficiency for the two-stage ditch was good, both in terms of percent load reduction and cost, but watershed-scale adoption will be required in order to achieve significant nutrient reductions as called for by policymakers.

Subsurface tile drained area detection using GIS and remote sensing in an agricultural watershed	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Subsurface tile drainage has been used around the globe to lower the water table and drain soils that are seasonally or perennially wet making them suitable for agriculture and/or increasing productivity. However, tile drainage systems have a negative impact on water quality of adjacent streams and ditches due to the transport of excess fertilizer nutrients like nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from fields. To support nutrient management and conservation practices like drain water management (DWM), accurate delineation of the agricultural area drained by tiles is critical for quantifying nutrient yields (nutrient mass per area per time) to downstream water bodies. In this study, we tested Geographic Information System decision tree classification (GIS DTC) and satellite remote sensing based methods (i.e., image differencing) to determine tile drainage area in an agricultural watershed, Shatto Ditch Watershed (SDW) in Indiana, USA. Using these techniques, we estimated that 79% of the cultivated area of SDW is tile drained with 94% accuracy according to the image differencing approach whereas 55% is classified as tile drained with an accuracy of 75% based on estimates from the DTC approach with the most relaxed rule thresholds (where tiles exist on <= 4% slope with poorly and moderately well drained soils). Using satellite imagery to characterize tile drained area at a high resolution over large geographical extent shows promise and will be important for accurately quantifying nutrient yields from tiles which will inform management and conservation efforts to reduce excess nutrient export to downstream water bodies.

Phosphorus concentrations in a Florida Everglades water conservation area before and after El Nino events in the dry season	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												The Florida Everglades depends on both seasonal hydroperiods and low nutrient loading. This study investigated phosphorus concentrations in a 237,000-ha wetland complex in the Greater Florida Everglades known as Water Conservation Area 3A (WCA-3A). WCA-3A is south and downstream of Lake Okeechobee and most of the agricultural activity in the Everglades region, but immediately north and upstream of the Everglades National Park. The original goal of the study was to investigate if this water conservation area was serving as a phosphorus sink during a 9-month period (October 2015 to June 2016) that normally would have bracketed the dry winter season of south Florida. The beginning of 2016 brought several unexpected polar fronts with high rainfall, an unusual weather pattern in subtropical Florida later confirmed to have been caused by an El Nino condition in the Pacific Ocean. Samples taken at the beginning of the dry season (October through December 2015 during pre-El Nino conditions) showed low phosphorus concentrations. In April and June 2016 during post-El Nino conditions, monthly average total phosphorus concentrations averaged 7.1-7.2 ppb total phosphorus in inflow region of WCA-3A, significantly higher (P = 0.030 and 0.045) than 3.0 and to 2.6 ppb in the wetland's outflow region. The wetland was found to be a sink of phosphorus with a 47% decrease in total phosphorus from north to south during this post- El Nino time. If future additional wetlands and water quality strategies are not in place to mitigate fluxes of phosphorus during future climate variations such as this El Nino condition, this wetland complex may take on an even greater role of protecting the water quality of the downstream Everglades National Park.																	0925-8574	1872-6992				NOV	2017	108		B				391	395		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.07.028								WOS:000423883000005

Solving Lake Erie's harmful algal blooms by restoring the Great Black Swamp in Ohio	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Harmful algal blooms are now a common occurrence around the world in these Anthropocene times because of fertilization of phosphorus and nitrogen for crop and animal production. One of the most dramatic cases in North America is the recent accelerated eutrophication of Lake Erie in the Laurentian Great Lakes. Also, we have lost, by some estimates, 50% of the world's wetlands in the 20th century and 90% of the wetlands in Ohio USA over the 19th and 20th centuries. We are proposing a serious analysis of an ecological engineering opportunity to restore parts of the former 400,000 ha (1 million acre) Great Black Swamp that was immediately southwest of Lake Erie in Ohio and is now one of the major sources of agricultural phosphorus to western Lake Erie through the Maumee River. Restoring and creating 20,000-40,000 ha (50,000-100,000 acres) or 5-10% of the original wetlands in the Black Swamp to optimize nutrient reduction could reduce phosphorus loading by 480-960 metric tons/year or 18-37% percent of the annual phosphorus loading by the Maumee River to Lake Erie. A thorough investigation of this idea will first require physical (mull-year mesocosm experiments), mathematical, and business models to explore biogeochemical, hydrologic and economic feasibility and reliability. If this presents reasonable results, it would be followed by the creation of a small 400-1000 ha (1000-2500 acre) demonstration treatment wetland in the Black Swamp region to see if wetland performance will scale up as predicted with the mesocosm and mathematical models. Only after a decade of studies at these smaller scale models and a demonstration levels would the full-scale nutrient retention wetlands be implemented in the former Black Swamp. When completed, these treatment wetlands would cover about 10% of the Great Black Swamp region and could remove, with proper ecological engineering design, 40% or more of the phosphorus load from the Maumee River Basin now going into Lake Erie.																	0925-8574	1872-6992				NOV	2017	108		B				406	413		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.08.040								WOS:000423883000007

Design of real-time and long-term hydrologic and water quality wetland monitoring stations in South Florida, USA	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Hydrologic regimes in tropical and subtropical regions (e.g. hurricanes, tropical storms, and droughts) impact biogeochemical processes in created and restored wetlands with variability of wet/dry seasons and extreme weather events. Our South Florida Wetland Monitoring Network (SFWMN) with three real-time hydrologic, water quality, and meteorological field stations was established by the Everglades Wetland Research Park of Florida Gulf Coast University in the subtropical Southwest Florida, USA, beginning in 2012. The stations include a restored freshwater marsh (RFM) and adjacent meteorological field station; a restored brackish water marsh (RBM); and a created freshwater treatment wetland system and adjacent meterological station (CFTW). Continuous observations of water depth, temperature, salinity, and pH for the period of January 2012 to January 2016 indicate significant differences among the restored freshwater marsh, the restored brackish marsh, and the created freshwater treatment wetlands for water temperature and pH for wet and dry seasons. The brackish wetland salinity fluctuated between 26.16 (in the dry season) to 1.03 ppt (in the wet season). The real-time dataset allowed up-to-date information of the frequency and duration of severe weather events illustrating, for example, that 70% of the 2012 annual rainfall (1129 mm) occurring in July and August with a 75.4 mm precipitation during one event tropical storm Isaac on August 26-28, 2012. This storm led to a water stage peak in the brackish wetland due to excessive watershed runoff, not tidal surges, and salinity decreased from 22.3 to 5.5 ppt. The coefficient of variation (CV) for water depth and water quality from all wetland monitoring stations exhibited similar variations during all seasons, except when the salinity for the brackish marsh (RBM) had the highest CV values (1.02) in the wet season. Principal component analysis (PCA) at each station identified the variance in water depth and water quality parameters as due to seasonal changes of precipitation in distinct wet and dry seasons. The data from these monitoring stations are also used for research by scholars and students as well as for teaching a better understanding of wetlands dynamics and function in the classroom. As a whole, these stations are being used to bring awareness about the fragile and unique hydrological conditions of wetlands in subtropical Southwest Florida, especially for long-term conditions related to sea level changes and more frequent tropical storms.

Relative importance of external and internal phosphorus loadings on affecting lake water quality in agricultural landscapes	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Internal phosphorus (P) loading from the sediment poses a high risk of being an additional P source to deteriorate water quality. Previous studies hypothesized that internal P loads can be as high as external P inputs, especially in P enriched landscapes such as agricultural areas. However, internal P loadings in eutrophic conditions are rarely quantified or compared with external P loads. In this study, we aimed to answer these three questions; 1) how much P is internally released from the sediment of hypereutrophic lakes? 2) how much do internal P loads contribute to lake water quality compared to external loads? and 3) what factors regulate the release and retention of P in the sediment? We selected four hypereutrophic lakes located in Eastern Nebraska. In the study lakes and watersheds, internal and external P loads were quantified in 2014. Total P concentrations of inflow water collected from primary water channels feeding the study lakes and daily inflow water discharge rates were used to calculate external P loads. Internal P loads were quantified from flow-through soil core incubation experiments. External TP loads varied temporarily depending on the changes in discharge, and were highest during spring storm events. The majority of internal P loading (i.e. P release from sediment) occurred in the summer when lakes experience strong stratification (i.e. anaerobic conditions). This is likely associated with oxygen availability in the sediments and chemical dissolution of P. By comparing the annual-scale of external and internal P inputs, external P loadings were still the dominant P source to the lakes, contributing up to 98% of the total P input whereas internal P loadings accounted for 4-12% of the total P input. Although internal P loads were relatively minor on an annual time scale, we found that summer internal loadings in some of study lakes exceeded their external loadings. Our results confirmed the dominant influence of external P loadings on water quality in the reservoirs. This suggests that non-point source controls and watershed management strategies to reduce external loadings should be implemented prior to internal P loading controls. Internal P loadings can be a significant P source, even if just temporarily, worsening water quality of agricultural reservoirs and downstream ecosystems in the summer. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Riparian forests play a major role in protecting water quality, and there is a need to assess the role of riparian restoration in reducing nutrients and sediment loading. This study uses watershed simulation modeling to evaluate impacts of riparian forest restoration on water quality in a tropical agricultural watershed. Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is used to simulate streamflow, suspended sediment and nutrients of the Sarapui River watershed, located in southeast Brazil. We observe a spatial and temporal variation in water quality impacts of changes in land use/land cover (LULC) and rainfall patterns. Watersheds with agricultural and some residential areas had a higher sediment and nutrients loads than forest and with pasture land uses, especially during the wet season. Forested watersheds in general had a better water quality than other LULC types. Riparian restoration in the study watershed can reduce suspended sediment (9.26%), total nitrogen (22.6%), and total phosphorus (7.83%). Protecting riparian zone and site-conservation practices is critical to improve water quality. We observe that the simulation model provides a satisfactory baseline of the watershed system to evaluate impacts of land use changes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Hsu, TTD; Mitsch, WJ; Martin, JF; Lee, J				Hsu, Tsung-Ta David; Mitsch, William J.; Martin, Jay F.; Lee, Jiyoung			Towards sustainable protection of public health: The role of an urban wetland as a frontline safeguard of pathogen and antibiotic resistance spread	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Wetlands are known for providing important ecosystem services, such as reduction of eutrophication. However, less research has focused on public health service of wetlands: their ability to protect microbial quality of water for downstream while they attract wildlife populations. For urban surface water, transmission of antibiotic resistance is also an important concern. Under anticipated climate change scenarios, more extreme precipitation patterns are emerging. Thus, runoff and flooding from increased precipitation will impair surface water quality more significantly. The objectives of this study were to 1) evaluate the dynamics of bacteria of public health concern in urban wetlands, including: Escherichia coli, Campylobacter, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), Arcobacter, and two antibiotic resistance genes (sulfonamide, sul1 and tetracycline, tetQ); and 2) identify the major fecal contamination sources using microbial source tracking (MST). Water samples were collected across the urban wetlands in central Ohio from June 2013 to June 2014 and tested with a culture-based (E. coli) and quantitative PCR (the rest) methods. Since Canada geese were the most observed wildlife at the study sites and they are known to carry an array of infectious disease agents, their fecal samples were also collected. From the water samples, E. coli (fecal indicator) had the highest occurrence in 99.2% of the total samples, followed by sul1 (98.3%), Arcobacter (94.9%), STEC (74.6%), tetQ (58.5%), and Campylobacter (1.7%). Overall reduction in E. coli was 22.3% across the wetlands, but variation was observed depending on the season. Microbial source tracking suggested a high prevalence of avian- (44.9%) and ruminant- (38.1%) originated fecal contaminations (e.g., Canada geese and deer). From the geese fecal samples, STEC (93.2%) and Arcobacter (4.5%) were detected, which could potentially compromise wetlands functions in reductions in bacteria of public health concern and antibiotic resistance. The results suggest that careful wildlife management together with long-term monitoring of microorganisms of concern are needed for making urban wetlands as a sustainable frontline safeguard of pathogen and antibiotic resistance spread in surface water.

J	Marion, JW; Zhang, F; Cutting, D; Lee, J				Marion, Jason W.; Zhang, Feng; Cutting, David; Lee, Jiyoung			Associations between county-level land cover classes and cyanobacteria blooms in the United States	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Cyanobacteria blooms can cause public health concerns related to drinking water quality and water recreation. The rapidly changing global climate is anticipated to bring about an increased frequency of extreme weather events (e.g. stronger storms, more extensive droughts), which are expected to promote more frequent cyanobacteria blooms that persist for longer durations in freshwater. Land use planning, landscape management, and ecological engineering may present mitigation opportunities for decreasing the occurrence and intensity of current and future cyanobacteria blooms through improved nutrient management strategies thereby reducing eutrophication of watersheds. To examine the potential impacts of various land cover classes (and their relative density) on cyanobacteria bloom coverage, county-level data were obtained or generated from the National Land Cover Database and the national nutrient inputs to the land surface database. These data were paired with county-level estimates of cyanobacteria bloom area obtained by satellite-based MERIS (Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer). Multivariable zero-inflated beta regression models were constructed for the U.S. and five U.S. regions for assessing the relationships between the proportion of county area experiencing a cyanobacteria bloom, county land cover types, and nutrient loading. The land cover type associated with the greatest decreases in bloom area in the national model was deciduous forest (p < 0.001). Open water extent (p = 0.001) and nitrogen loading from manure (p = 0.002) and fertilizer (p < 0.001) were positively associated with the proportion of water characterized as experiencing a cyanobacteria bloom. A significant interaction (p < 0.001) was observed between cultivated crop coverage and open water extent. Overall, increasing cultivated crop coverage was associated with increasing proportions of cyanobacteria blooms. Low intensity, medium intensity, and high intensity development land uses were not associated with bloom coverage in the national model, although development land uses were positively associated in several regional models. Ultimately, there is evidence that county-level land cover and nutrient loading, notably N in the national model, can impact countylevel cyanobacteria bloom coverage. Given regional model differences, additional remote sensing-based studies that examine watershed-based effects on cyanobacteria coverage are needed to establish watershed-specific associations. Studies that transcend county boundaries may provide greater utility than this correlational study for better characterizing land uses and mitigation measures that impact or could impact cyanobacteria bloom coverage in U.S. surface waters.																	0925-8574	1872-6992				NOV	2017	108		B				556	563		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.07.032								WOS:000423883000022

The potential for wetland systems to act as sinks for various types of pollutants indicates their potential for mitigating algal blooms. Although nutrient uptake in terrestrial treatment wetland systems has received substantial attention in the literature, relatively little is known about the mechanisms involved in floating constructed wetland (FCW) function for algal control and whether plant species can optimise performance. Here, the effect of FCWs on water quality including nutrient levels and algal biomass was investigated, along with the effect of planting with different species of macrophyte. All the planted FCWs showed significant potential for algal bloom mitigation in both hypereutrophic and mesotrophic systems; algal biomass control is proposed to be due to the direct uptake of nitrate and phosphate via macrophyte roots, rather than algaecidal effect of phenolic compounds. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) release was found to differ between species, with implications for drinking water treatment.																	0925-8574	1872-6992				NOV	2017	108		B				581	588		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.07.033								WOS:000423883000025

Phosphorus (P) impairment of fresh surface waters is a major concern in the USA and worldwide. The aim of this study is to use a bench scale P removal system that utilizes electrocoagulation (EC) to address this water quality problem. This study examined the effects of treatment parameters (initial pH, initial conductivity, power input, and initial P concentration) on the ability of the EC process to remove P in solutions with initial P concentrations less than 2 mg/L. It also investigated the ability of EC to reduce concentrations of P in surface water and treated wastewater. P concentrations in phosphate solutions, surface water, and wastewater effluent were reduced by 99% in under 60 min. The removal efficiency was demonstrated to be directly proportional to the conductivity and power supplied.																	0925-8574	1872-6992				NOV	2017	108		B				589	596		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.07.031								WOS:000423883000026

With the development of social economy, the pollution problem of Lijiang River in recent decades has become more and more serious, which has aroused widespread concern and attention. However, the study on the reduction of river pollution load is seldom found reported until now. In this paper, the pollutant load of Lijiang River is estimated by equal standard pollution load method and the water pollution model is used to simulate the reduction of river pollution load under different ecological water supply of upstream reservoir. The calculation results showed that the livestock and poultry breeding and rural life are the main sources of pollution, and the main pollutants are TN and TP, the pollution load ratio data of which is 30.30% and 29.39% respectively. The simulation results indicated that three kinds of upstream reservoir replenishment plans have obvious effect on the reduction in pollution load of Lijiang water. After being replenished by upstream reservoir, the concentration of water in downstream of the replenishment point decrease rapidly, the higher the water intensity is, the faster the concentration will decrease. Compared with the target year (S2), the 30m(3)/s water replenishment plan from the upstream reservoir can reduce about 20% of the annual average maximum concentration of CODMn and NH4-N in the river, and 60m(3)/s water replenishment can reduce about 40% in same rate. At the same time, by the comparison of annual average data and dry season average date simulation, we found that the constant replenishment in dry season improve water quality obviously.																	1582-9596	1843-3707				NOV	2017	16	11					2589	2598										WOS:000419141500019

The reverse osmosis process has been selected to study since it typically uses less energy than thermal distillation. The aim of the robust design is to overcome the limitation of classical controllers in dealing with large parametric uncertainties, external disturbances, sensor noises, and unmodeled process dynamics. The analyzed desalination process is modeled as a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system with varying parameters. The control system is decoupled using a feed forward decoupling method to reduce the interactions between control channels. Both nominal and perturbed reverse osmosis systems have been analyzed using structured singular values for their stabilities and performances. Simulation results show that the system responses meet all the control requirements against various uncertainties. Finally the reduced order controller provides excellent robust performance, with achieving decoupling, disturbance attenuation, and noise rejection. It can help to reduce the membrane cleanings, increase the robustness against uncertainties, and lower the energy consumption for process monitoring.																	1061-4303	1554-7531				NOV 1	2017	89	11					1932	1941		10.2175/106143017X15054988926316								WOS:000418398500001	29080563

Development of Multiple Regression Models to Predict Sources of Fecal Pollution	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												This study assessed the usefulness of multivariate statistical tools to characterize watershed dynamics and prioritize streams for remediation. Three multiple regression models were developed using water quality data collected from Sinking Creek in the Watauga River watershed in Northeast Tennessee. Model 1 included all water quality parameters, model 2 included parameters identified by stepwise regression, and model 3 was developed using canonical discriminant analysis. Models were evaluated in seven creeks to determine if they correctly classified land use and level of fecal pollution. At the watershed level, the models were statistically significant (p < 0.001) but with low r(2) values (Model 1 r(2) = 0.02, Model 2 r(2) = 0.01, Model 3 r(2) = 0.35). Model 3 correctly classified land use in five of seven creeks. These results suggest this approach can be used to set priorities and identify pollution sources, but may be limited when applied across entire watersheds.																	1061-4303	1554-7531				NOV 1	2017	89	11					1961	1969		10.2175/106143017X14839994523901								WOS:000418398500004	28327258

Design of Remediation Actions for Nutrient Mitigation in the Hyporheic Zone	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Although hyporheic exchange has been shown to be of great importance for the overall water quality of streams, it is rarely considered quantitatively in stream remediation projects. A main driver of hyporheic exchange is the hydraulic head fluctuation along the streambed, which can be enhanced by modifications of the streambed topography. Here we present an analytical 2-D spectral subsurface flow model to estimate the hyporheic exchange associated with streambed topographies over a wide range of spatial scales; a model that was validated using tracer-test-results and measurements of hydraulic conductivity. Specifically, engineered steps in the stream were shown to induce a larger hyporheic exchange velocity and shorter hyporheic residence times compared to the observed topography in Tullstorps Brook, Sweden. Hyporheic properties were used to parameterize a longitudinal transport model that accounted for reactions in terms of first-order decay and instantaneous adsorption. Theoretical analyses of the mitigation effect for nitrate due to denitrification in the hyporheic zone show that there is a Damkohler number of the hyporheic zone, associated with several different stream geomorphologies, that optimizes nitrate mass removal on stream reach scale. This optimum can be limited by the available hydraulic head gradient given by the slope of the stream and the geological constraints of the streambed. The model illustrates the complex interactions between design strategies for nutrient mitigation, hyporheic flow patterns, and stream biogeochemistry and highlights the importance to diagnose a stream prior remediation, specifically to evaluate if remediation targets are transport or reaction controlled.

The need for high-fidelity hydrodynamic and water quality models within optimization schemes is driven by improved computational capabilities, increased requirements to meet specific points of compliance with greater resolution, and the need to optimize operations of not just single reservoirs but systems of reservoirs. This study describes an important advancement for computing hourly power generation schemes for a hydropower reservoir using high-fidelity models, surrogate modeling techniques, and optimization methods. The predictive power of the high-fidelity hydrodynamic and water quality model CE-QUAL-W2 is successfully emulated by an artificial neural network, then integrated into a genetic algorithm optimization approach to maximize hydropower generation subject to constraints on dam operations and water quality. This methodology is applied to a multipurpose reservoir near Nashville, Tennessee, USA. The model successfully reproduced high-fidelity reservoir information while enabling 6.8% and 6.6% increases in hydropower production value relative to actual operations for dissolved oxygen (DO) limits of 5 and 6 mg/L, respectively, while witnessing an expected decrease in power generation at more restrictive DO constraints. Exploration of simultaneous temperature and DO constraints revealed capability to address multiple water quality constraints at specified locations. The reduced computational requirements of the new modeling approach demonstrated an ability to provide decision support for reservoir operations scheduling while maintaining high-fidelity hydrodynamic and water quality information as part of the optimization decision support routines. Plain Language Summary Hydropower operations can influence water quality, including temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations both upstream and downstream of dams. Meanwhile, as energy demands increase it is important to improve the efficiency and capacity of renewable sources. A well-optimized hydropower system thus requires a fully integrated approach where environmental quality and energy production are achieved together. Currently, hydropower optimization subject to environmental constraints is limited by dimensionality, resolution, and computational expense of detailed hydrodynamic and water quality models. The need for integrating these models within optimization schemes is now driven by improved computational capabilities, requirements to meet specific points of compliance, and the need to optimize systems of reservoirs. This study describes an approach for computing hourly power generation schemes for a hydropower reservoir using high-fidelity models, surrogate modeling techniques, and optimization methods. Surrogate models, which emulate the predictions of complex models at much less computational expense, are integrated into an optimization routine that maximizes hydropower generation subject to dam operations and water quality constraints. For the case study, the method found potential increases in hydropower production value relative to actual operations while maintaining DO minimum concentrations, and produced an expected decrease in power generation at more restrictive DO limits.

The intermittent creek receives domestic and industrial discharges of Kemalpasa District Center and its neighborhoods and more than 180 factories of the organized industrial zone. A monitoring campaign was conducted on the creek and samples were taken in two different seasons with distinct hydrological characteristics from 20 stations along the creek to quantify the quality status of water and sediment columns. A number of physicochemical parameters, heavy metals, and trace elements were measured by field and laboratory techniques to assess the status of creek's water and sediment quality. The spatial and temporal variations were determined, and statistical tools were used to conduct an environmental forensic overview along the creek. A geo-accumulation index and a modified heavy metal pollution index were calculated to cumulatively assess the quality of sediment and water columns, respectively. The results revealed that the creek was under significant pollution load from the industrial zone where metal processing, food and beverage production, marble and natural stone manufacturing, and paper production are made. In particular, elements such as Co, Cu, Cd, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn, and Zr were found to be above the surface water quality standard values. Similarly, B, Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Sn were determined to be in extreme levels in the sediment column with values exceeding the probable effect concentrations.

In Europe, the Water Framework Directive (WFD) gives the legal basis for the use of this indicator for water quality assessment and its management. Several quality indices, like the Specific Polluosensitivity Index (SPI), were developed to assess the ecological quality status of rivers based on diatom communities. It is based on morphological identifications and count of diatom species present in natural biofilms using a microscope. This methodology requires high taxonomic skills and several hours of analysis per sample as 400 individuals must be identified to species level. Since several years, a molecular approach based on DNA metabarcoding combined to High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) is developed to characterize species assemblages in environmental samples which is potentially faster and cheaper. The ability of this approach to provide reliable diatom inventories has been demonstrated and its application to water quality assessment is currently being improved. Despite optimization of the DNA metabarcoding process with diatoms, few studies had yet extended it at the scale of a freshwater monitoring network and evaluated the reliability of its quality assessment compared to the classical morphological approach. In the present study we applied DNA metabarcoding to the river monitoring network of the tropical Island Mayotte. This island is a French departement since 2011 and the WFD has to be applied. This offered the opportunity to scale up the comparison of molecular and morphological approaches and their ability to produce comparable community inventories and water quality assessments. Benthic diatoms were sampled following WFD standards in 45 river sites in 2014 and 2015 (80 samples). All samples were submitted in parallel to the molecular and the morphological approaches. DNA metabarcoding was carried out using Genelute DNA extraction method, rbcL DNA barcode and PGM sequencing, while microscopic counts were carried out for the classical methodology. Diatom community structures in terms of molecular (OTUs) and of morphological (species) were significantly correlated. However, only 13% of the species was shared by both approaches, with qualitative and quantitative variation due to i) the incompleteness of the reference library (82% of morphological species are not represented in the database), ii) limits in taxonomic knowledge and iii) biases in the estimation of relative abundances linked to diatom cell biovolume. However, ecological quality status assessed with the molecular and morphological SPI values were congruent, and little affected by sequencing depth. DNA metabarcoding of diatom communities allowed a reliable estimation of the quality status for most of the rivers at the scale of the full biomonitoring network of Mayotte Island.																	1470-160X	1872-7034				NOV	2017	82						1	12		10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.06.024								WOS:000417551700001

One of the increasing activities is recreation, including bathing areas in the south of the Caspian Sea, which have been scarcely studied and assessed. Investigating the interactions between human activities and the resulting environmental status in bathing areas, by using adequate indicators and assessment methods, is necessary to undertake management measures for ecosystem restoration. In this study, for the first time, we use the Nested Environmental status Assessment Tool (NEAT) outside the European waters to assess environmental status in bathing waters, to differentiate areas impacted and non-impacted by bathing activities. We have assessed the status in winter and summer seasons, by combining multiple indicators from different ecosystem components (8 physico-chemical, 4 bacteria, 2 plankton, and 1 benthos indicators). Despite the interactions between season and human affection, NEAT determined that the Caspian Seas is not in good status, differentiating, in summer, between impacted and non-impacted bathing areas, with a significant correlation with the number of beach users. Accordingly, management measures should be taken in the southern Caspian Sea to improve the environmental status in general and that of bathing areas in particular.

J	Pandey, J; Yadav, A				Pandey, Jitendra; Yadav, Amita			Alternative alert system for Ganga river eutrophication using alkaline phosphatase as a level determinant	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Short-term variations in phosphorus (P) concentrations must be considered while assessing the long-term changes in trophic status and estimating the P load and export. Furthermore, given the challenges of conventional monitoring of river systems, a sediment-specific biomonitoring tool may be more successful inferring P related human controls. In this study, conducted along a 37 km river channel representing up-and downstream urban control, and through a trajectory from a major point source (Assi drain), we tested the patterns of concordance between alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity and soluble reactive-P (SRP) and between AP activity and trophic status in the Ganga River. To validate data comparison, we selected a reference site at Dev Prayag, situated 1130 km upstream to the main study stretch. Samples were collected for three consecutive year (March 2013 to February 2016) with respect to atmospheric deposition, surface runoff, point source loading, river water and sediment analysis. For trajectory analysis, samples were collected from 15 locations starting from the drain outlet (zero distance) upto 1.5 km downstreaM with sampling location 100 m away from the preceding one. We found marked spatial and temporal variations in P concentrations which could be traced by quantifying the AP activity. The AP activity, recorded highest at reference site, declined with increases in P; and at drain mouth it was close to zero reflecting strong influence of P level on alkaline phosphatase activity in the river. We used canonical correlation analysis (CCorA) to test the degrees of concordance and similarity in different variables. Most of the environmental variables and indicators of eutrophy appear largely clustered at one side of the coordinate separating AP activity and dissolved oxygen towards opposite side of the axis. The dynamic fit function relating AP activity with different variables showed significant positive correlation with DO (R-2 = 0.67; p < 0.001) and negative correlations with BOD (R-2 = 0.82; p < 0.001), Chl a biomass (R-2 = 0.52; p < 0.001) and trophic status index (R-2 = 0.54 (Chl a), 0.96 (DRP); p < 0.001). Furthermore, the enzyme activity did not show significant negative correlation with heavy metals in sediment. Because anthropogenic activities continue to enhance P loads; AP is inhibited directly by P availability; and eutrophy feedbacks sediment P release, our observations on P-AP activity relationship provide a valuable alternative means for detecting P related. controls on water quality, trophic status and biogeochemical feedbacks in human impacted rivers.																	1470-160X	1872-7034				NOV	2017	82						327	343		10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.06.061								WOS:000417551700032

This biome covers an area of about 2 million km2, i.e. nearly 24% of the total area of Brazil, and has come under substantial pressure during the last 50 years caused by strong land-use/land-cover change, mostly due to agricultural expansion and urbanization. Because of its fast transformation rate, there is an enormous demand for knowledge, and its application, about the effects of land-use/land-cover on the capacity of providing or maintaining ecosystem services. The MapES approach was developed using a vast existing knowledge base. After analyzing and structuring this knowledge the relationships between land-use/land-cover and the potential to provide or maintain eight ecosystem services (Erosion Control, Runoff Control, Water Supply, Water Quality Maintenance, Soil Quality Maintenance, Biodiversity Maintenance, Food Production and Energy Production) were parametrized. In addition, the approach was developed as spatially explicit by including landscape properties (soil, slope and distance to river network) in the cell based system. A reference map of potential natural vegetation and a land use map for 2013 for a meso-scale experimental catchment (32.7 km(2)) were produced. The catchment was used as an example to apply the approach, i.e. assessing and visualizing changes from before human interference to the current land use situation. Finally, a procedure for assessing the potential impacts of land-use/land-cover on ecosystem services considering the methodological limitations of the respective monitoring. The presented approach is easy to understand, to modify and to adapt to other situations and might be therefore used in other context of decision support. It might also help to fill the gap between land use planning and numeric modeling using very complex tools.																	1470-160X	1872-7034				NOV	2017	82						513	525		10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.07.028								WOS:000417551700050

Diatom teratologies as biomarkers of contamination: Are all deformities ecologically meaningful?	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Contaminant-related stress on aquatic biota is difficult to assess when lethal impacts are not observed. Diatoms, by displaying deformities (teratologies) in their valves, have the potential to reflect sub-lethal responses to environmental stressors such as metals and organic compounds. For this reason, there is great interest in using diatom morphological aberrations in biomonitoring. However, the detection and mostly the quantification of teratologies is still a challenge; not all studies have succeeded in showing a relationship between the proportion of abnormal valves and contamination level along a gradient of exposure. This limitation in part reflects the loss of ecological information from diatom teratologies during analyses when all deformities are considered. The type of deformity, the severity of aberration, species proneness to deformity formation, and propagation of deformities throughout the population are key components and constraints in quantifying teratologies. Before a metric based on diatom deformities can be used as an indicator of contamination, it is important to better understand the "ecological signal" provided by this biomarker. Using the overall abundance of teratologies has proved to be an excellent tool for identifying contaminated and non-contaminated environments (presence/absence), but refining this biomonitoring approach may bring additional insights allowing for a better assessment of contamination level along a gradient. The dilemma: are all teratologies significant, equal and/or meaningful in assessing changing levels of contamination? This viewpoint article examines numerous interrogatives relative to the use of diatom teratologies in water quality monitoring, provides selected examples of differential responses to contamination, and proposes solutions that may refine our understanding and quantification of the stress. This paper highlights the logistical problems associated with accurately evaluating and interpreting teratologies and stimulates more discussion and research on the subject to enhance the sensitivity of this metric in bioassessments.

In this study, circular bubble plume diffusers were used, for the first time, to restore water quality in the Aha Reservoir, a typical sub-deep reservoir in Southwest China. Axisymmetric intrusive gravity currents were formed with a horizontal radius of 250 m at the equilibrium depth and the intrusion of oxygen-enriched water occurred within the depth of 10-14 m, while thermal stratification remained intact. A total of 95% of the imported oxygen was dissolved, but most was consumed by organic matter and other reduced substances within the hypolimnion. The oxygen consumption of organic matter, NH4+ and remaining reduced materials, accounted for 41.4-52.5%, 25% and 13.3-24.4% of the total imported oxygen, respectively. Compared with the control sites, dissolved oxygen level in the hypolimnion increased 3-4 times, and concentrations of NH4+, total Fe and total Mn were reduced by 15.5%, 45.5% and 48.9%, respectively. A significant decrease in total phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations was observed in the experimental zone (0.04-0.02 mg/L and 1.9-1.7 mg/L, respectively). This indicates that circular bubble plumes have great potential for oxygenation of the hypolimnion and improving water quality in the sub-deep water system. Nevertheless, further efforts are needed to improve the discrete bubble model to elaborate the oxygen transmission dynamics and the plume formation processes in sub-deep water systems, incorporating oxygen consumption processes.																	1660-4601					NOV	2017	14	11							1298	10.3390/ijerph14111298								WOS:000416545200014	29072625

In Pisa (Italy) we performed a three-year survey on Legionella presence in 121 buildings with an independent hot water production (IB); 64 buildings with a central hot water production (CB); and 35 buildings with a solar thermal system for hot water production (TB). From all the 220 buildings Legionella spp. was researched in two hot water samples collected either at the recirculation point or on the first floor and on the last floor, while the potable water quality was analysed in three cold water samples collected at the inlet from the aqueduct network, at the exit from the autoclave, and at the most remote tap. Legionella pneumophila sg1, Legionella pneumophila sg2-16, and non-pneumophila Legionella species were detected in 26% of the hot water networks, mostly in CB and TB. In these buildings we detected correlations between the presence of Legionella and the total chlorine concentration decrease and/or the increase of the temperature. Cold water resulted free from microbiological hazards, with the exception of Serratia liquefaciens and Enterobacter cloacae isolated at the exit from two different autoclaves. We observed an increase in total microbial counts at 22 degrees C and 37 degrees C between the samples collected at the most remote taps compared to the ones collected at the inlet from the aqueduct. The study highlights a condition of potential risk for susceptible categories of population and supports the need for measures of risk assessment and control.																	1660-4601					NOV	2017	14	11							1296	10.3390/ijerph14111296								WOS:000416545200012	29072607

Seasonal variations of rotifers from the high altitude Llano reservoir (State of Mexico, Mexico)	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												Aim: Llano reservoir is a high altitude waterbody and is of recreational importance in Mexico. It is also a source of revenue through fisheries. Though the reservoir was constructed nearly 6 decades ago, quantitative information on the zooplankton abundance is not available. The aim of the present study was to present data on the seasonal variations of rotifers from the high altitude waterbody Llano dam (State of Mexico) during a one year period. Methodology: Rotifer sampling was done monthly from 5 different littoral zones for one year (August 2014 to July 2015). Eighty liters of superficial water from the reservoir were concentrated to 200 ml through a plankton net of 50 mu m pore size and fixed in 4% formalin. Selected physico-chemical parameters (dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH, conductivity and nutrients (NO3- and PO4-3) and Chlorophyll a were also measured. Results: Temperature varied from 10-20 degrees C and pH 5-8. The reservoir had low turbidity (<3 NTU). nitrates (<60 mu g L-1), phosphates (<5 mu g L-1) and chlorophyll a (6-8 mu g L-1). In all, 84 species of monogonont rotifers (from 18 families and 39 genera) and 13 cladoceran species (from 3 families) were recorded. Aspelta angusta, Eosphora thoa, Trichocerca insulana and Lepadella punctata are new records for Mexico. Polyarthra vulgaris had the highest frequency of occurrence (98%), followed by Trichocerca bidens (90%) and Trichotria tectractis (75%). During April, we recorded the highest density (825 ind. I-1) of all rotifer species together, meanwhile for the rest of months, the density was low <300 ind. I-1. Shannon-Wiener index varied from 1.0 to 4.2 bits ind. I-1, depending on the sampling period. The Sladetek's Q(B/T) index in this reservoir was generally 1. Interpretation: In addition to nutrient levels, Chla and Q(B/T), the total rotifer density as a useful measure to determine the trophic status of this waterbody was explored. Our data from nutrients and total rotifer density showed that the Llano reservoir appeared to be oligotrophic.

Plankton community characteristics of natural and man-made tropical lakes	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												Aim : Plankton community assemblages in both natural and man-made lakes are greatly influenced by the environmental variations, which in turn are dependent on the lake morphometric characteristics, edaphic conditions, climatic changes and the surrounding anthropogenic activities. The main objective of the present study was to investigate the pattern of phytoplankton and zooplankton composition and density, and their relationship with the water chemistry in three different lakes of Malaysia. Methodology : Water quality, phytoplankton and zooplankton abundance were measured in a natural lake and two reservoirs in Malaysia. Multivariate and univariate analyses were performed to compare the differences in community assemblages between a natural lake and a reservoir of same depth, and a shallow and a deep reservoir. Results : Marked lake variations were observed in the phytoplankton density. Dominant phytoplankton groups were Cryptophyta and Bacillariophyta in the shallow Bera Lake, Chlorophyta in the shallow Bukit Merah Reservoir and Euglenophyta and Chlorophyta in the deeper Durian Tunggal reservoir. Both man-made lakes had significantly higher (P < 0.05) plankton densities compared to the natural lake. The shallower Bukit Merah Reservoir had higher phytoplankton density compared to the deeper Durian Tunggal Reservoir. Dissolved oxygen and pH levels were correlated to the phytoplankton and zooplankton communities in the Bera floodplain, whilst nutrient and chlorophyll-a concentrations were important factors affecting the phytoplankton and zooplankton assemblages, respectively,in the Durian Tunggal and Bukit Merah reservoirs. Interpretation : Plankton community in shallow tropical lakes have different characteristics and composition compared to the deeper ones, and thus requiring different management measures.

Terrestrial diatoms as tracers in catchment hydrology: a review	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER												Diatoms are remarkable organisms. They are present in almost all habitats containing water (e.g., lakes, streams, soils, bark) and rank among the most common algal groups in both freshwaters and marine ecosystems. The ubiquitous character of aquatic diatoms has triggered countless applications as environmental tracers for studies in water quality, paleoclimate reconstruction and sediment tracing. However, diatoms also occur in the terrestrial environment. It is this plethora of diatom life-forms that has recently triggered interest in their use as tracers of hydrological processes. The use of diatoms in catchment hydrology has been very limited. Part of the reason is that until recently, the taxonomy and ecology of terrestrial diatom assemblages were largely unknown. However, in the past decade, much work has been done to quantify terrestrial diatom reservoir size, dynamics, and potential depletion following precipitation events. Therefore, such terrestrial diatoms now hold promise for use in catchment hydrology-for tracing runoff flow sources and pathways across a wide range of spatial scales. Here we review the literature on terrestrial diatoms and describe the various sampling protocols that have been designed and tested for specific applications in hydrological processes research. We review and summarize the work on terrestrial diatom reservoir characterization, transport mechanisms and pathways to show how such diatom-based tracer work might be possible at the catchment scale for rainfall-runoff studies. Finally, we present a vision for future work that might take advantage of terrestrial diatoms in catchment hydrology and discuss the main challenges going forward. (C) 2017 The Authors.

This study examined this nexus by elasticity and statistical approaches through the lens of three watersheds: The Yukon, Mekong and Murray. Here, this study reports the fundamental characteristics, explanations and ecological and management implications of terrestrial determinant influence on the response of water quality to climate drivers. The stability of the response, measured by climate elasticity of water quality (CEWQ), is highly dependent on terrestrial determinants, with strong impacts from anthropogenic biomes and low impacts from surficial geology. Compared to temperature elasticity, precipitation elasticity of water quality is more unstable due to its possible linkages with many terrestrial determinants. Correlation and linear models were developed for the interaction system, which uncovered many interesting scenarios. The results implied that watersheds with a higher ratio of rangeland biomes have a lower risk of instability as compared to watersheds with a higher proportion of dense settlement, cropland and forested biomes. This study discusses some of the most essential pathways where instability might adversely affect CEWQ parameters and recommends suggestions for policy makers to alleviate the instability impacts to bring sustainability to the water environment.																	2071-1050					NOV	2017	9	11							2118	10.3390/su9112118								WOS:000416793400196						
J	Kim, S; An, K				Kim, Suyeon; An, Kyungjin			Exploring Psychological and Aesthetic Approaches of Bio-Retention Facilities in the Urban Open Space	SUSTAINABILITY												Over the last decades, a number of bio-retention facilities have been installed in urban areas for flood control and green amenity purposes. As urban amenity facilities for citizens, bio-retentions have a lot potential; however, the literature on bio-retentions focused mostly on physiochemical aspects like water quality and runoffs. Hence, this paper aims to explore psychological aspects of bio-retentions such as perceptions and landscape aesthetic value for visitors. In order to achieve this purpose, the study employed on-site interviews and questionnaires in the chosen three case studies as research methodology. For the 3 different locations of bio-retention facilities, interviews and questionnaires were carried out. The surveys of 100 bio-retention users were conducted, investigating their general perceptions and landscape aesthetics of the bio-retention facilities. The paper found that only 34% of the interviewees recognised bio-detention facilities, illustrating that most visitors were not aware of such facilities and were unable to distinguish the differences between bio-retention and conventional gardens. On the other hand, the majority of interviewees strongly supported the concept and function of bio-retentions, especially those who recognised the differences in planting species with conventional urban open spaces. Such main findings also encourage further studies of seeking quantitative values by conducting a correlation analysis between the functions and aesthetics of bio-retention facilities.																	2071-1050					NOV	2017	9	11							2067	10.3390/su9112067								WOS:000416793400147

The following results were obtained. (1) The total non-carcinogenic risk values of 14 surface water samples were all lower than 1, which indicates that these surface water samples will not pose non-carcinogenic risk. Drinking water intake is the main exposure pathway of non-carcinogenic risk. (2) Among the 15 phreatic groundwater wells monitored, the total non-carcinogen levels at 6 points exceeded safe levels for children, which indicates that the local groundwater is harmful to children's health. The order of contaminants contributing to this risk is NO3-N > Mn > Fe > NH4-N > NO2-N. (3) Among the 29 points of confined groundwater monitoring wells, 2 points showed total non-carcinogenic risk values exceeding safe levels for children, which indicates that the local groundwater is unsafe to children health. The order of contaminants contributing to non-carcinogenic risk is NO3-N > Mn > Fe > NH4-N > NO2-N.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				NOV	2017	76	22							UNSP 761	10.1007/s12665-017-7097-4								WOS:000416820300019						
J	Sharifinia, M; Adeli, B; Nafarzadegan, AR				Sharifinia, Moslem; Adeli, Behzad; Nafarzadegan, Ali Reza			Evaluation of water quality trends in the Maroon River Basin, Iran, from 1990 to 2010 by WQI and multivariate analyses	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												This research aimed to investigate the long-term spatiotemporal changes of surface water quality of the Maroon River by implementing Water Quality Index (WQI) and multivariate statistical analyses such as non-metric multidimensional scaling and cluster analyses, as complementary tools to investigate spatial variations in water quality parameters and also delineate areas in terms of water quality conditions in the period under study. The other purposes of this study were to evaluate the physicochemical properties of the Maroon River water and assess the effects of each water quality parameter on the WQI values. Relationship between quality scale of hydrochemical parameters and the resulting WQI scores was determined employing linear regression analysis. Moreover, the suitability of water quality was evaluated for irrigation purposes using conventional indices, electrical conductivity (EC), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), and percent sodium (Na%). The monitoring stations were placed in high and very high categories according to the assessment of irrigation water quality with EC. Considering WQI, the upper (S1, S2, and S4) and lower (S3, S5, and S6) monitoring stations of the Maroon River distributed in category C3 (high salinity) and C4-C5 (very high salinity), respectively. The findings of WQI presented an increasing trend from upstream toward downstream in the Maroon River. The findings of the linear regression analysis showed no significant correlation between WQI scores with pH and SO42- concentrations even though the relationship is weak. These results suggest that pH and SO42- concentrations could be the secondary driving parameters behind the variations in WQI scores. It can be inferred that the Maroon River water is appropriate for irrigation based on Na% and SAR. However, it also exhibits high EC. Therefore, for mitigating the adverse impacts of polluted water authors recommend multidimensional management practices such as transferable discharge permit programs in the study area.

However, other factors of water quality such as the water age must be taken into account while forming DMAs. The current study uses genetic algorithm (GA) optimization methods to achieve the desired WDN segmentation conditions in terms of: (a) reducing the operating pressure, thus reducing the system's real losses; and (b) reducing the water age, thus improving the feeling of water freshness and preventing growth of disinfection byproducts. Techniques based on GA are a proven way to provide a very good solution to optimization problems. The solution is obtained using an objective function and setting boundary constraints. The formation of the objective functions is tested through Matlab's optimization toolbox. The logic of the objective functions' formulation for both the operating pressure and the water age optimization is recorded and analyzed. The method's application utilized a sample network model assisted by EPANET and Bentley's WaterGEMS software tools. The morphology of the DMAs is presented for each scenario, as well as the results of the network's segmentation according to the operating pressure and the water age.																	1464-7141	1465-1734				NOV	2017	19	6			SI		890	899		10.2166/hydro.2017.156								WOS:000416447000009

The present paper utilizes optimization methods to achieve desired segmentation conditions in terms of (a) operating pressure reduction, thus reducing the system's real water losses and (b) residual chlorine concentration reduction thus preventing disinfection byproducts' growth. Exploiting the numerous possibilities offered by the inter-connection of Matlab and EPANET software tools, an algorithm is developed in C++ language. The algorithm reads all significant data of a WDN as an output of EPANET. The first algorithm calculates the optimal allocation of a given number of closed isolation valves in terms of water losses' reduction, considering restrictions for network's proper operation. The second algorithm calculates the optimal formation of DMAs in terms of water quality improvement. Both algorithms can be applied in any WDN. The outcome is the optimal set of closed pipes that leads to the optimal formation of DMAs in a given network. The closing of pipes (by installing isolation valves) determines the optimal formation of DMAs. The basic concept of both algorithms and their application in a case study network's hydraulic model are presented.																	1464-7141	1465-1734				NOV	2017	19	6			SI		900	910		10.2166/hydro.2017.157								WOS:000416447000010						
J	Baouab, MH; Cherif, S				Baouab, M. Hassen; Cherif, Semia			Identification of indispensable components for a better drinking water quality management: Tunis case of study	JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS												In order to reduce the number of operations for the assessment of potable water treatment, principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering are applied to large databases of raw and treated water of three treatment plants with various processes. It appears that the measurements can be divided into three clear groups, with a correlation higher than 0.8. The first contains salinity, conductivity, water hardness, calcium, magnesium and chlorides. The second includes turbidity and organic matter. The third includes pH and alkalinity. Despite the disparities in water quality and in all the cases, three parameters were sufficient to represent all the routine measurements: conductivity, turbidity and pH, which can represent the three principal components of the data. It can reduce by two-thirds of the measurement and analysis, dropping from 6,960 to 2,088 analysis annually. The analysis on the principal axes of the individuals, represented by raw and treated water from the three treatment plants, reveals that the quality of the raw water seems more important than the type of treatment process, in the resulting quality of treated water. These results could be generalized and easily adopted by other treatment plants whatever the process. They could offer substantial savings of time, chemicals, electricity and longevity of the devices.																	1464-7141	1465-1734				NOV	2017	19	6			SI		942	952		10.2166/hydro.2017.070								WOS:000416447000014

In this research first we developed a hydrological model (SWAT) to estimate recharge rates and its spatiotemporal distribution. Then, groundwater simulation of the basin was simulated and calibrated using MODFLOW 2000 and water quality was simulated and calibrated using MT3DMS. Afterwards, a multi-objective optimization model (MOPSO) and embed simulation models as tools to assess the objective function was carried out in order to produce a simulation-optimization model. Finally, a sustainability index to assess Pareto front's answers and three management scenarios (continuing previous operation, 30% increasing and reduction in previous operation) was developed. The results show that the majority of Pareto optimal answers have more sustainability index than a 30% reduction of operation with the best answer of 0.059. Relatively, the sustainability index of 30% reduction of operation is 0.05.																	1464-7141	1465-1734				NOV	2017	19	6			SI		973	992		10.2166/hydro.2017.007								WOS:000416447000016

In developing countries, the major source of antibiotic contamination in surface water is improper disposal of effluents from industries, hospitals and domestic waste water treatment plants. The antibiotic pollution combined with other environmental pollution factors exerts selective pressure on environmental microbes, driving evolution and resulting in the spread of antibiotic resistance in a local to global scale. Present study aimed to determine the proliferation of ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria in aquatic environment of a river which is heavily impacted by industrial effluents. Correlation analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of anthropogenic factors. Statistical analysis evaluated the effect of fluoroquinolones, heavy metals, total organic carbon and total nitrogen on the levels of resistant culture in samples from the natural settings.																	1747-6585	1747-6593				NOV	2017	31	4					456	462		10.1111/wej.12263								WOS:000416056200001

In Lebanon, we carried out experiments to assess the response of drip-irrigated table grapes grown under two water quality regimes (Freshwater (FW) and treated wastewater (TW) and two water levels (100% of evapotranspiration (ETc) and 75% of ETc). While in Jordan, we carried out experiments to assess the response of drip-irrigated fodder crops considering 4 irrigation levels (Q1: Rain fed; Q2: 80% of ETc; Q3: 100% of ETc; Q4: 120% of ETc) and three crop patterns (C1: Barley 100%; C2: Vetch 100%; C3: Mix 50% barley and 50% vetch). Based on the production and quality components, table grapes were successfully grown on plots that are supplied with TW. Fodder crops were successfully grown using TW with remarkable increase in biomass and grain yield production for the irrigated treatments.

Among different forms of aquatic pollutants, chemical and biological agents create paramount threat to water quality when the safety standards are surpassed. There are many conventional remediatory strategies that are practiced such as resin-based exchanger and activated charcoal/carbon and reverse osmosis. Newer technologies using plants, microorganisms, genetic engineering, and enzyme-based approaches are also proposed for aquatic pollution management. However, the conventional technologies have shown impending inadequacies. On the other hand, new bio-based techniques have failed to exhibit reproducibility, wide specificity, and fidelity in field conditions. Hence, to solve these shortcomings, nanotechnology ushered a ray of hope by applying nanoscale zinc oxide (ZnO), titanium dioxide (TiO2), and tungsten oxide (WO3) particles for the remediation of water pollution. These nanophotocatalysts are active, cost-effective, quicker in action, and can be implemented at a larger scale. These nanoparticles are climate-independent, assist in complete mineralization of pollutants, and can act non-specifically against chemically and biologically based aquatic pollutants. Photocatalysis for environmental remediation depends on the availability of solar light. The mechanism of photocatalysis involves the formation of electron-hole pairs upon light irradiations at intensities higher than their band gap energies. In the present review, different methods of synthesis of nanoscale ZnO, TiO2, and WO3 as well as their structural characterizations have been discussed. Photodegradation of organic pollutants through mentioned nanoparticles has been reviewed with recent advancements. Enhancing the efficacy of photocatalysis through doping of TiO2 and ZnO nanoparticles with non-metals, metals, and metal ions has also been documented in this report.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				NOV	2017	24	33					25775	25797		10.1007/s11356-017-0252-3								WOS:000416332100027						
J	Srivastava, P; Grover, S; Verma, J; Khan, AS				Srivastava, Prateek; Grover, Sarika; Verma, Jyoti; Khan, Ambrina Sardar			Applicability and efficacy of diatom indices in water quality evaluation of the Chambal River in Central India	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Diatom indices have gained considerable popularity in estimation of the trophic state and degree of pollution in lotic ecosystems. However, their applicability and efficacy have rarely been tested in Indian streams and rivers. In the present study, benthic diatom assemblages were sampled at 27 sites along the Chambal River in Central India. PCA revealed three groups of sites, namely, heavily polluted (HVPL), moderately polluted (MDPL), and least polluted (SANT). A total of 100 diatom taxa belonging to 40 genera were identified. Brachysira vitrea (Grunow) was the most abundant species recorded from the least polluted sites with an average relative abundance of 29.52. Nitzschia amphibia (Grunow) was representative of heavily polluted sites (average relative abundance 31.71) whereas moderately polluted sites displayed a dominance of Achnanthidium minutissimum (KIitzing) with an average relative abundance of 26.33. CCA was used to explore the relationship between diatom assemblage composition and environmental variables. Seventeen different diatom indices were calculated using diatom assemblage data. The relationship between measured water quality variables and index scores was also investigated. Most of the diatom indices exhibited strong correlations with water quality variables including BOD, COD, conductivity, and nutrients, particularly phosphate. Best results were obtained for TDI and IPS indices which showed a high level of resolution with respect to discrimination of sites on the basis of pollution gradients. Water quality maps for the Chambal River were hence prepared in accordance with these two indices. However, satisfactory results with respect to water quality evaluation were also obtained by the application of EPI-D and IGD indices. The present study suggests that TDI and IPS are applicable for biomonitoring of rivers of Central India. Diatom indices, which are simpler to use such as IGD, may be considered, at least for a coarser evaluation of water quality.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				NOV	2017	24	33					25955	25976		10.1007/s11356-017-0166-0								WOS:000416332100042	28940082

Study emphases covered publication outputs, language, categories, journals, countries/territories, institutions, words, and hot issues. The results indicated that the annual output of environmental monitoring publications increased steadily. The environmental sciences and analytical chemistry were the two most common categories. Environmental Monitoring and Assessment published the most articles. The USA and the UK ranked in the top two in terms of all five indicators. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency took the leading position of the institutions in terms of publication output. The synthesized analysis by words in title, author keywords, and KeyWords Plus provided important clues for hot issues. Researchers paid more attention on water environment monitoring than other environmental factors. The contaminants including organic contaminants, heavy metal, and radiation were most common research focuses, and the organic contaminants and heavy metal of the degree of concern were gradually rising. Sensor and biosensor played an important role in the field of environmental monitoring devices. In addition to conventional device detection method, the remote sensing, GIS, and wireless sensor networks were the mainstream environmental monitoring methods. The international organization, social awareness, and the countries' positive and effective political and policies promoted the published articles.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				NOV	2017	24	33					26079	26091		10.1007/s11356-017-0147-3								WOS:000416332100052

W.; Huang, Ju-Chang			Field Experiments of Chlorine Demand in Disinfection of Treated Primary Effluent	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												In the Hong Kong Harbour Area Treatment Scheme (HATS), a concentrated 10% chlorine solution (in sodium hypochlorite with a specific gravity of 1.2) is used directly to disinfect sewage that receives a chemically enhanced primary treatment (CEPT). The dense chlorine solution is injected into the treated sewage flow in the form of multiple dense jets. Field observations have revealed large variations of chlorine consumption in the treatment system. In view of the importance of the disinfection system to the environmental impact and operational cost of HATS, the mixing of a chlorine jet with the CEPT effluent and its associated chlorine consumption are studied for the first time using a 1: 2-scale sectional physical model located inside the sewage treatment plant, using sewage and a chlorine solution obtained on-site. The total residual chlorine (TRC) concentration distribution is measured at different cross sections of the chlorine mixing chamber. The overall disinfection efficiency is assessed by detailed measurement of the water quality of the outflow from the chamber, which receives only a few seconds of chlorine exposure. At a targeted dosing rate of 10-20 mg/L, only approximately 60-80% of the sewage flow is exposed to chlorine upon leaving the chamber, and approximately 70-80% of the chlorine mass flux is consumed within a very short distance (0.5-1 m, or a matter of several seconds) from the chlorine dosing unit. Overall, there is a 1-log Escherichia coli (E. coli) kill within the chlorine mixing chamber, with effective E. coli kill associated with a TRC concentration above 15 mg/L. The detailed field-scale model tests help to unravel the causes of the observed large TRC fluctuations in the plant and provide a basis for optimization of the chlorine disinfection operations (e.g., use of lower source chlorine concentration).

The sources of pollution are so vast and also include point and nonpoint sources, with intrinsic challenge for control and abatement. This paper focuses on pollutant concentrations and also the distance that the pollution is in contact with the river water as objective functions to determine two main necessary characteristics for water quality management in the river. These two necessary characteristics are named assimilative capacity and dilution flow. The mean area of unacceptable concentration and affected distance (X) are considered as two objective functions to determine the dilution flow by a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) optimization algorithm. The results demonstrate that the variation of river flow discharge in different seasons can modify the assimilation capacity up to 97%. Moreover, when using dilution flow as a water quality management tool, results reveal that the content of and X change up to 97% and 93%, respectively.																	0007-4861	1432-0800				NOV	2017	99	5					531	541		10.1007/s00128-017-2182-7								WOS:000415991900001	28951956

Individual and combined toxic effects of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47) on embryogenesis, and larval survival of the Pacific oyster were investigated. The EC50 values of BaP, BDE-47 and their mixture on embryogenesis were 18.4, 203.3 and 72.0 A mu g/L respectively, while the LC50 values for 96 h larval mortality were 26.8, 244.5 and 108.9 A mu g/L respectively. The Marking-Dawson additive toxicity indices were -0.02 and -0.19, indicating an additive effect with a trend to antagonism. In addition, DNA strand breaks were also observed in oyster embryos after exposure. Our study suggests that BaP and BDE-47 exposure can cause developmental abnormalities, DNA damage and larval mortality. Furthermore, the toxicity of the mixture is slightly lower than individual pollutant. These data will be helpful to predict the toxicity of organic pollutants, and provide criteria for marine water quality standards.																	0007-4861	1432-0800				NOV	2017	99	5					582	588		10.1007/s00128-017-2164-9								WOS:000415991900008	28889174

The Promise, Practice, and State of Planning Tools to Assess Site Vulnerability to Runoff Phosphorus Loss	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Over the past 20 yr, there has been a proliferation of phosphorus (P) site assessment tools for nutrient management planning, particularly in the United States. The 19 papers that make up this special section on P site assessment include decision support tools ranging from the P Index to fate-and-transport models to weather-forecast-based risk calculators. All require objective evaluation to ensure that they are effective in achieving intended benefits to protecting water quality. In the United States, efforts have been underway to compare, evaluate, and advance an array of P site assessment tools. Efforts to corroborate their performance using water quality monitoring data confirms previously documented discrepancies between different P site assessment tools but also highlights a surprisingly strong performance of many versions of the P Index as a predictor of water quality. At the same time, fate-and-transport models, often considered to be superior in their prediction of hydrology and water quality due to their complexity, reveal limitations when applied to site assessment. Indeed, one consistent theme from recent experience is the need to calibrate highly parameterized models. As P site assessment evolves, so too do routines representing important aspects of P cycling and transport. New classes of P site assessment tools are an opportunity to move P site assessment from general, strategic goals to web-based tools supporting daily, operational decisions.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				NOV-DEC	2017	46	6					1243	1249		10.2134/jeq2017.10.0395								WOS:000416288000012	29293848

Advances in high-performance computing and hydrologic or climate modeling have enabled rapid dissemination of real-time information that can assist landowners and conservation personnel with short-term management planning. This paper reviews short-term decision support tools for agriculture that are under various stages of development and implementation in the United States: (i) Wisconsin's Runoff Risk Advisory Forecast (RRAF) System, (ii) New York's Hydrologically Sensitive Area Prediction Tool, (iii) Virginia's Saturated Area Forecast Model, (iv) Pennsylvania's Fertilizer Forecaster, (v) Washington's Application Risk Management (ARM) System, and (vi) Missouri's Design Storm Notification System. Although these decision support tools differ in their underlying model structure, the resolution at which they are applied, and the hydroclimates to which they are relevant, all provide forecasts (range 24-120 h) of runoff risk or soil moisture saturation derived from National Weather Service Forecast models. Although this review highlights the need for further development of robust and well-supported short-term nutrient management tools, their potential for adoption and ultimate utility requires an understanding of the appropriate context of application, the strategic and operational needs of managers, access to weather forecasts, scales of application (e.g., regional vs. field level), data requirements, and outreach communication structure.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				NOV-DEC	2017	46	6					1257	1269		10.2134/jeq2016.09.0377								WOS:000416288000014	29293860

Thomas			Assessing Coastal Plain Risk Indices for Subsurface Phosphorus Loss	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Phosphorus (P) Index evaluations are critical to advancing nutrient management planning in the United States. However, most assessments until now have focused on the risks of P losses in surface runoff. In artificially drained agroecosystems of the Atlantic Coastal Plain, subsurface flow is the predominant mode of P transport, but its representation in most P Indices is often inadequate. We explored methods to evaluate the subsurface P risk routines of five P Indices from Delaware, Maryland (two), Virginia, and North Carolina using available water quality and soils datasets. Relationships between subsurface P risk scores and published dissolved P loads in leachate (Delaware, Maryland, and North Carolina) and ditch drainage (Maryland) were directionally correct and often statistically significant, yet the brevity of the observation periods (weeks to several years) and the limited number of sampling locations precluded a more robust assessment of each P Index. Given the paucity of measured P loss data, we then showed that soil water extractable P concentrations at depths corresponding with the seasonal high water table (WEPWT) could serve as a realistic proxy for subsurface P losses in ditch drainage. The associations between WEPWT and subsurface P risk ratings reasonably mirrored those obtained with sparser water quality data. As such, WEPWT is seen as a valuable metric that offers interim insight into the directionality of subsurface P risk scores when water quality data are inaccessible. In the long term, improved monitoring and modeling of subsurface P losses clearly should enhance the rigor of future P Index appraisals.

Vertical Stratification of Soil Phosphorus as a Concern for Dissolved Phosphorus Runoff in the Lake Erie Basin	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												During the re-eutrophication of Lake Erie, dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) loading and concentrations to the lake have nearly doubled, while particulate phosphorus (PP) has remained relatively constant. One potential cause of increased DRP concentrations is P stratification, or the buildup of soil-test P (STP) in the upper soil layer (< 5 cm). Stratification often accompanies no-till and mulch-till practices that reduce erosion and PP loading, practices that have been widely implemented throughout the Lake Erie Basin. To evaluate the extent of P stratification in the Sandusky Watershed, certified crop advisors were enlisted to collect stratified soil samples (0-5 or 0-2.5 cm) alongside their normal agronomic samples (0-20 cm) (n = 1758 fields). The mean STP level in the upper 2.5 cm was 55% higher than the mean of agronomic samples used for fertilizer recommendations. The amounts of stratification were highly variable and did not correlate with agronomic STPs (Spearman's r = 0.039, p = 0.178). Agronomic STP in 70% of the fields was within the buildup or maintenance ranges for corn (Zea mays L.) and soybeans [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] (0-46 mg kg(-1) Mehlich-3 P). The cumulative risks for DRP runoff from the large number of fields in the buildup and maintenance ranges exceeded the risks from fields above those ranges. Reducing stratification by a one-time soil inversion has the potential for larger and quicker reductions in DRP runoff risk than practices related to drawing down agronomic STP levels.

We compared risk ratings from 12 southern states (Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas) using data collected from benchmark sites in the South (Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Texas). Phosphorus Index ratings were developed using both measured erosion losses from each benchmark site and Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation 2 predictions; mostly, there was no difference in P Index outcome. The derived loss ratings were then compared with measured P loads at the benchmark sites by using equivalent USDA-NRCS P Index ratings and three water quality models (Annual P Loss Estimator [APLE], Agricultural Policy Environmental eXtender [APEX], and Texas Best Management Practice Evaluation Tool [TBET]). Phosphorus indices were finally compared against each other using USDA-NRCS loss ratings model estimate correspondence with USDA-NRCS loss ratings. Correspondence was 61% for APEX, 48% for APLE, and 52% for TBET, with overall P index correspondence at 55%. Additive P Indices (Alabama and Texas) had the lowest USDA-NRCS loss rating correspondence (31%), while the multiplicative (Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee) and component (Georgia, Kentucky, and North Carolina) indices had similar USDA-NRCS loss rating correspondence-60 and 64%, respectively. Analysis using Kendall's modified Tau suggested that correlations between measured and calculated P-loss ratings were similar or better for most P Indices than the models.

Edge-Of-Field Evaluation of the Ohio Phosphorus Risk Index	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												The Phosphorus Index (PI) has been the cornerstone for phosphorus (P)-based management and planning over the past twenty years, yet field-scale evaluation of many state PIs has been limited. In this study, P loads measured in surface runoff and tile discharge from 40 agricultural fields in Ohio with prevailing management practices were used to evaluate the Ohio PI. Annual P loads were highly variable among fields (dissolved reactive P: 0.03-4.51 kg ha(-1), total P: 0.03-6.88 kg ha(-1)). Both measured annual dissolved reactive P (R-2 = 0.36, p < 0.001) and total P (R-2 = 0.25, p < 0.001) loads were significantly related to Ohio PI score. The relationship between measured load and PI score substantially improved when averaged annual field values were used (dissolved reactive P: R-2 = 0.71, total P: R-2 = 0.73), indicating that the Ohio PI should be utilized to evaluate average annual risk of P loss, rather than as an annual risk tool. Comparison between the Ohio PI and other established local and national metrics resulted in large differences in potential P management recommendations for the monitored fields. In the near term, revision of Ohio PI risk categories and management recommendations using local P loading thresholds is needed. To meet the minimum criteria for state PI tools, future research efforts should focus on using measured field data (i) to incorporate new input factors (i.e., P application timing and leaching potential) into the Ohio PI, and (ii) to calibrate and validate the Ohio PI to provide better P risk assessments and management recommendations.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				NOV-DEC	2017	46	6					1306	1313		10.2134/jeq2016.05.0198								WOS:000416288000018	29293845

In this study, we compare field-scale P-loss predictions between the Annual P Loss Estimator (APLE), an empirically based annual time-step model, and the Texas Best Management Practice Evaluation Tool (TBET), a process-based daily time-step model based on the Soil and Water Assessment Tool. We first compared predictions of field-scale P loss from both models using field and land management data collected from 11 research sites throughout the southern United States. We then compared predictions of P loss from both models with measured P-loss data from these sites. We observed a strong and statistically significant (p < 0.001) correlation in both dissolved (r = 0.92) and particulate (r = 0.87) P loss between the two models; however, APLE predicted, on average, 44% greater dissolved P loss, whereas TBET predicted, on average, 105% greater particulate P loss for the conditions simulated in our study. When we compared model predictions with measured P-loss data, neither model consistently outperformed the other, indicating that more complex models do not necessarily produce better predictions of field-scale P loss. Our results also highlight limitations with both models and the need for continued efforts to improve their accuracy.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				NOV-DEC	2017	46	6					1314	1322		10.2134/jeq2016.04.0159								WOS:000416288000019	29293849

Multisite Evaluation of APEX for Water Quality: I. Best Professional Judgment Parameterization	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												The Agricultural Policy Environmental eXtender (APEX) model is capable of estimating edge-of-field water, nutrient, and sediment transport and is used to assess the environmental impacts of management practices. The current practice is to fully calibrate the model for each site simulation, a task that requires resources and data not always available. The objective of this study was to compare model performance for flow, sediment, and phosphorus transport under two parameterization schemes: a best professional judgment (BPJ) parameterization based on readily available data and a fully calibrated parameterization based on site-specific soil, weather, event flow, and water quality data. The analysis was conducted using 12 datasets at four locations representing poorly drained soils and row-crop production under different tillage systems. Model performance was based on the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), the coefficient of determination (r(2)) and the regression slope between simulated and measured annualized loads across all site years. Although the BPJ model performance for flow was acceptable (NSE = 0.7) at the annual time step, calibration improved it (NSE = 0.9). Acceptable simulation of sediment and total phosphorus transport (NSE = 0.5 and 0.9, respectively) was obtained only after full calibration at each site. Given the unacceptable performance of the BPJ approach, uncalibrated use of APEX for planning or management purposes may be misleading. Model calibration with water quality data prior to using APEX for simulating sediment and total phosphorus loss is essential.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				NOV-DEC	2017	46	6					1323	1331		10.2134/jeq2016.06.0226								WOS:000416288000020	29293832

Calibration of the APEX Model to Simulate Management Practice Effects on Runoff, Sediment, and Phosphorus Loss	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Process-based computer models have been proposed as a tool to generate data for Phosphorus (P) Index assessment and development. Although models are commonly used to simulate P loss from agriculture using managements that are different from the calibration data, this use of models has not been fully tested. The objective of this study is to determine if the Agricultural Policy Environmental eXtender (APEX) model can accurately simulate runoff, sediment, total P, and dissolved P loss from 0.4 to 1.5 ha of agricultural fields with managements that are different from the calibration data. The APEX model was calibrated with field-scale data from eight different managements at two locations (management-specific models). The calibrated models were then validated, either with the same management used for calibration or with different managements. Location models were also developed by calibrating APEX with data from all managements. The management-specific models resulted in satisfactory performance when used to simulate runoff, total P, and dissolved P within their respective systems, with r(2) > 0.50, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency > 0.30, and percent bias within +/-35% for runoff and +/-70% for total and dissolved P. When applied outside the calibration management, the management-specific models only met the minimum performance criteria in one-third of the tests. The location models had better model performance when applied across all managements compared with management-specific models. Our results suggest that models only be applied within the managements used for calibration and that data be included from multiple management systems for calibration when using models to assess management effects on P loss or evaluate P Indices.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				NOV-DEC	2017	46	6					1332	1340		10.2134/jeq2016.07.0272								WOS:000416288000021	29293861

The objective of this study was to compare predictions from the Texas Best Management Practice Evaluation Tool (TBET) against measured P-loss data to determine whether the model could be used to improve P Indices in the southern region. Measured P-loss data from field-scale study sites in Arkansas, Georgia, and North Carolina were used to assess the accuracy of TBET for predicting field-scale loss of P. We found that event-based predictions using an uncalibrated model were generally poor. Calibration improved runoff predictions and produced scatterplot regression lines that had slopes near one and intercepts near zero. However, TBET predictions of runoff met the performance criteria (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency >= 0.3, percent bias <= 35%, and mean absolute error <= 10 mm) in only one out of six comparisons: North Carolina during calibration. Sediment predictions were imprecise, and dissolved P predictions underestimated measured losses. In North Carolina, total P-loss predictions were reasonably accurate because TBET did a slightly better job of predicting sediment losses from cultivated land. In Arkansas and Georgia, where the experimental sites were in forage production, the underprediction of dissolved P led directly to the underpredictions of total P. We conclude that TBET cannot be used to improve southern P Indices, but a curve number approach could be incorporated into P Indices to improve runoff predictions.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				NOV-DEC	2017	46	6					1341	1348		10.2134/jeq2016.06.0210								WOS:000416288000022	29293843

Multisite Evaluation of APEX for Water Quality: II. Regional Parameterization	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Phosphorus (P) Index assessment requires independent estimates of long-term average annual P loss from fields, representing multiple climatic scenarios, management practices, and landscape positions. Because currently available measured data are insufficient to evaluate P Index performance, calibrated and validated process-based models have been proposed as tools to generate the required data. The objectives of this research were to develop a regional parameterization for the Agricultural Policy Environmental eXtender (APEX) model to estimate edge-of-field runoff, sediment, and P losses in restricted-layer soils of Missouri and Kansas and to assess the performance of this parameterization using monitoring data from multiple sites in this region. Five site-specific calibrated models (SSCM) from within the region were used to develop a regionally calibrated model (RCM), which was further calibrated and validated with measured data. Performance of the RCM was similar to that of the SSCMs for runoff simulation and had Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) > 0.72 and absolute percent bias (|PBIAS|) < 18% for both calibration and validation. The RCM could not simulate sediment loss (NSE < 0, |PBIAS| > 90%) and was particularly ineffective at simulating sediment loss from locations with small sediment loads. The RCM had acceptable performance for simulation of total P loss (NSE > 0.74, |PBIAS| < 30%) but underperformed the SSCMs. Total P-loss estimates should be used with caution due to poor simulation of sediment loss. Although we did not attain our goal of a robust regional parameterization of APEX for estimating sediment and total P losses, runoff estimates with the RCM were acceptable for P Index evaluation.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				NOV-DEC	2017	46	6					1349	1356		10.2134/jeq2016.07.0254								WOS:000416288000023	29293851

Larry			Evaluation of the APEX Model to Simulate Runoff Quality from Agricultural Fields in the Southern Region of the United States	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												The Agricultural Policy Environmental eXtender (APEX) model has been widely applied to assess phosphorus (P) loss in runoff water and has been proposed as a model to support practical decisions regarding agricultural P management, as well as a model to evaluate tools such as the P Index. The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of APEX to simulate P losses from agricultural systems to determine its potential use for refinement or replacement of the P Index in the southern region of the United States. Uncalibrated and calibrated APEX model predictions were compared against measured water quality data from row crop fields in North Carolina and Mississippi and pasture fields in Arkansas and Georgia. Calibrated models satisfactorily predicted event-based surface runoff volumes at all sites (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency [NSE] > 0.47, |percent bias [PBIAS]| < 34) except Arkansas (NSE < 0.11, |PBIAS| < 50) but did not satisfactory simulate sediment, dissolved P, or total P losses in runoff water. The APEX model tended to underestimate dissolved and total P losses from fields where manure was surface applied. The model also overestimated sediments and total P loads during irrigation events. We conclude that the capability of APEX to predict sediment and P losses is limited, and consequently so is the potential for using APEX to make P management recommendations to improve P Indices in the southern United States.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				NOV-DEC	2017	46	6					1357	1364		10.2134/jeq2017.07.0258								WOS:000416288000024	29293856

Use of Annual Phosphorus Loss Estimator (APLE) Model to Evaluate a Phosphorus Index	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												The Phosphorus (P) Index was developed to provide a relative ranking of agricultural fields according to their potential for P loss to surface water. Recent efforts have focused on updating and evaluating P Indices against measured or modeled P loss data to ensure agreement in magnitude and direction. Following a recently published method, we modified the Maryland P Site Index (MD-PSI) from a multiplicative to a component index structure and evaluated the MD-PSI outputs against P loss data estimated by the Annual P Loss Estimator (APLE) model, a validated, field-scale, annual P loss model. We created a theoretical dataset of fields to represent Maryland conditions and scenarios and created an empirical dataset of soil samples and management characteristics from across the state. Through the evaluation process, we modified a number of variables within the MD-PSI and calculated weighting coefficients for each P loss component. We have demonstrated that our methods can be used to modify a P Index and increase correlation between P Index output and modeled P loss data. The methods presented here can be easily applied in other states where there is motivation to update an existing P Index.

Revised Method and Outcomes for Estimating Soil Phosphorus Losses from Agricultural Land in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Model	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Current restoration efforts for the Chesapeake Bay watershed mandate a timeline for reducing the load of nutrients and sediment into receiving waters. The Chesapeake Bay watershed model (WSM) has been used for two decades to simulate hydrology and nutrient and sediment transport; however, spatial limitations of the WSM preclude edge-of-field scale representation of phosphorus (P) losses. Rather, the WSM relies on literature-derived, county-scale rates of P loss (targets) for simulated land uses. An independent field-scale modeling tool, Annual Phosphorus Loss Estimator (APLE), was used as an alternative to the current WSM approach. Identical assumptions of county-level acreage, soil properties, nutrient management practices, and transport factors from the WSM were used as inputs to APLE. Incorporation of APLE P-loss estimates resulted in greater estimated total P loss and a revised spatial pattern of P loss compared with the WSM's original targets. Subsequently, APLE's revised estimates for P loss were substituted into the WSM and resulted in improved WSM calibration performance at up to 79% of tributary monitoring stations. The incorporation of APLE into the WSM will improve its ability to assess P loss and the impact of field management on Chesapeake Bay water quality.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				NOV-DEC	2017	46	6					1388	1394		10.2134/jeq2016.05.0201								WOS:000416288000028	29293854

G.; Arriaga, Francisco J.; Stock, Melanie			Quantifying the Impact of Seasonal and Short-term Manure Application Decisions on Phosphorus Loss in Surface Runoff	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Agricultural phosphorus (P) management is a research and policy issue due to P loss from fields and water quality degradation. Better information is needed on the risk of P loss from dairy manure applied in winter or when runoff is imminent. We used the SurPhos computer model and 108 site-years of weather and runoff data to assess the impact of these two practices on dissolved P loss. Model results showed that winter manure application can increase P loss by 2.5 to 3.6 times compared with non-winter applications, with the amount increasing as the average runoff from a field increases. Increased P loss is true for manure applied any time from late November through early March, with a maximum P loss from application in late January and early February. Shifting manure application to fields with less runoff can reduce P loss by 3.4 to 7.5 times. Delaying manure application when runoff is imminent can reduce P loss any time of the year, and sometimes quite significantly, but the number of times that application delays will reduce P loss is limited to only 3 to 9% of possible spreading days, and average P loss may be reduced by only 15% for winter-applied manure and 6% for non-winter-applied manure. Overall, long-term strategies of shifting manure applications to low runoff seasons and fields can potentially reduce dissolved P loss in runoff much more compared with near-term, tactical application decisions of avoiding manure application when runoff is imminent.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				NOV-DEC	2017	46	6					1395	1402		10.2134/jeq2016.06.0220								WOS:000416288000029	29293831

Seasonal Manure Application Timing and Storage Effects on Field-and Watershed-Level Phosphorus Losses	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Timing of manure application to agricultural soils remains a contentious topic in nutrient management planning, particularly with regard to impacts on nutrient loss in runoff and downstream water quality. We evaluated the effects of seasonal manure application and associated manure storage capacity on phosphorus (P) losses at both field and watershed scales over an 11-yr period, using long-term observed data and an upgraded, variable-source water quality model called Topo-SWAT. At the field level, despite variation in location and crop management, manure applications throughout fall and winter increased annual total P losses by 12 to 16% and dissolved P by 19 to 40% as compared with spring. Among all field-level scenarios, total P loss was substantially reduced through better site targeting (by 48-64%), improving winter soil cover (by 25-46%), and reducing manure application rates (by 1-23%). At the watershed level, a scenario simulating 12 mo of manure storage (all watershed manure applied in spring) reduced dissolved P loss by 5% and total P loss by 2% but resulted in greater P concentrations peaks compared with scenarios simulating 6 mo (fall-spring application) or 3 mo storage (four-season application). Watershed-level impacts are complicated by aggregate effects, both spatial and temporal, of manure storage capacity on variables such as manure application rate and timing, and complexities of field and management. This comparison of the consequences of different manure storage capacities demonstrated a tradeoff between reducing annual P loss through a few high-concentration runoff events and increasing the frequency of low peaks but also increasing the annual loss.

A new subroutine that couples existing matrix-excess and matrix-desiccation macropore flow theory and a modified P routine is implemented in the Agricultural Policy Environmental eXtender (APEX) model. The original and modified formulation were applied and evaluated for a case study in a poorly drained field in Western Ohio with 31 months of surface and subsurface monitoring data. Results highlighted that a macropore subroutine in APEX improved edge-of-field discharge calibration and validation for both tile and total discharge from satisfactory and good, respectively, to very good and improved dissolved reactive P load calibration and validation statistics for tile P loads from unsatisfactory to very good. Output from the calibrated macropore simulations suggested median annual matrix-desiccation macropore flow contributions of 48% and P load contributions of 43%, with the majority of loading occurring in winter and spring. While somewhat counterintuitive, the prominence of matrix-desiccation macropore flow during seasons with less cracking reflects the importance of coupled development of macropore pathways and adequate supply of the macropore flow source. The innovative features of the model allow for assessments of annual macropore P contributions to tile drainage and has the potential to inform P site assessment tools.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				NOV-DEC	2017	46	6					1413	1423		10.2134/jeq2016.06.0218								WOS:000416288000031	29293822

Managing Surface Water Inputs to Reduce Phosphorus Loss from Cranberry Farms	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.) production in Massachusetts represents one-fourth of the US cranberry supply, but water quality concerns, water use, and wetland protection laws challenge the future viability of the state's cranberry industry. Pond water used for harvest and winter flooding accounts for up to two-thirds of phosphorus (P) losses in drainage waters. Consequently, use of P sorbing salts to treat pond water holds promise in the mitigation of P losses from cranberry farms. Laboratory evaluation of aluminum (Al)-, iron (Fe)-, and calcium (Ca)-based salts was conducted to determine the application rate required for reducing P in shallow (0.4 m) and deep (3.2 m) water ponds used for cranberry production. Limited P removal (< 22%) with calcium carbonate and calcium sulfate was consistent with their relatively low solubility in water. Calcium hydroxide reduced total P up to 49%, but increases in pond water pH (> 8) could be detrimental to cranberry production. Ferric sulfate and aluminum sulfate applications of 15 mg L-1 (ppm) resulted in near-complete removal of total P, which decreased from 49 +/- 3 to < 10 mg P L-1 (ppb). However, ferric sulfate application lowered pH below the recommend range for cranberry soils. Field testing of aluminum sulfate demonstrated that at a dose of 15 mg L-1 (similar to 1.4 Al mg L-1), total P in pond water was reduced by 78 to 94%. Laboratory and field experiments support the recommendation of aluminum sulfate as a cost-effective remedial strategy for reducing elevated P in surface water used for cranberry production.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				NOV-DEC	2017	46	6					1472	1479		10.2134/jeq2017.04.0134								WOS:000416288000037	29293836

In areas where in-stream chemical and hydrological data are limited but where estimates of nutrient loads are needed to guide management, it is necessary to apply more generalized models that make few assumptions about underlying processes. This paper presents the selection and application of a model to estimate total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) loads in two semiarid and adjacent catchments exposed to pollution risk in north-central Ethiopia. Using specific criteria to assess model suitability resulted in the use of the Pollution Load (PLOAD) model. The model relies on estimates of nutrient loads from point sources such as industries and export coefficients of land use, and it is calibrated using measured TN and TP loads from the catchments. The performance of the calibrated PLOAD model was increased, reducing the sum of errors by 89 and 5% for the TN and TP loads, respectively. The results were validated using independent field data. Next, two scenarios were evaluated: (i) use of riparian buffer strips, and (ii) enhanced treatment of industrial effluents. The model estimated that combined use of the two scenarios could reduce TN and TP loads by nearly 50%.

J	Su, Y; Guan, DJ; Su, WC; Gao, WJ				Su Yin; Guan Dongjie; Su Weici; Gao Weijun			Integrated assessment and scenarios simulation of urban water security system in the southwest of China with system dynamics analysis	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The demand for global freshwater is growing, while global freshwater available for human use is limited within a certain time and space. Its security has significant impacts on both the socioeconomic system and ecological system. Recently, studies have focused on the urban water security system (UWSS) in terms of either water quantity or water quality. In this study, water resources, water environment, and water disaster issues in the UWSS were combined to establish an evaluation index system with system dynamics (SD) and geographic information systems (GIS). The GIS method performs qualitative analysis from the perspective of the spatial dimension; meanwhile, the SD method performs quantitative calculation about related water security problems from the perspective of the temporal dimension. We established a UWSS model for Guizhou province, China to analyze influencing factors, main driving factors, and system variation law, by using the SD method. We simulated the water security system from 2005 to 2025 under four scenarios (Guiyang scenario, Zunyi scenario, Bijie scenario and combined scenario). The results demonstrate that: (1) the severity of water security in cities is ranked as follows: three cities are secure in Guizhou province, four cities are in basic security and two cities are in a situation of insecurity from the spatial dimension of GIS through water security synthesis; and (2) the major driving factors of UWSS in Guizhou province include agricultural irrigation water demand, soil and water losses area, a ratio increase to the standard of water quality, and investment in environmental protection. A combined scenario is the best solution for UWSS by 2025 in Guizhou province under the four scenarios from the temporal dimension of SD. The results of this study provide a useful suggestion for the management of freshwater for the cities of Guizhou province in southwest China.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				NOV	2017	76	9					2255	2267		10.2166/wst.2017.333								WOS:000415638000001	29144284

The experimental results showed that the vortex wave flow state in the membrane module could be formed when the Reynolds number (Re) of liquid was adjusted between 450 and 1,050, and the membrane flux declined more slowly in the vortex wave flow state than those in the laminar flow state and turbulent flow state. The MBR system was used to treat domestic wastewater under the condition of vortex wave flow state for 30 days. The results showed that the removal efficiency for CODcr and NH3-N was 82% and 98% respectively, and the permeate quality met the requirement of 'Water quality standard for urban miscellaneous water consumption (GB/T 18920-2002)'. Analysis of the energy consumption of the MBR showed that the average energy consumption was 1.90 +/- 0.55 kWh/m(3) (permeate), which was only two thirds of conventional MBR energy consumption.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				NOV	2017	76	9					2465	2472		10.2166/wst.2017.400								WOS:000415638000021	29144304					
J	Chen, H; Zuo, QT; Zhang, YY				Chen, Hao; Zuo, Qi-ting; Zhang, Yong-yong			Preliminary results of water quality assessment using phytoplankton and physicochemical approaches in the Huai River Basin, China	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Water pollution has been a significant issue in the Huai River Basin (HRB) of China since the late 1970s. In July and December 2013, two field investigations were carried out at 10 sites along the main streams of the basin. The monitoring indices contained both physicochemical variables and the structure and composition of phytoplankton communities. The correlations between communities and physicochemical variables were analyzed using cluster analysis and redundancy analysis. Moreover, water quality was evaluated using the comprehensive nutrition state index (TLI) and Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H). Results indicated that more phytoplankton species were present in December than in July, but total density was less in December. Phytoplankton communities in the midstream of the Shaying River were affected by the same physicochemical factors throughout the year, but ammonia nitrogen and total phosphorus had the greatest influence on these sites in July and December, respectively. The water pollution status of the sampling sites was much greater in the Shaying River midstream than at other sites. TLI was more suitable than H for assessing water quality in the study area. These results provide valuable information for policy makers and stakeholders in water quality assessment, water ecosystem restoration, and sustainable basin management in the HRB.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				NOV	2017	76	9					2554	2564		10.2166/wst.2017.418								WOS:000415638000030	29144313					
J	Zhang, ZC				Zhang, Zhenchao			The flocculation mechanism and treatment of oily wastewater by flocculation	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												In the present study, the performance of compound flocculants composed of different concentrations of polyaluminum chloride (PAC) and cationic polyacrylamide (CPAM), the influencing mechanism of the flocculation process and the effects of temperature, settling time, and speed and time of stirring were investigated. The results show that the poor water quality with high concentrations of oil, suspended solids (SS) and polymer greatly increases the oily wastewater emulsion stability and the difficulty of the flocculation treatment process. The compound flocculant in oily wastewater treatment can achieve best results at optimum conditions of temperature 45 degrees C, settling time 60 min, and two stirring stages, 250 r.min(-1) for 3 min followed by 100 r.min(-1) for 7 min. At the PAC dosage of 80 mg.L-1 and the CPAM dosage of 0.8 mg.L-1, the turbidity of oily wastewater is reduced from 153.8 NTU to 11.2 NTU, and the turbidity removal rate reaches 92.69%. Through further measurements, oil content and SS content are less than 10 mg.L-1, which meets the requirement of the Daqing oilfield re-injection standard.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				NOV	2017	76	10					2630	2637		10.2166/wst.2017.414								WOS:000415999900006	29168702

In this study, water columns were collected at 22 sites in the littoral zone of Lake Taihu in 2014 to investigate the distribution and concentration of nutrients and the stable isotope signatures of POM, and their potential interrelation. Generally, mean concentration of nitrogen forms (NH4+-N) showed substantial variation, probably because they had received large amounts of wastewater from various local industrial enterprises. Source analysis by stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios showed that the main POM sources were phytoplankton. Contrasting correlations were obtained between delta N-15 and N concentrations in effluent river mouths when compared with influent river mouths. In effluent river mouths, there was a significant positive correlation between delta N-15 and nitrogen concentration (total nitrogen and ammonia-nitrogen), in contrast with the negative correlation in influent river mouths. According to these results, more factors should be taken into consideration when stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes of POM are used to assess the feeding relationship between consumers and prey, as well as the energy flow pathways that support the lake pelagic food webs.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				NOV	2017	76	10					2690	2697		10.2166/wst.2017.439								WOS:000415999900013	29168709					
J	Elci, A				Elci, Alper			Evaluation of nutrient retention in vegetated filter strips using the SWAT model	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Nutrient fluxes in stream basins need to be controlled to achieve good water quality status. In stream basins with intensive agricultural activities, nutrients predominantly come from diffuse sources. Therefore, best management practices (BMPs) are increasingly implemented to reduce nutrient input to streams. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of vegetated filter strip (VFS) application as an agricultural BMP. For this purpose, SWAT is chosen, a semi-distributed water quality assessment model that works at the watershed scale, and applied on the Nif stream basin, a small-sized basin in Western Turkey. The model is calibrated with an automated procedure against measured monthly discharge data. Nutrient loads for each sub-basin are estimated considering basin-wide data on chemical fertilizer and manure usage, population data for septic tank effluents and information about the land cover. Nutrient loads for 19 sub-basins are predicted on an annual basis. Average total nitrogen and total phosphorus loads are estimated as 47.85 t/yr and 13.36 t/yr for the entire basin. Results show that VFS application in one sub-basin offers limited retention of nutrients and that a selection of 20-m filter width is most effective from a cost-benefit perspective.

Nutrient modeling for a semi-intensive IMC pond: an MS-Excel approach	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Semi-intensive Indian Major Carp (IMC) culture was practised in polythene lined dugout ponds at the Aquacultural Farm of Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, West Bengal for 3 consecutive years at three different stocking densities (S. D), viz., 20,000, 35,000 and 50,000 numbers of fingerlings per hectare of water spread area. Fingerlings of Catla, Rohu and Mrigal were raised at a stocking ratio of 4:3:3. Total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) value along with other fishpond water quality parameters was monitored at 1 day intervals to ensure a good water ecosystem for a better fish growth. Water exchange was carried out before the TAN reached the critical limit. Field data on TAN obtained from the cultured fishponds stocked with three different stocking densities were used to study the dynamics of TAN. A developed model used to study the nutrient dynamics in shrimp pond was used to validate the observed data in the IMC pond ecosystem. Two years of observed TAN data were used to calibrate the spreadsheet model and the same model was validated using the third year observed data. The manual calibration based on the trial and error process of parameters adjustments was used and several simulations were performed by changing the model parameters. After adjustment of each parameter, the simulated and measured values of the water quality parameters were compared to judge the improvement in the model prediction. Forward finite difference discretization method was used in a MS-Excel spreadsheet to calibrate and validate the model for obtaining the TAN levels during the culture period. Observed data from the cultured fishponds of three different S. D were used to standardize 13 model parameters. The efficiency of the developed spreadsheet model was found to be more than 90% for the TAN estimation in the IMC cultured fishponds.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				NOV	2017	76	10					2858	2866		10.2166/wst.2017.458								WOS:000415999900030	29168726

Assessing Target Strength, Abundance, and Biomass for Three Commercial Pelagic Fish Species along the East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia Using a Split-Beam Echo Sounder	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Decapterus maruadsi (round scad), Megalaspis cordyla (torpedo scad), and Selar boops (oxeye scad) are commercially important small pelagic fish species of Malaysia. Despite their commercial and ecological value, little is known about their target strength (TS), spatial and vertical distributions, and biomass estimates. A split-beam acoustic survey was performed in the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia (ECPM) in March-June 2009. The calibrated echo sounder allowed determination of TS, estimation of fish density (spatial distribution) and biomass, and produced density maps along depth gradients (vertical distribution). The TS-length relationships indicated that the logarithmic TS was proportional to the squared length. Additional water parameters that included salinity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen (DO) were collected to examine fish density changes in relation to water quality and depth. Results revealed that the small pelagic fish formed small schools that were scattered over a wide area of the ECMP; mean density varied between 1.1 and 1.9 t/km(2). The maximum fish density was in the spatial coverage between 102.875 degrees E, 6.000 degrees N and 103.125 degrees E, 6.500 degrees N. The mean total biomass was about 18,610 t. Optimum fish density was estimated around water depths between 40 and 60 m. Fish density mainly decreased with decreasing DO and with increasing depth. The demonstrated acoustic method can be used as a monitoring tool for national fish stock surveys.

Factors influencing streambed hydraulic conductivity and their implications on stream-aquifer interaction: a conceptual review	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												The estimation and modeling of streambed hydraulic conductivity (K) is an emerging interest due to its connection to water quality, aquatic habitat, and groundwater recharge. Existing research has found ways to sample and measure K at specific sites and with laboratory tests. The challenge undertaken was to review progress, relevance, complexity in understanding and modeling via statistical and geostatistical approaches, literature gaps, and suggestions toward future needs. This article provides an overview of factors and processes influencing streambed hydraulic conductivity (K) and its role in the stream-aquifer interaction. During our synthesis, we discuss the influence of geological, hydrological, biological, and anthropogenic factors that lead to variability of streambed substrates. Literature examples document findings to specific sites that help to portray the role of streambed K and other interrelated factors in the modeling of hyporheic and groundwater flow systems. However, studies utilizing an integrated, comprehensive database are limited, restricting the ability of broader application and understanding. Examples of in situ and laboratory methods of estimating hydraulic conductivity suggest challenges in acquiring representative samples and comparing results, considering the anisotropy and heterogeneity of fluvial bed materials and geohydrological conditions. Arriving at realistic statistical and spatial inference based on field and lab data collected is challenging, considering the possible sediment sources, processes, and complexity. Recognizing that the K for a given particle size group includes several to many orders of magnitude, modeling of streambed K and groundwater interaction remain conceptual and experimental. Advanced geostatistical techniques offer a wide range of univariate or multi-variate interpolation procedures such as kriging and variogram analysis that can be applied to these complex systems. Research available from various studies has been instrumental in developing sampling options, recognizing the significance of fluvial dynamics, the potential for filtration, transfer, and storage of high-quality groundwater, and importance to aquatic habitat and refuge during extreme conditions. Efforts in the characterization of natural and anthropogenic conditions, substrate materials, sediment loading, colmation, and other details highlight the great complexity and perhaps need for a database to compile relevant data. The effects on streambed hydraulic conductivity due to anthropogenic disturbances (in-stream gravel mining, contaminant release, benthic activity, etc.) are the areas that still need focus. An interdisciplinary (hydro-geo-biological) approach may be necessary to characterize the magnitude and variability of streambed K and fluxes at local, regional scales.

The effective classification and recycling of urban water resources that are available here are therefore significant for the sustainable utilization of water in winter cities, and snow is a potential water resource. In this research, the water quality of the snow and the pollutant composition in the vehicle roads of a typical residential community of Harbin are analyzed. It is concluded that there is a large amount of suspended substances, including chemical oxygen demand (COD), salt, ammonia, and oil in this snow. There are 27 main pollutants. The oily substances are dominated by hexadecane and are accompanied by toxic substances, including benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene (BTEX), and naphthalene. As snow is a carrier of pollutants, the underground space of the urban shallow green belt is proposed to be used to establish a snow-melting system that would integrate biological treatment devices. This method allows the year-round collection, storage, and utilization of rainwater for use in city planning and municipal technology, realizing multiple objectives and having a significant influence on further urban development.

The relative sensitivity of freshwater species to antimony(III): Implications for water quality guidelines and ecological risk assessments	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Antimony (Sb) is a pollutant in many jurisdictions, yet its threat to aquatic biota is unclear. Water quality guidelines (WQGs) for Sb are not well established and large uncertainty factors are commonly applied in derivation. We constructed freshwater species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) for Sb(III) using available acute toxicity data sourced from temperate and tropical regional studies. A tiered ecological risk assessment (ERA) approach using risk quotients (RQs) was applied for characterisation of risks presented by Sb(III) concentrations measured in the freshwater environment. Multiple parametric models were fitted for each SSD, with the optimal model used to derive the 5% hazardous concentration (HC5), defined as protective of 95% of species, and the corresponding predicted no effect concentration (PNEC). The HC5 values for whole and temperate SSDs were estimated at 781 and 976 mu g L-1 Sb(III), respectively, while the PNECs for both datasets were 156 and 195 mu g L-1 Sb(III), respectively. Due to limited tropical data, a temperate-to-tropic extrapolation factor of 10 was used to estimate an interim PNEC for tropical regions of 20 mu g L-1 Sb(III). Based on published freshwater Sb(III) concentration values across a range of locations, potential ecological risks posed by Sb(III) in some freshwater systems studied would be classified as medium to high risk, but the majority of locations sampled would fall into the low ecological risk category. Our results facilitate the understanding of toxic effects of Sb(III) to freshwater species but also demonstrate that data for Sb ERA are extremely limited.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				NOV	2017	24	32					25276	25290		10.1007/s11356-017-0168-y								WOS:000414958700044	28929352

The Water Framework Directive (WFD) specifies and sets forth the achievement of the good ecological status. However, the assessment of the water quality of the lake as a complex system requires a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation procedure. Measurements were carried out around the Lake Balaton at ten different locations/sites and 13 physical-chemical parameters were monitored at each measurement site. For the interpretation of the water chemistry parameters the Aquatic Environmental Assessment (AEA) method devised by authors was used for the water body of the Lake Balaton. The AEA method can be used for all types of the water bodies since it is flexible and using individual weighting procedure for the water chemistry parameters comprehensive information can be obtain. The AEA method was compared with existing EIA methods according to a predefined criterion system and proved to be the most suitable tool for evaluating the environmental impacts in our study. On the basis of the results it can be concluded that the status of the quality of studied area on the Lake Balaton can be categorized as proper quality (from the outcome of the ten measurement sites this conclusion was reached at seven sites).

Conservation aquaculture: Shifting the narrative and paradigm of aquaculture's role in resource management	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												In the 21st century, aquaculture is generally characterized as a foe to conservation efforts. Yet, much has changed in the two seemingly disparate practices over the last two decades, motivating an updated evaluation of the scientific evidence for how aquaculture currently impacts conservation, as well as prospects for further alignment and research. Here we present a new perspective on conservation aquaculture, which we redefine as "the use of human cultivation of an aquatic organism for the planned management and protection of a natural resource." Looking across scales of conservation aquaculture that include single species to ecosystem level benefits (and limitations), we highlight ways aquaculture has historically, and is currently being integrated into conservation (e.g., habitat restoration of oyster beds) and areas that could be improved for the protection of critical species and habitats (e.g., aquarium trade of coral reef species). With a more strategic focus, there appears to be notable conservation aquaculture potential via the cultivation of species for harvest that could provide wild harvest alleviation through replacement or supplement particularly for over-exploited species and/or ecosystem services, such as improved water quality and reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Given that aquaculture is the fastest growing food industry on the planet, aligning farming practices with conservation objectives is particularly pressing to ensure that growth happens in the service of conservation in the most effective and sustainable way possible. The sheer potential of conservation aquaculture suggests a tale of redemption for aquaculture and opportunity for conservationists to bring in a new age of collaborative practices to address global issues.																	0006-3207	1873-2917				NOV	2017	215						162	168		10.1016/j.biocon.2017.09.012								WOS:000414883000019

Appraisal of seasonal variation of groundwater quality near an uncontrolled municipal solid waste landfill in Kolkata, India	GLOBAL NEST JOURNAL												The present study was aimed to evaluate the impact of leachate derived from uncontrolled municipal landfill on surrounding groundwater quality in Kolkata, India. Seasonal variation of twenty physico-chemical parameters in pre-monsoon (PRM) and post-monsoon (POM) season were analysed in forty groundwater samples around the landfill site. Groundwater pollution was identified by the spatial distribution maps of TDS, Na+, Cl-, Mn and Fe along with the heavy metals like Pb, Hg and Cr in both the seasons. Hydrogeochemical characteristics of groundwater samples showed that the area was dominated by brackish water, [Ca+2-Cl-], [Mg+2-Cl-] and [Na+-Cl-] type in PRM season whereas [Na+-HCO3-] type dominated in POM season. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was also applied to identify the source of groundwater pollution. In PRM season, groundwater samples closer to the active landfill site were physico-chemically different from upstream samples but more related to downstream samples. However, in POM season, groundwater samples closer to the active landfill site represented distinctly different physico-chemical characteristics from upstream and downstream samples as a result of high influx of leachate pollutants. In specific, the present study urges for proper pollution control measures along with landfill leachate treatment process to improve the surrounding water quality.																	1790-7632					NOV	2017	19	3					367	376										WOS:000414537400002						
J	Kanat, G				Kanat, Gurdal			Risk Perception and Bottled Drinking Water Consumption in Istanbul City	GLOBAL NEST JOURNAL												Parallel to the increase in public concern about the safety of drinking water globally, the demand for bottled water has increased in almost every country. Although tap water is significantly cheaper than bottled water, consumers concerned about the safety of tap water. They still prefer the bottled water despite several checks implemented in tap water networks. The present paper aims to discuss network water quality in the city of Istanbul, Turkey and to present the findings on a related survey conducted by the authors. The survey was conducted with the participation of 980 individuals living in different districts in Istanbul and the findings were assessed to determine the public perception about tap water quality and bottled water consumption especially after the experienced years of drought and water quality concerns. Findings demonstrated that several individuals never drink tap water and certain individuals do not utilize tap water at all. It was found that only 4% in the surveyed group drink tap water without hesitation. Based on survey findings, the abovementioned group was mainly among the lowest income group in the sample. When purchasing bottled water, several individuals preferred the well-known brands. It was found that the most significant reasons for preferring bottled water were the nice taste of the bottled spring water, which was perceived not to exist in tap water. It was concluded that drinking water treatment facilities and regulations are required to cater the future quality demands. Furthermore, it was determined that adequate inspections and controls on network water are necessary.																	1790-7632					NOV	2017	19	3					521	532										WOS:000414537400018

It could affect water quality and marine ecosystems due to pollutants and trace elements transported through groundwater. Relations between different characteristics of aquifers and SGD have been investigated extensively before, but the role of fractures in SGD still remains unknown. In order to better understand the mechanism of groundwater flow and solute transport through fractures in SGD, one-dimensional analytical solutions of groundwater hydraulic head and velocity through a synthetic horizontal fracture with periodic boundary conditions were derived using a Laplace transform technique. Then, numerical solutions of solute transport associated with the given groundwater velocity were developed using a finite-difference method. The results indicated that SGD associated with groundwater flow and solute transport was mainly controlled by sea level periodic fluctuations, which altered the hydraulic head and the hydraulic head gradient in the fracture. As a result, the velocity of groundwater flow associated with SGD also fluctuated periodically. We found that the pollutant concentration associated with SGD oscillated around a constant value, and could not reach a steady state. This was particularly true at locations close to the seashore. This finding of the role of fracture in SGD will assist pollution remediation and marine conservation in coastal regions.

Transport and potential attenuation of nitrogen in shallow groundwaters in the lower Rangitikei catchment, New Zealand	JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY												Intensive agricultural activities are generally associated with nitrogen leaching from agricultural soils, and this nitrogen has the potential to percolate and contaminate groundwater and surface waters. We assessed surface water and groundwater interactions, and nitrogen leaching and its potential attenuation in shallow groundwater in the lower Rangitikei River catchment (832 km(2)), New Zealand. We combined regional- and local-scale field surveys and experiments, nutrient budget modelling, and hydraulic and geochemical methods, to gain an insight into leaching, transformation and transport of nitrogen via groundwaters to the river in the study area. Concurrent river flow gaugings (in January 2015) and a piezometric map, developed from measured depths to groundwater in 110 bores (in October 2014), suggest groundwater discharges to the Rangitikei River in the upper parts of the study area, while there is groundwater recharge near the coast. The groundwater redox characterisation, based on sampling and analysis of 15 mostly shallow bores (< 30 m below ground level (bgl)), suggests groundwater across the lower Rangitikei catchment in general is under anoxic/reduced conditions. The groundwater typically has low dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations (< 1 mg/L), suggesting the subsurface environment is conducive to potential attenuation by 'denitrification' of NO3-N in groundwater. We further measured NO3-N attenuation in shallow groundwater piezometers (3-6 m bgl) using single-well push-pull tests. We found generally low levels (< 0.5 mg/L) of NO3-N in shallow groundwater piezometers (> 5 m bgl), despite being installed under intensive land uses, such as dairying and cropping. Our in-field push-pull tests showed NO3-N reduction at four shallow groundwater piezometers, with the rates of reduction varying from 0.04 mg N L-1 h(-1) to 1.57 mg N h(-1). This highlights the importance of a sound understanding of not only the sources, but also transport and transformation, or fate, of nutrients leached from farms, to mitigate the likely impacts of land use on water quality and ecosystem health in agricultural catchments.																	0169-7722	1873-6009				NOV	2017	206						55	66		10.1016/j.jconhyd.2017.10.002								WOS:000414891200006	29033220

The effect of rivers, streams, and canals on property values	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Rivers, streams, and canals support a variety of critical agricultural, industrial, transportation, ecological, and household uses. They also provide important aesthetic, recreational, and sociocultural benefits. This review paper synthesizes the evidence to date regarding the value of these linear water features as aesthetic and recreational resources to adjacent and nearby residents. Specifically, it summarizes 25 studies that have used the hedonic pricing method to calculate the effects of views of and proximity to rivers, streams, and canals on surrounding residential property values. The majority of studies indicated that significant positive property price effects are associated with river, stream, and canal view and proximity, though these effects appear less definitive in rural than urban settings. Implications of the body of evidence for planning, management, and development are discussed, and potential effects of climate change and diversion policies are highlighted. Improvements in measurement facilitated by advanced geographic information systems and rigorous spatially explicit regression techniques are noted.

Cost-effective treatment of swine wastes through recovery of energy and nutrients	WASTE MANAGEMENT												Wastes from concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) are challenging to treat because they are high in organic matter and nutrients. Conventional swine waste treatment options in the U.S., such as uncovered anaerobic lagoons, result in poor effluent quality and greenhouse gas emissions, and implementation of advanced treatment introduces high costs. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to evaluate the performance and life cycle costs of an alternative system for treating swine CAFO waste, which recovers valuable energy (as biogas) and nutrients (N, P, K+) as saleable fertilizers. The system uses in-vessel anaerobic digestion (AD) for methane production and solids stabilization, followed by struvite precipitation and ion exchange (IX) onto natural zeolites (chabazite or clinoptilolite) for nutrient recovery. An alternative approach that integrated struvite recovery and IX into a single reactor, termed STRIEX, was also investigated. Pilot- and bench-scale reactor experiments were used to evaluate the performance of each stage in the treatment train. Data from these studies were integrated into a life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) to assess the cost-effectiveness of various process alternatives. Significant improvement in water quality, high methane production, and high nutrient recovery (generally over 90%) were observed with both the AD-struvite-IX process and the AD-STRIEX process. The LCCA showed that the STRIEX system can provide considerable financial savings compared to conventional systems. AD, however, incurs high capital costs compared to conventional anaerobic lagoons and may require larger scales to become financially attractive. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Mobile phosphorus stratification in sediments by aluminum immobilization	CHEMOSPHERE					2nd International Conference on Biological Waste as Resource (BWR) - Environmental Impact and Emerging Concerns of Biological Waste Treatment and Recycling Processes	MAY 25-28, 2017	Hong Kong Polytechn Univ, Hung Hom, PEOPLES R CHINA		Hong Kong Polytechn Univ			There is a great heterogeneity in the distribution of mobile phosphorus (P) in natural sediments, while the assessment of P immobilization by amendment agents has mostly neglected this feature. In this study, the effects of aluminum sulfate (ALS) on P immobilization were investigated via a 60-day microcosm experiment using sampled sediment cores. The high-resolution dialysis (HR-Peeper) and diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) techniques were first employed to establish the profiles of soluble reactive P (SRP) and DGT-labile P in aluminum-amended sediments at 2 and 1 mm resolutions, respectively. Both concentrations of two mobile P forms decreased with increasing ALS dosages. The static layers with extremely low P concentrations (<= 0.060 mg L-1 for SRP and <= 0.024 mg L-1 for DGT-labile P) were observed in the upper 6-16 mm sediment layers at 6-15 ALS/P-mobile treatments (mobile P is the sum of NH4Cl-P, BD-P, and NaOH-nrP; mol mol(-1)). The static layer was followed by an active layer in which the upward release potential (R-AL decreased from 33.4 to 21.9 for SRP and from 92.2 to 51.0 for DGT-labile P, respectively. As the formation of the static layer is a key to sustaining P immobilization in sediments, the minimal dosage of 9 ALS/P-mobile is required for ALS capping. Modeling with DGT Induced Fluxes in Sediments (DIFS) showed a greater increase in adsorption rate constant (k(1), maximum 7.2-fold) compared to adsorption rate constant (k(1), maximum 2.2-fold), demonstrating that the release of P from sediment solids became increasingly difficult after ALS amendment.

Interplay of water quality and vegetation in restored wetland plant assemblages from an agricultural landscape	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Water quality degradation from excessive fertilizer use and runoff is a worldwide problem. While this degradation impacts wetlands, these systems can also be a vehicle for water quality improvement. Restoration of wetlands in agricultural landscapes has recently increased, but little work has evaluated the relationship of plant assemblages and water quality parameters in restored, non-treatment wetlands. This study examines the impact of self-designed wetland plant assemblages on nitrogen and sediment dynamics. Thirty mesocosms were seeded with soil from restored wetlands and allowed to develop from the seed bank to emergent assemblages. During the 2015 growing season (seven to nine months after establishment), these assemblages were exposed to treatment loads of nitrogen and sediment, common stressors to wetlands in agricultural landscapes. Water samples were taken up to five days post-treatment in July and September to quantify interactions between the stressors and plant assemblages. Analyses showed plant assemblage identify was not structured by treatment, but by the site of soil origin. Treatment removal rates were influenced by total amount of the stressor present, with nitrogen removal rates being higher, in relative terms, in low nitrogen amended treatments. Additionally, plant quality, not quantity, was linked to nitrogen and sediment loss rates, and over time, elevated nitrogen and sediment loads were associated with decreased plant assemblage quality. This study demonstrates the ability of plants from restored wetlands to affect nutrient and sediment dynamics, with three significantly differing plant assemblages all exhibiting substantial nutrient and sediment reduction capacity. Nevertheless, we also found that in a relatively short time (seven to nine months) common stressors in agricultural settings can significantly impact wetland plant assemblage quality, and that this may be linked to a reduced capacity for nutrient and sediment removal.																	0925-8574	1872-6992				NOV	2017	108		A				255	262		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.08.034								WOS:000412127500030

Hydrologic and water quality performance of regenerative stormwater conveyance installed to stabilize an eroded outfall	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Conveying concentrated urban runoff to outfall locations frequently leads to stream bank erosion, channel incision, and the formation of headcuts. Installed in an incised eroded channel, regenerative stormwater conveyance (RSC) is a grade-control and treatment system that uses a series of pools and cascades with an underlying sand bed. As a recently developed practice, RSC performance evaluations are needed to improve the design and guide regulatory accreditation. An eroded channel with a 10% longitudinal slope was stabilized with a five-cell system and monitored for a 14-month period. A small capture volume (6-mm design event) and groundwater intrusion resulted in minimal hydrologic benefit. Hydrologic mitigation was attained only for storms less than 12.7 mm. The RSC converted a substantial 50% of inflow to media flow at the second cell; however, the media flow entirely reemerged as surface flow in the saturated downstream pools. Small but statistically significant reductions in event mean concentrations occurred: 17% total suspended sediment (TSS), 17% total phosphorus (TP), and 3% total nitrogen (TN). Water quality improvements occurred primarily between the upstream and second cell, indicating limited processing by the wetter downstream pools. Comparisons between inter-event outflow grab samples and storm event outflow concentrations show nitrogen export during inter-event periods (47% increase in TN concentration). Due to elevated inter-event concentrations, overall mass loading of nitrogen increased. Hydrologic and water quality benefits were garnered only in the first three cells where groundwater intrusion was minimal. Future implementations of RSC are encouraged to account for seasonal high water table elevations that interact with the RSC media and adequately size pool and sand layer capture volumes.

J	McMillan, SK; Noe, GB				McMillan, Sara K.; Noe, Gregory B.			Increasing floodplain connectivity through urban stream restoration increases nutrient and sediment retention	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Stream restoration practices frequently aim to increase connectivity between the stream channel and its floodplain to improve channel stability and enhance water quality through sediment trapping and nutrient retention. To measure the effectiveness of restoration and to understand the drivers of these functional responses, we monitored five restored urban streams that represent a range of channel morphology and restoration ages. High and low elevation floodplain plots were established in triplicate in each stream to capture variation in floodplain connectivity. We measured ecosystem geomorphic and soil attributes, sediment and nutrient loading, and rates of soil nutrient biogeochemistry processes (denitrification; N and P mineralization) then used boosted regression trees (BRT) to identify controls on sedimentation and nutrient processing. Local channel and floodplain morphology and position within the river network controlled connectivity with increased sedimentation at sites downstream of impaired reaches and at floodplain plots near the stream channel and at low elevations. We observed that nitrogen loading (both dissolved and particulate) was positively correlated with denitrification and N mineralization and dissolved phosphate loading positively influenced P mineralization; however, none of these input rates or transformations differed between floodplain elevation categories. Instead, continuous gradients of connectivity were observed rather than categorical shifts between inset and high floodplains. Organic matter and nutrient content in floodplain soils increased with the time since restoration, which highlights the importance of recovery time after construction that is needed for restored systems to increase ecosystem functions. Our results highlight the importance of restoring floodplains downstream of sources of impairment and building them at lower elevations so they flood frequently, not just during bankfull events. This integrated approach has the greatest potential for increasing trapping of sediment, nutrients, and associated pollutants in restored streams and thereby improving water quality in urban watersheds.																	0925-8574	1872-6992				NOV	2017	108		A				284	295		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.08.006								WOS:000412127500033						
J	Julian, P				Julian, Paul, II			Commentary on "Mitsch et al., 2015, Protecting the Florida Everglades wetlands with wetlands: Can stormwater phosphorus be reduced to oligotrophic conditions?"	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Constructed wetlands have been utilized with varying levels of success in an effort to reduce nutrient concentrations entering waterways. In south Florida, stormwater treatment areas (STAs) have been utilizedto remove excessive phosphorus (P) from surface waters for more than two decades with remarkableresults. Even though the STAs have been operational for more than two decade, further improvementof P removal performance is necessary to achieve the desired outflow concentrations. This commentary critically reviews a recently published manuscript concerning the ability of alternative vegetativecommunities' ability to improve STA treatment efficiency. The commentary provides clarification of Everglades STA effluent limit and the total P water quality criterion established for the Everglades ProtectionArea. The commentary also addresses fundamental issues with the authors' experimental design andinterpretability in light of the studies treatment fidelity, controls and scalability. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

To ensure the safety of water consumption of cities in Jingjinji area, we investigated the abundance of three classes of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in water and sediment of six water supply reservoirs in this area. The results showed that the detection frequency of sul1, tetM and ermB were 100%. However, the content ranges of these genes were different (10(-5) to 10(-2)/16S gene copies for sul1, 10(-5) to 10(-3)/16S gene copies for ermB, and 10(-5) to 10(-3)/16S gene copies for tetM). The content of ribosome protection proteins (RPP) genes were the highest in all selected tet genes. The highest abundance of ARGs in water and sediment samples was sampled from Panjiakou reservoir and Guanting reservoir, respectively. Except COD, chla and tetM, there are no significant correlation between water quality parameters and ARGs. Overall, this study provides integrated profiles of the three types of ARGs in water supply reservoirs of Jingjinji area and thus helps to re-evaluate the effects of human activities to water supply reservoirs.

Inhibition in fertilisation of coral gametes following exposure to nickel and copper	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												The mining and production of nickel in tropical regions have the potential to impact on ecologically valuable tropical marine ecosystems. Currently, few data exist to assess the risks of nickel exposure to tropical ecosystems and to derive ecologically relevant water quality guidelines. In particular, data are lacking for keystone species such as scleractinian corals, which create the complex structural reef habitats that support many other marine species. As part of a larger study developing risk assessment tools for nickel in the tropical Asia-Pacific region, we investigated the toxicity of nickel on fertilisation success in three species of scleractinian corals: Acropora aspera, Acropora digitifera and Platygyra daedalea. In the literature, more data are available on the effects of copper on coral fertilisation, so to allow for comparisons with past studies, the toxicity of copper to A. aspera and P. daedalea was also determined. Overall, copper was more toxic than nickel to the fertilisation success of the species tested. Acropora aspera was the most sensitive species to nickel (NOEC < 280 mu g Ni/L), followed by A. digitifera with an EC10 of 2000 mu g Ni/L and P. daedalea (EC10 > 4610 mu g Ni/L). Acropora aspera was also the more sensitive species to copper with an EC10 of 5.8 mu g Cu/L. The EC10 for P. daedalea was 16 mu g Cu/L, similar to previous studies. This is the first time that the toxicity of nickel on fertilisation success in Acropora species has been reported, and thus provides valuable data that can contribute to the development of reliable water quality guidelines for nickel in tropical marine waters.

Contribution of waste water treatment plants to pesticide toxicity in agriculture catchments	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												Pesticide residues are frequently found in water bodies and may threaten freshwater ecosystems and biodiversity. In addition to runoff or leaching from treated agricultural fields, pesticides may enter streams via effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). We compared the pesticide toxicity in terms of log maximum Toxic Unit (log mTU) of sampling sites in small agricultural streams of Germany with and without WWTPs in the upstream catchments. We found an approximately half log unit higher pesticide toxicity for sampling sites with WWTPs (p < 0.001). Compared to fungicides and insecticides, herbicides contributed most to the total pesticide toxicity in streams with WWTPs. A few compounds (diuron, terbuthylazin, isoproturon, terbutryn and Metazachlor) dominated the herbicide toxicity. Pesticide toxicity was not correlated with upstream distance to WWTP (Speannan's rank correlation, rho = -0.11, p > 0.05) suggesting that other context variables are more important to explain WWTP-driven pesticide toxicity. Our results suggest that WWTPs contribute to pesticide toxicity in German streams.

J	Zhao, JS; Zhang, R				Zhao, Jinsong; Zhang, Run			Species sensitivity distribution for pentachlorophenol to aquatic organisms based on interval ecotoxicological data	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												Species sensitivity distribution (SSD) model is often used to extrapolate the chemicals' effects from the ecotoxicological data on individual species to ecosystems, and is widely applied to derive water quality criteria or to assess ecological risk. Because of the influence of various factors, the ecotoxicological data of a specific chemicals to an individual usually exist in a range. The feasibility of interval ecotoxicological data directly applied to build SSD model has not been clearly stated. In the present study, by means of Bayesian statistics, the half maximal effective concentration (EC50) of pentachlorophenol (PCP) to 161 aquatic organisms, which were organized into 7 groups, i.e., single determined value, geometric mean estimation, median estimation, interval data, and combination of single determined data with other groups, were used to develop SSD models and to estimate the minimum sample sizes. The results showed that the interval data could be directly applied to build SSD model, and when combined with single point data could give the narrowest credible interval that indicates a stable and robust SSD model. Meanwhile, the results also implied that at least 6-14 ecotoxicological data were required to build a stable SSD model. It suggests that the utilization of interval data in building SSD model can effectively enhance the availability of ecotoxicological data, reduce the uncertainty brought by sample size or point estimation, and provide a reliable way to widen the application of SSD model.																	0147-6513	1090-2414				NOV	2017	145						193	199		10.1016/j.ecoenv.2017.07.029								WOS:000411917100024	28734222

However, it has ecological risk, as suggested by comparison of habitat and white and red blood cell count in two wild fish species (Barbus meridionalis and Squalius laietanus) before and after an input of recycled water in Ripoll River (NE Spain) in 2009. Due to the lack of normal ranges for blood variables in wild fish, we surveyed seasonally the same river reaches in 2013 to test if blood alterations from 2009 compromised the viability of the fish populations. By examining other indicators of river health in baseline and polluted sites (fish abundance, mass-length relationships, and community indices in fish, diatoms and invertebrates), we tested for the superior utility of blood tests in biomonitoring. The comparison of water quality and scores of diatoms and invertebrate indices between polluted and reference sites showed that polluted sites improved from 2009 to 2013. The abundance of B. meridionalis also increased in polluted sites, but that of S. laietanus declined in 2013 compared to 2009. These results contrast with results of blood analyses in 2009, which suggested that B. meridionalis was more seriously affected by pollution than S. laietanus. The fish index did not reveal the risk of recycled water to fish health, whereas fish mass-length relationships suggested that S. laietanus individuals in 2013 had a better body condition in polluted than in reference sites. Given that the two fish species had opposite results in reference sites, and that the physical habitat was more suitable for B. meridionalis in polluted sites in 2013 than was for S. laietanus, trends in population size are not only explained by pollution. The role of phenology is suggested by peaks in blood disorders during the breeding season. However, more long-term studies combining indicators of river health at the individual and community scales are needed to fully assess the ecological risk of recycled water in this river. These studies will also help to develop blood tests as reliable health indicators in wild fish populations.

J	Kumari, J; Paul, B				Kumari, Juli; Paul, Biswajit			Geochemical and environmental risk assessment of hazardous elements in river sediment	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The peninsular river Damodar is the life line of eastern India, facing critical pollution problems due to sewage, industrial waste disposal as well as coal mining along the river valley. Sediment samples were collected and analyzed for various geochemical phases of hazardous elements, and associated environmental risks were evaluated. This paper provides chemical fractionation of nine (Cd, Mn, Zn, Ni, Cu, Pb, Co, Cr, Fe) elements from river sediment by using Tessier five step sequential extraction method. The study was aimed (1) to understand dynamics and mobility of elements in different geochemical fractions; (2) to evaluate bioavailability and ecological risk of these elements by RAC; and (3) to identify contaminated and uncontaminated sites by using cluster analysis. The result of the study revealed maximum bioavailable fraction was that of Cd. Bioavailable elements in studied sediment followed the order Cd (23.76%) > Mn (14.19%) > Zn (13.54%) > Ni (12.82%) > Cu (7.12%) > Pb (7.05%) > Co (6.09%) > Fe (4.98%) > Cr (2.03%). Maximum % of the reducible fraction was found for Fe (14.38%) while in organic fraction Cu (11.25%) was maximum. Residual fraction dominates in all elements with a maximum percentage of 83.85% for Co. Risk assessment by RAC reveals that the river was under medium risk due to Cd, Mn, Zn and Ni while at low risk for rest of the elements. Cluster analysis shows that three sampling sites were highly contaminated, three were moderately contaminated and six were contaminated while only one site was uncontaminated.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				NOV	2017	76	21							731	10.1007/s12665-017-7073-z								WOS:000414335900010						
J	Sener, S; Karakus, M				Sener, Sehnaz; Karakus, Murat			Investigating water quality and arsenic contamination in drinking water resources in the Tavsanli District (Kutahya, Western Turkey)	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Arsenic is a natural component of the earth's crust, and it is transported into surface water and groundwater through the dissolution of rocks, minerals and ores. In addition, arsenic leaching processes contaminate water sources and this geogenic arsenic contamination causes significant water quality problems in many parts of the world. In this study, water quality, arsenic contamination and human health risks of drinking water resources in the Tavsanli District were determined and the origins were discussed. For this purpose, geological and hydrogeological properties were investigated. In situ measurements and chemical analyses were carried out on water samples taken from drinking water sources such as wells, springs and surface waters for hydrogeochemical studies. According to the obtained results, water resources are Ca-Mg-HCO3, Mg-HCO3 and Na-HCO3 type. Total As (AsT) concentration of the water samples sometimes exceeds the permissible limit given by the TSI-266 (Standards for drinking waters, Turkish Standards Institution, Ankara, 2005) and WHO (Guidelines for drinking-water quality, World Health Organization, Geneva, 2008) for drinking water. H3AsO30 and HAsO42- are dominant arsenic species in groundwater and surface water, respectively. Typically high total arsenic concentrations can be found in regions characterized by magmatic rocks. In addition, As concentrations in surface waters were found to be higher than in groundwater in the region, due to the anthropogenic influence of mining activities in the region.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				NOV	2017	76	21							750	10.1007/s12665-017-7101-z								WOS:000414335900028						
J	Nygren, NA; Tapio, P; Horppila, J				Nygren, Nina A.; Tapio, Petri; Horppila, Jukka			Will the Oxygen-Phosphorus Paradigm Persist? - Expert Views of the Future of Management and Restoration of Eutrophic Lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												In the age of climate change, the demand and lack of pure water challenges many communities. Substantial amount of effort is put in every year to manage and restore degraded lakes while the long-term effects of those efforts are only poorly known or monitored. Oxygenation, or aeration, is used extensively for the restoration of eutrophic lakes, although many studies question whether this process improves the status of the lakes in the long-term. The desired effect of oxygenation is based on paradigmatic theories that, in the light of recent literature, might not be adequate when long-term improvements are sought. This article canvasses expert views on the feasibility of the 'oxygen-phosphorus paradigm' as well as the future of the management and restoration of eutrophic lakes, based on an international, two-rounded, expert panel survey (Delphi study), employing 200 freshwater experts from 33 nationalities, contacted at three conferences on the topic. The conclusion is that the oxygen-phosphorus paradigm seems to be rather persistent. The experts considered oxygenation to be a valid short-term lake restoration method, but not without harmful side-effects. In addition, experts' low level of trust in the adequacy of the scientific knowledge on the effects of restorations and in the use of the scientific knowledge as a basis of choice of restoration methods, could be signs of a paradigm shift towards an outlook emphasizing more effective catchment management over short-term restorations. The expert panel also anticipated that reducing external nutrient loads from both point and diffuse sources will succeed in the future.																	0364-152X	1432-1009				NOV	2017	60	5					947	960		10.1007/s00267-017-0919-z								WOS:000412755900011	28799010

Midwestern US Farmers Perceive Crop Advisers as Conduits of Information on Agricultural Conservation Practices	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Nonpoint source pollution from agricultural land uses continues to pose one of the most significant threats to water quality in the US, with measurable impacts across local, regional, and national scales. The impact and the influence of targeted conservation efforts are directly related to the degree to which farmers are familiar with and trust the entities providing the information and/or outreach. Recent research suggests that farmers consistently rank independent and retail-affiliated crop advisers as among the most trusted and influential sources for agronomic information, but little is understood about whether farmers are willing to receive advice from crop advisers on the use of practices that conserve soil and water, and, if so, whether crop advisers will be perceived as influential. We present survey data from farmers (n = 1461) in Michigan's Saginaw Bay (Lake Huron) watershed to explore these questions. Results suggest that farmers view crop advisers as trustworthy sources of information about conservation, and influential on management practices that have large conservation implications. We discuss these results, along with perceived barriers and opportunities to crop advisers partnering with traditional conservation agencies to enhance the impact of voluntary conservation programs.																	0364-152X	1432-1009				NOV	2017	60	5					974	988		10.1007/s00267-017-0927-z								WOS:000412755900013	28856397

The framework includes data quality assurance and quality control processes, automated kriging interpolation along undulating paths, and local hotspot and cluster analyses. These methods are implemented in an interactive Web application developed using the Shiny package in the R programming environment to support near-real time analysis along with 2-and 3-D visualizations. The approach is demonstrated using historical sampling data from an undulating vehicle deployed at three rivermouth sites in Lake Michigan during 2011. The normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE) of the interpolation averages approximately 10% in 3-fold cross validation. The results show that the framework can be used to track river plume dynamics and provide insights on mixing, which could be related to wind and seiche events. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

A management-oriented water quality model for data scarce catchments	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												Due to the degeneration of water quality globally, water quality models could increasingly be utilised within water resource management. However, a lack of observed data as well as financial resources often constrain the number of potential water quality models that could practically be utilised. This study presents the Water Quality Systems Assessment Model (WQSAM). WQSAM directly utilises flow data generated by systems models to drive water quality simulations. The model subscribes to requisite simplicity by constraining the number of variables simulated as well as the processes represented to only those most important to water quality management, in this case, nutrients and salinity. The model application to the upper Olifants River catchment in South Africa is described. WQSAM was able to use the limited observed data to simulate representative frequency distributions of water quality, and the approach used within WQSAM was shown to be suitable for application to data scarce catchments.

These models have guided agricultural management by simulating effects of landscape structure, farming system changes and their spatial arrangement on stream water quality. Such models generate many intermediate results that should be managed, analyzed and transformed into usable information. We describe a data warehouse (N-Catch) built to store and analyze simulation data from the spatially distributed agro-hydrological model TNT2. We present scientific challenges to and tools for building data warehouses and describe the three dimensions of N-Catch: space, time and an original hierarchical description of cropping systems. We show how to use OLAP to explore and extract all kinds of useful high-level information by aggregating the data along these three dimensions and how to facilitate exploration of the spatial dimension by coupling N-Catch with GIS. Such tool constitutes an efficient interface between science and society, simulation remaining a research activity, exploration of the results becoming an easy task accessible for a large audience.

J	Choudhury, D; Gupta, S				Choudhury, Dharitri; Gupta, Susmita			Impact of waste dump on surface water quality and aquatic insect diversity of Deepor Beel (Ramsar site), Assam, North-east India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Water and aquatic insects were collected seasonally from site 1, the low-lying area of the dump near Deepor Beel, and from sites 2 and 3 of the main wetland and analysed. While dissolved oxygen (DO) increased from site 1 to site 3 in each season, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solid (TDS), total alkalinity (TA) and free CO2 (F-CO2) decreased. Pb and Cd were found to exceed the limits set for drinking water in all the sites and seasons. Species richness (SpR) was found highest (23) at site 2 and lowest (14) at site 1. Sensitive species was absent. The Shannon (H') values at site 1 were < 1 while at sites 2 and 3 were > 1 in most of the seasons. Biological monitoring scores (Biological Monitoring Working Party and Stream Invertebrate Grade Number-Average Level) in different sites and seasons inferred severely poor to moderate water quality. At site 1, significant negative correlations were seen for Pb and Cr with SpR while Ni and Cu with insect density (ID). At site 2, TA had highly significant positive correlations with SpR and ID while Cu showed negative correlation with SpR. At site 3, ID had significant negative relationships with air temperature, water temperature, depth, TA, F-CO2, PO43- and Cr. Canonical correspondence analysis triplot has clearly separated site 1 associated with tolerant species and highly influenced by TA, TDS, EC, F-CO2, Cr, Ni, Cd and Zn confirming high anthropogenic activities on that site. Tolerant and semitolerant species were present at site 2 (influenced by depth and transparency) and site 3 (influenced by Pb and WT) both. Results of this study discerned that the dump site is the point source of pollution.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				NOV	2017	189	11							540	10.1007/s10661-017-6233-7								WOS:000413605000010	28986729					
J	da Costa, EP; Pinto, CC; Soares, ALC; Melo, LDV; Oliveira, SMAC				da Costa, Elizangela Pinheiro; Pinto, Carolina Cristiane; Cunha Soares, Ana Luiza; Ventura Melo, Livia Duarte; Alves Correa Oliveira, Silvia Maria			Evaluation of violations in water quality standards in the monitoring network of Sao Francisco River basin, the third largest in Brazil	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The Sao Francisco River is the largest river located entirely within Brazil, and water scarcity problems have been a major concern of Brazilian society and government. Water quality issues are also a concern and have worsened with the recent intensification of urbanization and industrialization. In this study, violations to water quality standards established by local legislation were calculated as a percentage for 26 selected parameters over a monitoring period of 14 years. The violation percentages were analyzed spatially using the Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by multiple comparison analysis. Temporal analysis was performed using the Mann-Kendall test and Spearman correlation. Some parameters could be identified as cause for concern due to high violation levels, such as the fecal coliform indicator (FCI) and phosphorus-both related to domestic and effluent disposal without treatment or with insufficient treatment-and color, turbidity, manganese, and total suspended solids-which can be affected by erosive processes of natural and anthropogenic causes. The study found that these violations are concentrated in the most urbanized and industrialized areas of the basin. Some metallic parameters, such as iron and arsenic violations, may be related to mining activities in the rich soil of the Iron Quadrangle area located within the Minas Gerais State. Trend analysis results indicated that most monitoring stations did not have significant modification (elevation or reduction) trends over time, which, together with the high violation percentages, might indicate the maintenance of a scenario of constant pressure upon water resources, in particular in those more urbanized areas.

J	Guilherme, S; Rodriguez, MJ				Guilherme, Stephanie; Rodriguez, Manuel J.			Models for estimation of the presence of non-regulated disinfection by-products in small drinking water systems	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Among all the organic disinfection by-products (DBPs), only trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs) are regulated in drinking water, while most DBPs are not. Very little information exists on the occurrence of non-regulated DBPs, particularly in small water systems (SWS). Paradoxically, SWS are more vulnerable to DBPs because of a low capacity to implement adequate treatment technologies to remove DBP precursors. Since DBP analyses are expensive, usually SWS have difficulties to implement a rigorous characterization of these contaminants. The purpose of this study was to estimate non-regulated DBP levels in SWS from easy measurements of relevant parameters regularly monitored. Since no information on non-regulated DBPs in SWS was available, a sampling program was carried out in 25 SWS in two provinces of Canada. Five DBP families were investigated: THMs, HAAs, haloacetonitriles (HANs), halonitromethanes (HNMs), and haloketones (HKs). Multivariate linear mixed regression models were developed to estimate HAN, HK, and HNM levels from water quality characteristics in the water treatment plant, concentrations of regulated DBPs, and residual disinfectant levels. The models obtained have a good explanatory capacity since R-2 varies from 0.77 to 0.91 according to compounds and conditions for application (season and type of treatment). Model validation with an independent database suggested their ability for generalization in similar SWS in North America.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				NOV	2017	189	11							577	10.1007/s10661-017-6296-5								WOS:000413605000047	29063230					
J	Haider, H				Haider, Husnain			Performance assessment framework for groundwater treatment plants in Arid Environments: a case of Buraydah, Saudi Arabia	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												In arid environmental regions, such as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), each and every drop of groundwater needs to be efficiently utilized to meet growing water demands. Ground water treatment plants (WTPs) are regularly being monitored by the municipalities to ensure safe water supply. However, analyzing large data to assess the performance of a WTP has always been a daunting task for plant's management. Most of existing performance assessment frameworks were developed for surface WTPs. In this research, an assessment framework using performance-based water quality indices (PWQI) is developed to facilitate senior management of ground WTPs for effective decisionmaking. The framework is also implemented on a case study of Buraydah, Qassim, Saudi Arabia. Five most important water quality parameters (WQPs) have been selected to assess the performance of different components of the WTP, including raw water, pre-treatment, ultrafiltration, sand filtration, reverse osmosis, and final product. Depending on the relative importance ofWQPs for a specific treatment process, different weighting schemes have been developed for each treatment process using fuzzy analytical hierarchical process (FAHP) to address the possible uncertainties in data and imprecision in expert opinion. Subsequently, fuzzy weighted sum method (FWSM) is employed to develop aggregated PWQI for assessing average monthly performance during the year 2016. Study results show that all the units consistently performed Bhigh,<^> and the plant is meeting drinking water quality standards throughout the year. Hypothetical scenario analysis revealed robustness of the developed framework by showing lacking performance in case failure of different units.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				NOV	2017	189	11							544	10.1007/s10661-017-6271-1								WOS:000413605000014	28988396

Multi-criteria evaluation of hydro-geological and anthropogenic parameters for the groundwater vulnerability assessment	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Groundwater contamination assessment is a challenging task due to inherent complex dynamisms associated with the groundwater. DRASTIC is a very widely used rapid regional tool for the assessment of vulnerability of groundwater to contamination. DRASTIC has many lacunas in the form of subjectivities associated with weights and ratings of its hydrogeological parameters, and, therefore, the accuracy of the DRASTIC-based vulnerability map is questioned. The present study demonstrates the optimisation of the DRASTIC parameters along with a scientific consideration to the anthropogenic factors causing groundwater contamination. The resulting scientific consistent weights and ratings to DRASTIC parameters assist in the development of a very precise groundwater vulnerability map highlighting different zones of different gravity of contamination. One of the most important aspects of this study is that we have considered the impact of vadose zone in a very comprehensive manner by considering every sub-surface layer from the earth surface to the occurrence of groundwater. The study area for our experiment is Fatehgarh Sahib district of Punjab which is facing several groundwater issues.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				NOV	2017	189	11							564	10.1007/s10661-017-6267-x								WOS:000413605000034	29035418					
J	Kusnierz, PC; Holbrook, CM				Kusnierz, Paul C.; Holbrook, Christopher M.			Relative performance of three stream bed stability indices as indicators of stream health	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Bed stability is an important stream habitat attribute because it affects geomorphology and biotic communities. Natural resource managers desire indices of bed stability that can be used under a wide range of geomorphic conditions, are biologically meaningful, and are easily incorporated into sampling protocols. To eliminate potential bias due to presence of instream wood and increase precision of stability values, we modified a stream bed instability index (ISI) to include measurements of bankfull depth (dbf) and median particle diameter (D-50) only in riffles and increased the pebble count to decrease variability (i.e., increase precision) in D-50. The new riffle-based instability index (RISI) was compared to two established indices: ISI and the riffle stability index (RSI). RISI and ISI were strongly associated with each other but neither was closely associated with RSI. RISI and ISI were closely associated with both a diatom-and two macrovertebrate-based stream health indices, but RSI was only weakly associated with the macroinvertebrate indices. Unexpectedly, precision of D50 did not differ between RISI and ISI. Results suggest that RISI is a viable alternative to both ISI and RSI for evaluating bed stability in multiple stream types. With few data requirements and a simple protocol, RISI may also better conform to riffle-based sampling methods used by some water quality practitioners.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				NOV	2017	189	11							563	10.1007/s10661-017-6291-x								WOS:000413605000033	29035417

High-frequency measurements reveal spatial and temporal patterns of dissolved organic matter in an urban water conveyance	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Stormwater runoff in urban areas can contribute high concentrations of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to receiving waters, potentially causing impairment to the aquatic ecosystem of urban streams and downstream water bodies. Compositional changes in DOM due to storm events in forested, agricultural, and urban landscapes have been well studied, but in situ sensors have not been widely applied to monitor stormwater contributions in urbanized areas, leaving the spatial and temporal characteristics of DOM within these systems poorly understood. We deployed fluorescent DOM (FDOM) sensors at upstream and downstream locations within a study reach to characterize the spatial and temporal changes in DOM quantity and sources within an urban water conveyance that receives stormwater runoff. Baseflow FDOM decreased over the summer season as seasonal flows upstream transported less DOM. FDOM fluctuated diurnally, the amplitude of which also declined as the summer season progressed. During storms, FDOM concentrations were rapidly elevated to values orders of magnitude greater than baseflow measurements, with greater concentrations at the downstream monitoring site, revealing high contributions from stormwater outfalls between the two locations. Observations from custom, in situ fluorometers resembled results obtained using laboratory methods for identifying DOM source material and indicated that DOM transitioned to a more microbially derived composition as the summer season progressed, while stormwater contributions contributed DOM from terrestrial sources. Deployment of a mobile sensing platform during varying flow conditions captured spatial changes in DOM concentration and composition and revealed contributions of DOM from outfalls during stormflows that would have otherwise been unobserved.

J	Qian, DW; Yan, CZ; Xing, ZP; Xiu, LN				Qian, Dawen; Yan, Changzhen; Xing, Zanpin; Xiu, Lina			Monitoring coal mine changes and their impact on landscape patterns in an alpine region: a case study of the Muli coal mine in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The Muli coal mine is the largest open-cast coal mine in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and it consists of two independent mining sites named Juhugeng and Jiangcang. It has received much attention due to the ecological problems caused by rapid expansion in recent years. The objective of this paper was to monitor the mining area and its surrounding land cover over the period 1976-2016 utilizing Landsat images, and the network structure of land cover changes was determined to visualize the relationships and pattern of the mining-induced land cover changes. In addition, the responses of the surrounding landscape pattern were analysed by constructing gradient transects. The results show that the mining area was increasing in size, especially after 2000 increased by 71.68 km(2)), and this caused shrinkage of the surrounding lands, including alpine meadow wet-land (53.44 km(2)), alpine meadow (6.28 km(2)) and water (6.24 km(2)). The network structure of the mining area revealed the changes in lands surrounding the mining area. The impact of mining development on landscape patterns was mainly distributed within a range of 16 km. Alpine meadow wetland was most affected in Juhugeng, while alpine meadow was most affected in Jiangcang. The results of this study provide a reference for the ecological assessment and restoration of the Muli coal mine land.

J	Shi, RG; Xu, MM; Liu, AF; Tian, Y; Zhao, ZS				Shi, Rongguang; Xu, Mengmeng; Liu, Aifeng; Tian, Yong; Zhao, Zongshan			Characteristics of PAHs in farmland soil and rainfall runoff in Tianjin, China	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Rainfall runoff can remove certain amounts of pollutants from contaminated farmland soil and result in a decline in water quality. However, the leaching behaviors of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with rainfall have been rarely reported due to wide variations in the soil compositions, rainfall conditions, and sources of soil PAHs in complex farmland ecosystems. In this paper, the levels, spatial distributions, and composition profiles of PAHs in 30 farmland soil samples and 49 rainfall-runoff samples from the Tianjin region in 2012 were studied to investigate their leaching behaviors caused by rainfall runoff. The contents of the Sigma(16)PAHs ranged from 58.53 to 3137.90 mu g/kg in the soil and 146.58 to 3636.59 mu g/L in the runoff. In total, most of the soil sampling sites (23 of 30) were contaminated, and biomass and petroleum combustion were proposed as the main sources of the soil PAHs. Both the spatial distributions of the soil and the runoff PAHs show a decreasing trend moving away from the downtown, which suggested that the leaching behaviors of PAHs in a larger region during rainfall may be mainly affected by the compounds themselves. In addition, 4- and 5-ring PAHs are the dominant components in farmland soil and 3- and 4-ring PAHs dominate the runoff. Comparisons of the PAH pairs and enrichment ratios showed that acenaphthylene, acenaphthene, benzo[a]anthracene, chrysene, and fluoranthene were more easily transferred into water systems from soil than benzo[b]fluoranthene, benzo[k]fluoranthene, benzo[ghi]perylene, and indeno[123-cd]pyrene, which indicated that PAHs with low molecular weight are preferentially dissolved due to their higher solubility compared to those with high molecular weight.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				NOV	2017	189	11							558	10.1007/s10661-017-6290-y								WOS:000413605000028	29032441					
J	Sisay, T; Beyene, A; Alemayehu, E				Sisay, Tadesse; Beyene, Abebe; Alemayehu, Esayas			Spatiotemporal variability of drinking water quality and the associated health risks in southwestern towns of Ethiopia	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The failure to provide safe drinking water services to all people is the greatest development setback of the twenty-first century including Ethiopia. Potential pollutants from various sources are deteriorating drinking water quality in different seasons, and associated health risks were not clearly known. We determined seasonal and spatial variations of urban drinking water characteristics and associated health risks in Agaro, Jimma, and Metu towns, Southwest Ethiopia. Seventy-two samples were collected during dry and rainy seasons of 2014 and 2015. The majority (87.4%) of physicochemical parameters was found within the recommended limits. However, free residual chlorine in Jimma and Agaro town water sources was lower than the recommended limit and negatively correlated with total and fecal coliform counts (r = -0.585 and -0.638). Statistically significant differences were observed at pH, turbidity, and total coliform between dry and rainy seasons (p < 0.05). A Kruskal-Wallis H test revealed a statistically significant difference in electrical conductivity, total hardness, fluoride, iron, and fecal coliform across the study towns (p < 0.05). The Agaro town water source was the highest in fluoride concentration (3.15 mg/l). The daily exposure level for high fluoride concentration in Agaro town was estimated between 0.19 and 0.41 mg/kg day, and the average cumulative hazard index of fluoride was > 3.13 for all age groups. Water quality variations were observed in all conventional water treatment systems in the rainy season, and further research should focus on its optimization to safeguard the public.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				NOV	2017	189	11							569	10.1007/s10661-017-6277-8								WOS:000413605000039	29043452

In this study, the profiling of ARGs was investigated using high-throughput qPCR from water samples of 13 catchment areas in East Tiaoxi River, China. High prevalence of ARG5 indicated significant antibiotic resistance pollution in the research area (absolute abundance: 6.1 x 10(8) -2.1 x 10(10) copies/L; relative abundance: 0.033-0.158 copies/cell). Conventional water qualities (COD, TN, TP, NH3-N), bacterial communities and mobile gene elements (MGEs) were detected and analyzed as factors of ARGs shift. Nutrient and MGEs showed positive correlation with most ARGs (P < 0.05) and bacteria community was identified as the key contributing factor driving ARGs alteration. With the land use study and field investigation, country area, especially arable, was expected as a high spot for ARGs shift and pathogen breeding. Comparing to environmental background, promotion of ARGs and marked shift of bacterial community were observed in country and urban city areas, indicating that human activities may lead to the spread of ARGs. Analysis of factors affecting ARG5 in this study may shed new light on the mechanism of the maintenance and propagation of ARGs in urban rivers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Time-averaged concentrations are effective for predicting chronic toxicity of varying copper pulse exposures for two freshwater green algae species	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Intermittent, fluctuating and pulsed contaminant discharges may result in organisms receiving highly variable contaminant exposures. This study investigated the effects of dissolved copper pulse concentration and exposure duration on the toxicity to two freshwater green algae species. The effects of single copper pulses of between 1 and 48 h duration and continuous exposures (72 h) on growth rate inhibition of Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and Chlorella sp. were compared on a time-averaged concentration (TAC) basis. Relationships were then derived between the exposure concentration and duration required to elicit different levels of toxicity expressed as inhibition concentration (IC). Continuous exposure IC50's of 3.0 and 1.9 mu g/L were measured on a TAC basis for P. subcapitata and Chlorella sp., respectively. Algal growth rates generally recovered to control levels within 24-48 h of the copper pulse removal, with some treatments exhibiting significantly (p < 0.05) higher rates of cell division than controls in this recovery period. For both algae, when exposed to treatments with equivalent TACs, the continuous exposure elicited similar or slightly greater growth rate inhibition than the pulsed exposures. To elicit equivalent inhibition, the exposure concentration increased as the exposure duration decreased, and power models fitted this relationship reasonably well for both species. Water quality guideline values (WQGVs) are predominantly derived using data from continuous exposure toxicity bioassays, despite intermittent contaminant exposures often occurring in aquatic systems.

J	Ochoo, B; Valcour, J; Sarkar, A				Ochoo, Benjamin; Valcour, James; Sarkar, Atanu			Association between perceptions of public drinking water quality and actual drinking water quality: A community-based exploratory study in Newfoundland (Canada)	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Studying public perception on drinking water quality is crucial for managing of water resources, generation of water quality standards, and surveillance of the drinking-water quality. However, in policy discourse, the reliability of public perception concerning drinking water quality and associated health risks is questionable. Does the public perception of water quality equate with the actual water quality? We investigated public perceptions of water quality and the perceived health risks and associated with the actual quality of public water supplies in the same communities. The study was conducted in 45 communities of Newfoundland (Canada) in 2012. First, a telephone survey of 100 households was conducted to examine public perceptions of drinking water quality of their respective public sources. Then we extracted public water quality reports of the same communities (1988-2011) from the provincial government's water resources portal. These reports contained the analysis of 2091 water samples, including levels of Disinfection By-Products (DBPs), nutrients, metals, ions and physical parameters. The reports showed that colour, manganese, total dissolved solids, iron, turbidity, and DBPs were the major detected parameters in the public water. However, the majority of the respondents (> 56%) were either completely satisfied or very satisfied with the quality of drinking water. Older, higher educated and high income group respondents were more satisfied with water quality than the younger, less educated and low-income group respondents. The study showed that there was no association with public satisfaction level and actual water quality of the respective communities. Even, in the communities, supplied by the same water system, the respondents had differences in opinion. Despite the effort by the provincial government to make the water-test results available on its website for years, the study showed existing disconnectedness between public perception of drinking water quality and actual quality. We had little scope to explore the possible explanations, and hence further studies are required to verify the age, gender educational status and income differential about the satisfaction of public service like water supply.																	0013-9351	1096-0953				NOV	2017	159						435	443		10.1016/j.envres.2017.08.019								WOS:000413280500049	28858757

In this study, the response of anaerobic sludge to the presence of Bi2WO6 nano-particles (NPs) was investigated in the anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR). As the concentration of Bi2WO6 in the reactor was controlled around 1 mg/L, there was no significant difference in effluent water quality or bacterial activities before and after NP exposure, partially due to the microbial-induced NP aggregation and stable complex formation. However, with the increasing dosage of Bi2WO6 from 5 to 40 mg/L, great influences on the AnMBR performance were observed, including the reduction of COD removal efficiency, inhibition of the mechanization step, increased production of soluble microbial products, and enhanced secretion of extracellular polymer substrates. Additional investigation with high-throughput sequencing was conducted, clearly demonstrating that Bi2WO6 NPs induced changes in the bacterial community.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				NOV	2017	24	31					24261	24271		10.1007/s11356-017-0022-2								WOS:000413649700019	28889223

Cuprous oxide was aerially applied to three catchments of Pinus radiata of varying age classes in the central North Island of New Zealand. Copper was monitored in stream water and sediments prior to and for 1 month after application. Copper deposits collected from tracer plates deployed above the water surface along the stream channels within the treated areas at each site ranged from 13 to 406 ppm. Lowest concentrations occurred above small stream channels with dense overhead riparian vegetation. Peak copper concentrations in stream water across the three sites ranged from 28 to 60 mu g L-1 and were below the analytical detection limit within hours. Copper concentrations were higher and persisted for longer in stream sediment (range 1.7-6.1 mg kg(-1), sampled at two sites only). Copper concentrations in sediments were below environmental guidelines. Copper concentrations in water and sediment indicated a low risk to aquatic organisms based on the exposure times to the concentrations measured in this study.

The effects of a chronic exposure to such discharges are complex to understand due to the combined effects of environmental physico-chemical parameters (e.g., high salinity) and different pollutants that can modulate the physiological responses of this species to stress. In this context, we assessed the biological effects in a marine species P. rustica, by a multibiomarker approach that provided information on the health status of organisms in response to such an environmental stress. We measured biomarkers in the whole soft tissues of limpets as indicators of neurotoxicity (AChE activity), oxidative stress (CAT, SOD, GR, and GPx activities), biotransformation (GST), oxidative damage (LPO through TBARS levels), and genotoxicity (CSP 3-like activity). In parallel, hydrological parameters were measured in the Bay of Oran, at four selected sites: site H considered as a "hotspot," located at Bousfer desalination plant; two other sites E and W, at the east and the west of H respectively; finally, site R "reference" located in Madragh, which is considered as a remote clean site. Our analyses revealed that the activities of antioxidant defense enzymes reached the highest levels in P. rustica collected from site H. The activation of antioxidant defense system in these organisms translated the alteration of their status health, reflecting a level of environmental disruption generated by the desalination plant brine discharges and the high salinity in this area. We also observed that the tissues of limpets collected from site H as well as the two other sites, E and W, had undergone molecular damage, confirmed by the high levels of CSP 3-like activity. This damage resulted from chronic exposure to environmental conditions, potentially genotoxic, due to the desalination plant discharges. The present results indicate the adverse impact of brine effluents from desalination plants on marine fauna and suggest the need for a more consistent approach to environmental management of brine discharges.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				NOV	2017	24	31					24521	24532		10.1007/s11356-017-0081-4								WOS:000413649700041	28900807

The receiving waters are frequently polluted by the initial stormwater from the separate stormwater system and the wastewater from sewage pipes through stormwater pipes. Consequently, calculating the intercepted runoff depth has become a problem that must be resolved immediately for initial stormwater pollution management. The accurate calculation of intercepted runoff depth provides a solid foundation for selecting the appropriate size of intercepting facilities in drainage and interception projects. This study establishes a separate stormwater system for the Yishan Building watershed of Fuzhou City using the InfoWorks Integrated Catchment Management (InfoWorks ICM), which can predict the stormwater flow velocity and the flow of discharge outlet after each rainfall. The intercepted runoff depth is calculated from the stormwater quality and environmental capacity of the receiving waters. The average intercepted runoff depth from six rainfall events is calculated as 4.1 mm based on stormwater quality. The average intercepted runoff depth from six rainfall events is calculated as 4.4 mm based on the environmental capacity of the receiving waters. The intercepted runoff depth differs when calculated from various aspects. The selection of the intercepted runoff depth depends on the goal of water quality control, the self-purification capacity of the water bodies, and other factors of the region.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				NOV	2017	24	31					24681	24689		10.1007/s11356-017-9800-0								WOS:000413649700055	28913681

The evolving role of government in the adaptive governance of freshwater social-ecological systems in the western US	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY												The role of government within the western United States is shifting, as government command and control policies inadequately address freshwater management complexity. As growing human and environmental needs intensify water resource governance challenges, government is increasingly combining existing regulatory structures with collaborative exchange mechanisms, such as Investments in Watershed Services (IWS). We explored the changing role of government through IWS in the west, a region that holds one of the highest concentrations of IWS globally. Through a survey, we collected and analysed information on the influence of government in IWS. All 48 identified IWS contained some form of government presence: as program participants, regulation drivers, or land managers, and in both voluntary and regulatory contexts. Government influence on IWS varies across water issue (in-stream flow, water quality, and source water protection), and level of government (local, state and federal). Our work demonstrates how the government is expanding its roles and responsibilities, moving beyond historic command and control roles to support and facilitate new mechanisms. Although most government presence in early IWS was regulatory, local, state and federal governments are increasingly participating directly in IWS. State government have expanded regulatory structures for instream flow, and federal and local government are collaborating in source water protection. We found that government is reactionary, pragmatic, and incremental in their responses to water management. Our work provides the first government-specific analysis of IWS in the western US, and provides insights into the evolving role of government in adaptive governance of freshwater resources.

This study developed an online analytical technique-high-performance liquid chromatography followed by photochemical reaction and chemiluminescence detection (HPLCPR-CL)-for determination of the concentration of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and three other N-nitrosamines. Its feasibility for near real-time analysis was evaluated by analyzing an ultrafiltration (UF)-treated wastewater before and after a pilotscale reverse osmosis (RO) treatment system. The online instrument with a method detection limit of 0.3-2.7 ng L-1 requires a direct injection (i.e., no sample pre-concentration) of only 20-200 mu L sample volume for the determination of N-nitrosamine concentrations every 20 min. NDMA concentrations in UF-treated wastewater were successfully monitored in a range of 50-200 ng L-1 over the course of 24 h. Likewise, NDMA concentrations in RO permeate ranged from 26-81 ng L-1 over the course of 48 h. The online monitor was capable of recording variations in N-nitrosamine concentration in RO permeate that occurred following changes in feedwater concentration and temperature. This study demonstrates the potential for online water quality assurance via direct measurement of trace levels of organic contaminants, which is highly relevant to the implementation of potable reuse.																	2053-1400	2053-1419				NOV 1	2017	3	6					1032	1036		10.1039/c7ew00296c								WOS:000413934800004

Peracetic acid disinfection kinetics for combined sewer overflows: indicator organisms, antibiotic resistance genes, and microbial community	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY												Combined sewer overflows (CSOs) degrade water quality and end-of-pipe treatment is one potential solution for retrofitting this outdated infrastructure. The goal of this research was to evaluate peracetic acid (PAA) as a disinfectant for CSOs using viability based molecular methods for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), indicator organism marker gene BacHum, and 16S rRNA genes. Simulated CSO effluent was prepared using 23-40% wastewater, representing the higher end of the range of wastewater concentrations reported in CSO effluent. PAA residual following disinfection was greatest for samples with the lowest initial COD. Treatment of simulated CSO effluent (23% wastewater) with 100 mg min L-1 PAA (5 mg L-1 PAA, 20 min) was needed to reduce viable cell sul1, tet(G), and BacHum (1.0 +/- 0.63-3.2 +/- 0.25- log) while 25 to 50 mg min L-1 PAA (5 mg L-1 PAA, 5-10 min) was needed to reduce viable cell loads (0.62 +/- 0.56-1.6 +/- 0.08log) in 40% wastewater from a different municipal treatment plant. Increasing contact time after the initial decrease in viable cell gene copies did not significantly improve treatment. A much greater applied Ct of 1200 mg min L-1 PAA (20 mg L-1 PAA, 60 min) was required for significant log reduction of 16S rRNA genes (3.29 +/- 0.13-log). No significant losses of mexB were observed during the study. Data were fitted to a Chick-Watson model and resulting inactivation constants for sul1 and tet(G) > BacHum > 16S rRNA. Amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene indicated the initial viable and total microbial communities were distinct and that treatment with PAA resulted in marked increases of the relative abundance of select phyla, particularly Clostridia which increased by 1-1.5 orders of magnitude. Results confirm that membrane disruption is a mechanism for PAA disinfection and further treatment is needed to reduce total ARGs in CSO effluent.																	2053-1400	2053-1419				NOV 1	2017	3	6					1061	1072		10.1039/c7ew00184c								WOS:000413934800008	29333272

Development and experimental validation of the composition and treatability of a new synthetic bathroom greywater (SynGrey)	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY												Bathroom greywater, including bathing and handwashing wastewater, can be reused for toilet flushing to reduce 35% of residential water demand. Despite these potential savings, greywater reuse is underutilized and the development of innovative treatment technologies is impeded by a lack of validated synthetic recipes to support laboratory-scale experimentation. The objective of this work was to develop and validate a new, representative synthetic bathroom greywater to enable reproducible and translatable treatment studies. A literature review compiled data from 49 real bathroom greywaters, which was used to set 20 water quality criteria for a synthetic recipe. A new synthetic greywater - SynGrey - was developed to match real bathroom greywater composition across all criteria and was found to be more representative of real greywater than existing recipes. SynGrey's validity was evaluated by comparing its treatability against a real bathroom greywater including via chlorination, aerobic biodegradation, adsorption, and coagulation. Total chlorine residuals were statistically similar between SynGrey and the real bathroom greywater, but doses were an order of magnitude higher than for drinking water. The readily biodegradable fraction of total chemical oxygen demand was about 40% for both greywaters. The dissolved organic carbon percent removal by activated carbon was similar between SynGrey and the real greywater (+/- 14%). Alum coagulation achieved comparable effluent turbidity, but SynGrey had a much more narrow dose curve, and coagulation achieved substantially greater total organic carbon removal from the real greywater. SynGrey represents a superior synthetic recipe for laboratory-scale experimentation to facilitate the evaluation, selection, and optimization of greywater reuse technologies.

ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												With the aim to refine water analysis in fish bioconcentration studies, automated solid-phase microextraction (SPME) was used as an alternative approach to conventional solvent extraction (liquid-liquid extraction [LLE]) for the extraction of 3 hydrophobic organic chemicals (HOCs; log K-OW 5.5-7.8) from flow-through studies with rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The results showed that total concentrations extracted by SPME combined with internal standards and LLE are equal. The results further verify the possibility of simultaneous extraction of total and freely dissolved HOC concentrations by SPME. Freely dissolved concentrations allow the assessment of sorption and bioavailability of HOCs in bioconcentration studies and their potential impact on resulting bioconcentration factors (BCFs). Reduction in freely dissolved water concentrations can result in an underestimation of BCFs if they are calculated based on total water concentrations. For polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) 153, a significant increase in BCF value was observed when freely dissolved concentrations were taken into account. However, log BCF values calculated based on freely dissolved concentrations did not correlate linearly with log K-OW values above 5 to 6. This pointed to further influences besides a reduction in freely dissolved water concentrations by sorption to organic matter. The results can aid in assessment of the factors that influence bioconcentration systems and also give important information regarding the possible replacement of LLE by SPME for water analysis of highly HOCs in fish bioconcentration studies.

Development of biotic ligand model-based freshwater aquatic life criteria for lead following us environmental protection agency guidelines	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												The US Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA's) current ambient water quality criteria (AWQC) for lead (Pb) in freshwater were developed in 1984. The criteria are adjusted for hardness, but more recent studies have demonstrated that other parameters, especially dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and pH, have a much stronger influence on Pb bioavailability. These recent studies have been used to support development of a biotic ligand model (BLM) for Pb in freshwater, such that acute and chronic Pb toxicity can be predicted over a wide range of water chemistry conditions. Following USEPA guidelines for AWQC development and using a methodology consistent with that used by the USEPA in developing its recommended BLM-based criteria for copper in 2007, we propose acute and chronic BLM-based AWQC for Pb in freshwater. In addition to the application of the BLM approach that can better account for site-specific Pb bioavailability, the toxicity data sets presented are much more robust than in 1984, and there are now sufficient chronic Pb toxicity data available that use of an acute-to-chronic ratio is no longer necessary. Over a range of North American surface waters with representative water chemistry conditions, proposed acute BLM-based Pb criteria ranged from approximately 20 to 1000g/L and chronic BLM-based Pb criteria ranged from approximately 0.3 to 40g/L. The lowest criteria were for water with low DOC (1.2mg/L), pH (6.7), and hardness (4.3mg/L as CaCO3), whereas the highest criteria were for water with high DOC (9.8mg/L), pH (8.2), and hardness (288mg/L as CaCO3).

Updated species sensitivity distribution evaluations for acute and chronic lead toxicity to saltwater aquatic life	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												The US Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA's) ambient water quality criteria (AWQC) for lead (Pb) in salt water were developed in 1984. The acute and chronic criteria are 210 and 8.1g/L dissolved Pb, respectively. Because data were limited in 1984, the chronic criterion was derived using an acute-to-chronic ratio, but there are now sufficient toxicity data such that an acute-to-chronic ratio is no longer needed. Based on the data now available, the proposed updated acute and chronic salt water Pb AWQC (following USEPA methods) are 100 and 10 mu g/L, respectively. In the European Union, a chronic salt water predicted no-effect concentration based on the median 5th percentile hazardous concentration (HC5-50) was developed in 2008 for the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation, and Restriction of Chemicals program, which forms the basis for deriving chronic environmental quality standards for Pb in European marine waters. The salt water HC5-50 previously derived for Pb was 6.1g/L, whereas the proposed, updated chronic salt water HC5-50 derived following European Union methods is 11.0 mu g/L. Thus, despite differences in derivation methodologies, the proposed AWQC and HC5-50 values are very consistent. Studies evaluating the effect of water quality factors on bioavailability and toxicity of Pb in salt water are limited; the effect of water quality on Pb toxicity in salt water should be considered in future studies.

J	Schiffer, S; Liber, K				Schiffer, Stephanie; Liber, Karsten			Estimation of vanadium water quality benchmarks for the protection of aquatic life with relevance to the Athabasca Oil Sands region using species sensitivity distributions	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Elevated vanadium (V) concentrations in oil sands coke, which is produced and stored on site of some major Athabasca Oil Sands companies, could pose a risk to aquatic ecosystems in northern Alberta, Canada, depending on its future storage and utilization. In the present study, V toxicity was determined in reconstituted Athabasca River water to various freshwater organisms, including 2 midge species (Chironomus dilutus and Chironomus riparius; 4-d and 30-d to 40-d exposures) and 2 freshwater fish species (Oncorhynchus mykiss and Pimephales promelas; 4-d and 28-d exposures) to facilitate estimation of water quality benchmarks. The acute toxicity of V was 52.0 and 63.2mg/L for C. dilutus and C. riparius, respectively, and 4.0 and 14.8mgV/L for P. promelas and O. mykiss, respectively. Vanadium exposure significantly impaired adult emergence of C. dilutus and C. riparius at concentrations 16.7 (31.6% reduction) and 8.3 (18.0% reduction) mg/L, respectively. Chronic toxicity in fish presented as lethality, with chronic 28-d LC50s of 0.5 and 4.3mg/L for P. promelas and O. mykiss, respectively. These data were combined with data from the peer-reviewed literature, and separate acute and chronic species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) were constructed. The acute and chronic hazardous concentrations endangering only 5% of species (HC5) were estimated as 0.64 and 0.05mgV/L, respectively. These new data for V toxicity to aquatic organisms ensure that there are now adequate data available for regulatory agencies to develop appropriate water quality guidelines for use in the Athabasca Oil Sands region and elsewhere. Until then, the HC5 values presented in the present study could serve as interim benchmarks for the protection of aquatic life from exposure to hazardous levels of V in local aquatic environments.

Widespread occurrence and potential for biodegradation of bioactive contaminants in Congaree National Park, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Organic contaminants with designed molecular bioactivity, such as pesticides and pharmaceuticals, originate from human and agricultural sources, occur frequently in surface waters, and threaten the structure and function of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Congaree National Park in South Carolina (USA) is a vulnerable park unit due to its location downstream of multiple urban and agricultural contaminant sources and its hydrologic setting, being composed almost entirely of floodplain and aquatic environments. Seventy-two water and sediment samples were collected from 16 sites in Congaree National Park during 2013 to 2015, and analyzed for 199 and 81 targeted organic contaminants, respectively. More than half of these water and sediment analytes were not detected or potentially had natural sources. Pharmaceutical contaminants were detected (49 total) frequently in water throughout Congaree National Park, with higher detection frequencies and concentrations at Congaree and Wateree River sites, downstream from major urban areas. Forty-seven organic wastewater indicator chemicals were detected in water, and 36 were detected in sediment, of which approximately half are distinctly anthropogenic. Endogenous sterols and hormones, which may originate from humans or wildlife, were detected in water and sediment samples throughout Congaree National Park, but synthetic hormones were detected only once, suggesting a comparatively low risk of adverse impacts. Assessment of the biodegradation potentials of 8 C-14-radiolabeled model contaminants indicated poor potentials for some contaminants, particularly under anaerobic sediments conditions.

J	Maloney, EM; Morrissey, CA; Headley, JV; Peru, KM; Liber, K				Maloney, Erin M.; Morrissey, Christy A.; Headley, John V.; Peru, Kerry M.; Liber, Karsten			Cumulative toxicity of neonicotinoid insecticide mixtures to Chironomus dilutus under acute exposure scenarios	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Extensive agricultural use of neonicotinoid insecticide products has resulted in the presence of neonicotinoid mixtures in surface waters worldwide. Although many aquatic insect species are known to be sensitive to neonicotinoids, the impact of neonicotinoid mixtures is poorly understood. In the present study, the cumulative toxicities of binary and ternary mixtures of select neonicotinoids (imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam) were characterized under acute (96-h) exposure scenarios using the larval midge Chironomus dilutus as a representative aquatic insect species. Using the MIXTOX approach, predictive parametric models were fitted and statistically compared with observed toxicity in subsequent mixture tests. Single-compound toxicity tests yielded median lethal concentration (LC50) values of 4.63, 5.93, and 55.34g/L for imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam, respectively. Because of the similar modes of action of neonicotinoids, concentration-additive cumulative mixture toxicity was the predicted model. However, we found that imidacloprid-clothianidin mixtures demonstrated response-additive dose-level-dependent synergism, clothianidin-thiamethoxam mixtures demonstrated concentration-additive synergism, and imidacloprid-thiamethoxam mixtures demonstrated response-additive dose-ratio-dependent synergism, with toxicity shifting from antagonism to synergism as the relative concentration of thiamethoxam increased. Imidacloprid-clothianidin-thiamethoxam ternary mixtures demonstrated response-additive synergism. These results indicate that, under acute exposure scenarios, the toxicity of neonicotinoid mixtures to C. dilutus cannot be predicted using the common assumption of additive joint activity. Indeed, the overarching trend of synergistic deviation emphasizes the need for further research into the ecotoxicological effects of neonicotinoid insecticide mixtures in field settings, the development of better toxicity models for neonicotinoid mixture exposures, and the consideration of mixture effects when setting water quality guidelines for this class of pesticides.

Risk assessment of imidacloprid use in forest settings on the aquatic macroinvertebrate community	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												The isolated effects of a single insecticide can be difficult to assess in natural settings because of the presence of numerous pollutants in many watersheds. Imidacloprid use for suppressing hemlock woolly adelgid, Adelges tsugae (Annand) (Hemiptera: Adelgidae), in forests offers a rare opportunity to assess potential impacts on aquatic macroinvertebrates in relatively pristine landscapes. Aquatic macroinvertebrate communities were assessed in 9 streams in Great Smoky Mountains National Park (southern Appalachian Mountains, USA). The streams flow through hemlock conservation areas where imidacloprid soil drench treatments were applied for hemlock woolly adelgid suppression. Sites were located upstream and downstream of the imidacloprid treatments. Baseline species presence data (pre-imidacloprid treatment) were available from previous sample collections at downstream sites. Downstream and upstream sites did not vary in numerous community measures. Although comparisons of paired upstream and downstream sites showed differences in diversity in 7 streams, higher diversity was found more often in downstream sites. Macroinvertebrate functional feeding groups and life habits were similar between downstream and upstream sites. Downstream and baseline stream samples were similar. While some functional feeding group and life habit species richness categories varied, variations did not indicate poorer quality downstream communities. Imidacloprid treatments applied according to US Environmental Protection Agency federal restrictions did not result in negative effects to aquatic macroinvertebrate communities, which indicates that risks of imidacloprid use in forest settings are low.

J	Suter, G; Cormier, S; Barron, M				Suter, Glenn; Cormier, Susan; Barron, Mace			A weight of evidence framework for environmental assessments: Inferring quantities	INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT												The US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has developed a generally applicable framework for a weight-of-evidence (WoE) process for deriving quantitative values from multiple estimates. These guidelines are intended for environmental assessments that require the generation of quantitative parameters such as degradation rates or that develop quantitative products such as criterion values or magnitudes of effects. The basic steps are to weigh evidence for the environmental quality to be quantified, generate the value by merging estimates or by identifying the best estimate, and weight the results to determine confidence in the numerical value. When multiple data sets or outputs of multiple models are available, it may be appropriate to weigh the evidence. Use of the framework to weigh multiple estimates may increase the accuracy of quantitative results compared to a single estimate from a default method. Its use can provide greater transparency compared to ad hoc weighing of evidence. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2017;13:1045-1051. Published 2017.

Industrial pilots representing small real-size treatment units were set up downstream of a conventional secondary treatment of a wastewater treatment plant in the South of France and their performance followed for 2 y. Life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology is used to compare the environmental impacts of different treatment processes. Five tertiary treatment trains were studied: 1) sand filtration (SF) ?storage followed by ultraviolet (UV) dynamic reactor disinfection (SF-UVD), 2) sand filtration + UV batch reactor disinfection (SF-UVB), 3) ultrafiltration (UF), 4) ultrafiltration and UV batch reactor disinfection (UF-UVB), and 5) microfiltration (MF) and storage followed by dynamic UV disinfection (MF-UVD). The chosen functional unit is "To supply 1 m(3) of water with a quality in compliance with the highest standard of the French reuse regulations." The combination of SF with UV disinfection or the use of UF alone was found to be equivalent in terms of environmental impact for most of the midpoint indicators chosen. Combination of UF with UV disinfection was significantly more impacting because the electricity consumption was nearly doubled. This study was conducted on an industrial pilot; it may thus be representative of industrial facilities implemented to treat higher water flows.

Chemometric approach integrated with capillary electrophoresis for the investigation of public water system sources and quality	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												A chemometric approach coupled with capillary electrophoresis based on the hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis has been applied for the investigation of the water quality in the Golcuk-Isparta region (Lake District of Turkey). In the research area, Egirdir Lake, Golcuk Lake and surrounding ground and domestic waters have been utilized as drinking water resources. Golcuk Lake is distinctive in terms of high fluoride content (3.50 +/- 0.21 mg/mL) which is endemic in volcanic areas where the water flow through volcanic rocks and sediments. Based on the analysis of major anions chloride, sulfate, nitrate and fluoride with capillary electrophoresis, twenty-four drinking water sampling sites in the research area were classified into four classes using the hierarchical cluster and principal component analysis. Combining the research area investigation results of hierarchical cluster and principal component analysis, it was found that fluoride concentration is the major diagnostic variable to determine the quality of drinking waters, and all the other anions are the important classification factors to predict the resources of the drinking water samples, individually. To sum up, this study reveals the potential of the use of capillary electrophoresis in combination with chemometric techniques for the determination of the quality and origin of drinking waters.

Metal contamination of bed sediments in the Irwell and Upper Mersey catchments, northwest England: exploring the legacy of industry and urban growth	JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS												Manchester is often heralded as the first industrial city. Large volumes of physical and liquid contaminants were released into its river network throughout the industrial period up to the latter part of the twentieth century. Water quality has improved dramatically in recent decades, but, given their environmental significance, it is important to ascertain the extent to which a legacy of contamination persists in the modern bed sediments. Fine-grained bed sediments were sampled at 40 sites in the Mersey and Irwell catchments. Sediments were wet sieved to isolate the < 63-mu m grain size fraction. Metal concentrations were determined using XRF. Particle size characteristics were also measured. Sediments were subjected to a five-step sequential extraction procedure to ascertain the environmental significance of metal concentrations. Alongside archival research of past industry, enrichment factors, multivariate statistical techniques and conditional inferences trees were used to identify sources of heavy metals. Bed sediment-associated heavy metal(loid) concentrations were as follows: As (9.89-110 mg kg(-1)), Cr (76.5-413 mg kg(-1)), Cu (53.1-383 mg kg(-1)), Pb (80.4-442 mg kg(-1)) and Zn (282-1020 mg kg(-1)). Enrichment factors ranged from moderate to extremely severe, with Pb showing the greatest enrichment across the catchments. Chemical mobility was generally low, but metal(loid) partitioning identified the influence of anthropogenic sources. Statistical analysis highlighted a number of point sources associated with former industrial sites that operated during the industrial period. Conditional inference trees highlighted the role of the textile industry on Cu concentrations in addition to indicating the complexity of sources, fluxes and stores of sediment-associated contamination throughout the system. Fine-grained sediment-associated metal(loid)s in the Mersey and Irwell catchments are anthropogenically enriched. Concentrations also exceed sediment quality guidelines. A lack of distinct spatial patterning points to a complex network of contaminant inputs across the catchments, even in the headwaters. Whilst potential modern urban sources are likely to be important, spatial patterns and multivariate/data mining techniques also highlighted the importance of releases from former industrial sites as well as the reworking of historically contaminated floodplains and soils.																	1439-0108	1614-7480				NOV	2017	17	11					2648	2665		10.1007/s11368-017-1668-6								WOS:000412738900007

However, the hydraulics condition within PSR, which is an essential prerequisite of the water quality studies, still remains unclear. Consequently, the objective of this study is to analyze the hydraulic conditions within PSR by means of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach. The influences of configuration parameters on the hydraulic conditions were tested including propeller diameter, inclined angle of the propeller, distance between the top and inner cylinder, distance between the bottom and inner cylinder, outer cylinder length, baffle length, number of the baffles, rotational speed of the propeller, and inner and outer cylinder diameters. According to the CFD analysis, an optimal structure of PSR was suggested. The data presented here could facilitate the PSR application and improve the simulation of water quality in distribution systems.

Samples were collected on two occasions from 22 sampling sites within the Bloukrans River system, Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. The data collected were subjected to multivariate statistical technique, i. e. CCA, to determine environmental gradients along which the diatom species were distributed as well as to elucidate hypothesised differences in community structure per stream order. Significant differences between the two sampling periods were observed in dissolved oxygen, temperature, Na, B, Ca, Zn, Cu, Cr, K, Fe, phosphate, conductivity, salinity and nitrate, while significant stream order variation was observed for conductivity, salinity, Mg, Ca and sediment nitrates. Study sites were grouped into two broad categories (stream order 1 and 2/3 sites) based on CCA. As pollution increased, low to moderate pollution-tolerant species such as Fragilaria tenera, Cyclostephanos dubius and Gyrosigma acuminatum were replaced by high pollution-tolerant species such as Nitzschia palea, Gomphonema parvulum, Tryblionella apiculata, Diploneis vulgaris and Staurosira elliptica. This shows that diatom assemblages are appropriate indicators of ionic composition/conductivity and hydromorphological characteristics (e. g. stream size) of running waters. The results highlight the importance of creating regional calibration datasets which will make it possible to develop procedures to determine conductivity and ion concentration effects on biota.

J	Vithana, CL; Sullivan, LA; Shepherd, T				Vithana, Chamindra L.; Sullivan, Leigh A.; Shepherd, Troy			Effect of schwertmannite and jarosite on the formation of hypoxic blackwater during inundation of grass material	WATER RESEARCH												This study focused on understanding the effect of schwertmannite and jarosite, commonly found in floodplains containing acid sulfate soil materials, on the characteristics of the hypoxic blackwaters that can form when floodplain vegetation experiences prolonged inundation. The formation of these 'blackwaters' was simulated in the laboratory by inundating flood-intolerant pasture grass leaf material in both the presence of schwertmannite/jarosite (schwertmannite and jarosite treatments) minerals and their absence (control treatment) at 27.5 degrees C for 32 days. The presence of either schwertmannite or jarosite was able to decrease the concentrations of DOC, nutrients (e.g. NH3 and PO43-) and the biological oxygen demand (BOD) in the incubating water compared to the control treatment. Being fresh and labile, the pasture grass material liberated DOC immediately following inundation with a concomitant decrease in dissolved O-2 thereby resulting in anoxic and reducing conditions in the incubating water. With the onset of anoxic and reducing conditions, the biogeochemical cycling of DOC in schwertmannite and jarosite treatments might have proceeded via microbially mediated iron(III) and sulfate reduction and electron shuttling processes. Under anoxic, slightly acidic conditions, microbially mediated iron(III) reduction and subsequent dissolution of schwertmannite and jarosite were triggered by liberating Fe2+, SO42- and alkalinity to the incubating water. The resultant increase in pH led to SO42- reduction in schwertmannite, and the Fe2+ catalysed transformation of both schwertmannite and jarosite to goethite. Schwertmannite almost completely transformed to goethite within two weeks of incubation. Iron(III) in goethite (formed from schwertmannie transformation) was also reduced and likely proceeded via direct microbial reduction or via electron shuttling using the humic acids in the incubating water derived from pasture grass. These findings are highly useful in managing the coastal low lying acid sulfate soils landscapes which are subject to frequent flooding during wet seasons. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Meyers, G; Kapelan, Z; Keedwell, E				Meyers, Gregory; Kapelan, Zoran; Keedwell, Edward			Short-term forecasting of turbidity in trunk main networks	WATER RESEARCH												Water discolouration is an increasingly important and expensive issue due to rising customer expectations, tighter regulatory demands and ageing Water Distribution Systems (WDSs) in the UK and abroad. This paper presents a new turbidity forecasting methodology capable of aiding operational staff and enabling proactive management strategies. The turbidity forecasting methodology developed here is completely data-driven and does not require hydraulic or water quality network model that is expensive to build and maintain. The methodology is tested and verified on a real trunk main network with observed turbidity measurement data. Results obtained show that the methodology can detect if discolouration material is mobilised, estimate if sufficient turbidity will be generated to exceed a preselected threshold and approximate how long the material will take to reach the downstream meter. Classification based forecasts of turbidity can be reliably made up to 5 h ahead although at the expense of increased false alarm rates. The methodology presented here could be used as an early warning system that can enable a multitude of cost beneficial proactive management strategies to be implemented as an alternative to expensive trunk mains cleaning programs.

Linking terrestrial phosphorus inputs to riverine export across the United States	WATER RESEARCH												Humans have greatly accelerated phosphorus (P) flows from land to aquatic ecosystems, causing eutrophication, harmful algal blooms, and hypoxia. A variety of statistical and mechanistic models have been used to explore the relationship between P management on land and P losses to waterways, but our ability to predict P losses from watersheds often relies on small scale catchment studies, where detailed measurements can be made, or global scale models that that are often too coarse-scaled to be used directly in the management decision-making process. Here we constructed spatially explicit datasets of terrestrial P inputs and outputs across the conterminous U.S. (CONUS) for 2012. We use this dataset to improve understanding of P sources and balances at the national scale and to investigate whether well standardized input data at the continental scale can be used to improve predictions of hydrologic P export from watersheds across the U.S. We estimate that in 2012 agricultural lands received 0.19 Tg more P as fertilizer and confined manure than was harvested in major crops. Approximately 0.06 Tg P was lost to waterways as sewage and detergent nationally based on per capita loads in 2012. We compared two approaches for calculating non-agricultural P waste export to waterways, and found that estimates based on per capita P loads from sewage and detergent were 50% greater than Discharge Monitoring Report Pollutant Loading Tool. This suggests that the tool is likely underestimating P export in waste the CONUS scale. TP and DIP concentrations and TP yields were generally correlated more strongly with runoff than with P inputs or P balances, but even the relationships between runoff and P export were weak. Including P inputs as independent variables increased the predictive capacity of the best-fit models by at least 20%, but together inputs and runoff explained 40% of the variance in P concentration and 46-54% of the variance in P yield. By developing and applying a high-resolution P budget for the CONUS this study confirms that both hydrology and P inputs and sinks play important roles in aquatic P loading across a wide range of environments.

Sirajul			The public health significance of latrines discharging to groundwater used for drinking	WATER RESEARCH												Faecal contamination of groundwater from pit latrines is widely perceived as a major threat to the safety of drinking water for several billion people in rural and peri-urban areas worldwide. On the floodplains of the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta in Bangladesh, we constructed latrines and monitored piezometer nests monthly for two years. We detected faecal coliforms (FC) in 3.3-233% of samples at four sites. We differentiate a near-field, characterised by high concentrations and frequent, persistent and contiguous contamination in all directions, and a far-field characterised by rare, impersistent, discontinuous low-level detections in variable directions. Far-field FC concentrations at four sites exceeded 0 and 10 cfu/100 ml in 2.4-9.6% and 0.2-2.3% of sampling events respectively. The lesser contamination of in-situ groundwater compared to water at the point-of-collection from domestic wells, which itself is less contaminated than at the point-of-consumption, demonstrates the importance of recontamination in the well-pump system. We present a conceptual model comprising four sub-pathways: the latrine aquifer interface (near-field); groundwater flowing from latrine to well (far-field); the well-pump system; and post-collection handling and storage. Applying a hypothetical dose-response model suggests that 1-2% of the diarrhoeal disease burden from drinking water is derived from the aquifer, 29% from the well-pump system, and 70% from post-collection handling. The important implications are (i) that leakage from pit latrines is a minor contributor to faecal contamination of drinking water in alluvial deltaic terrains; (ii) fears of increased groundwater pollution should not constrain expanding latrine coverage, and (iii) that more attention should be given to reducing contamination around the well-head.

While beneficial, coagulation or ozonation alone is unable to both efficiently control membrane fouling and product water quality in many cases. Thus, in this study an emerging alternative of ferrous iron/peroxymonosulfate (Fe(II)/PMS), which can act as both an oxidant and a coagulant was employed prior to UF for treatment of natural surface water, and compared with conventional coagulation and ozonation. The results showed that the Fe(II)/PMS-UF system exhibited the best performance for dissolved organic carbon removal, likely due to the dual functions of coagulation and oxidation in the single process. The fluorescent and UV-absorbing organic components were more susceptible to ozonation than Fe(II)/PMS treatment. Fe(II)/PMS and ozonation pretreatments significantly increased the removal efficiency of atrazine, p-chloronitrobenzene and sulfamethazine by 12-76% and 50-94%, respectively, whereas coagulation exerted a minor influence. The Fe(II)/PMS pretreatment also showed the best performance for the reduction of both reversible and irreversible membrane fouling, and the performance was hardly affected by membrane pore size and surface hydrophobicity. In addition, the characterization of hydraulic irreversible organic foulants confirmed its effectiveness. These results demonstrate the potential advantages of applying Fe(II)/PMS as a pretreatment for UF to simultaneously control membrane fouling and improve the permeate quality. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Another common phenomenon at the terminus of pipelines is leakage, which is considered helpful by allowing seepage of low-quality drinking water resulting from long-term stagnation. In this study, the effect of laminar flow on alleviating water quality deterioration under different leakage conditions was investigated, and the potential thresholds of the flow rate, which can affect the iron release process, were discussed. Based on a galvanized pipe and ductile cast iron pipe pilot platform, which was established at the terminus of pipelines, this research was carried out by setting a series of leakage rate gradients to analyze the influence of different leakage flow rates on iron release, as well as the relationship with chemical and biological parameters. The results showed that the water quality parameters were obviously influenced by the change in flow velocity. Water quality was gradually improved with an increase in flow velocity, but its change regularity reflected a diversity under different flow rates (p < 0.05). The iron release was remarkably correlated to the redox potential, dissolved oxygen, pH, iron-oxidized bacteria and sulfate-reducing bacteria. The cumulative total iron release (r = 0.587, p < 0.05) and total iron release rate (r = 0.71, p < 0.022) were significantly influenced by the changes in flow velocity. In short, they tended first to increase and then to decrease with an increasing flow velocity with the threshold as approximately 40% of the critical laminar flow velocity (1.16 x 10(-3) m/s).

However, the accumulation and distribution of harbored elements and microbes in the different niches (loose deposits, PVC-U biofilm, and HDPE biofilm) and their corresponding potential contribution to water quality deterioration remain unknown. This precludes an in-depth understanding of water quality deterioration and the development of proactive management strategies. The present study quantitatively evaluated the distribution of elements, ATP, Aeromonas spp., and bacterial communities in distribution pipes (PVC-U, D = 110 mm, loose deposit and biofilm niches) and household connection pipes (HDPE, D = 32 mm, HDPE biofilm niches) at ten locations in an unchlorinated distribution system. The results show that loose deposits in PVC-U pipes, acting as sinks, constitute a hotspot (highest total amount per meter pipe) for elements, ATP, and target bacteria groups (e.g., Aeromonas spp., Mycobacterium spp., and Legionella spp.). When drinking water distribution system niches with harbored elements and microbes become sources in the event of disturbances, the highest quality deterioration potential (QDP) is that of HDPE biofilm; this can be attributed to its high surface-to-volume ratio. 16s rRNA analysis demonstrates that, at the genus level, the bacterial communities in the water, loose deposits, PVC-U biofilm, and HDPE biofilm were dominated, respectively, by Polaromorws spp. (2-23%), Nitrosipra spp. (1-47%), Flavobacterium spp. (1-36%), and Flavobacterium spp. (5-67%). The combined results of elemental composition and bacterial community analyses indicate that different dominant bio-chemical processes might occur within the different niches for example, iron arsenic oxidizing in loose deposits, bio-calumniation in PVC-U biofilm, and methane oxidizing in HDPE biofilm. The release of 20% loose deposits, 20% PVC-U biofilm and 10% HDPE biofilm will cause significant changes of water bacterial community. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Benthic cyanobacteria: A source of cylindrospermopsin and microcystin in Australian drinking water reservoirs	WATER RESEARCH												Cyanobacteria represent a health hazard worldwide due to their production of a range of highly potent toxins in diverse aquatic environments. While planktonic species have been the subject of many investigations in terms of risk assessment, little is known about benthic forms and their impact on water quality or human and animal health. This study aimed to purify isolates from environmental benthic biofilms sampled from three different drinking water reservoirs and to assess their toxin production by using the following methods: Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and quantitative PCR (qPCR). Microscopic observation of the isolates allowed the identification of various filamentous cyanobacterial genera: Anabaena (benthic form), Calothrix and Nostoc from the Nostocales and Geitlerinema, Leptolyngbya, Limnothrix, Lyngbya, Oxynema, Phormidium and Pseudanabaena representing non-heterocystous filamentous cyanobacteria. The Phormidium ambiguum strain AWQC-PHO021 was found to produce 739 ng/mg of dry weight (d/w) of cylindrospermopsin and 107 ng/mg (d/w) of deoxycylindrospermopsin. The Nostoc linckia strain AWQC-NOS001 produced 400 ng/mg (d/w) of a microcystin analogue. This is the first report of hepatotoxin production by benthic cyanobacteria in temperate Australian drinking water reservoirs. These findings indicate that water quality monitoring programs need to consider benthic cyanobacteria as a potential source of toxins. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The implications of drought and water conservation on the reuse of municipal wastewater: Recognizing impacts and identifying mitigation possibilities	WATER RESEARCH												As water agencies continue to investigate opportunities to increase resilience and local water supply reliability in the face of drought and rising water scarcity, water conservation strategies and the reuse of treated municipal wastewater are garnering significant attention and adoption. Yet a simple water balance thought experiment illustrates that drought, and the conservation strategies that are often enacted in response to it, both likely limit the role reuse may play in improving local water supply reliability. For instance, as a particular drought progresses and agencies enact water conservation measures to cope with drought, Influent flows likely decrease while influent pollution concentrations increase, particularly salinity, which adversely affects wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) costs and effluent quality and flow. Consequently, downstream uses of this effluent, whether to maintain streamflow and quality, groundwater recharge, or irrigation may be impacted. This is unfortunate since reuse is often heralded as a drought-proof mechanism to increase resilience. The objectives of this paper are two-fold. First, we illustrate using a case study from Southern California during its most recent drought how drought and water conservation strategies combine to reduce influent flow and quality and, subsequently, effluent flow and quality. Second, we use a recently developed regional water reuse decision support model (RWRM) to highlight cost-effective strategies that can be implemented to mitigate the impacts of drought on effluent water quality. While the solutions we identify cannot increase the flow of influent or effluent coming into or out of a treatment plant, they can improve the value of the remaining effluent in a cost-effective manner that takes into account the characteristics of its demand, whether it be for landscaping, golf courses, agricultural irrigation, or surface water augmentation.

Multiparametric monitoring of microbial faecal pollution reveals the dominance of human contamination along the whole Danube River	WATER RESEARCH												The microbial faecal pollution of rivers has wide-ranging impacts on a variety of human activities that rely on appropriate river water quality. Thus, detailed knowledge of the extent and origin of microbial faecal pollution is crucial for watershed management activities to maintain safe water use. In this study, the microbial faecal pollution levels were monitored by standard faecal indicator bacteria (SFIB) along a 2580 km stretch of the Danube, the world's most international river, as well as the Danube's most important tributaries. To track the origin of faecal pollution, host-associated Bacteroidetes genetic faecal marker qPCR assays for different host groups were applied in concert with. SFIB. The. spatial resolution analysis was followed by a time resolution analysis of faecal pollution patterns over 1 year at three selected sites. In this way, a comprehensive faecal pollution map of the total length of the Danube was created, combining substantiated information on both the extent and origin of microbial faecal pollution. Within the environmental data matrix for the river, microbial faecal pollution constituted an independent component and did not cluster with any other measured environmental parameters. Generally, midstream samples representatively depicted the microbial pollution levels at the respective river sites. However, at a few, somewhat unexpected sites, high pollution levels occurred in the lateral zones of the river while the midstream zone had good water quality. Human faecal pollution was demonstrated as the primary pollution source along the whole river, while animal faecal pollution was of minor importance. This study demonstrates that the application of host-associated genetic microbial source tracking markers in concert with the traditional concept of microbial faecal pollution monitoring based on SFIB significantly enhances the knowledge of the extent and origin of microbial faecal pollution patterns in large rivers. It constitutes a powerful tool to guide target-oriented water quality management in large river basins. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Butler, MJ; Dolan, TW				Butler, Mark J.; Dolan, Thomas W., III			Potential Impacts of Everglades Restoration on Lobster and Hard Bottom Communities in the Florida Keys, FL (USA)	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) is intended to restore the Everglades ecosystem (FL, USA) by altering its hydrology, with likely consequences for "downstream" estuarine and marine communities in Florida Bay and the Florida Keys. Spiny lobsters (Panulirus argus) are among several species of special concern with respect to CERP because they are of economic and ecological importance and because their nursery habitat may be impacted. We used agent-based, spatially explicit modeling to evaluate the possible impacts of changing water quality (temperature, salinity, harmful algal blooms (HABs)) on spiny lobsters and sponges, the latter of which provide shelter for juvenile lobsters. In our simulations, lobster abundance declined 6-24% in scenarios where salinity either decreased alone or in combination with HABs that kill sponges and are associated with changing water quality. The most severe decline in lobsters occurred when salinity was lowest and HABs occurred annually. One third of this decline was attributable to decreased salinity that increased lobster mortality and movement. However, the greatest impacts on lobsters were indirect. CERP-associated changes in salinity along with HABs caused a die-off of large sponges, resulting in higher predatory mortality on lobsters that depend on sponges for shelter in hard bottom nursery habitats. Sponges declined by similar to 50% in simulations with HABs, whereas decreased salinity alone led to sponge mortality of 9-18%. In contrast, higher temperatures increased juvenile lobster growth and eventual recruitment by approximately 7%. Our results suggest that returning Florida Bay to more estuarine, pre-development conditions is likely to result in an ecosystem reversal that is detrimental to stenohaline marine taxa, a scenario with significant socioeconomic implications.																	1559-2723	1559-2731				NOV	2017	40	6					1523	1539		10.1007/s12237-017-0256-8								WOS:000411505400001

Interactive Effects of Physical and Biogeochemical Feedback Processes in a Large Submersed Plant Bed	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Submersed plants are sensitive to nutrient loading because excess algal growth creates light-limiting conditions. However, submersed plant beds can also modify nutrient cycling through feedback loops whereby algal growth is limited and plant growth is enhanced. Whereas most studies on the effect of submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV) beds on nutrient cycling concentrate on either biogeochemical or physical controlling mechanisms, we use a holistic approach that analyzes how these processes interact. We measured a suite of physical and biological processes in a large SAV bed and developed a simple, 1-dimensional reactive transport model to investigate the mechanisms underlying SAV bed effects on nutrient cycling. We observed lower water column concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus (DIN and DIP) inside relative to outside the SAV bed during the summer. Sediment denitrification (mean N-2-N flux in August = 46 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)) and plant nutrient assimilation (August rates = 385 mu mol N and 25 mu mol P m(-2) h(-1)) were mechanisms of nutrient removal. We also found that the physical structure of the bed decreased advection and tidal dispersion, resulting in increased water residence time that enhanced biologically mediated nutrient loss. These processes create conditions that enable SAV to outcompete other primary producers, as water column nutrient concentrations were low enough to limit algal growth and associated light attenuation, while sediment pore water concentrations were sufficient to satisfy SAV nutrient demand. These findings suggest that interactions between physical and biological feedback processes in SAV beds can play a key role in structuring shallow aquatic ecosystems.

Addressing industrial structure upgrading and spatial optimization based on water environment carrying capacity has become an urgent issue. This paper establishes an analytical framework that uses a combination of economic and water environment information for industrial structure upgrading and spatial optimization based on water environment carrying capacity. This framework promotes the practical application of water environment carrying capacity theory for socio-ecological sustainability. The input-output table, information entropy method and a simulation platform of water environment carrying capacity using a multi-agent system are integrated into the analytical framework. A spatial assessment of the water environment carrying capacity, industrial structure upgrading and spatial optimization is performed for Changzhou, China. With the measures implementation of industrial structure upgrading and spatial optimization, the economic scale of the electrical equipment and machinery industry, which is the most important industry in Changzhou City, would reach 126,814.68 billion yuan, nearly 73 times its current value. In addition, the total local industrial economy would reach 3319.81 billion yuan, nearly 1.6 times its current scale. Due to the industrial concentration, the increased economic scale would create additional benefits, including the whole study region reaching the water quality goal and the water quality in urban areas significantly improving. The measures of industrial structure upgrading and spatial optimization would help to achieve a mutually beneficial balance between environmental protection and economic development. The analytical framework establishes the internal link between industrial structure upgrading and spatial optimization based on the water environment carrying capacity. The links from water quality to industrial structure upgrading and spatial optimization are also established. These connections could support the fine-scale management of water environments and could help local governments to plan sustainable socio-ecologic development. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Using housing transactions data and exploiting variation in placement and design, we examine the capitalization of stormwater retention basins, a common green infrastructure project in suburban housing developments. Results show adjacency causes decreases in housing prices between 13 and 14% for the average home. Additionally this negative effect exacerbates with basin age.

A case study in the Fitzroy Basin	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The decline in health of the Great Barrier Reef and the pressure on allocating funds efficiently has increased efforts to prioritise where public funds are invested. The Fitzroy basin and coastal catchments is 152,000 square kilometres and geographically diverse. Past work has identified that sediment loads leaving the catchment are posing a high risk to the ongoing health of the Reef and that there is a need to prioritise funds to achieve cost effective outcomes. In this paper we aim to present an alternative approach to effective prioritisation of sediment reductions. The approach integrates spatial information regarding the sediment source and process, levels of adoption, bare ground cover, and cost into a function to rank neighbourhood catchments. The results demonstrate the complexity of the issue and the challenge the Fitzroy Basin Association faces when allocating funds. They also illustrate that there are effective opportunities in particular priority areas within the catchment in which on-ground actions could be undertaken, proving it to be a useful approach in prioritising future investments aimed at achieving cost effective sediment reductions to the Reef.

Use of spatially distributed time-integrated sediment sampling networks and distributed fine sediment modelling to inform catchment management	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Under the EU Water Framework Directive, suspended sediment is omitted from environmental quality standards and compliance targets. This omission is partly explained by difficulties in assessing the complex dose-response of ecological communities. But equally, it is hindered by a lack of spatially distributed estimates of suspended sediment variability across catchments. In this paper, we demonstrate the inability of traditional, discrete sampling campaigns for assessing exposure to fine sediment. Sampling frequencies based on Environmental Quality Standard protocols, whilst reflecting typical manual sampling constraints, are unable to determine the magnitude of sediment exposure with an acceptable level of precision. Deviations from actual concentrations range between -35 and +20% based on the interquartile range of simulations. As an alternative, we assess the value of low-cost,, suspended sediment sampling networks for quantifying suspended sediment transfer (SST). In this study of the 362 km(2) upland Esk catchment we observe that spatial patterns of sediment flux are consistent over the two year monitoring period across a network of 17 monitoring sites. This enables the key contributing sub-catchments of Butter Beck (SST: 1141 t km(2) yr(-1)) and Glaisdale Beck (SST: 841 t km(2) yr(-1)) to be identified. The time -integrated samplers offer a feasible alternative to traditional infrequent and discrete sampling approaches for assessing spatio-temporal changes in contamination. In conjunction with a spatially distributed diffuse pollution model (SCIMAP), time-integrated sediment sampling is an effective means of identifying critical sediment source areas in the catchment, which can better inform sediment management strategies for pollution prevention and control.

This study is an attempt to estimate the daily patterns of nutrients transport in the catchment reservoir systems through the application of the ensemble of complementary models SWAT-SALMO. SWAT quantifies flow, nitrate and phosphate loadings originating in catchments before entering downstream reservoirs meanwhile SALMO determines phosphate, nitrate, and chlorophyll-a concentrations within the reservoirs. The study applies to the semi-arid Millbrook catchment-reservoir system that supplies drinking water to north-eastern suburbs of Adelaide, South Australia. The catchment hosts viti-and horticultural land uses. The warm-monomictic, mesotrophic reservoir is artificially aerated in summer. After validating the simulation results for both Millbrook catchment and reservoir, a comprehensive scenario analysis has been conducted to reveal cascading effects of altered management practices, land uses and climate conditions on water quality in the reservoir. Results suggest that the effect on reservoir condition in summer would be severe, most likely resulting in chlorophyll-a concentrations of greater than 40 mu g/l if the artificial destratification was not applied from early summer. A 50% curbing of water diversion from an external pipeline to the catchment will slightly limit chlorophyll-a concentrations by 1.22% as an effect of reduced inflow phosphate loads. The simulation of prospective land use scenarios converting 50% of present pasture in the Millbrook catchment into residential and orchards areas indicates an increase of summer chlorophyll-a concentrations by 9.5-107.9%, respectively in the reservoir. Global warming scenarios based on the high emission simulated by SWAT-SALMO did result in earlier growth of chlorophyll-a but overall the effects on water quality in the Millbrook reservoir was not significant. However scenarios combining global warming and land use changes resulted in significant eutrophication effects in the reservoir, especially in the unmanaged condition with stratification in summer. This study has demonstrated that complementary model ensembles like SWAT SALMO allow to comprehend more realistically cascading effects of distinct catchment processes on internal reservoir's processes, and facilitate integrated management scenarios.

Previous research has estimated the influence of TCC on the outflow temperature, but its effect on the thermal structure of a reservoir area is unknown, which is crucial to the reservoir ecology. For this purpose, taking the Sanbanxi Reservoir as a case study, a 2-D hydrodynamic and temperature model covering the whole reservoir was built and calibrated to simulate the flow and temperature fields under different TCC scenarios, and the change rules of thermal stability and outflow temperature are obtained. When the water-retaining proportion (P-r) of bottom TCC increases, the temperature difference between inflow and outflow monotonously decreases, while the thermal stability first increases and later decreases. The maximum thermal stability exists at P-r = 62.5%; it goes against water quality improvement and should be avoided in practice. A bottom-TCC with P-r > 80% is practical for deep reservoirs such as Sanbanxi Reservoir to decrease the temperature difference between inflow and outflow without the increase of thermal stability. In terms of top-TCC, as P-r increases, the temperature difference between inflow and outflow monotonously increases and thermal stability decreases. The top-TCCs are recommended when a smaller thermal stability is more preferentially considered than outflow temperature, or a cool outflow in the summer is required for downstream coldwater fishes. In addition, the TCC cannot decrease or increase the outflow temperature all of the time throughout the whole year, and it primarily changes the phase and variation range of the outflow temperature. This study quantitatively estimates the potential effect of TCCs on the thermal structure and water environment management and provides a theoretical basis for the application of TCC.

J	McAndrew, B; Ahn, C				McAndrew, Brendan; Ahn, Changwoo			Developing an ecosystem model of a floating wetland for water quality improvement on a stormwater pond	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												An ecosystem model was developed to assist with designing and implementing a floating wetland (FW) for water quality management of urban stormwater ponds, focusing on nitrogen (N) removal. The model is comprised of three linked submodels: hydrology, plant growth, and nitrogen. The model was calibrated with the data that resulted from a FW constructed and implemented as part of an interdisciplinary pedagogical project on a university campus, titled "The Rain Project", which raised awareness of stormwater issues while investigating the potential application of green infrastructure for sustainable stormwater management. The FW had been deployed during the summer of 2015 (i.e., May through mid September) on a major stormwater pond located at the center of the Fairfax Campus of George Mason University near Washington, D.C. We used the model to explore the impact of three design elements of FW (i.e., hydraulic residence time (HRT), surface area coverage, and primary productivity) on the function of FW. Model simulations showed enhanced N removal performance as HRT and surface area coverage increased. The relatively low macrophyte productivity observed indicates that, in the case of our pond and FW, N removal was very limited. The model results suggest that even full pond surface coverage would result in meager N removal (similar to 6%) at a HRT of one week. A FW with higher plant productivity, more representative of that reported in the literature, would require only 10% coverage to achieve similar N removal efficiency (similar to 7%). Therefore, macrophyte productivity appears to have a greater impact on FW performance on N removal than surface area coverage or pond HRT. The outcome of the study shows that this model, though limited in scope, may be useful in aiding the design of FW to augment the performance of degraded stormwater ponds in an effort to meet local water quality goals.

Unconventional gas development facilitates plant invasions	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Vegetation removal and soil disturbance from natural resource development, combined with invasive plant propagule pressure, can increase vulnerability to plant invasions. Unconventional oil and gas development produces surface disturbance by way of well pad, road, and pipeline construction, and increased traffic. Little is known about the resulting impacts on plant community assembly, including the spread of invasive plants. Our work was conducted in Pennsylvania forests that overlay the Marcellus and Utica shale formations to determine if invasive plants have spread to edge habitat created by unconventional gas development and to investigate factors associated with their presence. A piecewise structural equation model was used to determine the direct and indirect factors associated with invasive plant establishment on well pads. The model included the following measured or calculated variables: current propagule pressure on local access roads, the spatial extent of the pre-development road network (potential source of invasive propagules), the number of wells per pad (indicator of traffic density), and pad age. Sixty-one percent of the 127 well pads surveyed had at least one invasive plant species present. Invasive plant presence on well pads was positively correlated with local propagule pressure on access roads and indirectly with road density pre-development, the number of wells, and age of the well pad. The vast reserves of unconventional oil and gas are in the early stages of development in the US. Continued development of this underground resource must be paired with careful monitoring and management of surface ecological impacts, including the spread of invasive plants. Prioritizing invasive plant monitoring in unconventional oil and gas development areas with existing roads and multi-well pads could improve early detection and control of invasive plants.

J	El Din, ES; Zhang, Y				El Din, Essam Sharaf; Zhang, Yun			Estimation of both optical and nonoptical surface water quality parameters using Landsat 8 OLI imagery and statistical techniques	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING												Traditional surface water quality assessment is costly, labor intensive, and time consuming; however, remote sensing has the potential to assess surface water quality because of its spatiotemporal consistency. Therefore, estimating concentrations of surface water quality parameters (SWQPs) from satellite imagery is essential. Remote sensing estimation of nonoptical SWQPs, such as chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and dissolved oxygen (DO), has not yet been performed because they are less likely to affect signals measured by satellite sensors. However, concentrations of nonoptical variables may be correlated with optical variables, such as turbidity and total suspended sediments, which do affect the reflected radiation. In this context, an indirect relationship between satellite multispectral data and COD, BOD, and DO can be assumed. Therefore, this research attempts to develop an integrated Landsat 8 band ratios and stepwise regression to estimate concentrations of both optical and nonoptical SWQPs. Compared with previous studies, a significant correlation between Landsat 8 surface reflectance and concentrations of SWQPs was achieved and the obtained coefficient of determination (R-2) > 0.85. These findings demonstrated the possibility of using our technique to develop models to estimate concentrations of SWQPs and to generate spatiotemporal maps of SWQPs from Landsat 8 imagery.

Susceptibility of Goethite to Fe2+-Catalyzed Recrystallization over Time	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Recent work has shown that iron oxides, such as goethite and hematite, may recrystallize in the presence of aqueous Fe2+ under anoxic conditions. This process, referred to as Fe2+-catalyzed recrystallization, can influence water quality by causing the incorporation/release of environmental contaminants and biological nutrients. Accounting for the effects of Fe2+-catalyzed recrystallization on water quality requires knowing the time scale over which recrystallization occurs. Here, we tested the hypothesis that nanoparticulate goethite becomes less susceptible to Fe2+-catalyzed recrystallization over time. We set up two batches of reactors in which Fe-55(2+) tracer was added at two different time points and tracked the Fe-55 partitioning in the aqueous and goethite phases over 60 days. Less Fe-55 uptake occurred between 30 and 60 days than between 0 and 30 days, suggesting goethite recrystallization slowed with time. Fitting the data with a box model indicated that 17% of the goethite recrystallized after 30 days of reaction, and an additional 2% recrystallized between 30 and 60 days. The decreasing susceptibility of goethite to recrystallize as it reacted with aqueous Fe2+ suggested that recrystallization is likely only an important process over short time scales.

Acid Rock Drainage Treatment Using Membrane Distillation: Impacts of Chemical-Free Pretreatment on Scale Formation, Pore Wetting, and Product Water Quality	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Acid rock drainage (ARD) is a metal-rich wastewater that forms upon oxidation of sulfidic minerals. Although ARD impacts >12,000 miles of rivers in the U.S. and has an estimated cleanup cost of $32-$72 billion, the low pH and high metal concentrations in ARD make rapid, high volume treatment without chemical addition difficult. This research focuses on a novel method of ARD treatment, membrane distillation (MD). In MD, heated ARD is separated from a cooled distillate by a hydrophobic, water-excluding membrane. Because water only passes through the membrane in the vapor phase, nonvolatile sulfate and heavy metals are retained in the concentrate stream. A preliminary in silico analysis using an electrolyte thermodynamic model indicated that MD of 10 different mine wastes yields product water containing no contaminants at concentrations >0.2 ppm. MD tests of synthetic ARD used a similar to 34 degrees C temperature difference, operated at 80% recovery, and produced an initial flux of 38.4 +/- 1.1 L.m(-2).h(-1). This flux decreased slightly after scaling by iron oxyhydroxide; however, membranes maintained >99% dissolved solids rejection. Both flux decline and membrane scale formation decreased after a chemical-free, thermal precipitation pretreatment. These results indicate that MD can purify contaminated, acidic wastewater using low-grade heat sources, such as geothermal energy, without chemical addition.

Distribution System Operational Deficiencies Coincide with Reported Legionnaires' Disease Clusters in Flint, Michigan	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												We hypothesize that the increase in reported Legionnaires disease from June 2014 to November 2015 in Genesee County, MI (where Flint is located) was directly linked to the switch to corrosive Flint River water from noncorrosive Detroit water from April 2014 to October 2015. To address the lack of epidemiological data linking the drinking water supplies to disease incidence, we gathered physiochemical and biological water quality data from 2010 to 2016 to evaluate characteristics of the Flint River water that were potentially conducive to Legionella growth. The treated Flint River water was 8.6 times more corrosive than Detroit water in short-term testing, releasing more iron, which is a key Legionella nutrient, while also directly causing disinfectant to decay more rapidly. The Flint River water source was also 0.8-6.7 degrees C warmer in summer months than Detroit water and exceeded the minimum Legionella growth temperature of 20 degrees C more frequently (average number of days per year for Detroit was 63 versus that for the Flint River, which was 157). The corrosive water also led to 1.3-2.2 times more water main breaks in 2014-2015 compared to 2010-2013; such disruptions have been associated with outbreaks in other locales. Importantly, Legionella spp. and Legionella pneumophila decreased after switching back to Detroit water, in terms of both gene markers and culturability, when August and October 2015 were compared to November 2016.

We tracked changes in metal content in the seagrass Posidonia oceanica, along the NW Mediterranean from 2003 to 2010. While Cu, Cd and Ni showed a large inter-site variation, likely due to local factors, Fe, Mn and Pb showed little local variation and synchronous interannual variability across sites, most likely due to large-scale sources. Zn showed equal importance of local and large-scale sources of variation. Temporal trends of Ni, Zn, Cd, Cu remained almost stable. In contrast, Fe, Mn and Pb slightly increased in the last decade. These trends suggest that metals like Cu, Cd, Ni can be effectively managed at local scale. Whereas, elements like Fe, Mn and Pb have an important large-scale component that needs to be managed across the frontiers of national jurisdictions.

The conversion of natural land-covers into human land uses were detected for protected and unprotected coastal stretches highlighting that the only establishment of a protected area is not enough to stem undesirable land-use outcomes. A survey analysis was also conducted to assess attitudes of beach users and to evaluate their perception of natural habitats, beach and coastal water quality, and coastal dynamic over time. The results of 2071 questionnaires showed that there is similarity between subjective and objective data.

Waters quality of the Arapiranga and Murucupi rivers were regular to good and bad to good, respectively. Anthropogenic influence on the Murucupi River was higher, mainly by the disposal of domestic effluents from the urban agglomerate and of the industrial waste tailing basins upstream of this river. Due to its less inhabited environment and further away from the area urban and industrial, the Arapiranga River was more preserved.

We conducted dilute-acid extractions and standard elutriate tests to investigate the potential of this exploitation to (1) create a new seafloor with elevated trace metal content, (2) mobilise trace metals during iron sand extraction and, (3) enrich the returning process seawater, which feeds iron sand through mills, with trace metals. We found that recruits of freshly uncovered sediment may encounter higher-than-natural concentrations of cadmium, nickel and chromium (but not of copper, lead, and zinc) and propose to investigate the bioavailability of these metals. Elutriate test with raw and milled iron sand revealed that, for nickel and copper, dilution of the process seawater may be required to meet the local water quality guideline. We argue that this dilution can be achieved by adjustment of the mass and seawater balance of the offshore extraction process.

In this study, the Bay of Izmir (in the eastern Aegean Sea), which is a critical area because of its relationship with marine transportation and industrial and commercial activities, was evaluated for its microbiological and physicochemical parameters through a monitoring program. The data were obtained from seasonally assembled surface seawater samples from 2015 to 2017 at 23 sampling stations. Bacteriological investigations were performed by membrane filtration technique. During the monitoring period, for stations at the inner and middle-outer part, it was found that the inner part is exposed to more number of fecal coliforms (8.8 x 10(2) cfu/100 mL) and fecal streptococci (1.1 x 10(3) cfu/100 mL). The monitoring analysis performed in this study showed that there was negative correlation between physicochemical parameters and the level of fecal bacteria, but no significance was recorded by the Pearson correlation test. Fecal contamination parameters should be routinely monitored for improving the environmental conditions of coastal cities.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				OCT 15	2017	123	1-2					400	403		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.08.052								WOS:000415776600059	28863975

In the ZHZ, NaP1 zeolite was covered with hydrous zirconia, which existed as an amorphous phase. Experimental results in pond water indicated that ZHZ could efficiently remove soluble reactive phosphorus. The 28-day sediment incubation experiments showed that capping sediment with ZHZ resulted in a more efficient, rapid and sustained decrease in P concentration when compared with the traditional alum treatment method. Furthermore, ZHZ increased the sediment stability, resulting in. the lowest turbidity, total phosphorus and soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations in overlying water following artificially induced resuspension of sediment. Phosphorus fractionation of sediment showed that the dominant P form transferred from HCl-extractable P to residual P, and the most release-sensitive P (labile P and reductant reactive P) was decreased after ZHZ application. Overall, ZHZ is a highly effective P-immobilization material. ZHZ has high potential as a sediment capping material to control internal P loading in eutrophic water bodies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Chappell, NA; Jones, TD; Tych, W				Chappell, Nick A.; Jones, Timothy D.; Tych, Wlodek			Sampling frequency for water quality variables in streams: Systems analysis to quantify minimum monitoring rates	WATER RESEARCH												Insufficient temporal monitoring of water quality in streams or engineered drains alters the apparent shape of storm chemographs, resulting in shifted model parameterisations and changed interpretations of solute sources that have produced episodes of poor water quality. This so-called 'aliasing' phenomenon is poorly recognised in water research. Using advances in in-situ sensor technology it is now possible to monitor sufficiently frequently to avoid the onset of aliasing. A systems modelling procedure is presented allowing objective identification of sampling rates needed to avoid aliasing within strongly rainfall-driven chemical dynamics. In this study aliasing of storm chemograph shapes was quantified by changes in the time constant parameter (TC) of transfer functions. As a proportion of the original TC, the onset of aliasing varied between watersheds, ranging from 3.9-7.7 to 54-79 %TC (or 110-160 to 300 -600 min). However, a minimum monitoring rate could be identified for all datasets if the modelling results were presented in the form of a new statistic, Delta TC. For the eight H+, DOC and NO3-N datasets examined from a range of watershed settings, an empirically-derived threshold of 1.3(Delta TC) could be used to quantify minimum monitoring rates within sampling protocols to avoid artefacts in subsequent data analysis.

Design of waste stabilization pond systems: A review	WATER RESEARCH												A better design instruction for waste stabilization ponds is needed due to their growing application for wastewater purification, increasingly strict environmental regulations, and the fact that most of previous design manuals are outdated. To critically review model-based designs of typical pond treatment systems, this paper analyzed more than 150 articles, books, and reports from 1956 to 2016. The models developed in these publications ranged from simple rules and equations to more complex first-order and mechanistic models. From a case study on all four approaches, it appeared that rules of thumb is no longer a proper tool for pond designs due to its low design specification and very high output variability and uncertainty. On the other hand, at the beginning phase of design process or in case of low pressure over land and moderate water quality required, regression equations can be useful to form an idea for pond dimensions. More importantly, mechanistic models proved their capacity of generating more precise and comprehensive designs but still need to overcome their lack of calibration and validation, and overparameterization. In another case study, an essential but often overlooked role of uncertainty analysis in pond designs was investigated via a comparison between deterministic and uncertainty based approaches. Unlike applying a safety factor representing all uncertainty sources, probabilistic designs quantify the uncertainty of model outputs by including prior uncertainty of inputs and parameters, which generates more scientifically reliable outcomes for decision makers. Based on these findings, we advise engineers and designers to shift from the conventional approaches to more innovative and economic tools which are suitable for dealing with large variations of natural biological systems.

Effective removal of phosphate from aqueous solution using humic acid coated magnetite nanoparticles	WATER RESEARCH												Effective removal of excess phosphate from water is critical to counteract eutrophication and restore water quality. In this study, low cost, environmentally friendly humic acid coated magnetite nano particles (HA-MNP) were synthesized and applied for the remediation of phosphate from aqueous media. The HA-MNPs, characterized by FTIR, TEM and HAADF-STEM showed the extensive coating of humic acid on the magnetite surface. The magnetic nanoparticles with diameters of 7-12 nm could be easily separated from the reaction mixture by using a simple hand held magnet. Adsorption studies demonstrate the fast and effective separation of phosphate with maximum adsorption capacity of 28.9 mg/g at pH 6.6. The adsorption behavior follows the Freundlich isotherm suggesting the formation of nonuniform multilayers of phosphate on the heterogeneous surface of HA-MNP. The adsorption kinetic fits the pseudo-second order model well with rate constants of 0.206 +/- 0.003, 0.073 +/- 0.002 and 0.061 +/- 0.003 g mg(-1) min(-1) for phosphate (P) concentrations of 2, 5 and 10 mg/L respectively. The removal of phosphate was found higher at acidic and neutral pH compared to basic conditions. The nanoparticles exhibit good selectivity and adsorption efficiency for phosphate in presence of co-existing ions such as Cl-, SO42- and NO3- with some inhibition effect by CO32-. The effect of temperature on the adsorption reveals that the process is endothermic and spontaneous. HA-MNPs are promising, simple, environmentally friendly materials for the removal of phosphate from aqueous media. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This study generated microcosms that mimicked riverbank sediment resuspension into the water of a typical Mediterranean river as a consequence of heavy rainfall. The mobilization and inactivation of six fecal pollution indicators and microbial source tracking markers were evaluated. The T-90 values in the sediments were: 4 days for sorbitol-fermenting Bifidobacterium, 11 days for culturable E. coli, 36 days for bacteriophages infecting Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron strain GA17 and more than 42 days for qPCR-detected E. coli, somatic coliphages and sulfite-reducing clostridia spores. Bacteriophages and bacteria showed different resuspension and sedimentation patterns. The data obtained could be used in predictive models to assess the effects of climate change on surface water quality. Pathogen mobilization into the water column poses a risk for humans, animals and the natural environment, and breaches the One Health approach. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Development of a bioanalytical test battery for water quality monitoring: Fingerprinting identified micropollutants and their Contribution to effects in surface water	WATER RESEARCH												Surface waters can contain a diverse range of organic pollutants, including pesticides, pharmaceuticals and industrial compounds. While bioassays have been used for water quality monitoring, there is limited knowledge regarding the effects of individual micropollutants and their relationship to the overall mixture effect in water samples. In this study, a battery of in vitro bioassays based on human and fish cell lines and whole organism assays using bacteria, algae, daphnids and fish embryos was assembled for use in water quality monitoring. The selection of bioassays was guided by the principles of adverse outcome pathways in order to cover relevant steps in toxicity pathways known to be triggered by environmental water samples. The effects of 34 water pollutants, which were selected based on hazard quotients, available environmental quality standards and mode of action information, were fingerprinted in the bioassay test battery. There was a relatively good agreement between the experimental results and available literature effect data. The majority of the chemicals were active in the assays indicative of apical effects, while fewer chemicals had a response in the specific reporter gene assays, but these effects were typically triggered at lower concentrations. The single chemical effect data were used to improve published mixture toxicity modeling of water samples from the Danube River. While there was a slight increase in the fraction of the bioanalytical equivalents explained for the Danube River samples, for some endpoints less than 1% of the observed effect could be explained by the studied chemicals. The new mixture models essentially confirmed previous findings from many studies monitoring water quality using both chemical analysis and bioanalytical tools. In short, our results indicate that many more chemicals contribute to the biological effect than those that are typically quantified by chemical monitoring programs or those regulated by environmental quality standards. This study not only demonstrates the utility of fingerprinting single chemicals for an improved understanding of the biological effect of pollutants, but also highlights the need to apply bioassays for water quality monitoring in order to prevent underestimation of the overall biological effect.

An experimental study on the influence of water stagnation and temperature change on water quality in a full-scale domestic drinking water system	WATER RESEARCH												The drinking water quality changes during the transport through distribution systems. Domestic drinking water systems (DDWSs), which include the plumbing between the water meter and consumer's taps, are the most critical points in which water quality may be affected. In distribution networks, the drinking water temperature and water residence time are regarded as indicators of the drinking water quality. This paper describes an experimental research on the influence of stagnation time and temperature change on drinking water quality in a full-scale DDWS. Two sets of stagnation experiments, during winter and summer months, with various stagnation intervals (up to 168 h of stagnation) were carried out. Water and biofilms were sampled at two different taps, a kitchen and a shower tap. Results from this study indicate that temperature and water stagnation affect both chemical and microbial quality in DDWSs, whereas microbial parameters in stagnant water appear to be driven by the temperature of fresh water. Biofilm formed in the shower pipe contained more total and intact cells than the kitchen pipe biofilm. Alphaproteobacteria were found to dominate in the shower biofilm (78% of all Proteobacteria), while in the kitchen tap biofilm Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria were evenly distributed.

Modelling the transport and decay processes of microbial tracers in a macro-tidal estuary	WATER RESEARCH												The Loughor Estuary is a macro-tidal coastal basin, located along the Bristol Channel, in the South West of the U.K. The maximum spring tidal range in the estuary is up to 7.5 m, near Burry Port Harbour. This estuarine region can experience severe coastal flooding during high spring tides, including extreme flooding of the intertidal saltmarshes at Llanrhidian, as well as the lower industrial and residential areas at Llanelli and Gowerton. The water quality of this estuarine basin needs to comply with the designated standards for safe recreational bathing and shellfish harvesting industries. The waterbody however, potentially receives overloading of bacterial inputs that enter the estuarine system from both point and diffuse sources. Therefore, a microbial tracer study was carried out to get a better understanding of the faecal bacteria sources and to enable a hydro-environmental model to be refined and calibrated for both advection and dispersion transport. A two-dimensional hydro-environmental model has been refined and extended to predict the highest water level covering the intertidal floodplains of the Loughor Estuary. The validated hydrodynamic model for both water levels and currents, was included with the injected mass of microbial tracer, i.e. MS2 coliphage from upstream of the estuary, and modelled as a non-conservative tracer over several tidal cycles through the system. The calibration and validation of the transport and decay of microbial tracer was undertaken, by comparing the model results and the measured data at two different sampling locations. The refined model developed as a part of this study, was used to acquire a better understanding of the water quality processes and the potential sources of bacterial pollution in the estuary.

Health risks from exposure to untreated wastewater used for irrigation in the Mezquital Valley, Mexico: A 25-year update	WATER RESEARCH												Wastewater reuse for agriculture is common worldwide; wastewater treatment, however, is rare in many countries, leading to high potential for exposure to harmful pathogens. Mexico City, one of the largest producers of untreated wastewater for agricultural use worldwide, was the site of key epidemiologic studies conducted in the 1990s. We both reviewed the literature on and conducted a cross-sectional study of diarrheal risk and wastewater contamination to provide an updated assessment of health risks and to inform an upcoming update of the 2006 WHO guidelines on wastewater reuse. We surveyed communities in the Mezquital Valley that use wastewater for irrigation and communities that use well water to compare the prevalence of self-reported diarrheal disease in children under five years old. Wastewater, well water, household environmental samples, and stool samples were collected and analyzed. Communities exposed to wastewater had a higher one-week prevalence of diarrhea (10%) compared to unexposed communities (5%). This association remained in an adjusted modified Poisson regression model (PR = 2.31, 95% CI 1.00, 531), but not when limited to households engaged in agriculture. Water quality indicators document differences between irrigation water from the two community groups. These results are in agreement with 25 population studies identified by our review that were conducted since or not included in the 2006 WHO guidelines and show consistent negative impacts of wastewater exposure on health. While overall diarrheal prevalence has declined when compared to studies conducted over 25 years ago in the same region, the association of diarrheal disease and wastewater exposure has remained and possibly increased. With rising urbanization worldwide, attention to these risks and wastewater treatment is becoming increasingly important. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The use of reclaimed municipal wastewater for this purpose was demonstrated by numerous studies and full-scale installations. On the other hand, reuse of industrial effluents in irrigation is uncommon and the knowledge in this field is limited. This work aims at assessing the suitability of agro-industrial effluent reuse for irrigation. In the case study presented, a full-scale tertiary treatment based on membrane ultrafiltration and UV disinfection was tested at an agro-industrial site in Apulia (Italy). The wastewater treatment plant processed the stream produced at a vegetable canning factory, and the treated effluents were used for field scale irrigation tests. The variability of wastewater quality and its effects on treatment process performances and reclaimed water quality were investigated. An economic evaluation of the full scale tertiary treatment was also performed. The results showed that the adopted technologies effectively removed suspended solids and the faecal indicator Escherichia coli below the local standards for reuse in irrigation. Furthermore, the use of treated agro-industrial wastewater had no inhibitory effects on the growth of tomato and broccoli, neither resulted in any faecal contamination of crops. In general, the present study shows that reuse of treated wastewater for irrigation is a suitable practice to close the water cycle in the agro-industrial sector. This is very important in areas where the sustainability of agriculture and transformation activities depends on the water available for irrigation. This practice also avoids the discharge of pollutants into water bodies, reducing the environmental impacts of agro-industrial productions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In storage ecosystems, the natural process of solar light irradiation plays a key role in water quality, altering disinfection byproduct formation potential in later use. This study investigated changes in haloacetamide formation potential (HAcAm FP) during subsequent chloramination when reclaimed water was exposed to solar light irradiation. Significant decreases in HAcAm FP were observed for the solar light irradiated reclaimed water, with reductions of 27%-69% for different haloacetamides. Moreover, transformation of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) to inorganic nitrogen occurred during irradiation. The application of N-15-labeled monochloramine indicated that the nitrogen source of the decreased HAcAms mainly originated from DON, rather than chloramine. Chloramination of the model compound L-asparagine after irradiation demonstrated that the decreased HAcAms could be attributed to the decrease in DON. After solar light irradiation, the brominated HAcAm FP in the presence of bromide was also reduced, while the bromine incorporation factor remained steady. Overall, this study revealed the contribution of natural processes in controlling HAcAm FP during subsequent chloramination, suggesting solar light irradiation is important to water purification during reclaimed water storage.

The utility of fingernail clippings as a biomarker for F- exposure and EF was also assessed for the first time in a high-F- region. The study recorded the EF status of 386 individuals (10 to 50 years old), who consume naturally contaminated groundwater with widely varying F- concentration (0.615 mg/L). The mean F- concentrations among residents of communities with primary reliance on groundwater were 5.1 mg/kg (range: 0.534 mg/kg) in fingernails and 8.9 mg/L (range: 0.4434 mg/L) in urine. We show strong positive correlations between F- in drinking water and 12-hour urinary excretion (r = 0.74, p < 0.001, n = 287), fingernail F- content (r = 0.6, p < 0.001, n = 258), and mean individual measures of EF severity as measured using the Thylstrup and Fejerskov (TF) Index (r = 0.42, p < 0.001, n = 316). The data indicate that both fingernail and urine measures are good biomarkers for F- exposure and EF outcomes, the latter being slightly more sensitive. Cases of moderate/severe EF were significantly more common among younger subjects (10 to 15 years old) than older subjects (mostly > 25 years old) (p < 0.001), consistent with their greater exposure to F- during early childhood, which is the only period of life the enamel is at risk of fluorosis. In this younger population, EF may be useful as a biomarker for identifying individuals with other potential health effects that depend on a specific age window of susceptibility. The finding of exceptionally high F(-)concentrations in water, fingernail clippings and urine in this region should motivate further investigations of other potential health consequences such as bone disease and abnormalities in the function of the neurological and endocrine systems.

PPCP residues are frequently detected in drinking water sources, sewage treatment plants (STPs), and water treatment plants (WTPs) due to their universal consumption, low human metabolic capability, and improper disposal. When partially metabolized PPCPs are transferred into STPs, they elicit negative effects on biological treatment processes; therefore, conventional STPs are insufficient when it comes to PPCP removal. Furthermore, the excreted metabolites may become secondary pollutants and can be further modified in receiving water bodies. Several advanced treatment systems, including membrane filtration, granular activated carbon, and advanced oxidation processes, have been used for the effective removal of individual PPCPs. This review covers the occurrence patterns of PPCPs in water environments and the techniques adopted for their treatment in STP/WTP unit processes operating in various countries. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive summary of the removal and fate of PPCPs in different treatment facilities as well as the optimum methods for their elimination in STP and WTP systems.

Temporal characterization of flowback and produced water quality from a hydraulically fractured oil and gas well	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												This study examined water quality, naturally-occurring radioactive materials (NORM), major ions, trace metals, and well flow data for water used and produced from start-up to operation of an oil and gas producing hydraulically- fractured well (horizontal) in the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) Basin in northeastern Colorado. Analysis was conducted on the groundwater used to make the fracturing fluid, the fracturing fluid itself, and nine flowback/ produced water samples over 220 days of operation. The chemical oxygen demand of the wastewater produced during operation decreased from 8200 to 2500 mg/L, while the total dissolved solids (TDS) increased in this same period from 14,200 to roughly 19,000mg/L. NORM, trace metals, and major ion levels were generally correlated with TDS, and were lower than other shale basins (e.g. Marcellus and Bakken). Although at lower levels, the salinity and its origin appear to be the result of a similar mechanism to that of other shale basins when comparing Cl/Br, Na/Br, and Mg/Br ratios. Volumes of returned wastewater were low, with only 3% of the volume injected (11 million liters) returning as flowback by day 15 and 30% returning by day 220. Low levels of TDS indicate a potentially treatment-amenable wastewater, but low volumes of flowback could limit onsite reuse in the DJ Basin. These results offer insight into the temporal water quality changes in the days and months following flowback, along with considerations and implications for water reuse in future hydraulic fracturing or for environmental discharge.

Assessment of the SWAT model to simulate a watershed with limited available data in the Pampas region, Argentina	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Argentina has been among the world leaders in the production and export of agricultural products since the 1990s. The Carcarana River Lower Basin (CRLB), a cropland of the Pampas region supplied by extensive rainfall, is located in an area with few streamgauging and other hydrologic/water-quality stations. Therefore, limited hydrologic data are available resulting in limited water-resources assessment. This work explores the application of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to the CRLB in the Santa Fe province of the Pampas region. The analysis of field and remote-sensing data characterizing hydrology, water quality, soil types, land use/land cover, management practices, and crop yield, guarantee a comprehensive SWAT modeling approach. A combined manual and automated calibration and validation process incorporating sensitivity and uncertainty analysis is performed using information concerning interior watershed processes. Eleven N/P fertilizer rates are selected to simulate the impact of N fertilizer on crop yield, plant uptake, as well as runoff and leaching losses. Different indices (partial factor productivity, agronomic efficiency, apparent crop recovery efficiency of applied nutrient, internal utilization efficiency, and physiological efficiency) are considered to assess nitrogen-use efficiency. The overall quality of the fit is satisfactory considering the input data limitations. This work provides, for the first time in Argentina, a reliable tool to simulate yield response to soil quality and water availability capable to meet defined environmental targets to support decision making on planning public policies and private activities on the Pampas region.

Ecosystem structure refers to characteristics such as channel form, water quality or the composition of biological communities, whereas ecosystem functioning refers to processes such as metabolism, organic matter decomposition or secondary production. Structure and functioning respond in contrasting and complementary ways to environmental stressors. Moreover, assessing the response of ecosystem functioning to stressors is critical to understand the effects on the ecosystem services that produce direct benefits to humans. Yet, there is more information on structural than on functional parameters, and despite the many approaches available to measure river ecosystem processes, structural approaches are more widely used, especially in management. One reason for this discrepancy is the lack of synthetic studies analyzing river ecosystem functioning in a way that is useful for both scientists and managers. Here, we present a synthesis of key river ecosystem processes, which provides a description of the main characteristics of each process, including criteria guiding their measurement as well as their respective sensitivity to stressors. We also discuss the current limitations, potential improvements and future steps that the use of functional measures in rivers needs to face. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

This study aims to evaluate the quality of potable water in Baghdad city. Furthermore, this study compares the quality of tap and bottled water. Baghdad city was divided into 4 districts based on the water source, and 40 water samples were collected from each district. Moreover, the most popular bottled water brands were sampled and compared with the tap water samples. The quality of the analyzed potable water samples varied based on the water source. The total dissolved solid (TDS) levels exceed the palatable (> 600 ppm) water levels in some districts. In addition, the concentration of sulfate was relatively high in both tap and bottled water and ranged from 200 to 330 ppm. The bottled water quality was within the acceptable limits set by the World Health Organization, but the TDS levels were relatively high. The hardness, Cl-, Pb2+, and bacteria contents in both tap and bottled water were within the standard limits. Finally, it is important to conduct radiological analyses in the future to investigate the effect of wars on Iraqi water resources.																	1178-6221					OCT 4	2017	10								UNSP 1178622117733441	10.1177/1178622117733441								WOS:000412217300001

However, environmental fate models developed for traditional contaminants are limited in their ability to simulate nanomaterials' environmental behavior by incomplete understanding and representation of the processes governing nanomaterial distribution in the environment and by scarce empirical data quantifying the interaction of nanomaterials with environmental surfaces. In this study, the well-known Water Quality Analysis Simulation Program (WASP) was updated to incorporate particle collision rate and particle attachment efficiency to simulate multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) fate and transport in surface waters. Heteroaggregation attachment efficiencies (alpha(het)) values derived from sediment attachment studies are used to parametrize WASP for simulation of MWCNTs transport in Brier Creek, a coastal plain river located in central eastern Georgia, and a tributary to the Savannah River. Simulations using a constant MWCNT load of 0.1 kg d(-1) in the uppermost Brier Creek water segment showed that MWCNTs were present predominantly in the Brier Creek water column, while downstream MWCNT surface and deep sediment concentrations exhibited a general increase with time and distance from the source, suggesting that MWCNT releases could have increasing ecological impacts in the benthic region over long time frames.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				OCT 3	2017	51	19					11174	11184		10.1021/acs.est.7b01477								WOS:000412716500029	28876918

Exposure to human-associated fecal indicators and self-reported illness among swimmers at recreational beaches: a cohort study	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH												Background: Fecal indicator bacteria used to assess illness risks in recreational waters (e. g., Escherichia coli, Enterococci) cannot discriminate among pollution sources. To address this limitation, human-associated Bacteroides markers have been proposed, but the risk of illness associated with the presence of these markers in recreational waters is unclear. Our objective was to estimate associations between human-associated Bacteroides markers in water and self-reported illness among swimmers at 6 U. S. beaches spanning 2003-2007. Methods: We used data from a prospectively-enrolled cohort of 12,060 swimmers surveyed about beach activities and water exposure on the day of their beach visit. Ten to twelve days later, participants reported gastroinestinal, diarrheal, and respiratory illnesses experienced since the visit. Daily water samples were analyzed for the presence of human-associated Bacteroides genetic markers: HF183, BsteriF1, BuniF2, HumM2. We used model-based standardization to estimate risk differences (RD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed whether the presence of Bacteroides markers were modifiers of the association between general Enterococcus and illness among swimmers using interaction contrast. Results: Overall we observed inconsistent associations between the presence of Bacteroides markers and illness. There was a pattern of increased risks of gastrointestinal (RD = 1.9%; 95% CI: 0.1%, 3.7%), diarrheal (RD = 1.3%; 95% CI: -0.2%, 2.7%), and respiratory illnesses (RD = 1.1%; 95% CI: -0.2%, 2.5%) associated with BsteriF1. There was no evidence that Bacteroides markers acted as modifiers of Enterococcus and illness. Patterns were similar when stratified by water matrix. Conclusions: Quantitative measures of fecal pollution using Bacteroides, rather than presence-absence indicators, may be necessary to accurately assess human risk specific to the presence of human fecal pollution.

J	Khan, AU; Jiang, JP; Wang, P; Zheng, Y				Khan, Afed U.; Jiang, Jiping; Wang, Peng; Zheng, Yi			Influence of watershed topographic and socio-economic attributes on the climate sensitivity of global river water quality	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Surface waters exhibit regionalization due to various climatic conditions and anthropogenic activities. Here we assess the impact of topographic and socio-economic factors on the climate sensitivity of surface water quality, estimated using an elasticity approach (climate elasticity of water quality (CEWQ)), and identify potential risks of instability in different regions and climatic conditions. Large global datasets were used for 12 main water quality parameters from 43 water quality monitoring stations located at large major rivers. The results demonstrated that precipitation elasticity shows higher sensitivity to topographic and socio-economic determinants as compared to temperature elasticity. In tropical climate class (A), gross domestic product (GDP) played an important role in stabilizing the CEWQ. In temperate climate class (C), GDP played the same role in stability, while the runoff coefficient, slope, and population density fuelled the risk of instability. The results implied that watersheds with lower runoff coefficient, thick population density, over fertilization and manure application face a higher risk of instability. We discuss the socio-economic and topographic factors that cause instability of CEWQ parameters and conclude with some suggestions for watershed managers to bring sustainability in freshwater bodies.																	1748-9326					OCT	2017	12	10							104012	10.1088/1748-9326/aa8a33								WOS:000424304600001

Integrated water resources management (IWRM) institutions and mechanisms offer a good entry point for the uptake and implementation of climate change adaptation measures. This review paper provides an overview about IWRM approaches in the MRB and ongoing processes as well as opportunities to mainstream climate change adaptation into existing basin strategies and water management instruments. The review clearly shows that approaches taken by the Mekong River Commission, the Greater Mekong Subregional Economic Cooperation Program, and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations with respect to water resources management are largely complementary and synergies could be increased to incorporate climate change adaptation into existing schemes. Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) has a great potential in the region as its economy is still largely based on the use of natural resources. Despite this acknowledgment, the inclusion of EbA measures as a sustainable land and water management tool for climate change adaptation is still relatively new in the MRB context. We argue that mainstreaming EbA measures in IWRM-guided basin development planning offers no-regret and flexible solutions and opportunities and allows for action despite the considerable uncertainties decision-makers face.

J	Benson, D; Lorenzoni, I				Benson, David; Lorenzoni, Irene			Climate change adaptation, flood risks and policy coherence in integrated water resources management in England	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE												Integrated water resources management (IWRM) assumes coherence between cognate aspects of water governance at the river basin scale, for example water quality, energy production and agriculture objectives. But critics argue that IWRM is often less 'integrated' in practice, raising concerns over inter-sectoral coherence between implementing institutions. One increasingly significant aspect of IWRM is adaptation to climate change-related risks, including threats from flooding, which are particularly salient in England. Although multiple institutional mechanisms exist for flood risk management (FRM), their coherence remains a critical question for national adaptation. This paper therefore (1) maps the multi-level institutional frameworks determining both IWRM and FRM in England; (2) examines their interaction via various inter-institutional coordinating mechanisms; and (3) assesses the degree of coherence. The analysis suggests that cognate EU strategic objectives for flood risk assessment demonstrate relatively high vertical and horizontal coherence with river basin planning. However, there is less coherence with flood risk requirements for land-use planning and national flood protection objectives. Overall, this complex governance arrangement actually demonstrates de-coherence over time due to ongoing institutional fragmentation. Recommendations for increasing IWRM coherence in England or re-coherence based on greater spatial planning and coordination of water-use and land-use strategies are proposed.																	1436-3798	1436-378X				OCT	2017	17	7					1921	1932		10.1007/s10113-016-0959-6								WOS:000418588400006

J	Malsy, M; Florke, M; Borchardt, D				Malsy, Marcus; Floerke, Martina; Borchardt, Dietrich			What drives the water quality changes in the Selenga Basin: climate change or socio-economic development?	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE												Lake Baikal is the largest near-surface global freshwater source and of high interest for water quality alterations, as deterioration of water quality is a main global and an increasing issue in the Selenga River Basin. Here, the Selenga River Basin as main contributor to the inflow of Lake Baikal is extremely important. Pressure on ecosystems and water resources increased due to population growth, rapid urbanization and rising industrial activities, particularly in the mining sector. In this study, the large-scale water resources model WaterGAP3 is applied to calculate loadings of conservative substances (total dissolved solids) and non-conservative substances (faecal coliform bacteria and biological oxygen demand) in a spatially explicit way as well as in in-stream concentrations to get an insight into the state of water quality under current and future scenario conditions. The results show a strong increase in loadings in the scenario period and consequently increasing concentration levels. Comparing the sectoral contributions of the loadings, domestic and industrial sectors are by far the main contributors today and expected to be in the future. Furthermore, for all modelled substances and time periods, water quality thresholds are exceeded posing a potential risk to aquatic ecosystems and human health.

This is particularly relevant in light of recent and expected future changes involving both the hydrology and water quality in the Lake Baikal basin causing spatiotemporal changes in water flow, morphology, and transport of sediments and metals in the Selenga River delta and thus impacting on delta barrier functions. The central part of the delta had been characterized by sediment storage, especially along the main channels, causing a continuous lift of the delta surface by about 0.75 cm/year(-1). Theses morphological changes have a significant impact on hydrological conditions, with historical shifts in the bulk discharge from the left to the right parts of the delta which is distinguished by a relatively high density of wetlands. Regions with a high density of wetlands and small channels, in contrast to main channel regions, show a consistent pattern of considerable contaminant filtering and removal (between 77 and 99 % for key metals), during both high-flow and low-flow conditions. The removal is associated with a significant concentration increase (2-3 times) of these substances in the bottom sediment. In consequence, geomorphological processes, which govern the partitioning of flow between different channel systems, may therefore directly govern the barrier function of the delta.

Using a replicated BACIPS (Before-After-Control Impact Paired Series) design, we investigated 24 peatlands, all drained for forestry and subsequently restored, and 19 pristine control boreal peatlands with high temporal and spatial resolution data on hydro climate and pore water quality. In drained conditions, total nitrogen (N-tot), total phosphorus(P-tot), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in pore water were several-fold higher than observed at pristine control sites, highlighting the impacts of long-term drainage on pore water quality. In general, pore water DOC and Ntot decreased after restoration measures but still remained significantly higher than at pristine control sites, indicating long time lags in restoration effects. Different peatland classes and trophic levels (vegetation gradient) responded differently to restoration, primarily due to altered hydrology and varying acidity levels. Sites that were hydrologically overrestored (inundated) showed higher P-tot, N-tot, and DOC than well restored or insufficiently restored sites, indicating the need to optimize natural-like hydrological regimes when restoring peatlands drained for forestry. Rich fens (median pH 6.2-6.6) showed lower pore water P-tot, Ntot, and DOC than intermediate and poor peats (pH 4.0-4.6) both before and after restoration. Nutrients and DOC in pore water increased in the first year postrestoration but decreased thereafter. The most important variables related to pore water quality were trophic level, peatland class, water table level, and soil and air temperature.

Flow and Residence Times of Dynamic River Bank Storage and Sinuosity-Driven Hyporheic Exchange	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Hydrologic exchange fluxes (HEFs) vary significantly along river corridors due to spatiotemporal changes in discharge and geomorphology. This variability results in the emergence of biogeochemical hot-spots and hot-moments that ultimately control solute and energy transport and ecosystem services from the local to the watershed scales. In this work, we use a reduced-order model to gain mechanistic understanding of river bank storage and sinuosity-driven hyporheic exchange induced by transient river discharge. This is the first time that a systematic analysis of both processes is presented and serves as an initial step to propose parsimonious, physics-based models for better predictions of water quality at the large watershed scale. The effects of channel sinuosity, alluvial valley slope, hydraulic conductivity, and river stage forcing intensity and duration are encapsulated in dimensionless variables that can be easily estimated or constrained. We find that the importance of perturbations in the hyporheic zone's flux, residence times, and geometry is mainly explained by two-dimensionless variables representing the ratio of the hydraulic time constant of the aquifer and the duration of the event (Gamma(d)) and the importance of the ambient groundwater flow (Delta h*). Our model additionally shows that even systems with small sensitivity, resulting in small changes in the hyporheic zone extent, are characterized by highly variable exchange fluxes and residence times. These findings highlight the importance of including dynamic changes in hyporheic zones for typical HEF models such as the transient storage model.

This study was based on a genotoxic evaluation of buccal cells using the Comet assay technique. Levels of DNA damage in the consumers group were significantly higher than those of the control group. However, occupational exposure to genotoxicants showed to be the critical factor rather than water consumption. Taking into account the professions of well-and/or tap-water consumers, agricultural workers exposed directly (those who fumigated) or indirectly (those not involved in fumigating) to agrochemicals showed greater genetic damage than controls. This difference persisted even when age, and whether the person smoked or consumed alcoholic drinks were considered. These factors were not associated with the level of genetic damage observed. Chemical analyses of organochlorine pesticides and heavy metals were carried out to evaluate the water quality of wells, faucets, and surface water of canals consumed by the population and/or used for irrigation. High concentrations of alpha and beta endosulfan were detected in water of surface canals. Although our inventory of agrochemicals employed in the region showed the use of products considered carcinogenic and/or mutagenic, they were not detected by the analytical techniques used. Heavy metals (arsenic, mercury, and lead) were detected in water of some wells used for irrigation and human consumption.

We present an overview of deep-well recharge applications which have taken place in the Netherlands over the last two decades. We present the purpose of each application, the issues which had to be resolved, the preventive measures which were taken to improve performance and the lessons learned from each experience. Examples are given of applications which aimed at the storage of water for drinking and other purposes such as irrigation, achieving environmental goals and disposal of wastewater. Applications aiming at drinking water production usually faced issues related to the quality of the abstracted water not meeting drinking water standards with respect to various elements, such as iron, manganese and arsenic. Storage of water in brackish aquifers was complicated by buoyancy effects making part of the recharged water irrecoverable. Recharge of water with the purpose of recovering declined groundwater tables and fighting seawater intrusion was hindered by clogging of the injection well while the disposal of wastewater was limited to aquifers of lower groundwater quality.																	1606-9749					OCT	2017	17	5					1201	1211		10.2166/ws.2017.032								WOS:000417944300001

The paper presents a conceptual framework and typology to assess watershed ecological restoration based on the properties and processes of sustainable watershed development. According to multiple life stages, habitat properties and existing legal frameworks and applicable valuation approaches, the bio-indicator that integrates natural, political and socio-economic dimensions is proposed. With existing assessment results and official web-pages as references, evaluation systems concerning human impacts on aquatic systems are set forth. Suitable aquatic bio-indicators can standardize the monitoring methodology with respect to water quality, organic pollutants and pesticides, generation time, migration ability, saprobic status, taxonomic composition and diversity. A large number of fish-based indexes have been developed to monitor and manage river ecosystems. Biophysical and statistical models are being used to identify influential stream variables that correlate with macroinvertebrate indices. A probabilistic fuzzy hybrid model to assess river water quality is proposed. The method and process of ecological risk assessment are provided based on adaptive management principles. The environmental sustainability index (ESI) is used to estimate the degree of environmental restoration sustainability with the emergy triangle as a reference.																	1606-9749					OCT	2017	17	5					1232	1240		10.2166/ws.2017.017								WOS:000417944300005

The treatment scheme was: (1) As(III) in contaminated water is oxidized by arsenite-oxidizing bacteria fixed in the sponges in the reactor; (2) Fe(II) naturally existing in the water is oxidized by dissolved oxygen; (3) Fe(III) is precipitated as iron hydroxide and As(V) is co-precipitated with the iron hydroxide; and finally (4) the co-precipitates are fixed in the sponges. This system could remove As from As-contaminated water on a small scale and at low cost. The results showed that, after using the DHS reactor, As and Fe concentrations in the treated water were lower than water quality standards for drinking water when Fe(II) concentration in the influent was lower than 10 mg/L and the Fe/As ratio was higher than 6.67-8.42, with dependence on the Fe concentration. Additionally, even if Fe concentration is higher than 10 mg/L, the treatment system is still applicable if the pH of the influent is higher than 7 or the retention time is longer than 2 h.																	1606-9749					OCT	2017	17	5					1249	1259		10.2166/ws.2017.025								WOS:000417944300007

Investigation of natural organic matter (NOM) character and its removal in a chlorinated and chloraminated system at Rand Water, South Africa	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												In its natural environment, natural organic matter (NOM) is not problematic. However, during water treatment NOM does affect water quality specifically during the disinfection step, where if NOM is present it reacts with disinfectants resulting in the formation of disinfection by-products. To emphasize the importance of NOM monitoring during potable water treatment this study aimed to characterize NOM and evaluate NOM removal by a conventional water treatment plant considering seasonal trends. NOM was characterized by making use of NOM polarity and specific ultraviolet absorbance. NOM removal was monitored with high-performance size exclusion chromatography, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and UV254 analyses. The polarity rapid assessment method indicated that the hydrophobic and hydrophilic NOM fractions within the surface water increased during a period of heavy rain when floods occurred, but conversely decreased during an average rain season. Although NOM character showed variability during the 5-year study period, seasonal relationship during high and low flow seasons between aromatic NOM and total trihalomethane (TTHM) formation was not evident. Aromatic NOM was not the only precursor to TTHM formation, which stresses the need to implement advanced NOM characterization techniques during NOM monitoring to study reactivity of the individual NOM fraction with the disinfectant used at the water treatment plant.

In this study, we conducted high-frequency, synchronous field observations of meteorology, hydrology, and water quality to determine the relationship between sediment release rate and wind speed in the central region of Lake Taihu. We combined these results with our previous findings from other regions to establish the temporal-spatial variation in sediment release patterns for this lake. We then calculated the annual total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) release fluxes. We constructed an environmental fluid dynamics code (EFDC) model; we then loaded the temporal-spatial variation parameters and simulated the effects on different TN and TP concentrations. Overall, the following results were observed: (1) the critical wind speed at which sediment was first suspended in the central region of the lake was 4 m/s, and the fitted curve of the sediment release rate and wind speed was r = 144.7x - 100 (R-2 = 0.851); and (2) the annual TN and TP release fluxes of Lake Taihu were approximately 3,086 and 740 tons, respectively. This research would provide a basis for decision-making regarding pollution control in this region.																	1606-9749					OCT	2017	17	5					1335	1346		10.2166/ws.2017.034								WOS:000417944300016

Evaluation of the potential impact of Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam and pumping scenarios on groundwater level in the Nile Delta aquifer	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												The main objective of this study is to evaluate the potential impact of Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) and pumping scenarios on groundwater level by a three- dimensional groundwater model of the Nile Delta using MODFLOW software. The Nile Delta has highly intensive irrigation canal networks that share yearly about 35.5 km(3) of water. In this study, an integrated three- dimensional groundwater model is built considering the actual condition of the irrigation canals and their recharges of the Nile Delta aquifer. The model was calibrated for estimating the vertical and hydraulic conductivity. The model was run for three scenarios: (1) reduction of water depth in canals, (2) increasing pumping discharge from the aquifer and (3) combination between the first and second scenarios. Results reveal that the effect of increasing the pumping discharge on groundwater level in the Nile Delta is more significant than decreasing the water depth of the canals network due to the fact of the existence of the upper clay layer which reduces the amount of water penetrating and reaching the groundwater in the aquifer. The last scenario presents the worst case as the average drawdown reached 1.26 m, 1.7 m and 1.35 m in the western, central and eastern parts of the Nile Delta respectively. The study results should be taken in account for studying the saltwater intrusion and climate change impacts on the Nile Delta region.

Statistical assessment of water quality of a Ramsar site wetland	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												This study was conducted to evaluate the wetland water quality (WWQ) over a period of 3 years and establish relationships between these qualities using Ramsar site Uchali Wetland, Pakistan (32 degrees 33'N, 72 degrees 01'E). WWQ data obtained were subjected to summary statistics, generalized linear model (glm), correlation, covariance and cluster analysis. The glm of the monthly mean water indices showed that the mean returned for pH (2.57) was not significant while means for others were significant (p< 0.05). The correlation analysis of the WWQ indices indicated that 56% of the pairing indices were inversely correlated while 44% were directly correlated and three piles of clusters of WWQ indices were distinct. The wetland water is not very safe for drinking but safe for other non- domestic uses since it contains fewer microbes and the water health model as arrived at in this study provides a management protocol for wetland water.

Hydrochemical characteristics and quality assessment of urban groundwater in Urmia City, NW Iran	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality and hydrochemical characteristics of urban groundwater in Urmia City, northwest of Iran. In order, 59 groundwater samples were collected and analyzed for various anions and cations. Result shows that, mineral weathering, ion exchange and anthropogenic activity are the main hydrochemical processes controlling urban groundwater chemistry. The evaluation of groundwater geochemistry in the flow path beneath the urban area shows that, due to land use changes, the hydrochemical change occurs predominantly in electrical conductivity (EC), Cl- and NO3. The EC is increased in the direction of groundwater flow and in the last decade in industrial areas. According to the groundwater quality index values, most of the samples fit into the good quality class and samples with poor quality are located in the old residential, parks and agricultural areas of the city. The calculation of the irrigation water quality indices (Na%, sodium adsorption ratio, permeability index, residual sodium carbonate), and industrial water quality indices (Ryznar stability index, Langelier saturation index, Larson- Skold, Puckorius scaling index) indicated that the quality of water for irrigation purposes could be classified in the excellent to permissible categories. However, as for the industrial uses, the results also revealed that most of the samples could be classified in the aggressive and very aggressive categories.																	1606-9749					OCT	2017	17	5					1410	1425		10.2166/ws.2017.039								WOS:000417944300023

ELM evaluation model of regional groundwater quality based on the crow search algorithm	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												According to the multi-parameter evaluation of groundwater quality, an evaluation model of groundwater quality based on the improved Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) was proposed to resolve fuzziness of the water quality evaluation and incompatibility of water parameters. A training sample set and testing sample set were randomly generated according to the classification standards of groundwater quality, then Crow Search Algorithm (CSA) was used to optimize the input weights and thresholds of hidden-layer neurons of the ELM; thus, the CSA-ELM evaluation model of groundwater quality was constructed based on optimization of the ELM by the CSA. Base on the training sample set and testing sample set, the CSA-ELM model was tested. The test results indicate that the evaluating precision and generalization ability of the CSA-ELM model reach a high level and can be used for comprehensive evaluations of groundwater quality. The Jiansanjiang Administration in Heilongjiang Province, China, was used as an example; the groundwater quality of 15 farms in this region was evaluated based on the CSA-ELM model. The groundwater quality in this region was generally good, and the groundwater quality appeared to have spatial distribution characteristics. Compared with the Nemerow Index Method (NIM), the CSA-ELM evaluation model of groundwater quality is more reasonable and can be used for the comprehensive evaluation of groundwater quality. The stability of the NIM, ELM model, back propagation (BP) model and CSA-ELM model was analyzed using the theory of serial number summation and Spearman's correlation coefficient. The stability of the NIM and BP model in groundwater quality evaluation was poor, while the stability of the ELM model and CSA-ELM model was relatively superior. The ranked results of stability are CSA-ELM model > ELM model > NIM > BP model. The reliability of the NIM, ELM model, BP model and CSA-ELM model was analyzed using the theory of distinction degree. The reliability of the NIM was not good, although its distinction degree was large; the distinction degrees of the ELM model, BP model and CSA-ELM model were close to each other. The ranked results of reliability are CSA-ELM model > ELM model > BP model. The CSA-ELM model can provide a stable and reliable evaluation method for the evaluation of related fields and thus has important practical applicability.

Monitoring river water quality with transplanted bryophytes: A methodological review	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The aim of this literature review, which considers 47 articles published between 1989 and 2015, is to ascertain the current status of the active biomonitoring technique for assessing water quality and to evaluate the degree to which different aspects of the method have been standardized. Use of the tool is largely limited to Europe (83% of the articles reviewed). The technique has been used to biomonitor inorganic contaminants (in 96% of the studies) and, to a lesser extent, organic contaminants (4% of the studies). Only 25% of the articles concern methodological aspects of the technique. Moreover, most authors (78%) have only published one article on the topic, and many different protocols have been used in the various studies. As a result, the technique is not standardized, which hampers comparison of the results of different studies. We propose a protocol that would facilitate use of the technique for routine monitoring of the quality of river waters.

To assess the biomonitoring potential of the Caryophyllaeid tapeworm Adenoscolex oreini and the possible impact of water quality on fish species, a study was carried out in three lakes with marked eutrophication and pollution gradients. The A. oreini infection level in three host fish species of the genus Schizothorax and corresponding fish health status were determined. The pattern of cestode infection varied significantly in the three fish species across the pollution gradient. The prevalence of infection in two fish species (Schizothorax esocinus and S. curvifrons) was significantly greater (P < 0.05) in the eutrophic lake than in the reference lake, whereas in S. niger, the maximum was reached in the hypereutrophic lake. The estimated marginal mean intensity and other infection indices varied significantly (P < 0.05) across the inter and intra-pollution gradients of lakes. Multivariate statistical analysis results revealed maximum cestode infection in the eutrophic lake. An altered seasonal pattern was observed in the highly stressed lake. The gonadosomatic index (GSI) and condition factor values were significantly greater in fish collected from the reference lake than in those collected from the other lakes. A significant negative relationship between GSI and cestode prevalence was observed in the hypereutrophic lake as compared to least eutrophic lake. These findings indicate that infection indices of the Caryophyllaeid tapeworm and health attributes of fish can act as surrogates for the environmental quality of deteriorated lentic water bodies of the north-western Himalayan region, which is currently undergoing environmental degradation.																	1470-160X	1872-7034				OCT	2017	81						503	513		10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.06.025								WOS:000417229100049

O.; Herlihy, Alan T.; Hughes, Robert M.; Callisto, Marcos			An improved macroinvertebrate multimetric index for the assessment of wadeable streams in the neotropical savanna	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Multimetric indices (MMIs) have been successfully used to assess ecological conditions in freshwater ecosystems worldwide, and provide an important management tool especially in countries where biological indicators are fostered by environmental regulations. Nonetheless, for the neotropics, the few published papers are limited to small local scales and lack standardized sampling protocols. To fill the gaps left by previous studies, we propose a stream MMI that reflects anthropogenic impacts by using macroinvertebrate assemblage metrics from a data set of 190 sites collected from four hydrologic units in the Parana and Sao Francisco River Basins, southeastern Brazil. Sites were selected through use of a probabilistic survey design allowing us to infer ecological condition to the total of 9432 kilometers of wadeable streams in the target population in the four hydrologic units. We used a filtering process to determine the least- and most-disturbed sites based on their water quality, physical habitat structure, and land use. To develop the MMI, we followed a stepwise procedure to screen our initial set of biological metrics for influence of natural variation, responsiveness and discriminance to disturbances, sampling variability, and redundancy. The final MMI is the sum of 7 scaled assemblage metrics describing different aspects of macroinvertebrate assemblage characteristics: Ephemeroptera richness, % Gastropoda individuals, Shannon Wiener diversity index, % sensitive taxa richness, % scraper individuals, temporarily attached taxa richness, and gill respiration taxa richness. The MMI clearly distinguished the least-disturbed sites from the most-disturbed sites and showed a significant negative response to anthropogenic stressors. Of the total length of wadeable streams in the study area, 38%, 35%, and 27% were classified by the MMI as being in good, fair, and poor condition, respectively. By reducing the subjectivity of site selection, rigorously selecting the set of reference sites, and following a standardized metric screening method, we developed a robust MMI to assess and monitor ecological condition in neotropical savanna streams. This improved MMI provides an effective ecological tool to guide decision makers and managers in developing and implementing improved, cost-effective environmental policies, regulations, and monitoring of those systems.

However, it remains challenging because of hydrological uncertainties in the single scale. A multimodal water quality prediction model based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and support vector regression (SVR) is proposed to address this problem. Based on the idea of decomposition and ensemble, dissolved oxygen (DO), one representation in water quality, is firstly decomposed into several intrinsic mode functions, which are then modeled by the SVR in each mode. According to the reconstruction theory of the EEMD, the subresults predicted by the SVR of each mode are summarized into the final results. The proposed model is evaluated by the weekly DO concentrations during 2014-2015 from one monitoring station of the Jialing River, China. A back propagation neural network and the standard SVR models are used for a comparison study. The results demonstrate that the addressed model, combining the mode representation capacity of the EEMD and the nonlinear mapping of the SVR, has the best prediction performance among the peer models.

J	Greenway, M				Greenway, Margaret			Stormwater wetlands for the enhancement of environmental ecosystem services: case studies for two retrofit wetlands in Brisbane, Australia	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Constructed stormwater wetlands are examples of 'blue-green' ecological engineering in the urban environment providing a range of ecosystem services. A study was undertaken in Brisbane, Australia to examine the enhancement of environmental ecosystem services in 2 retrofit wetlands. Originally concrete drainage channels in existing residential catchments, a series of wetlands and ponds were created i.e. green infrastructure in a brownfield setting. Boardwalks, pathways and interpretive signage were incorporated into the design. Golden Pond wetland was only 0.2% of the catchment whereas Bridgewater Creek - Bowie's Flat wetland was 0.4% of the catchment. The larger 0.8 ha Bridgewater Creek wetland had an overflow bypass channel. Water quality (suspended solids and nutrients) and the diversity of aquatic macro invertebrates were monitored for 2-4 years after construction. During storm events suspended solids increased at Golden Pond due to resuspension from the high velocities in this small linear flow system. Resuspension was minimised at Bridgewater Creek due to the by-pass channel. During dry weather suspended solids in both wetlands increased due to resuspension from the activity of waterbirds. Both wetlands were effective in reducing nutrient concentrations especially NOx-N and PO4-P, attributed to biological uptake; but during dry periods NH4-N increased within the system. The concept of irreducible background concentrations in wetland systems is discussed. Open water and aquatic vegetation provided habitats for macroinvertebrates. Species richness increased by more than 50% in both stormwater wetlands, compared to the concrete drains. Wetland sizing and design are essential parameters for water quality improvement and biodiversity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Li, WJ; Li, LJ; Qiu, GY				Li, Wenjiang; Li, Linjun; Qiu, Guoyu			Energy consumption and economic cost of typical wastewater treatment systems in Shenzhen, China	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Wastewater treatment, a great potential alternative to alleviate water shortage, has been attached more and more importance in China, and has been developing very fast. The quantity of wastewater treatment plants in China has increased up to 3272 in June 2013, and has a total handling capacity of 0.14 billion t/day. However, wastewater treatment requires to consuming a lot of energy, and even energy consumption is often the main operation cost of wastewater treatment systems. Thus, it is very necessary to explore energy consumption of wastewater treatment systems and its influential factors, and seek for some possible pathways to save energy and lower cost. In this paper, we investigated the average energy consumption per unit wastewater treatment in Shenzhen, and analyzed the effect of treatment capacity and treatment technology on the energy cost per unit of wastewater treatment. The results showed that the average energy consumption of wastewater treatment plants in Shenzhen was about 0.20 +/- 0.06 kWh/t, much less than those in some developed countries. This result may be related to the advanced wastewater treatment plants newly constructed and the low water quality requirements of wastewater treatment in Shenzhen. As the key to wastewater treatment, biochemical treatment sub-process consumed 50-70% of total energy cost in wastewater treatment. Secondly, the larger the treat capacity, the lower the energy cost per unit of wastewater treatment was. And the difference of treatment technologies can also significantly affect the energy consumption per unit of wastewater treatment. Finally, labor cost and electricity consumption respectively covered about 30.1% and 26.3% of total economic cost in the three typical wastewater treatment plants in original Shenzhen. Thus, upgrading treatment machines & equipment and improving management level are two effective alternatives to decrease energy consumption and lower total economic cost of wastewater treatment plants in Shenzhen and even China.

However, transitions towards regenerative urban built environments that widely incorporate sustainable drainage systems are "per se" innovative journeys that encounter barriers which include the limited evidence on the performance of these systems which, in many countries, are still unknown to professionals and decision makers. A further important barrier is the frequently poor interaction among stakeholders; key items such as sustainable drainage systems provide collective benefits which also demand collective efforts. With the aim of overcoming such innovation-driven barriers, six showcase projects (including rain gardens acting as infiltration basins, swales and a green roof) to demonstrate the feasibility and suitability of sustainable drainage systems were developed and/or retrofitted in two cities of the Valencian region of Spain as a part of an European project, and their performance was monitored for a year. The data acquired, after being fully analyzed and presented to a group of key regional stakeholders, is proving to be a valuable promoter of the desired transition (for instance in influencing the support to SuDS in recent regional legislation). This paper presents detailed data on how these urban ecological drainage infrastructure elements reduce runoff (peak flows and volumes) and improve its quality, contributing to the goal of healthier and livable cities. The data show that the pilots have good hydraulic performance under a typical Mediterranean climate and also provided water quality benefits. Furthermore, it shows how engagement can contribute to smarter governance in the sense of smoothing the difficulties faced by innovation when being presented, understood, and endorsed by professionals and decision-makers in the field of stormwater management. Finally, activities undertaken in the demonstration sites monitored, show how they have been drivers of innovation and transition towards a new stormwater paradigm in Spain, serving as a reference to other urban areas in the Mediterranean.

SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Fate and transport models are powerful tools that aid authorities in making unbiased decisions for developing sustainable management strategies. Application of pollution fate and transport models in semi-arid regions has been challenging because of unique hydrological characteristics and limited data availability. Significant temporal and spatial variability in rainfall events, complex interactions between soil, vegetation and topography, and limited water quality and hydrological data due to insufficient monitoring network make it a difficult task to develop reliable models in semi-arid regions. The performances of these models govern the final use of the outcomes such as policy implementation, screening, economical analysis, etc. In this study, a deterministic distributed fate and transport model, SWAT, is applied in Lake Mogan Watershed, a semi-arid region dominated by dry agricultural practices, to estimate nutrient loads and to develop the water budget of the watershed. To minimize the discrepancy due to limited availability of historical water quality data extensive efforts were placed in collecting site-specific data for model inputs such as soil properties, agricultural practice information and land use. Moreover, calibration parameter ranges suggested in the literature are utilized during calibration in order to obtain more realistic representation of Lake Mogan Watershed in the model. Model performance is evaluated using comparisons of the measured data with 95%CI for the simulated data and comparison of unit pollution load estimations with those provided in the literature for similar catchments, in addition to commonly used evaluation criteria such as Nash-Sutcliffe simulation efficiency, coefficient of determination and percent bias. These evaluations demonstrated that even though the model prediction power is not high according to the commonly used model performance criteria, the calibrated model may provide useful information in the comparison of the effects of different management practices on diffuse pollution and water quality in Lake Mogan Watershed.

Previous studies pointed out that most AFIs use aquatic plants to carry out improvement of water quality and ecological conservation. This study proposed a modified AFI system, named Green Water Farm (GWF), to increase the practical application value of traditional AFIs, and added a special design to create an environment that allows for terrestrial plants (including vegetables and flowers) to grow and to carry out improvement of water quality and ecological conservation. The research site was located at the waterfront of Li-tze Lake in Pitou Township, Taiwan. A GWF was established to evaluate the improvement of water quality and ecological conservation. During one year, water quality and ecological conservation assessments were recorded to investigate the performance of GWF system. The research results showed that GWF could improve water quality and ecological conservation. In addition, the results of this study can provide useful information for more food sources for humans and animals, and increase biodiversity and ecological conservation.

Of those projects, governing diverse needs and desires from stakeholders for those who have various water values are key elements of identifying the success of the project. In fact, the Korean government has had concern over restoring the rivers which brings to construct 16 weirs in four major rivers and may fail to achieve main goal of the project, which is to ameliorate water quality. In this study, principle component analysis and multinomial logit model were executed to investigate major socioeconomic variables to influence water values in terms of sustainability in Korea. Evitable evidences have been found that age, income, education level, and city dwelling are the most effective variables to estimate water values. In addition, a monotonous water development project and a myopic view could cause major dejection across the nation and may lead to the failure of water governance. Unfortunately, the latter may be observed in Korea as one of the reasons for the recent amplification of major conflicts.																	2071-1050					OCT	2017	9	10							1764	10.3390/su9101764								WOS:000414896200094

In the present study, assessment of P recovery from swine wastewater in Beijing was performed. P amounts of swine wastewater increased from 11,687 tons in 1980 to 16,237 tons in 2014. Without treatment of swine wastewater, P concentration will reach a maximum 1.20 mg/L. The maximum P recovery was 99.36% under the condition of crystallization coupled BPR (biological phosphorus removal) when the operating conditions were 60.6 mg/L for C-p (initial P concentration (mg/L)), 1.2 for Mg/P (magnesium-to-P molar ratio), 9.7 for pH of crystallization process, and 8.0 for pH, 1.6 h for anaerobic stage time, 15 days for sludge retention time of BPR. The P concentration for water quality was 0.03 mg/L to meet the water regulation standard. Under this situation, if the target P concentration were set as Grade II and III, pig breeding numbers reached 42.07 and 95.90 million heads. Construction investments for the crystallization, BRP, and coupled methods are 411 (10(4) Yuan, 604,307 USD), 301 (10(4) Yuan, 442,580 USD), and 551 (10(4) Yuan, 810,170 USD), respectively.

To manage non-point pollution, swine wastewater treatment facilities should be used and pig breeding numbers should be managed within reasonable ranges.																	2071-1050					OCT	2017	9	10							1845	10.3390/su9101845								WOS:000414896200175

Increases in agricultural production in response to population growth and wealth generation further increase risks associated with nutrient pollution. This paper presents results from projections of nutrient exports from global agricultural crop and pasture systems to the water environment generated using a process-based modeling approach. Brazil, China, India and the United States account for more than half of estimated global N and P loadings in the base year. Each country boasts large agriculture centers where high calculated loading values are found. Rapid growth in global agricultural nutrient loadings is projected. Growth of agricultural pollution loading is fastest in the group of low-income developing countries and loading growth rates also vary substantially with climate change scenario. Counter measures need to be taken to address the environmental risks associated with the projected rapid increase of agricultural nutrient loadings.																	1748-9326					OCT	2017	12	10							104008	10.1088/1748-9326/aa8148								WOS:000412439900001

Mapping and valuation of South Africa's ecosystem services: A local perspective	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES					Workshop on Optimizing and Unlocking Investment in Ecological Infrastructure in South Africa	NOV 15-19, 2015	Dept Environm Affairs S Africa, SOUTH AFRICA	Deutsche Gesell Int Zusammenarbeit GmbH, Econ Land Degradat, Ecosystem Serv Partnership, Australian Natil Univ	Dept Environm Affairs S Africa			We used locally-sourced and other relevant information to value ecosystem services provided by South Africa's terrestrial, freshwater and estuarine habitats. Our preliminary estimates suggest that these are worth at least R275 billion per annum to South Africans. Notwithstanding benefits to the rest of the world, natural systems provide a major source of direct income to poor households, and generate significant value in the economy through tourism and property markets, as well as providing considerable non-market benefits. Higher values correspond both to areas of higher biomass, which have higher capacity to supply ecosystem services, and areas of higher population densities, which generate demand as well as threats. The value of regulating services is higher for natural systems closer to population centres. Amenity values are highest in cities and protected areas, with the fragmented green open space areas within cities have among the highest values per ha. Even if the gaps are taken into account, our estimates are far lower than estimates based on average global values, but are likely to be more accurate, relevant and tractable to policymakers. Nevertheless, some services have large global values, the recognition of which is important in developing strategies for financing biodiversity conservation.

Climate change, land degradation and an inherently semi-arid, variable climate are making it increasingly difficult for water service providers to deliver sufficient quantity and quality of water to meet escalating demand. Investments in ecological infrastructure are seldom considered as a way of augmenting water supplies and improving water quality over the long-term. However, hydrological modelling shows that protecting and rehabilitating ecological infrastructure could generate meaningful gains in water quantity in two important South African water supply systems, the Baviaanskloof-Tsitsikamma and uMngeni catchments. The costs of such interventions, as estimated using resource economic techniques, are within the same order of magnitude as built infrastructure solutions. Investments in ecological infrastructure can also have a considerable range of other benefits. These findings make a compelling case for large-scale investment in the rehabilitation and protection of ecological infrastructure, which can be a cost-effective option for achieving water resource planning objectives. The types of rehabilitation activities planned would depend on the needs of local water users.

A total of 161 water samples including 88 tap drinking waters (DW) and 73 surface waters (SW) were collected from five cities in Xi'an, Yan'an, Xining, Lanzhou, and Urumqi in northwestern China. Eighteen parameters including pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total organic carbon (TOC) total nitrogen (TN), chemical compositions of anions (F-, Cl-, NO3-, HCO3-, SO42-), cations (NH4+, K+, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+), and metals (lead (Pb), chromium (Cr), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu)) were analyzed in the first time at the five cities. The results showed that pH values and concentrations of Cl-, SO42-, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+ and Cd, Cr, Cu in DW were within the permissible limits of the Chinese Drinking Water Quality Criteria, whereas the concentrations of other ions (F-, NO3-, NH4+ and Pb) exceeded their permissible values. In terms of the SW, the concentrations of F-, Cl-, NO3-, SO42- were over the third range threshold i.e., water suitable for fishing and swimming of the Surface Water Quality Standards in China. The spatial distributions of most MEs in source water are similar, and there was no clear variation for all ions and metals. The metals in DW may be caused by water pipes, faucets and their fittings. The noncarcinogenic risk of metals in DW for local children are in decreasing order Cr > Cd > Pb > Cu. The carcinogenic risk from Cr exposure was at the acceptable level according to threshold of USEPA. Although the comprehensive index of potential ecological assessment of Cr, Cd, Pb and Cu in SW ranked at low risk level and was in the order of Huang River in Xining > Peaceful Canal in Urumqi > Yan River in Yan'an > Yellow River in Lanzhou, their adverse effects to ecology and human health at a low concentration in local semi-arid and arid areas should not be ignored in the long run.

When MPT-mass spectrometry (MPT-MS) is applied in the detection of some metal elements, the metallic ions exhibit some novel features which are significantly different with those obtained by the traditional inductively coupled plasma (ICP)-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and may be helpful for metal element analysis. As the representative elements of group IVA, titanium and zirconium are both of importance and value in modern industry, and they have impacts on human health. Here, we first provide a study on the complex anions of titanium and zirconium in water by using the MPT as ion source and a linear ion trap mass spectrometer (LTQ-MS). These complex anions were produced in the plasma flame by an aqueous solution flowing through the central tube of the MPT, and were introduced into the inlet of the mass spectrometry working in negative ion mode to get the feature mass spectrometric signals. Moreover, the feature fragment patterns of these ions in multi-step collision-induced dissociation processes have been explained. Under the optimized conditions, the limit of detection (LOD) using the MS2 (the second tandem mass spectrometry) procedure was estimated to be at the level of 10 mu g/L for titanium and 20 mu g/L for zirconium with linear dynamics ranges that cover at least two orders of magnitude, i.e., between 0-500 mu g/L and 20-200 mu g/L, respectively. These experimental data demonstrated that the MPT-MS is a promising and useful tool in field analysis of titanium and zirconium ions in water, and can be applied in many fields, such as environmental control, hydrogeology, and water quality inspection. In addition, MPT-MS could also be used as a supplement of ICP-MS for the rapid and on-site analysis of metal ions.																	1660-4601					OCT	2017	14	10							1129	10.3390/ijerph14101129								WOS:000414763200038	28954404

Dissolved Organic Matter Compositional Change and Biolability During Two Storm Runoff Events in a Small Agricultural Watershed	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Agricultural watersheds are globally pervasive, supporting fundamentally different organic matter source, composition, and concentration profiles in comparison to natural systems. Similar to natural systems, agricultural storm runoff exports large amounts of organic carbon from agricultural land into waterways. But intense management of upper soil layers, waterway channelization, wetland and riparian habitat removal, and postharvest vegetation removal promise to uniquely drive organic matter release to waterways. During a winter first flush and a subsequent storm event, this study investigated the influence of a small agricultural watershed on dissolved organic matter (DOM) source, composition, and biolability. Storm water discharge released strongly terrestrial yet biolabile (23 to 32%) dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Following a 21day bioassay, a parallel factor analysis identified an 80% reduction in a protein-like (phenylpropyl) component (C2) that was previously correlated to lignin phenol concentration, and a 10% reduction in a humic-like, terrestrially sourced component (C4). Storm-driven releases tripled DOC concentration (from 2.8 to 8.7mgL(-1)) during the first flush event in comparison to base flow and were terrestrially sourced, with an eightfold increase in vascular plant derived lignin phenols (23.0 to 185gL(-1)). As inferred from system hydrology, lignin composition, and nitrate as a groundwater tracer, an initial pulse of dilute water from the upstream watershed caused a counterclockwise DOC hysteresis loop. DOC concentrations peaked after 3.5days, with the delay between peak discharge and peak DOC attributed to storm water hydrology and a period of initial water repellency of agricultural soils, which delayed DOM leaching. Plain Language Summary Human activities have transformed vast areas of Earth's surface to agricultural use. Contemporary agricultural practices have vastly increased crop yield but have also greatly intensified agricultural land management practices, which deviate strongly from many of the basic processes that affect natural habitats. It follows, then, that agricultural land use could affect carbon cycling and water quality in agricultural watersheds very differently from how natural systems affect those same parameters. This study seeks to deepen scientific knowledge surrounding how storms drive carbon release from land to waterways, specific to an agricultural watershed. Results indicate that over a quarter of the carbon released from the subject agricultural watershed during storms has the potential to be used as energy by downstream ecosystems. This could support future management actions seeking to benefit downstream ecosystems or may pose a threat to ecosystem health. The study also suggests that the timing, amount, and quality of carbon released from the watershed depend on rainfall patterns and watershed plumbing, and on whether or not soil wetting has occurred recently, prior to the event in question.

Converting bahiagrass pasture land to elephantgrass bioenergy production enhances biomass yield and water quality	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Changing pasture land to the production of bioenergy crops will affect regional water dynamics. Returning byproducts of industrial conversion of bioenergy crops like fermentation residual or biochar back to the field could be used to improve sustainable nutrient management, but could also impact water quantity and quality in ways that are poorly understood. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of land-use conversion from low input bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum Fliigge) pastures to elephantgrass [Pennisetum purpureum (L.) Schum.] for bioenergy production under different nutrient management practices on biomass yield, crop water dynamics and nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) leaching during growing and dormant seasons. Treatments evaluated were 1) bahiagrass + 50 kg N ha(-1); 2) elephantgrass + 50 kg N ha(-1); 3) elephantgrass + 50 kg N ha(-1) + fermentation residual; 4) elephantgrass + 50 kg N ha(-1) + biochar; and 5) elephantgrass + 250 kg N ha(-1). Data were collected on crop evapotranspiration (ET), water use efficiency, drainage, NO3-N leaching, and aboveground dry matter accumulation. Dry matter yield of elephantgrass was 4- to 7-fold greater than bahiagrass after the first growing season, but was similar among elephantgrass treatments. Elephantgrass produced with no residual amendments reduced drainage (approx. 43% across all growing seasons) compared to bahiagrass, and this reduction was exacerbated in the residual treatments. Reduced drainage was associated with increased ET. Elephantgrass, regardless of treatment, reduced the amount of NO3-N lost through drainage compared to bahiagrass. Therefore, replacing bahiagrass with elephantgrass will increase cropping system water use and diminish the rate of groundwater replenishment during the growing season, which could have detrimental effects for other ecosystem processes that rely on this water resource. However, elephantgrass increased the efficiency with which water was used to produce biomass and reduced NO3-N leaching to groundwater.																	0167-8809	1873-2305				OCT 1	2017	248						20	28		10.1016/j.agee.2017.07.021								WOS:000411539700003

This increases nitrate concentrations in the baseflow of streams, enhancing downstream eutrophication. Conservation practices reduce the impacts from agriculture, but little is documented on the recovery time of shallow groundwater after agriculture ceases and conservation practices are applied. Although conservation practices may reduce groundwater nitrate, they may also lead to the production of the greenhouse gas methane. This study investigated the temporal sequence of applying post-agricultural conservation practices and the effects on nitrate and methane concentrations in shallow groundwater. Harleigh Farms is a complex of fields near Oxford, MD (USA) that have been taken out of crop production and placed in conservation programs at various times after 1997. Groundwater nitrate and dissolved methane were sampled monthly from Nov 2012-Nov 2013 using age of the conservation practice as a proxy for time since fertilization. In this chronosequence study, an exponential decline in groundwater nitrate levels was found over the 16 year time period since last fertilization. Within 3-5 years after the cessation of intensive grain production, groundwater nitrate concentrations in the top of the surface unconfined aquifer dropped from 11 mg NO3--N L-1 to 0.5 mg NO3--N L-1. Methane only accumulated to high concentrations (2-60 mu M CH4) in hydric soils with low nitrate concentrations (<< 0.1 mg NO3--N L-1). Our results indicate rapid loss of nitrate in the top of the surficial aquifer after the cessation of intensive agriculture and seasonal accumulations of methane in wetland-based conservation practices. These data indicate that time series of groundwater nitrate concentrations at the top of the unconfined aquifer can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of agricultural conservation practices.																	0167-8809	1873-2305				OCT 1	2017	248						200	214		10.1016/j.agee.2017.07.026								WOS:000411539700021

Facing a wicked problem with optimism: issues and priorities for coral conservation in Hong Kong	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Economic development and environmental conservation are often seen as opposing forces in the arena of government policy-making. With more than 7 million people and a rich diversity of marine species and habitats, Hong Kong is an excellent case study to explore this dynamic. Despite anthropogenic impacts, Hong Kong still hosts more than 90 species of stony corals within a marine area of 1650 km 2. This is remarkable in light of the global plight of coral reefs, which have been reduced by similar to 80% worldwide in recent decades. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has not been immune to this negative trend with an unfortunate track of marine environmental disasters and, as such, can be viewed a harbinger for the future trajectory of coral reefs worldwide. Yet, the story is not entirely negative. Hong Kong possesses key assets, including capable government environmental agencies and competitive research led by local universities, which can bring novel and promising approaches for coral biodiversity conservation in an urbanized context. To coordinate and assist conservation efforts in Hong Kong, we here identify and prioritize major management efforts and identify knowledge gaps for coral conservation based on updated coral biodiversity distribution and a current literature review. Specifically, we propose five priorities for the most positive impact on conservation efforts: (1) reconstruct environmental baselines and establish long-term monitoring of local coral communities, (2) enhance the management and protection of local coral habitats, (3) improve water quality, (4) gain an understanding of the genetic connectivity among local and distant coral communities, and finally, (5) establish an active restoration program for local coral species/communities. In order to build progressive and integrative management strategies for coral biodiversity conservation in Hong Kong, we suggest specific ways in which these priorities be addressed and encourage a fresh dialogue between the government, the public and academia.																	0960-3115	1572-9710				OCT	2017	26	11					2521	2545		10.1007/s10531-017-1383-z								WOS:000412139000001

The present study showed that values of temperature (T), electrical conductivity (EC), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), chloride, phosphate, sulfate, fecal coliform, Streptococcus, Salmonella spp., and Enterococci were significantly higher in the dry season compared to samples taken in the wet season. Concurrently, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), turbidity, suspended matter (SM), NH4+ presented values significantly lower in dry season than surveys in rainy season. The following parameters BOD5, COD, SO42-, Cl-, SM, Salmonella spp. did not meet the Tunisian standard NT 106 for surface water quality. Analysis of pollutant concentrations via PCA showed that the two first components accounted for 87.34 and 93.17% of the total variance for dry and rainy season sampling, respectively. The first component included T, pH, EC, SM, SO42-, Cl-, NH4+, turbidity, COD, BOD, PO43-, Enterococci, fecal coliform and streptococcus, Salmonella spp., and total bacteria. The second included DO and NO3-. Cluster analysis identified the five sampling sites into three groups in the rainy and dry season based on seasonal differences and various pollution levels caused by physicochemical and bacteriological properties. The results suggest that future monitoring can include fewer sampling sites, and stratified random sampling plans can save time and resources.

Future Scenarios Modeling of Urban Stormwater Management Response to Impacts of Climate Change and Urbanization	CLEAN-SOIL AIR WATER												Future scenarios modeling is used to investigate the effectiveness of the urban stormwater infrastructure and its response to potential future changes. The changes of urban stormwater, both in-flow quantity and water quality, in response to climate change and urbanization are examined and tested in two highly developed urban catchments using the US Environmental Protection Agency's Storm Water Management Model. Similar responses are observed in the two catchments, despite their differences in size and land use. Flow quantity and water quality appears to be more sensitive to urbanization factors than to climatic change. With respect to factors attributable to urbanization, urban intensification (land use plus population density) has more of an effect than land-use changes alone. Low-impact development, as a key adaptation measure, could be effective in mitigating the adverse impacts of future changes on urban stormwater. The methodology developed in this study may be useful for urban stormwater planning and testing such plans against future urbanization and climate change scenarios.																	1863-0650	1863-0669				OCT	2017	45	10							1700111	10.1002/clen.201700111								WOS:000412916700006

The methodology can be used to elaborate and compare future socio-economic development scenarios to select the best interventions based on three criteria: (1) ideas of experts and stakeholders about the importance of scenarios, (2) impacts of each scenario on surface water quality in watershed, and (3) benefit-cost analysis for each scenario. A score is computed for each scenario based on a weighted sum technique which enables to take into consideration different level of importance for the three criteria. The methodology is applied to Cau River basin in Vietnam, with the aid of a computer tool, to assess interventions for river water quality improvement within the context of population growth and urbanization. The results show that fast future population growth in upstream has significant impacts. In 2020, an increase of 116 % of the population in Bac Kan town can lead to an increase of 120 and 135 % in BOD5 and NH4+ median concentrations, respectively, with the implementation of a treatment plant for 10,000 people in Bac Kan town. Therefore, the increase of the domestic wastewater treatment plant's capacity in Bac Kan town, at least twice as the projection of local government, is necessary. These results will help decision makers to select the best interventions for Cau River basin management.																	1387-585X	1573-2975				OCT	2017	19	5					1701	1729		10.1007/s10668-016-9822-7								WOS:000412840100007

The authors made a great effort measuring 21 water quality indicators for the surface waters from 14 monitoring and sampling stations selected in the Coruh River Basin (northeastern Turkey) during a period from June 2014 to May 2015. Unfortunately, various mistakes, e.g., several misevaluated water quality indicators and a number of mistyped parts, as well as incomplete evaluation were identified with respect to the surface water quality in the Coruh River Basin, northeastern Turkey. Moreover, Bilgin and Konanc (Environ Earth Sci 75: 1029, 2016) considered the Turkish Water Pollution Control Regulation (TWPCR 2004), which was repealed as of 30.11.2012, and the Council Directive 75/440/EEC (1975), which was repealed as of 22.12.2007, to evaluate the surface water quality in the Coruh River Basin, northeastern Turkey. The mistakes were corrected, and the surface water quality was reevaluated with reference to the Turkish Regulation being in force.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				OCT	2017	76	20							700	10.1007/s12665-017-6984-z								WOS:000413674900003

Hydrogeological modelling of these data can be implemented with physically based models (i.e. MODFLOW, MT3D.). Other approaches that are simpler to implement may be a good substitute for these numerical approaches. This is the case of probabilistic approaches and especially the statistical approach neural networks. The proposed method (coupling GIS/ANN) is especially suitable for the problem of large-scale and long-term simulation. It has been applied in the spatial prediction of nitrates in the chalk aquifer in Bethune (North of France). This confined chalk aquifer in its northern part provides natural denitrification and ensures a good drinking water quality, while in its southern part this aquifer is facing a high level of nitrate concentrations far above the European Nitrates Directive standard. A good groundwater management of this ecosystems service is therefore of great importance for regional water management. Thus, the spatial distribution of nitrate concentration obtained by GIS/ANN coupling model was compared with the results obtained from the numerical modelling (MT3D) and validated by the real measurements. ANN modelling seems to be more realistic than MT3D modelling both for 2003 and 2004. This is true for both of the nitrate concentrations and their difference. So, ANN modelling's spatially distributed difference with observed data ranges from - 3.67 to + 1.24 mg/l in 2003 and - 10.8 to + 6.51 mg/l in 2004, whereas for the MT3D model, this difference ranges from - 11.5 to + 17.9 mg/l in 2003 and - 9.91 to + 16.9 mg/l in 2004. The satisfactory results of the ANN model allowed to launch prospective simulations for 2025 under two groundwater recharge scenarios: a deficit year (150 mm/year) and a rainy year (500 mm/year) show an expansion of the exploitable zone ([NO3-] < 50 mg/L) in the case of a rainy year. The results demonstrate the potential of ANN modelling of spatially distributed hydrogeological data for groundwater management of nitrate pollution. From a groundwater management point of view, the GIS/ANN modelling represents an alternative data analysis to obtain fast results using a less tedious method whose results are satisfactory.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				OCT	2017	76	19							649	10.1007/s12665-017-6990-1								WOS:000412736700005

Findings on water quality in Upper Mustang (Nepal) from a preliminary geochemical and geological survey	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The major ion and trace element chemistry of water samples, including springs, rivers and irrigation ditches, collected during a survey on August 2016 in the Upper Mustang region of the Mustang District of Dhawalagiri Zone (Nepal) has been investigated. The Upper Mustang region, a cold desert, represents a hot-spot for climate change: indeed, violent hailstorms and rainstorms have been recently observed, consequently exposing land to erosion. Results of this study indicate that waters in the region belong to the Ca-HCO3, Ca-Mg-Cl-SO4 and Na-K-Cl-types, reflecting different hydrochemical regimes. Uranium is widespread in waters, with concentrations up to 19 mu g/L recorded in a potable water supply. Locally, anoxic conditions affect uranium mobility due to the low solubility of U(IV) minerals. Highly toxic thallium was detected in a thermal spring at an elevated concentration (45 mu g/L Tl). The association of thallium with high concentrations of iron suggests that these elements are derived from pyrite oxidation. Detectable levels of thallium were also measured in the water of an irrigation ditch. Lithium concentrations ranged from 7 mu g/L to 12 mg/L in the thermal water and showed a strong association with chloride ions. Arsenic concentrations up to 4.7 mu g/L were measured in tributaries of the Kali Gandaki river. The data provide evidence that solutes in water have originated from an array of input sources, including carbonate dissolution, the dissolution of soluble salts, silicate weathering and localized sulfide oxidation. In particular, chemical weathering of granitic rocks is likely the primary source for metals and metalloids in waters. Since the erosion rate is a factor affecting lithological weathering, highintensity rainfalls due to climate change are expected to influence the release and fate of potentially harmful elements in the in the Upper Mustang Valley.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				OCT	2017	76	19							651	10.1007/s12665-017-6991-0								WOS:000412736700007

Water in Central Asia: an integrated assessment for science-based management	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Central Asia contains one of the largest internal drainage basins in the world, and its continental location results in limited availability of both surface and groundwater. Since the twentieth century, water resources of the region have been exploited beyond sustainable levels. From small Mongolian headwater streams to the mighty Aral Sea, surface waters have been partially desiccated. Demands from the agricultural, energy and raw material sectors as well as population growth have not only increased water abstractions, but also left a diverse and strong pollution footprint on rivers, lakes and groundwater bodies. Such changes in water quantity and quality have not only led to a degradation of aquatic and riparian ecosystems, but also they have placed the region's socioeconomic development at risk. Because of the complexity of Central Asia's water problems, integrated assessment and management approaches are required. Despite some shortcomings in practical implementation, the widespread adoption of the Integrated Water Resources Management and water-food-energy nexus approaches may be keys to a more sustainable future. This thematic issue aims to provide documentation of the current state of scientific knowledge, ranging from hydrological research to water quality investigations, and offers an assessment of ecosystems and the services provided by them. Reviews and case studies on different management options conclude the thematic issue by providing insights into field-tested solutions for the region's water challenges.

Experimental investigation of fine sediment deposition using particle image velocimetry	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												In order to create natural and healthy water ecosystems, the impact of hydrological processes in ponds must be identified. Pond structure may affect water quality in many ways. The present study provides a novel insight into some of the hydrological processes as well as how to employ retentions to enhance storm water detention and manage discharge. In this research, particle image velocimetry is utilized to study the two-dimensional collecting efficiency of fine sediments by retention structures with a range of hydraulic features. To examine the hydrodynamic behavior of water mixed with fine particles, a sediment basin was designed. Fluorescent polymer particles (1-50 mu m) were subsequently added to this fluid mix. This study demonstrates that gravitational force increases fine particle settlement by over 50% at greater depths. The optimum collecting efficiency of sediments at the water surface was found to be around 80%. It was also determined that flow rate and particle size are directly correlated and that inlets and outlets at higher levels impede fine particle dispersion in the water column. For these reasons, it seems that adjusting the hydraulic parameters may diminish siltation.

Spatial distribution maps of nitrate pollution for groundwater in the study area were created using a geographical information system (GIS), and the potential for contamination in the entire plain was determined. Seasonal variations of nitrate concentrations in groundwater were assessed by sampling during spring, summer, autumn, and winter in the period April 2012 to January 2013. The groundwater samples were analyzed for nitrate (NO3). The results obtained were evaluated using a number of national and international standards and classifications. Seasonal average concentration distribution maps were established for nitrate to determine the extent and severity of contamination by this parameter in groundwater in the region. The monitoring indicated that nitrate concentrations in only two wells exceeded the recommended drinking water limit and that groundwater beneath the basin is currently suitable for irrigation.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				OCT	2017	76	20							698	10.1007/s12665-017-7044-4								WOS:000413674900001

Impact of Corrosion Control on Biofilm Development in Simulated Partial Lead Service Line Replacements	ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE												Interaction of water quality, flow conditions, and the presence of lead and biofilm was examined in simulated partial lead service line replacement. Recirculating pipe loops were connected to individual 90-L reservoirs, and biofilm was collected from polycarbonate coupons. Three corrosion inhibitors, including sodium orthophosphate (OP) (1 mg-P/L), zinc orthophosphate (ZOP) (1 mg-P/L), or sodium silicate (10 mg/L), were used to treat Pb-Cu pipe loops. Controls included an "inhibitor-free,'' "galvanic free,'' and "lead-free'' with Pb-Cu, Pb-PVC, and PVC-PVC coupled pipe loops, respectively. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) was used to measure energy production of living cells and as a proxy to assess biofilm growth. The two highest (significant) ATP counts were found in the OP (under stagnant conditions) and ZOP (under flow-through conditions). Sodium silicates generally produced lower ATP counts compared to the phosphate-based inhibitors in the flow-through condition, although these differences were not statistically significant. Significant positive correlation between presence of lead and biofilm (ATP) and presence of copper and biofilm (ATP) were observed, although this observation does not imply a linear relationship. Biofilm was observed to act as a significant reservoir for lead with values ranging from 0.06 to 0.81 mu g Pb/cm(2) before chlorination to 0.04 to 0.21 mu g Pb/cm(2) postchlorination. This work highlights the potential for biofilm to act as a reservoir and subsequently as a source of lead release, and underscores the value of including biofilm evaluation when selecting corrosion inhibitors.																	1092-8758	1557-9018				OCT	2017	34	10					711	720		10.1089/ees.2016.0507								WOS:000412299000003

A continuous consumption of polluted water as drinking water or for culinary purposes is by no means a minor hazard for people's health that must be studied. This research presents a new methodology for the spatial analysis of health risk rate from intake of nitratepolluted groundwater. The method is illustrated through its application to a water quality sampling campaign performed in the south of Spain in 2003. The probability risk model used by the US Environmental Protection Agency has been applied, considering a residential intake framework and three representative population age groups (10, 40 and 65 years). The method was based upon coupling Monte Carlo simulations and geostatistics, which allowed mapping of the health risk coefficient (RC). The maps obtained were interpreted in the framework of water resources management and user's health protection (municipalities). The results showed waterborne health risk caused by nitrate-polluted water is moderately low for the region. The observed risk was larger for the elderly and children, although no significant differences were found among the three age groups (RC average values of 95th percentile for age of 0.37, 0.33 and 0.37, respectively). Significant risk values of RC[ 1 were obtained for 10 % of the surface in the NW site of the study area, where the municipalities with the highest contamination thresholds are located (agricultural activity). Nitrate concentration and intake rate stood out as the main explanatory variables of the RC.

Twenty-nine borehole water samples were collected in the dry season (July/August 2012) and another 27 samples from the same localities in the wet season (March 2013) from the study area. The samples were analysed for trace elements arsenic (As), cadmium(Cd), chromium(Cr), selenium (Se), and lead (Pb) using the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry technique. The average concentrations of As, Cd, Cr, Se, and Pb were 11.3, 0.3, 33.1, 7.1, and 6.0 lg/L in the dry season and 11.0, 0.3, 28.3, 4.2, and 6.6 mu lg/L in the wet season, respectively. There was evidence of seasonal fluctuations in concentrations of all analysed elements except for As, though Cd and Pb displayed low concentrations (<0.2 and <6.0 mu g/L, respectively) in almost all sampled boreholes. Se and Cr concentrations slightly exceed the South African National Standard permissible limits for safe drinking water in few boreholes. A total of four boreholes exceeded the water quality guideline for As with two of these boreholes containing five times more As than the prescribed limit. The spatial distribution patterns of elevated As closely correlate with the underlying geology. The findings of this investigation have important implications for human health of the communities drinking from the affected boreholes.																	0269-4042	1573-2983				OCT	2017	39	5					1201	1219		10.1007/s10653-016-9887-0								WOS:000413749200017	27744552

Assessing landscape and contaminant point-sources as spatial determinants of water quality in the Vermilion River System, Ontario, Canada	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												The Vermilion River and major tributaries (VRMT) are located in the Vermilion watershed (4272 km(2)) in north-central Ontario, Canada. This watershed not only is dominated by natural land-cover but also has a legacy of mining and other development activities. The VRMT receive various point (e.g., sewage effluent) and non-point (e.g., mining activity runoff) inputs, in addition to flow regulation features. Further development in the Vermilion watershed has been proposed, raising concerns about cumulative impacts to ecosystem health in the VRMT. Due to the lack of historical assessments on riverine-health in the VRMT, a comprehensive suite of water quality parameters was collected monthly at 28 sites during the ice-free period of 2013 and 2014. Canadian water quality guidelines and objectives were not met by an assortment of water quality parameters, including nutrients and metals. This demonstrates that the VRMT is an impacted system with several pollution hotspots, particularly downstream of wastewater treatment facilities. Water quality throughout the river system appeared to be influenced by three distinct land-cover categories: forest, barren, and agriculture. Three spatial pathway models (geographical, topographical, and river network) were employed to assess the complex interactions between spatial pathways, stressors, and water quality condition. Topographical landscape analyses were performed at five different scales, where the strongest relationships between water quality and land-use occurred at the catchment scale. Sites on the main stem of Junction Creek, a tributary impacted by industrial and urban development, had above average concentrations for the majority of water quality parameters measured, including metals and nitrogen. The river network pathway (i.e., asymmetric eigenvector map (AEM)) and topographical feature (i.e., catchment land-use) models explained most of the variation in water quality (62.2%), indicating that they may be useful tools in assessing the spatial determinants of water quality decline.

Vegetation restoration projects have been carried out. However, the influences of water quality and hydrology on vegetation restoration from seed banks have been rarely investigated. This experiment aimed to identify the effect of water level and nitrogen loading (ammonium and nitrate) on seedling emergence and recruitment from the riparian seed bank of the river in this basin. Most of the species in the seed bank germinated under moist conditions. Under flooding conditions, however, the growth of aquatic species, especially Vallisneria natans (Lour.) Hara, was inhibited when the nitrogen concentration increased. At 0.37 mg/L NH4+-N in the water column, the growth of V. natans was inhibited. The results suggested that flooding was a primary limiting factor of seedling emergence. The inhibitory effect of high nitrogen loading on the growth of aquatic species was one of the main driving mechanisms of macrophyte degradation under flooding conditions; nevertheless, competitive advantage might determine the community pattern in moist habitats. Therefore, water level control and water quality improvement should be the key aspects of vegetation restoration in degraded rivers or lakes.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				OCT	2017	24	28					22688	22697		10.1007/s11356-017-9926-0								WOS:000412452200055	28815432

Arsenic constitutes a broad range of elements from the Earth's crust and is released into the environment from both anthropogenic and natural sources due to its relative mobility under different redox conditions. The toxicity of arsenic is described in its inorganic form, as inorganic arsenic compounds can leach into different environments. Sampling was carried out in the Bestari Jaya catchment while using a land use map to locate the site, and experiments were conducted via sequential extraction and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy to quantify proportions of arsenic in the sediment samples. The results show that metals in sediments of nonresidual fractions, which are more likely to be likely released into aquatic environments, are more plentiful than the residual sediment fractions. These findings support the mobility of heavy metals and especially arsenic through sediment layers, which can facilitate remediation in environments heavily polluted with heavy metals.

Thirteen stations along Alur Ilmu were selected to produce thematic maps through spatial distribution analysis based on six water quality parameters of Malaysia's Water Quality Index (WQI) for dry and raining seasons. The maps generated were used to identify the highly polluted region for phytoremediation applicability assessment. Four free-floating plants were tested in treating water samples from the highly polluted region under three different conditions, namely controlled, aerated and normal treatments. The selected free-floating plants were water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), water lettuce (Pistia stratiotes), rose water lettuce (Pistia sp.) and pennywort (Centella asiatica). The results showed that Alur Ilmu was more polluted during dry season compared to raining season based on the water quality analysis. During dry season, four parameters were marked as polluted along Alur Ilmu, namely dissolve oxygen (DO), 4.72 mg/L (class III); ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3-N), 0.85 mg/L (class IV); total suspended solid (TSS), 402 mg/L (class V) and biological oxygen demand (BOD), 3.89 mg/L (class III), whereas, two parameters were classed as polluted during raining season, namely total suspended solid (TSS), 571 mg/L (class V) and biological oxygen demand (BOD), 4.01 mg/L (class III). The thematic maps generated from spatial distribution analysis using Kriging gridding method showed that the highly polluted region was recorded at station AL 5. Hence, water samples were taken from this station for pollution removal analysis. All the free-floating plants were able to reduce TSS and COD in less than 14 days. However, water hyacinth showed the least detrimental effect from the phytoremediation process compared to other free-floating plants, thus made it a suitable free-floating plants to be used for on-site treatment.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				OCT	2017	24	29			SI		22873	22884		10.1007/s11356-017-0079-y								WOS:000412453500012	28905277					
J	Olowe, KO; Kumarasamy, M				Olowe, Kayode O.; Kumarasamy, Muthukrishnavellaisamy			Development of the hybrid cells in series model to simulate ammonia nutrient pollutant transport along the Umgeni River	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Discharge of organic waste results in high nutrient pollution of the water bodies which is a major menace to the environment. A high quantity of nutrients such as ammonia causes a reduction in the dissolved oxygen level and induces algal growth in the water bodies. Water quality models have been the tools to evaluate the rate at which streams can disperse the pollutants they receive. Many water quality models are flawed either because of their inadequacy to completely simulate the advection component of the pollutant transport, or because of the limited application of the models, due to inaccurate estimation of model parameters. The hybrid cell in series (HCIS) developed by Ghosh et al. (2004) has been able to overcome such difficulties associated with the mixing cell-based models. Thus, the current study focuses on developing an analytical solution for the pollutant transport of the ammonia concentration through the plug flow, the first and second well-mixed cells of the HCIS model. The HCIS model coupled with the first order kinetic equation for ammonia nutrient was developed to simulate the ammonia pollutant concentration in the water column. The ammonia concentration at various points along the river system was assessed by considering the effects of the transformation of ammonia to nitrite, the uptake of ammonia by the algae, the respiration rate of the algae and the input of benthic source to the ammonia concentration in the water column. The proposed model was tested using synthetic data, and the HCIS-NH3 model simulations for spatial and temporal variation of ammonia pollutant transport were analysed. The simulated results of the HCIS-NH3 model agreed with the Fickian-based advection-dispersion equation (ADE) for simulating ammonia concentration solved using an explicit finite difference scheme. The HCIS-NH3 model also showed a good agreement with the observed data from the Umgeni River, except during rainy periods.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				OCT	2017	24	29			SI		22967	22979		10.1007/s11356-017-9916-2								WOS:000412453500019	28819754

This paper presents total characteristics of sediments collected from Jiaxing, China. Size distribution and concentrations of volatile solids (VS) and four metals (Pb, Cu, Zn, Cr) of sediment samples from seven land use categories were analyzed. Then, the sediment samples were graded five fractions according to its settling velocity through the custom-built settling velocity-grading device. Sediment mass and pollution load distribution based on settling velocity were also assessed. The results show that there are relatively high level of heavy metal load in the sediment of separated storm drainage systems in Jiaxing, especially for the catchment of residential area (RA), road of developed area (RDA), and industrial area (IA). Although grain size follows a trend of increasing along with settling velocity, the methods of settling velocity grading are meaningful for stormwater treatment facilities with precipitation. For all land use categories, the pollution concentrations of the three lower settling velocity-fractionated sediment are relatively consistent and higher than others. Combined with mass distribution, the pollution percentage of fraction with different velocities for seven land use categories were also evaluated. Based on it, the statistical conclusion of design target settling velocity to different pollution load removal rates are drawn, which is helpful to guide design of on-site precipitation separation facilities.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				OCT	2017	24	29			SI		23133	23143		10.1007/s11356-017-9882-8								WOS:000412453500032	28828552

To gain insights into the predominant factors affecting the fate of ARGs in a highly polluted urban river in eastern China, a total of 285 ARGs, microbial communities, and 20 physicochemical parameters were analyzed for 17 sites. A total of 258 unique ARGs were detected using high-throughput qPCR, and the absolute abundance of total ARGs was positively correlated with total organic carbon and total dissolved nitrogen concentrations (P < 0.01). ARG abundance and diversity were greatly altered by microbial community structure. Variation partitioning analysis showed that the combined effects of multiple factors contributed to the profile and dissemination of ARGs, and variation of microbial communities was the major factor affecting the distribution of ARGs. The disparate distribution of some bacteria, including Bacteroides from mammalian gastrointestinal flora, Burkholderia from zoonotic infectious diseases, and Zoogloea from wastewater treatment, indicates that the urban river was strongly influenced by point-source pollution. Results imply that microbial community shifts caused by changes in water quality may lead to the spread of ARGs, and point-source pollution in urban rivers requires greater attention to control the transfer of ARGs between environmental bacteria and pathogens.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				OCT	2017	24	30					23753	23762		10.1007/s11356-017-0032-0								WOS:000412930300031	28864929

With the combined drivers of climate change and human activities, eutrophication has expanded from warm shallow lakes to cold-water lakes in relatively high latitude regions and has raised greater concerns over lake aquatic ecosystem health. A two-year field study was carried out to investigate water quality, phytoplankton characteristics and eutrophication status in a typical alpine glacial lake of Tianchi, a scenic area and an important drinking water source in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region of China, in 2014 and 2015. Clear seasonal and annual variations of nutrients and organic pollutants were found especially during rainy seasons. For the phytoplankton community, Bacillariophyta held the dominant position in terms of both species and biomass throughout the year, suggesting the dominant characteristics of diatoms in the phytoplankton structure in such a high-altitude cold-water lake. This was quite different from plain and warm lakes troubled with cyanobacterial blooming. Moreover, the dominant abundance of Cyclotella sp. in Tianchi might suggest regional warming caused by climate change, which might have profound effects on the local ecosystems and hydrological cycle. Based on water quality parameters, a comprehensive trophic level index TLI (Sigma) was calculated to estimate the current status of eutrophication, and the results inferred emerging eutrophication in Tianchi. Results from Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) and correlation analysis of phytoplankton genera and physico-chemical variables of water indicated that abiotic factors significantly influenced the phytoplankton community and its succession in Tianchi Lake. These abiotic factors could explain 77.82% of the total variance, and ammonium was identified as the most discriminant variable, which could explain 41% of the total variance followed by TP (29%). An estimation of annual nutrient loadings to Tianchi was made, and the results indicated that about 212.97 t of total nitrogen and 32.14 t of total phosphorus were transported into Tianchi Lake annually. Human socio-economic activities (runoff caused by historical overgrazing and increasing tourism) were identified as the most important contributors to Tianchi nutrient loadings.

Therefore this study was conducted to study the presence of few specific antibiotic resistance genes, which imparts resistance to commonly used antibiotics in a rural drinking water plant in Louisiana, USA. Samples were taken from raw intake water, the treated water in holding tank at the water treatment facility, and an offsite consumer source serviced by the distribution line. Water quality analysis uncovered increase in organic carbon in distributed water. No live bacteria were found in the treated or distributed water, but bacterial DNA in the form of 16s rRNA was consistently found. Isolates of antibiotic resistant E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aerugenosa, and Klebsiella pneumonia were found in the raw intake water. Antibiotic resistance genes, tetA and sun were observed in the raw intake showing the presence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) and antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) in the raw intake water. However, no ARGs or ARB were found in the treated and distributed water. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The bioflocs is capable of controlling water quality through absorption of undesirable nutrients in wastewater. It also contains microalgae such as Chlorella sp. that can be harvested for use in aqua culture applications. Nevertheless, the current harvesting technologies are based on chemicals or expensive membrane filtration. This study investigated the utilization of chitosan as a natural biocoagulant to harvest Chlorella sp. with an emphasis on the coagulation flocculation efficiency. The optimum dosage of chitosan at 30 mgri achieved 98% of microalgae removal efficiency and 80% of biomass recovery. The treated water was safe within a neutral pH level with less than 5 NTU of turbidity. The results show that chitosan can be an alternative and environmental-friendly bio-coagulant for microalgae harvesting. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The purpose of this study was to explore techniques for describing microbial water quality in rural drinking water wells, based on spatiotemporal analysis, time series analysis and relative risk mapping. Tests results for Escherichia coli and coliforms from private and small public well water samples, collected between 2004 and 2012 in Alberta, Canada, were used for the analysis. Overall, 14.6 and 1.5% of the wells were total coliform and E. coli-positive, respectively. Private well samples were more often total coliform or E. coli-positive compared with untreated public well samples. Using relative risk mapping we were able to identify areas of higher risk for bacterial contamination of groundwater in the province not previously identified. Incorporation of time series analysis demonstrated peak contamination occurring for E. coli in July and a later peak for total coliforms in September, suggesting a temporal dissociation between these indicators in terms of groundwater quality, and highlighting the potential need to increase monitoring during certain periods of the year.

Impacts of the Mississippi River spillway opening on faecal coliform concentration in Lake Pontchartrain	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												This study focuses on explaining the role of the periodic opening of the Bonnet Carre Spillway on the faecal coliform levels in Lake Pontchartrain. Water quality data were collected by the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation to analyse the faecal coliform bacteria levels, turbidity, salinity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen in the lake water. The results show that the faecal coliform concentrations were lower during the spillway opening than the preceding and subsequent months. Statistical analysis shows the dilution effect, characterized by an effective reduction in faecal coliform concentrations due to increase in water turbidity, coupled with decrease in water salinity and dissolved oxygen because of spillway opening. It is also indicated that the combine effect of more than one factor produces a significantly greater reduction in the faecal coliform than each factor acting independently. Periodic spikes in faecal coliform concentrations were observed at sampling points located near the outlets of streams and drainage canals with high settlement densities. A positive correlation (r=0.78467) was found between the average faecal coliform counts and average monthly precipitations, highlighting the role of precipitation run-offs. The results of this study indicate that the spillway opening contributed to a reduction in the faecal coliform concentration in the lake's surface water during the studied periods.																	1535-1459	1535-1467				OCT	2017	33	8					1327	1335		10.1002/rra.3179								WOS:000412518100010
