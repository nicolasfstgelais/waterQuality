Results showed that dissolved metals in surface waters, which were analyzed by means of flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry, followed the concentration levels (Pb>Ni>Fe>Cu>Cr>Co>Mn>Cd>Zn) on the southern and (Ni>Pb>Fe>Cu>Cr>Zn>Mn>Co>Cd) on the northern coasts of Sfax, and (Ni>Fe>Pb>Cu>Cr>Zn>Co>Cd>Mn) in the Ghannouch area. In the southern and the northern coasts of Sfax, all analyzed metals were detected in 100% of sampled stations except Co, which was revealed in 90 and 80% of stations, respectively. However, in the Ghannouch area all analyzed metals were detected in 100% of sampled stations except Mn, which was revealed in 70% of stations. These trace elements, except for Fe and Mn, exceeded the safety limit of the USEPA water quality criteria for the protection of aquatic fauna and flora survival and their uses. The Sfax and Ghannouch coastal areas should be considered relatively polluted with metals (Zn, Ni, Pb, Co, Cr, Cd, and Cu). The elevated metal contents were attributed to anthropogenic waste inputs around the study area. The main sources of Ni and Co loading in the seawater were the SIAPE phosphoric acid and fertilizer plant and a waste water treatment plant located close to station 1. Whereas the fishing harbor of Sfax, which is situated on the southern coast (station 9), is the second source of high amounts of Cd, Mn, Cr, and Pb. This situation has led to serious human health risks and chronic toxicity caused by their potential bioaccumulation in some aquatic fauna such as shrimp, fish, crab, shellfish, mollusk, and cephalopoda.																	1230-1485	2083-5906					2017	26	3					1057	1069		10.15244/pjoes/67529								WOS:000403567900011

The objective of this study was to analyze the occurrence of cyanotoxic risk in the catchment area of the Obrzyca River, which is a source of drinking water for the inhabitants of Zielona Gora. At the points of Uscie and at its tributary at Wojnowo, the river was more exposed to the blooms of toxigenic algae, whose active microcystins synthesize more here than in other places (Sadowo, Chwalim, Ostrzyce, Lubiatow). Throughout the study, conducted in 2008-12, we observed several times that the amounts of cyanobacteria exceeded 500.10(3) individuals per litre (ind. .dm(-3)). The observed cyanobacterial blooms were dominated by the following species: Dolichospermum flos-aquae and Planktothrix agardhii in the Obrzyca River at Uscie, and D. spiroides, D. affinis, and Aphanizomenon flos-aquae at its tributary in Wojnowo. The maximum value of intracellular MC-LR, totalling 21.4 mu g.dm(-3), was found at Wojnowo in September 2011. The analysis of the physico-chemical water quality indicators showed that the places along the Obrzyca River where periodic cyanobacterial blooms took place were characterized by eutrophic conditions, and the total nitrogen to total phosphorus ratio (N/P) fell within the range of 10 to 16, and the water temperature exceeded 20 degrees C. In order to assess the toxic hazard caused by periodic cyanobacterial blooms in the catchment area of the Obrzyca River for drinking water for Zielona Gora residents, regular monitoring of the cyanobacteria and their toxins is required-especially at the points in Uscie and Wojnowo as well as at the water intake at the water treatment plant (WTP) in Zawada (in central-western Poland).

To solve such incompatibility and evaluate the health condition of a river ecosystem objectively we can use the river health integrated index (RHI), which was determined by the fuzzy matter-element extension assessment model (FMEAM). FMEAM was established by combining the fuzzy matter-element extension assessment method with the proposed aggregative index system. By employing the model above, as well as data from the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, we evaluated the health state of the Luanhe River. The results showed that the Luanhe River was in a sub-healthy state in the 1980s and in an unhealthy state in the 1990s and 2000s. The reasons leading to the Luanhe River's health degradation have been analyzed. Among them, water conservation projects' building and operations are the major influence factors. Waste water emissions, the expansion of urban built-up areas, over exploitation of groundwater, and other unreasonable human activities also intensified the river ecosystem degradation. Finally, countermeasures for the ecological restoration and protection of the river were put forward.																	1230-1485	2083-5906					2017	26	3					1353	1361		10.15244/pjoes/67369								WOS:000403567900042

However, very limited studies have been done to explore its potential in decreasing phytoplankton in subtropical shallow lakes. We hypothesize that macrophyte restoration can also decrease phytoplankton and shift community structures in subtropical shallow lakes. In order to test our hypothesis, we consistently investigated submerged macrophytes, nutrients, and phytoplankton for three years in a shallow subtropical lake. Multiple analytical methods were employed to assess the effect of macrophyte restoration on the phytoplankton community. The results showed that the density and biomass of total phytoplankton after restoration were less compared to those before the restoration. During the restoration, species diversity significantly increased every year, but the change in species richness was not significant. Moreover, phytoplankton community structure also transformed greatly. Especially cyanobacteria density gradually decreased until almost disappeared; Chlorophyta density also significantly decreased from 4.6 x 10(6) cell/L to 1.9 x 10(6) cell/L. Although changes in the densities of other groups were not significant, their ratios in total phytoplankton significantly increased. The changes in four dominant species were also significant during the restoration, with Microcystis aeruginosa, M. incerta, and Chlamydomonas sp. significantly decreasing, but Chlorella pyrenoidosa significantly increasing. Correlation analysis between phytoplankton and environmental factors (macrophyte and water quality) showed that macrophytes were negatively correlated with total phytoplankton, TN, and COD, but total phytoplankton was positively correlated with TN and COD. These relations indicated that macrophyte restoration might not only directly inhibit phytoplankton growth, but also indirectly decrease phytoplankton by both bottom-up and top-down controls of phytoplankton. Therefore, these results basically proved our hypothesis, and more attention should be focused on this method in future lake management.																	1230-1485	2083-5906					2017	26	3					1363	1373		10.15244/pjoes/68228								WOS:000403567900043

For that purpose, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was developed able to forecast one month ahead the Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) levels and by that way to act as a warning tool when a HAB event might follow. Sampling data from eleven monitoring stations were collected from Lake Pamvotis (Greece), a shallow hypereutrophic lake, affected by HABs. The created ANN managed with high accuracy to simulate the next month's Chl-a concentration, establishing it as a reliable predictor that represents well the non-linear relationships between the Chl-a and the environmental parameters. The significance of each environmental parameter associated with eutrophication was also examined. Focusing on the contribution of the environmental parameters three different methods that give the ANN model sensitivity are applied: (i) the 'Perturb' method; (ii) the 'Weights' method; (iii) the `PaD' ('Partial Derivatives') method. A combined parameter importance index was introduced, in order to overcome the computational differences resulted from the three methods. The combined interpretation of the results produced led to useful conclusions regarding the effect of each parameter on the eutrophication process.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	5					3200	3208										WOS:000403134800013

Anthropogenic activities greatly alter the water quality of the Danube, physico-chemicaly and biologically. Water quality monitoring is therefore a priority activity, in order to assess arising environmental risks and act accordingly. Floating catering facilities (i.e. raft restaurants) on the Danube in Serbia may compromise physical, chemical and biological conditions of the river water. Those use septic tanks, emptied directly into the river, without treatment of any kind. The composition of this waste corresponds to the category of municipal waste, and as such is rich in organic matter at various stages of decomposition, as well as foecal bacteria, many of which are opportunistic pathogens. In order to examine the impact of such facilities on river water, micro-hydrolo-cation of raft restaurant "Noah's Ark" in Novi Sad was used, as a representative of the type, with the permission of the Management Board. The water was sampled in the vicinity, upstream and downstream, during normal operation, and during the discharge of its septic tank. Physical, chemical and bacteriological water quality parameters were evaluated. The results of the study show the possibility of the occurrence of ecological shock moments, related to the discharge of wastewater into the Danube, which are detectable in a range of changes in the oxygen regime to restructuring entire bacteriobiocoenotic communities in the surrounding water.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	5					3358	3364										WOS:000403134800031						
J	Jiang, HM; Si, WT; Li, X				Jiang, Haiming; Si, Wantong; Li, Xia			A NOVEL BIOSENSOR BASED ON MICROBIAL ELECTROLYSIS CELL FOR RAPID ANALYSIS OF BIOCHEMICAL OXYGEN DEMAND	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN												BOD measurement is often required for evaluation of water quality. Most used 5-day BOD measurement method is time consuming and requires skills. Although MFC based biosensors can measure BOD rapidly, they suffer oxygen leakage problem, damping the wide spread application. In this study, a novel biosensor for rapid determination of BOD was developed based on microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) technique, and its performance was evaluated. The biosensor utilized maximum current and coulomb yield as indicators of BOD level. For the best performance, system parameters were optimized as external applied voltage to be 0.7-0.9 volts, artificial BOD to be 10 to 100 mg/L when maximum current was measured and 10 to 400 mg/L when coulomb yield was measured. At the optimal conditions, the sensor responded to BOD linearly and was able to complete each measure in 10 min and 80-400 min respectively using maximum current and coulomb yield as BOD indicator. The repeatability of the system was high as indicated by relative standard deviation less than +/- 13% for 6 measurements. For stability test, the system was stable over a period of 12 days as evaluated by relative standard deviation less than +/- 10.3%. These results demonstrated that MEC can be employed as a biosensor for on-line or off-line monitoring of BOD.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	5					3455	3464										WOS:000403134800044

In this paper, water chemistry and isotopes (H-2, O-18, H-3) were used to study hydrogeochemical evolution and fluoride accumulation. The results show that from river water to groundwater in the upper and lower part of the piedmont alluvial-proluvial plain, the main ions and fluoride shows systematic increase. The saturation index of fluorite seems to control the maximum fluoride content. Fluoride-minerals in the aquifers will continue to dissolve when fluorite is under saturated. Stable isotopes show that evaporation is not obvious during groundwater recharge and fluoride accumulation by evaporation concentration is limited. The high fluoride in groundwater is primarily caused by the protogenic geochemical processes in the basin.

J	Saluja, R; Garg, JK				Saluja, Ridhi; Garg, J. K.			Macrophyte species composition and structure along littoral region in relation to limnological variables of a tropical wetland ecosystem	CHEMISTRY AND ECOLOGY												The composition and structure of macrophyte communities of the littoral region of Bhinda was wetland (India) was investigated. Two hypotheses were tested: (1) if limnological variables such as water chemistry and soil parameters are important determinants of species composition and abundance and (2) what is the variance in species richness and composition within the wetland. Twenty-eight macrophyte species belonging to 17 different families were identified with relatively low species diversity and richness (H' = 2.09; Margalef index = 1.12). Eichhornia crassipes, attained the highest relative frequency (22.69%), followed by Salvinia natans, Paspalum paspaloides, Phragmites karka, Cynodon dactylon and Cyperus alopecuroides. The first and second axis of CCA ordination explained 38.4% and 28.5% of the total variance of species-limnological variables relationship, respectively. Water-related variables (dissolved oxygen, pH and nitrate concentration) and soil nutrient factors (soil carbon and phosphorus levels) were significantly correlated to macrophyte distribution. Sampling sites formed two distinct groups based on cluster analysis, indicating varying ecological conditions. Generally, composition and abundance of macrophytes evince highly productive nature of the lake, while dominance of invasive species like E. crassipes and S. natans indicates high influence of increased nutrient levels and anthropogenic activities in the catchment on lake macrophyte composition.

In this study, we used comprehensive physiochemical indicators to assess the quality of groundwater used for drinking and irrigation in addition to the potential risks to local residents in a riverbank filtration site. Human health risks through drinking water intake and dermal contact were also estimated. Moreover, we analyzed the spatial distribution regularities of health risk values in a riverbank filtration site. The assessment results revealed that NH4-N, NO2-N, F-, Mn, and As are main contaminants affecting groundwater quality and that 62% of the total samples is suitable for a variety of purposes. All groundwater in the study area is suitable for irrigation based on the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), Na percentage (%Na), and U.S. Salinity Laboratory (USSL) and Wilcox diagrams. The health risk assessment suggests that residents in the study area are at high health risk, and women and children face higher risk than men in both non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks. The spatial distribution regularities of health risk values suggest that the human health risk value of each groundwater sample is different in the study area and has certain regularity. Therefore, effective measurements must be taken to address the groundwater contamination and to reduce the human health risks.																	1080-7039	1549-7860					2017	23	4					705	726		10.1080/10807039.2016.1277413								WOS:000401752300004

However, there were some reports on the poor water quality status of water sources in the past. In the present study, by applying fuzzy synthetic evaluation, the water quality was studied from a total of 24 water samples from a reservoir-type water source in the northeastern region of China. Health risks of eight trace elements in source water were assessed using health risk assessment model and Monte Carlo simulation, and source apportionment of eight trace elements in source water were also analyzed. The results indicated that the water quality of the source water was acceptable for category I surface water, while the concentrations of total phosphorus (TP) and manganese (Mn) were higher than the permissible level. The noncarcinogenic risks due to eight trace elements exposure were As > Mn > Pb > Cd approximate to Cr > Se > Zn > Cu and carcinogenic risk of Arsenic (As) was 3E-05 with a maximum probability. Furthermore, statistical analyses, such as correlation analysis, principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA) showed that the trace metals in the water source have a certain degree of anthropogenic contributions, especially Mn. Overall, both the contents of TP and Mn and the health risk of As require some attention of the relevant department, and further protected measures should be taken in the source water.																	1080-7039	1549-7860					2017	23	4					751	766		10.1080/10807039.2016.1278518								WOS:000401752300007

Groundwater samples (n = 100) were collected from ten different towns of Lahore District (Pakistan). Arsenic concentration ranged from 2 to 111 mu g L-1 in groundwater samples of the study area, which was significantly greater than the safe limit of As (10 mu g L-1) in drinking water set by the World Health Organization. Health risk assessment of As showed that HQ (0.1-11) for oral exposure and HI (0.1-11) values also exceeded the typical toxic risk index value of 1. 9.75 x E-05-4.59 x E-03 and 5.89 x E-07-2.77 x E-05 for oral and dermal As exposure, respectively. Both CR and cancer index (CIs) values were higher than United States Environmental Protection Agency limit (10(-6)), suggesting that people are at high risk of As-induced carcinogenicity from oral and dermal exposure to As in drinking water. It was concluded that As contamination of groundwater causes carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic health effects to the people; therefore, urgent management and remedial actions are required to protect people from As poisoning.

J	Lizotte, RE; Moore, MT				Lizotte, Richard E.; Moore, Matthew T.			Effectiveness of emergent and submergent aquatic plants in mitigating a nitrogen-permethrin mixture	CHEMISTRY AND ECOLOGY												Hydraulically connected wetland microcosms (approximate to 50L) in series were used to test the effectiveness of varying combinations of two common aquatic vascular plants, parrot feather (Myriophyllum aquaticum) and cattail (Typha latifolia), for mitigating contamination from a mixture of nitrogen (ammonium nitrate) and permethrin. The upstream series included Myriophyllum only (M) and Typha only (T) while the combination upstream effluent into downstream series included Myriophyllum into Myriophyllum (M+M) and Typha into Myriophyllum (T+M). During flow, M into M+M more efficiently mitigated nitrogen than T into T+M. Post-flow, nitrogen removal efficiency was greater for T versus M and M+M versus T+M. Mean aqueous dissipation half-lives (t(1/2)) of NH4-N and NO3-N were more rapid in T than M treatments. Ammonium and nitrate t(1/2) was highly correlated with aquatic plant above-ground shoot biomass. Permethrin mitigation efficiencies and t(1/2) were not significantly affected by plant species either singly or in combination. Trans-permethrin t(1/2) was moderately correlated with plant biomass, but not cis-permethrin t(1/2). Results of this study indicate differences in aquatic plant species and flow path influence nitrogen removal but not permethrin. However, plant species appears less important than overall plant biomass in ascertaining aquatic plant effectiveness in mitigating a nitrogen-permethrin mixture.																	0275-7540	1029-0370					2017	33	5					420	433		10.1080/02757540.2017.1310849								WOS:000401448600004

Thus, a comprehensive assessment of groundwater quality is critical for local residents. The hydrochemical characteristics of both shallow aquifer (14) and deep aquifer (11) were determined. The concentrations of the cations in the shallow groundwater decrease in the order of Na+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > K+, while in the deep groundwater in the order of Ca2+ > Na+ > Mg2+ > Kt classifying both groundwater as Ca2+-Na+ type. The contents of anions in both shallow and deep groundwater follow a similar pattern as HCO3- > Cl- > SO42- > NO3-, with HCO3- as the dominant species. The mean values of pH, electrical conductivity and total dissolved solid of shallow groundwater were higher than those in deep groundwater. Three groups of water were generated from hierarchical cluster analysis to test water quality data of their hydrochemical parameters. The factor analysis on different water quality parameters indicated that most of their variations can be explained by natural dissolved salts and anthropogenic activities. The assessment of water quality shows that deep groundwater is generally suitable for drinking and agricultural irrigation. In contrast, great caution should be taken when using shallow groundwater for irrigation or drinking. Appropriate technologies are thus required for shallow groundwater to reduce the salinity and sodium compounds before irrigation and to reduce F, Mn and total dissolved solid before drinking																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	4					2541	2549										WOS:000400806100008

Throughout the experiment, control ponds were higher than the corresponding floating bed ponds in ammonia concentration by 6.2 similar to 75.7 %, and 12.4 similar to 43.2 %, respectively. The unionized ammonia concentrations of the two control ponds were 2.58 similar to 8.86-fold higher than that of the corresponding experimental ponds. In the Ipomoea aquatica fibrous roots, the amoA copy numbers of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) ranged from (1.16 +/- 0.01) x 10(5) to (2.33 +/- 0.24) x 10(6) copy g(-1), and those of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) ranged from (5.41 +/- 0.25) x 10(3) to (3.82 +/- 0.37) x 10(4) copy g(-1). The Ipomoea aquatica floating bed can efficiently remove ammonia in intensive aquaculture pond, especially can decrease the unionized ammonia level and the unionized ammonia toxicity to fish. It was assumed that the decrease of the unionized ammonia level was resulted from the pH decrease, which was contributed by the floating bed through algal photosynthesis inhibition. High richness of AOB and AOA in the Ipomoea aquatica rhizosphere indicated that the rhizospheric ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms played a vital role in ammonia removal.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	4					2699	2705										WOS:000400806100028

This research modified calculation method of crop yield, on the basis of SWAT model considering temperature as one of the most important factors of controlling crop growth. Based on the source model calculating potential yield, the formula set phase relative evapotranspiration as variable and this method divided the growth stage through the fraction of accumulated heat units for considering different sensibility for water deficit on each stage. The modified SWAT model was simulated in Zhuozhang River Basin. The determination coefficient R-2 and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient Ens of ET data from 2003 to 2004 were 0.88 and 0.87 respectively. The simulation yield followed a similar trend as the actual yield and showed high determination coefficient R2 and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient Ens values.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	4					2706	2712										WOS:000400806100029

The results show that for influent turbidity in the range of 0.14 to 0.32 NTU, the effluent turbidity can be reduced to below 0.1 NTU within 30 min through the optimization of the backwash procedure with a low flow rate. Moreover, with the further dosage of an additional 0.2 mg/L poly aluminum ferric chloride (PAFC) immediately after backwashing for approximately 12 min, the effluent turbidity can be reduced to 0.1 NTU and maintained below 0.1 NTU until approximately 48 h of filtering without using additional coagulant. The new technique not only can shorten the filter ripening period and enhance the water quality but also can decrease the consumption of coagulant and lower the operating costs.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	4					2771	2777										WOS:000400806100037

This is particularly the case for central developers (Ministry, Municipality, Special Administration and so on) in the development of land use decisions. As a matter of fact, one of the duties placed in front of our country Turkey during the EU membership process is the preparation of the main spatial data infrastructures on the basis of each basin to manage river basins. In this process, first of all the following procedures should be done to determine watershed based land use within administrative borders. Protected areas, wetlands, forests, rangeland and plateau areas, agricultural protected areas, water collection lines, creek deposits, geologically objectionable areas, built-up areas, landslide susceptible areas should be digitally created in the ITRF system together with property information and ownership data. The use of this data will greatly facilitate the determination of decision-makers, appropriate land management and practices. It is known that basin based spatial data infrastructures have not yet been established in Turkey at this point. It has been found that environmental planning has been established without these data and based on these plans, so incorrect land use decisions have been developed. With this study, spatial data structures for river basins, which are obliged to prepare especially in EU membership process, have been created with the help of GIS technologies. In this process, proposals have been developed for resolving the problems faced by technical, institutional and legal aspects.

Violent fluctuations in water levels may lead to worsening water quality effects and destruction of plant growth. Ecological floating beds provide an effective way to overcome the problems, yet limited information regarding Sphagnum purification has been obtained in the open water environment. The ability of Sphagnum survival and its correlation to nutrients enrichment in violently fluctuating riverside wetland water as applied to the ecological floating bed are investigated in this study. Ecological floating beds, with Sphagnum fallax and Sphagnum squarossum, were chosen for nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) enrichment. The results indicated that changes of water quality (high N low P, low N high P) resulting from water level fluctuations in test areas were beneficial for the survival of Sphagnum species, especially in flood periods that high carbon content of water could effectively stimulate the growth of Sphagnum species. Following four months of field tests, the amounts of N and P enrichment in Sphagnum squarossum were 2.29 and 0.82 mg/g dry weight, respectively, while in Sphagnum fallax were 1.98 and 0.64 mg/g dry weight. N enrichment was superior to P for both Sphagnum moss types. The release of nutrients, especially P, can be controlled effectively by harvesting Sphagnum species in early winter. This study could be useful for improved understanding of water restoration in violent fluctuating degraded riverine wetland by eutrophic Sphagnum mosses.

INVESTIGATION OF STURGEON MIGRATION ROUTES USING THE MOST ADEQUATE MONITORING TECHNIQUES IN DIFFICULT HYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS OF THE DANUBE RIVER	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY												The Danube River is one of the most studied rivers in Europe. Its characteristics regarding biodiversity, hydrological conditions and water quality represent very interesting research domains. Since 2011, INCDPM (National Institute of Research and Development in Environmental Protection) runs a research project to monitor the impact of the hydrotechnical works on the aquatic ecosystems. In the present the project is in the post-construction phase, the hydrotechnical works were finished in 2016. They were realised for improving the navigation in the Lower Danube, Calarasi Braila sector (km 375 - km 175) and mean the construction of a bottom sill on Bala, one of the Danube branches. During the construction period, from 2011 to 2015, 315 sturgeon specimens of the 4 species that reproduce in the Lower Danube sector were captured, marked and released in order to identify the migration routes of them and the impact of the hydrotechnical works on their conservation status. There were analyzed the morphological modifications of river section in the bottom sill area and what kind of hydrological modifications has implied the construction. Also there was analysed the behaviour of the sturgeon specimens which have crossed the bottom sill upon different values of water flows and water velocities and the potential of those specimens to swim against too high water currents.

PERFORMANT TECHNOLOGY TO REMOVE ORGANIC AND INORGANIC POLLUTANTS FROM WASTEWATERS	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY												Nationally, discharge of treated insufficient or untreated wastewater is one of the main causes of pollution and degradation of soil, groundwater and surface water. Therefore, the main practical measures to protect water quality and soil are the wastewater treatment, which involves collecting them through sewage systems, cleaning in treatment plants followed by discharge either into the emissary, either in sewer according with the standards in force. The National Institute for Research and Development in Environment Protection had as a partner, ongoing a financing contract which was part of the Sectoral Operational Programme 'Increase of Economic Competitiveness', the direct beneficiary of the contract being the Society Echipa Horse and the main contracting authority was the National Authority for Scientific Research of Romania of Romania. Within this project was acquired the Juggler mobile technology. The practical relevance of the paper consist from the fact that the technology can be used in areas where there is no cleaning station (70% of the nation-wide), and in the activities from which results treated waters loaded with various hazardous pollutants, the technology being mobile, moving where necessary. The paper presents the results of tests conducted by a team of researchers from INCDPM and the results of the tests with the automated treatment technology on the wastewaters, their interpretation being done in accordance with the laws in force.																	1311-5065						2017	18	1					304	312										WOS:000401304800031

Spatial and seasonal variations of the microbiological condition of water sources in a dry tropical hydrographic system were determined, and the domestic water management was characterized to assess threats to family health. Twenty-two sources in eighteen localities, in dry and rainy seasons, were analyzed during two years. The microbiological condition of the sources was deficient by the presence of 35 species of thermotolerant coliforms, ten of them with high pathogenic importance (HPI). The pollution was most severe during rainy season due to the significant increase in the richness of HPI species and the number of sites affected at different altitudes and order flow within the watersheds. The use of water disinfection techniques was registered in 49 % of the surveyed families, who pointed out also have received information about the topic. The 45 % of interviewed declared suffering from diseases transmitted by water (diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever and vomiting) annually, although 72 % of the cases exposed to medical services had not been diagnosed. The highest contamination by HPI in rainfall season responds to the transportation and leaching of fecal material accumulated along dry season in riparian areas coming from livestock, wildlife and human population without sanitation services. The difficult control of diffuse pollution highlights the importance of increasing the information and monitoring of the household water management by rural vulnerable population as part of strategies for water security in seasonal rural watersheds.																	0188-4999						2017	33	2					199	213		10.20937/RICA.2017.33.02.02								WOS:000401070900002

A systematic evaluation of chemicals in hydraulic-fracturing fluids and wastewater for reproductive and developmental toxicity	JOURNAL OF EXPOSURE SCIENCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL EPIDEMIOLOGY												Hydraulic-fracturing fluids and wastewater from unconventional oil and natural gas development contain hundreds of substances with the potential to contaminate drinking water. Challenges to conducting well-designed human exposure and health studies include limited information about likely etiologic agents. We systematically evaluated 1021 chemicals identified in hydraulic fracturing fluids (n = 925), wastewater (n = 132), or both (n = 36) for potential reproductive and developmental toxicity to triage those with potential for human health impact. We searched the REPROTOX database using Chemical Abstract Service registry numbers for chemicals with available data and evaluated the evidence for adverse reproductive and developmental effects. Next, we determined which chemicals linked to reproductive or developmental toxicity had water quality standards or guidelines. Toxicity information was lacking for 781 (76%) chemicals. Of the remaining 240 substances, evidence suggested reproductive toxicity for 103 (43%), developmental toxicity for 95 (40%), and both for 41 (17%). Of these 157 chemicals, 67 had or were proposed for a federal water quality standard or guideline. Our systematic screening approach identified a list of 67 hydraulic fracturing related candidate analytes based on known or suspected toxicity. Incorporation of data on potency, physicochemical properties, and environmental concentrations could further prioritize these substances for future drinking water exposure assessments or reproductive and developmental health studies.

Employing indicators for prioritization of fish assemblage with a view to manage freshwater fish diversity and ecosystem health in the tributaries of Ganges basin, India	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												The major tributaries of the river Ganges basin are currently threatened by various anthropogenic activities which are hampering the ecosystem stability and fish biodiversity of the basin. Multiple indicators were used to prioritize the fish assemblages in the tributaries and to develop an index that is responsive to human-induced environmental changes. A high percentage of invasive species was described with the orgin index at the most disturbed sites of rivers Gomti and Betwa which also represented a substantial amount of biological disturbance. The Fisheries Assessment Integrity Index based on ecological integrity of different segments of the rivers was used to prioritize different sampling sites of the tributaries. Some of the sampling sites in Gomti and Betwa rivers are reflecting disturbed fish assemblages, a very low Fisheries Assessment Integrity Index score, few threatened species, and a high proportion of invasive species. Principal components analysis of the sampling sites, along with fish assemblage, reflected the influence of the habitat parameters on structuring the assemblage pattern. This study identified depth, flow, water quality and land uses in shaping fish assemblages. The combination of various indices in this study should provide more accurate measures in identifying sites of high conservation value.																	1463-4988	1539-4077				JAN-JUN	2017	20	1-2			SI		21	29		10.1080/14634988.2017.1270146								WOS:000400410800004

Studies on ecology, fish diversity and fisheries of Ken-Betwa rivers (India): Proposed for inter-linking	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												The Ken and Betwa rivers traversing through Central India are the major tributaries of the river Yamuna. Both rivers originate above 550m above sea level in the Vindhya region. An interlinking project proposed for the rivers envisages diversion of water from Ken basin to the Betwa. The river sediment is alkaline and dominated by sand (78-89%) in both rivers. Oxygen-rich alkaline water and moderate values of chemical parameters show the pollution free and productive nature of both the rivers. There was no statistically significant difference in water quality between the Ken and Betwa rivers, except for total alkalinity. The biotic parameters were observed in similar ranges and moderate condition. A total of 61 planktonic forms were recorded from the rivers out of which 55 were phytoplankton. For the first time, 89 fish species belonging to 10 orders, 26 families, and 62 genera have been recorded in the river Ken, while 81 species classified under 10 orders, 24 families, and 55 genera were found in the Betwa. Exotic fish species were also observed in the downstream stretches of both rivers. Out of the total fish species, 77 were common to both rivers, 12 were found only in the Ken River, and 4 species were restricted to the Betwa. Analysis of relative abundance showed dominance of Labeo boggut in the Ken and Osteobrama cotio in the Betwa River. On comparison of the Shannon-Wiener Diversity and Evenness Indices of fish diversity, these indicated slightly higher values in the Ken (3.76 and 0.842) than the Betwa (3.66 and 0.835). A total of nine near-threatened fish species was recorded in the rivers. Both rivers have already been obstructed by many developmental projects; the proposed interlinking would further negatively impact the ecology and fisheries.																	1463-4988	1539-4077				JAN-JUN	2017	20	1-2			SI		71	85		10.1080/14634988.2017.1261576								WOS:000400410800008

AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												The Damodar and Subarnarekha Rivers are the first and second largest running waters of Jharkhand, having variable river bed morphology with naturally hard substrates. The riverine biodiversity is outstanding, as it includes endemic taxa on species and subspecies levels. Aquatic habitats are mostly colonized by native species. Macrozoobenthic animals are important bioindicators of the habitat quality of the river and are used for rapid assessment of river quality globally. In order to have preliminary information on the biodiversity of macrobenthos, the first survey was undertaken to find the impact of domestic pollution, mining, and thermal power plants on the aquatic life of the Damodar in May 2004. On the basis of our observations and species records, systematic field sampling for macro-benthic invertebrates in the Damodar and Subarnarekha Rivers was conducted from 2007 to 2012 during different hydrological conditions to cover the seasonal variation. Synoptic sampling was done to allow comparison between the two rivers. Aquatic invertebrate fauna has been inventoried with 124 identified taxa. The highest proportion of functional feeding groups recorded were detritivores, followed by carnivores and herbivores, respectively. This present study demonstrates the seasonal disappearance of macrozoobenthic invertebrates caused by urban and industrial pollution and that the fauna of the two main rivers of Jharkhand are similar in species inventory. This reflects the ecological conditions of the shared ecoregion known as Chota Nagpur Dry Forests. The results of the present research provide an essential database to evaluate the future environmental impact of restoration and changes in water quality.																	1463-4988	1539-4077				JAN-JUN	2017	20	1-2			SI		116	129		10.1080/14634988.2017.1300041								WOS:000400410800011

Effect of river connectivity on hydrochemistry, sediment enzyme activity and biotic communities of wetlands	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Wetlands associated with floodplains of the Ganges and Brahmaputra river systems cover an estimated 0.2million ha and play a vital role in the fisheries, rural economy and environment. In recent years, most wetlands in the states of Bihar, Assam and West Bengal in India have lost connectivity with their parent rivers due to natural and anthropogenic changes. These changes are causing rapid shrinkage of valuable wetlands and threatening their biodiversity and ecological function. The present study was conducted to assess the effect of river connectivity on the hydrochemistry, sediment enzyme activity, and biotic communities of these wetlands. One wetland area having link channels (open) connecting the main river, and another without link channels (closed), were selected from each of the Ganges and Brahmaputra basins for the study. Comparative analysis of open and closed, ecologically distinct wetlands of the Ganges basin revealed greater seasonal reduction in water depth and higher water conductivity (p < 0.04), nutrients (Ca+2, Mg+2, SiO3-Si), sediment microbial activity (p < 0.004), phosphorous cycling enzymes (p < 0.001), carbon cycling enzymes (p < 0.01), organic matter, conductivity, and plankton and macrozoobenthos (p < 0.01) density in the closed wetland. However, the open wetland showed higher diversity of plankton and macrozoobenthos. A profound impact of connectivity on wetland fisheries was observed in the Brahmaputra basin in Assam, where a higher percentage of catch comprised of indigenous fish species with lower fish yield was noted in the open wetland.																	1463-4988	1539-4077				JAN-JUN	2017	20	1-2			SI		140	150		10.1080/14634988.2017.1301095								WOS:000400410800013

The river drains 45.64km(3) of annual run-off and a series of dams was proposed to hold some of its water resources for multipurpose use. Currently, three dams have been built in Madhya Pradesh and one is under construction in Gujarat. A comparison of pre- and post-impoundment eco-environment and fisheries revealed changes in water quality, productivity, and aquatic flora and fauna of the river system. Among the fish, species like Tor tor, Labeo fimbriatus and Labeo dyocheilus suffered most. The percentage contributions to total yield of Carp, Catfish, and miscellaneous groups have significantly changed, indicating falls of 17%, 36% and an increase of 410%, respectively. Percentage contributions to catches of Macrobrachium rosenbergii and Tenualosa ilisha have also declined by 46% and about 75% in the estuarine stretch of the river system.

Status of the River Krishna: Water quality and riverine environment in relation to fisheries	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												The River Krishna, the second largest peninsular river of India, was investigated during pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon seasons to improve the understanding of its ecology through analysis of physical and chemical parameters of water and sediment. Important tributaries of the river were also studied simultaneously to understand their influence on the main stream of the River Krishna. In addition to 25 sampling sites along the main stream of the River Krishna, sampling was also done in 13 important tributaries at sites upstream of the confluence point. Dams, barrages and anicuts have visible impacts on all of the observed physical and chemical properties of water and soil. Statistical analysis revealed that water parameters have a strong association with sediment parameters. However, the study was unable to find any relation between primary production and water quality parameters. Fish species distribution was strongly influenced by temperature and water depth, as well as specific conductivity, as observed through Canonical Correspondence Analysis.																	1463-4988	1539-4077				JAN-JUN	2017	20	1-2			SI		160	174		10.1080/14634988.2017.1296312								WOS:000400410800015

A combined physicochemical-biological and filtration process was used in the study for removing pollutants in the wastewater. The removal efficiency of the pollutant in physicochemical and biological process was evaluated, respectively. Furthermore, advanced technology was used to analyse the water quality before and after the process treatment. Experimental results showed that the removal efficiency of suspend solids (SS) of the system was above 99%, while the physicochemical treatment in the forepart of the system had achieved about 97%. The removal efficiency of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and colour had the similar trend after physicochemical treatment and were corresponding to the proportion of suspended and the near-colloidal organic matter in the wastewater. After biological treatment, the removal efficiency of COD and colour achieved were about 97% and 90%, respectively. Furthermore, molecular weight (MW) distribution analysis showed that after treatment low MW molecules (<5kDa) increased. Three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix fluorescence analysis showed that most humic-like substances were effectively removed during the treatment. The analyses of gas chromatography/mass spectrometry showed that the composition of organic matter in the wastewater was not complicated. Methylsiloxanes were the typical organic components in the raw wastewater and most of them were removed after treatment.																	0959-3330	1479-487X					2017	38	11					1443	1451		10.1080/09593330.2016.1231227								WOS:000400464400013	27585225					
J	Walther, SC; Reinholtz, AL; Marcus, WA				Walther, Suzanne C.; Reinholtz, Amanda L.; Marcus, W. Andrew			The geographic distribution of small dams in Oregon using ecoregion and landform classification	PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Small dams fragment river landscapes, disrupting channel connectivity and impacting water quality and quantity. Although they impound volumetrically less total water than large dams, the ubiquity of small dams suggests their cumulative impacts could be significant. Documenting the distribution and characteristics of small dams is necessary to understanding and mitigating their impacts. In this study, we compare datasets of small dams in Oregon, compile a new comprehensive dataset, and document geographic variations in small dam distributions between different ecoregions. We used Oregon Water Resources Department dam and Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife fish passage barrier datasets to compare dam heights and contributing drainage areas between different ecoregions. Over 61% of Oregon's land area is above one or more small dam. We highlight the location of Oregon's small dams at valley margins, transition zones between flat plains and mountains, and areas of high population density. Given the hidden nature of small dams, evaluation of small dam impacts using public imagery is not effective. However, knowledge of small dam distributions given their association with landforms can aid in finding unrecorded dams, assessing approaches for evaluating their geomorphic impacts, and informing their management.																	0272-3646	1930-0557					2017	38	3					286	301		10.1080/02723646.2017.1286224								WOS:000400371000005

One of the reason is the high mortality of the catfish infected by Aeromonas hydrophila and Saprolegnia sp. Motile Aeromonas septicemia (MAS) is a common bacterial disease, caused by Aeromonas hydrophila, which affects freshwater fish. In Southeast Asia, the outbreak of this disease was firstly reported from West Java in 1980, when a total of 82.5 tons a month of catfish were lost, while in Central Java in 1984, the total loss was 1.6 tons. Saprolegniosis can cause economic loss due to high mortality from its case reaching 10% to 50%. This research aimed to identify and determine the percentage of A. hydrophila and Saprolegnia sp. the catfish farmed in bozem Moro Krembangan, Surabaya, East Java. Meanwhile, a supporting parameter in this research is the value of water quality parameter including pH, temperature, ammonia and dissolved oxygen that were measured during sampling. The results showed that of the 20 samples taken from the two cages, 19 fish were positively infected by A. drophila. percentage of infections of A. hydrophila that infect umbo catfish in Moro Krembangan, was 95%, while the percentage Saprolegnia sp. was 90%.																	1755-1307						2017	55								UNSP 012038									WOS:000400161100038

This research aims to measure the efficacy of ozon and chitosan usage in prawn larvae rearing, and to measure the survial rate of prawn larvae during the rearing stage. The study was carried out using experimental method in laboratory, with factorial research design using 3 treatment combinations and 1 control groups. The chitosan dose administered in this research was 25 ml in 25 L of sea water, euating to 10 ppm. The dissolved ozon in this research was measured at the concentration of 8.245 - 13.748 ppm. Weekly measurement of water quality in terms of temperature, pH, salinity, dissolved oxygen and dissolved ozon were carried out throughout the course of the research. Total microbial population in the water was measured by means of Total Plate Count ( TPC) methiod in the Institute for Natural Medicines of Diponegoro University. Statistics figure from "ANOVA" test suggested that the application of ozon and the introduction of chitosan in prawn larvae rearing media gave impact to the microbial population in the media. Results of BNT test showed that there was a significant difference between the measurement results of the 3 treatment combination groups and that of the control group. The highest prawn larvae survival rate was found in the media with combined ozon and chitosan treatment, which was recorded at 100%. The second highest survival rate was recorded in the treatement combination group of ozon and chitosan with 80%, and the lowest survival rate was attributed to the control group with 20% prawn larvae survival rate. It is concluded that treatment combination of 10 ppm chitosan and 8.245 - 13.748 ppm of ozon showed significantly positive results in its application in giant tiger prawn farming media.																	1755-1307						2017	55								UNSP 012070	10.1088/1755-1315/55/1/012070								WOS:000400161100070

The different diatoms assemblage in the sediment layers indicate different environment at the time of the diatoms live and deposited. Telaga Warna is small lake in Dieng Plateau. Telaga means lake, Warna means colour. It is called Telaga Warna because previously have 4 colours i.e. red, white, blue, and yellow which was influenced by weather, time, and site of view. This study aims to analysis the diatoms communities and water quality of Telaga Warna Dieng, Java, Indonesia. Coring conducted at three different locations. Water sampling carried out on all three spots. Analysis of diatoms consist of three stages: digestion, preparation, and identification of diatoms. There were 59 diatoms species found in Telaga Warna Dieng that were belong to 9 groups diatoms of centric, arafid, eunotoid, birafid, monorafid, birafid, epitemid, nitzschioid, and surirelloid. Eunotia, Pinnularia, and Melosira were the dominant genus from Telaga Warna. The water quality parameters that exceeded Indonesia Water Quality Standard were pH (2.2 - 5.4), Pb, Cd, Cr, Cu. Based on the abundance of species Eunotia and Pinnularia in Telaga Warna Dieng indicates that water tends to be acidic. The dominance of Melosira indicates waters rich in nitrogen. Based on the total concentration of nitrogen and phosphorous, Telaga Warna was in an eutrophic-hipereutrophic conditions with total nitrogen concentration > 1.9 mg/L and total phosphorus concentration > 0.1 mg/L.

The effects of DO concentration and pyridine loading on the system removal efficiency were investigated. Results showed that the optimal DO concentration and pyridine loading were 3.5 mg/L and 0.5 kg COD/(m(3).d), respectively. Under operating conditions, pyridine removal rate by biodegradation could reach 80.89%. GC-MS analyser was used to determine the water quality of effluent, and the main intermediate products of biodegradation were 2-pentanone, 3-pentanone, methylbutyrate and dimethylformamide. As revealed by the DGGE results, the degradation of pyridine in the SBBR system was a synergistic effect of different kinds of microorganisms, including various dominant bacteria existing in a system. The main dominant microorganisms were Shinella zoogloeoides and Acidovorax caeni, as suggested by the results of DNA sequencing of the V3 region.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	3					1858	1864										WOS:000399966600002

As important indicator species, diatoms are widely used to explain past environment changes. The aims of this study were to describe the succession of the sediment diatom community in the large arid Bosten Lake and to discuss the responses of the diatoms to human activities and climate change over recent history. Sediment diatom analysis was applied to short core sediment samples extracted from the river mouth and the deep centre of Bosten Lake. The diatom assemblages were dominated by Cyclotella praetermissa, Fragilaria crotonensis and small fragilarioid and periphytic taxa. These diatom taxa are interpreted as being sensitive to changes in the water level and trophic status in the water column, which are probably related to the climate and human activities. The high percentage of Cyclotella praetermissa suggests that the water level was higher prior to the 1860s. From the 1860s to the 1950s, Aulacoseira alpigena appeared in the profundal zone, which indicates that spring winds may have been stronger. The high percentage of Navicula oblonga in the river mouth zone revealed that the lake might have been slightly brackish. From the 1950s to the early 1980s, the percentage of planktonic diatoms decreased, and F. crotonensis appeared, which indicates that the water level was lower and that human activity had increased. From the 1980s to the end of the 20th century, the population, land cultivation, and fish production all increased, resulting in changes in salinity and a rapid decline in water levels. During this period, the diatoms at the river mouth of the Kaidu River were dominated by benthic species, and the deepest site of the lake was dominated by F. crotonensis. Since the 20th century, F. crotonensis has been dominant as the water level has increased and the trophic status has changed in the lake. Environmental changes in the Bosten Lake catchment affected the diatom assemblage in the profundal zone much earlier than in the river mouth zone. The patchiness of the diatom distribution within the lake macroenvironment indicates the influence of microenvironments on diatom community structure. Over the last several decades, human activities may have caused the ecosystem of Bosten Lake to exceed a threshold and collapse into a new state.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	3					2104	2113										WOS:000399966600032

Different dynamics were found among phytoplankton, zooplankton, and zoobenthos in terms of density, biomass, and biodiversity. On an annual time scale and with deterioration of water quality, density and biomass of plankton and zoobenthos showed different variations, while phytoplankton (density, biomass, and biodiversity) changed significantly when water quality improved. On a seasonal time scale, density and biomass of phytoplankton showed significant differences between spring and summer. Results of Pearson's correlation analysis revealed that phytoplankton, zooplankton, and zoobenthos were significantly affected by different environmental factors. Our study demonstrated that phytoplankton was more sensitive to water quality changes than zooplankton and zoobenthos. These results suggest that density and biomass of phytoplankton could rapidly reflect water quality, whereas biodiversity of phytoplankton could indicate long-term status of water quality combined with the physico-chemical parameters of water. The results could contribute to predicting the dynamics of plankton and zoobenthos in freshwater lakei and to selecting effective bio-indicators for ecosystem health assessment of freshwater lakes.																	1230-1485	2083-5906					2017	26	2					755	764		10.15244/pjoes/66713								WOS:000399967900029

In 2012-2013, EM was applied in Muchawka Reservoir situated in the town of Siedlce (eastern Poland). Analyses of water parameters and bottom sediments were carried out, in 2011, before the EM technology was implemented and again in 2013-2015 after the EM application was completed. In spring 2011, the average total nitrogen (TN) content at the surface was 3.1 mg dm(-3) while the total mineral nitrogen content equalled 0.893 mg dm(-3). After the EM application was completed, in the summer of 2013, the TN content was on average 2.5 mg dm(-3). The content of nitrates and nitrites in the summer of 2013 reached 1.20 mg dm(-3) at the most. Lower levels of such forms of nitrogen were observed in 2013 and also in subsequent years at the bathing beach (site 1) and the hostel (site 3) than at the inflow (site 4). Likewise, the highest content of phosphates was recorded at the inflow site (4), being four-fold lower at the other sites (1, 3). The average content of TP before the EM technology was applied cc as 0.205 mg dm(-3), whereas after the application of effective microorganisms it fell down to 0.189 mg dm(-3) (2013-2015). Only slight changes of TSITP indicated that waters in Muchawka Reservoir were eutrophic. After EM was applied twice, no streaks, cyanobacterial scums or pollution at the bathing sites were visible. The bacteriological evaluation of the water samples was carried out by the County Branch of the State Sanitary Inspectorate in Siedlce. The bacteriological water quality was described as "excellent". These findings suggest that the method developed by SITNREK, combined with probiotic preparations, could be a useful tool in the restoration of water bodies, but the conclusion requires further detailed verification.

Our objective was to investigate the relationships between the measures of benthic macroinvertebrate communities and nutrient concentrations to assess water quality. The rivers' benthic macroinvertebrates were collected during different seasons in 2012. The biological and chemical parameters used in the current study identified them as quick indicators of water quality assessment. The total number of macroinvertebrate individuals (n = 15,006) (Osumi river: n = 5,546 organisms; Devolli river: n = 3,469 organisms; and Shkumbini river: n = 5,991 organisms), together with the EPT group (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera), showed that the water quality at the river stations during the above-mentioned period belonged to Classes II and III (fair water quality and good water quality, respectively). The classification of the water quality was also based on the nitrogen and total phosphorus contents. The pollution tolerance levels of macroinvertebrate taxa varied from the non-tolerating forms encountered in environments with low pollution levels to the tolerating forms that are typical of environments with considerable pollution levels.

As a broad (beta-diversity measure, multivariate dispersions are subject to influence from the relative weight placed on changes in composition versus abundance. To identify a feasible numeral resolution for determining beta-diversity of protozoa using community based dispersions, a dataset of the protozoan communities was studied. Results showed that although species composition was the primary contributor to the multivariate dispersions, the community-based dispersions showed a significant linear relationship to the Whittaker's (beta-diversity index. However, the data transformations on species-abundance data represented clear influences on outputs of community based dispersion measures: heavy (e.g., fourth root or log) transforms were more feasible than slight ones. Based on the results, we suggest that the community-based multivariate dispersions with heavy data transforms may be used to summarize the (beta-diversity of protozoan communities for bioassessment in coastal ecosystems.

Arboleda			Lentic water quality characterization using macroinvertebrates as bioindicators: An adapted BMWP index	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Water quality in lowland lentic system was evaluated through the use of aquatic macroinvertebrates as bioindicators, and their relationship with basic physicochemical factors was considered; thus, two biotopes were established for identifying both groups of macroinvertebrates, one being the population associated with macrophytes (AM) and the other being benthic (B). As a result, 46 families of macroinvertebrates were collected, with Hydrobiidae, Chironomidae, Thiaridae and Polymitarcyidae being the most abundant in the system. In addition, families with high tolerance to extreme conditions, such as Ceratopogonidae, Chironomidae and Syrphidae, were found, as well as some families with low tolerance to these conditions, such as Caenidae and Leptoceridae. The first biotope presented 7.189 individuals (50.42%) and the second 7.056 (49.5%), for a total of 14.259 individuals. Biotope AM presented 100% of the richness, while biotope B was significantly less rich, with 15 families, which represent 32,06%. In order to evaluate the families found in the lowland lentic system, their distribution in the ranges of variation of the physicochemical factors and tolerance levels was taken into account. As a consequence, a new score table was established, where this system obtained a total score of 207 with an average of 166 per sampling station, suggesting signs of contamination. Finally, these results allow an adaptation of the BMWP (Biological Monitoring Working Party) index to be proposed, including the lowland lentic systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Only a few decision support methodologies and integrative methods for evaluating the ecological status of rivers are used in river restoration projects, thereby limiting informed management decisions in restoration planning as well as success control. Moreover, studies quantifying river restoration effects are often based on the assessment of a single organism group, and the effects on terrestrial communities are often neglected. In addition, potential effects of water quality or hydrological degradation are often not considered for the evaluation of restoration projects. We used multi-attribute value theory to re-formulate an existing river assessment protocol and extend it to a more comprehensive, integrated ecological assessment program. We considered habitat conditions, water quality regarding nutrients, micropollutants and heavy metals, and five instream and terrestrial organism groups (fish, benthic invertebrates, aquatic vegetation, ground beetles and riparian vegetation). The physical, chemical and biological states of the rivers were assessed separately and combined to value the overall ecological state. The assessment procedure was then applied to restored and unrestored sites at two Swiss rivers to test its feasibility in quantifying the effect of river restoration. Uncertainty in observations was taken into account and propagated through the assessment framework to evaluate the significance of differences between the ecological states of restored and unrestored reaches. In the restored sites, we measured a higher width variability of the river, as well as a higher width of the riparian zone and a higher richness of organism groups. According to the ecological assessment, the river morphology and the biological states were significantly better at the restored sites, with the largest differences detected for ground beetles and fish communities, followed by benthic invertebrates and riparian vegetation. The state of the aquatic vegetation was slightly lower at the restored sites. According to our assessment, the presence of invasive plant species counteracted the potential ecological gain. Water quality could be a causal factor contributing to the absence of larger improvements. Overall, we found significantly better biological and physical states, and integrated ecological states at the restored sites. Even in the absence of comprehensive before-after data, based on the similarity of the reaches before restoration and mechanistic biological knowledge, this can be safely interpreted as a causal consequence of restoration. An integrative perspective across aquatic and riparian organism groups was important to assess the biological effects, because organism groups responded differently to restoration. In addition, the potential deteriorating effect of water quality demonstrates the importance of integrated planning for the reduction of morphological, water quality and hydrological degradation.

J	Wu, M; Che, Y; Lv, YP; Yang, K				Wu, Meng; Che, Yue; Lv, Yongpeng; Yang, Kai			Neighbourhood-scale urban riparian ecosystem classification	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Urban riparian ecosystems are now recognized as essential components in determining the vulnerability of nature and human systems to climate change, but still remains uncertainty concerning how to stratify and classify urban riparian landscapes into units of ecological significance at spatial scales appropriate for management. Ecosystem classification presents a tool that allows for quantifying the social and ecological processes of ecosystems so as to shape them into relatively homogeneous management objectives, and provides the potential of offering decision support to urban planners based on urban ecological principles. The purpose of this study is to explore and develop a framework for urban riparian ecosystem classification. The classification framework integrates 9 ecosystem components and 29 spatially-explicit variables that characterized by the biophysical landscape, built environment and human population. Then this framework is applied at the neighbourhood scale in Huangpu River basin, Shanghai city, China, employing hierarchical cluster analysis. The results of the ecosystem classification show that the riparian ecosystems in the Huangpu River could be grouped into three principal categories and these ecosystems are aligned along a gradient of increasing urbanization. We highlight the conservation and payment for riparian ecosystem services delivered in the upstream of Huangpu River, and revegetation and enhancement of riparian ecosystems in the more urbanized downstream area. We also find that riparian vegetation connectivity and coverage were negatively related to land use mix, built environment density, and economic wealth. In terms of riparian vegetation ecology, neighbourhood scale land use mix and built environment density are more influential than socioeconomic background (such as average family income and immigrant status).

Partitioning taxonomic diversity of aquatic insect assemblages and functional feeding groups in neotropical savanna headwater streams	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Biological diversity can be divided into: alpha (alpha local), beta (beta, difference in assemblage composition among locals), and gamma (gamma, total diversity). We assessed the partitioning of taxonomic diversity of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) and of functional feeding groups (FFG) in neotropical savanna (southeastern Brazilian cerrado) streams. To do so, we considered three diversity components: stream site (alpha), among stream sites (beta(1)), and among hydrologic units (beta(2)). We also evaluated the association of EPT genera composition with heterogeneity in land use, instream physical habitat structure, and instream water quality variables. The percentage of EPT taxonomic alpha diversity (20.7%) was smaller than the beta(1) and beta(2) diversity percentages (53.1% and 26.2%, respectively). The percentage of EPT FFG collector-gatherer a diversity (26.5%) was smaller than that of 131 diversity (55.8%) and higher than the beta(2) (17.7%) diversity. The collector-gatherer FFG was predominant and had the greatest beta diversity percentage among stream sites (beta(1), 55.8%). Our findings support the need for implementing regional scale conservation strategies in the cerrado biome, which has been degraded by anthropogenic activities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of the present study is to investigate the pollution in Ganga River in relation to appearance of toxic cyanobacterial strains. Jajmau area of Kanpur city is the industrial hub of Uttar Pradesh and is the main source of adding unwanted discharge into Ganga River. Water samples were randomly collected from the most polluted stretch of Ganga River (Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, India). Samples were also collected from other major water of Uttar Pradesh to compare their water chemistry with Ganga River. Physico-chemical parameters of water bodies were estimated periodically for three years 2013-2015. Pearson product mean correlation showed strong correlation between water parameters of sampling sites. Regression analysis showed seasonal variation in water parameters of Ganga River. Cyanobacteria prevalence in Ganga River was highest in May while lowest in August month. Fourteen cultivable cyanobacteria were isolated from Ganga River. Two new isolates, Oscillatoria sp. RBDO1 and Leptolyngbya sp. RBDO5 were found to be toxic and showed the presence of algal toxin (microcystin). Phylogenetic relatedness of toxic cyanobacterial isolates with their close homologues was established using 16S rRNA sequence analysis. Microcystin content in water samples (extracellular release) and in cyanobacterial isolates (intracellular content) was estimated by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Ganga River was found to be positive for microcystin with concentration >= 2 ppb which is above the permissible limit of WHO. Toxic cyanobacteria Oscillatoria sp. RBDO1 and Leptolyngbya sp. RBDO5 showed the presence of 23 and 17 ppb of microcystin in cells. Growth of the toxic cyanobacteria Oscillatoria sp. RBDO1 showed very strong correlation with phosphate (0.834) and nitrate (0.761) content of water. Toxic Oscillatoria sp. RBDO1 growing in moderate combination of nitrate (16x) and phosphate (4x) showed optimum growth and protein content. Periodic assessment of water quality and monitoring of toxic cyanobacteria would be helpful in identification and regulation of toxins which are responsible for destroying its sanctity and making it unsafe for human consumption.

Many of these streams are not considered in current national monitoring programs due to their small catchment area. However, assessing their status and monitoring their trends is well needed to ensure their proper management and conservation. In this study, we evaluated the use of a range of indicators related to different ecosystem structural and functional components in 2 streams affected by sewage outflows and compared with an unpolluted stream in the Picos de Europa National Park (Spain). We surveyed benthic periphyton, macroinvertebrate communities and fish assemblages and also estimated periphyton growth rates, wood decomposition rates and river metabolism. Additionally, we compared the performance of the selected indicators in different hydraulic conditions. Results revealed an effect of the organic pollution on most of the functional and structural indicators for the most polluted stream. Only the number of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera taxa, the Iberian Biomonitoring Working Party index, the invertebrate multimetric index used by the regional water agency, the fish abundance and biomass were sensitive enough to detect low leyels of pollution and followed the expected response to the pollution degree. Moreover, most of the indicators behaved similarly under different hydraulic conditions, without major differences between pools and runs. However, the combination of both pool and run replicates at the reach scale resulted in a higher detection capacity of the effects of organic pollution. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, there remains significant uncertainty regarding the effect of spatial configuration of different types of land cover on water quality. Using periphytic algae (diatoms) as indicators of stream trophic state, we investigated the relationship between landscape configuration and water quality in a large number of watersheds (590) at varying catchment scales in Eastern Canada. Variation partitioning analysis showed that landscape configuration explained 48% of the variation in water quality. However, since the physiographic setting constrains most agricultural activities, most of the variation was attributed to the shared influence of surficial deposits, land cover and landscape configuration (34%). The results from regression models showed that the geomorphological setting of watersheds (surficial deposits and slopes) and the proportion of different land cover types (mainly forests, wetlands, crops and urban areas) have a major impact on stream water quality. Nevertheless, a few configuration metrics emerged as important factors. Landscape diversity appeared to have a negative impact on water quality, whereas forest and wetland edge densities had a positive impact. Moreover, the influence of these lanscape metrics seems to occur at certain thresholds. In areas of intensive farming, streams with a forest area that covers at least 47% of the watershed have a better water quality. Below this threshold, eutrophic and meso-eutrophic conditions are more frequent in streams and rivers. The shape and location of forested patches were also found to be relevant. Woodlands and wetlands with an edge density higher than 36 m/ha and located along streams and gullies have a positive impact on water quality. For the same proportion of forest, complex patches will be more efficient filters than large regular patches. Forest edge density seems to control the extent of the interface with the agricultural sources and thus promotes the "sink" effect of forests on nutrients. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Origin here, impact there The need of integrated management for river basins and coastal areas	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												This study highlights the effect that estuarine polluted waters may have on adjacent coastal waters and the need of an integrated management of the coastal area. Pollution of land-to-sea water plumes varies spatially and temporally, being difficult, costly and time consuming to determine. However, the reduction in water quality of both estuarine and coastal environments and the consequent degradation of its biological communities is at issue. Chlorophyll-a analysis from water and stable nitrogen isotopic analysis (delta N-15) from opportunistic macroalgae Ulva species were respectively used as proxies to detect phyto-plankton proliferation and nitrogen related nutrient fluxes in the water. These analytical techniques were combined with the use of three-dimensional hydrodynamic models, and revealed to constitute reliable early warning instruments, able to identify coastal areas at risk, and supporting an integrated management of coastal and river basin areas. The approach detected synchronized delta N-15 signal variations along time between estuarine sites (Mondego estuary, Portugal) and nearby adjacent coastal shore sites (NE Atlantic coast). The higher values recorded by macroalgal tissues' delta N-15 signals, which occurred simultaneously to higher chlorophyll-a values, were linked to the anthropogenic contamination of the water, probably related with the Mondego valley land use patterns throughout the year (reflecting the opening of sluices that drain agriculture fields). Modeling scenarios point to a Mondego's influence that is able to reach its adjacent coastal shores in about 7 km from its river mouth. The methodology used here is replicable elsewhere and allowed to track nutrients from the source, inside the estuary, until the final area of impact, where primary producers may use those for growth, and to define vulnerable areas on adjacent coastal zones.

LANDSCAPE-ECOLOGICAL OPTIMIZATION OF HYDRIC POTENTIAL IN FOOTHILLS REGION WITH DISPERSED SETTLEMENTS. A CASE STUDY OF NOVA BOSACA, SLOVAKIA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The article shows how to implement scientific results from a methodology of landscape ecological planning (LANDEP) into integrated river basin management. This methodology creates a framework of integrating research of land use structure with modelling hydric potential by using runoff curve number into the assessment and subsequent optimization of hydric potential in a foothills region of the Biele Karpaty Mts. Analysis and hydric evaluation of the study area shows that foothills region has a relatively high hydric potential. The research question is: could landscape ecological optimization reduce runoff significantly and improve hydric regime in the landscape. The proposed measures are linked to existing land use structure, where they increase the quality of existing hydric elements. They have character of non-technical solutions with maximum exploitation of the potential of ecosystem services, therefore they are economically undemanding. On the basis of our results, the proposed changes in land use will lead to the capture of water in landscape and an overall better use of water in landscape.

DETERMINATION OF LEAD AND CADMIUM IN THE WATER OF THE DAMAVAND RIVER, IRAN	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Heavy metals contamination of surface waters has become an important issue in the last decades. The present study aimed to investigate the levels of lead and cadmium in the water of the Damavand River, Iran. Sampling was carried out in 10 stations during summer and autumn 2015. Metal analysis was performed by atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Surface water at each sampling point was measured for selected physicochemical parameters with a multiparameter meter. Statistical analysis was carried out by SPSS and Excel software. The results showed that the mean concentrations (mg/L) of lead in the samples were higher than cadmium over the studied months. The highest levels of lead (2.13 +/- 0.80) and cadmium (1.03 +/- 0.50) were found in station 9 while the lowest levels of lead (0.09 +/- 0.00) and cadmium (0.03 +/- 0.00) were in station 1 (before entering the city of Damavand). Significant differences (P< 0.05) were observed between the stations, however, there were no significant variations between the levels of metals in the months. Significant differences were found between the levels of physicochemical parameters among different months at 95% confidence level. Present values revealed that the concentrations of metals in the stations were higher than the maximum permitted levels for drinking water set by different organizations.																	1589-1623	1785-0037					2017	15	1					439	444		10.15666/aeer/1501_439444								WOS:000397162200030

HCA categorized three different cluster regions, namely Cluster 1 or LPS, Cluster 2 or MPS, and Cluster 3 or HPS. DA resulted in nine discriminant variables, namely turbidity, TSS, pH, BOD, COD, E. coli, As, Zn, and Fe. PCA indicated six components in HPS and MPS with total variance of 84.9% and 84.4%, while LPS result five components had a total variance of 77.1%. Generally, major sources of pollution are agricultural, residential and wastewater treatment plants, domestic and commercial waste, industry, as well as animal husbandry. The present study provides useful information for local authorities to identify sources of pollution of the examined area and effectively in proper management for land use area. Additionally, the study also helps in understanding river water quality within the basin and provides a database for future reference in developing water policies.																	1589-1623	1785-0037					2017	15	1					485	499		10.15666/aeer/1501_485499								WOS:000397162200034

LOCAL AND SCIENTIFIC ECOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE POTENTIAL AS A SOURCE OF INFORMATION IN A PERIURBAN RIVER, MEXICO CITY, MEXICO	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Rivers in large cities face management problems that could be addressed through the integration of scientific and local ecological knowledge. The objective of this article is to emphasize the importance of different sources of knowledge in management alternatives for periurban watersheds. Specifically, this is done through (a) use of oral sources and archives to document the historic relationship between local residents and their natural resources, and (b) technical evaluation of the quantity and quality of water in the sub-basin through the time. We analyzed, through the 19 unstructured interviews, local residents' knowledge related to water quantity and quality. Additionally, we analyzed historical river flow data and water quality reports. The results show that the relationship between the local inhabitants and the river has been governed by public policies of both exploitation and conservation. For the last century, the river was used as the main source of electric power for local industry, the collapse of which, led to the decline of the importance of the river in the perception of the locals. Analysis of historical river flow data reveals a slight decrease in flow despite a trend of somewhat lower precipitation. This discrepancy may be due to hydraulic infrastructure construction and uncontrolled extraction. We conclude that the integration of two kinds of knowledge present a great opportunity to test a monitoring system that incorporates the environmental features that were more accurately described by the local residents: water quantity and forest land use.

The river reach is characterized by complex geometry, including vegetated islands, alternating sand bars and an unpredictable thalweg. The models were setup and validated using available observed data in the region before using them to estimate the levels of cohesive sediment and a select set of chemical constituents, consisting of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and metals, within the river system. Different flow scenarios were considered, and the results show that a large proportion of the cohesive sediment that gets deposited within the study domain originates from the main stem upstream inflow boundary, although Ells River may also contribute substantially during peak flow events. The floodplain, back channels and islands in the river system are found to be the major areas of concern for deposition of sediment and associated chemical constituents. Adsorbed chemical constituents also tend to be greater in the main channel water column, which has higher levels of total suspended sediments, compared to in the flood plain. Moreover, the levels of chemical constituents leaving the river system are found to depend very much on the corresponding river bed concentration levels, resulting in higher outflows with increases in their concentration in the bed sediment.

Groundwater quality situation was found to be impaired when samples of different rural areas of district Kasur were monitored according to Pakistan Standards and Quality Control Authority (PSQCA) for all significant water quality constituents and analyzed for trace elements, physico-chemical, and microbiological parameters. Out of 35 water sources, 97 % were found unsafe and only 3 % of the sources were within safe limits. High concentrations of arsenic, fluoride, and bacteria were found in 91, 74, and 77 % sources of drinking water, respectively. Very high concentrations of arsenic ranging 58-3800 mu g/L were found in the water samples obtained from Badarpur and Ibrahimabad. A decrease in water contamination was observed with increase in source depth. The health issues like arsenicosis and skeletal/dental flourosis were observed in the residents of the monitored areas. Drinking water quality conditions of some rural areas of northen and southern districts of Punjab was also analyzed and compared with Kasur district.

This study aimed to use fish scales as a bio-indicator of pollution, along with water quality parameters, and the assessment and detection of selected heavy metals in water samples collected from the River Chenab, including the Chakbandi drain that gathers domestic sewage waste and industrial effluents from Faisalabad and deposits it into this freshwater body. All water quality parameters (pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), total suspended solids (TSS), salinity, conductivity, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), phenols and sulphates) and concentrations of selected heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Mn, Pb and Cr) were found to be considerably higher than permissible limits as defined by the WHO, and therefore capable of causing ill health effects in aquatic organisms. Specimens of fish scales from selected fish were described qualitatively and observed quantitatively. In Catla catla, Labeo rohita and Cirrhinus mrigala, the scales showed several deformities in shape and different scale structures such as circuli, radii and annuli. In each of the three types of fish, considerable variation in the morphology of their scales was observed in specimens collected from polluted sites.

A better understanding of the concentrations of heavy metals in the aquatic environment of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) is crucial for national drinking water security and sustainable ecosystem development. To thoroughly investigate the impact of heavy metals on water quality after the impoundment to the maximum level of 175 m in the TGR, the concentrations of the dissolved heavy metals (Cr, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, As) were measured in April and August 2015, by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). (1) Except Zn and Pb, most of the heavy metal concentrations in the water of the TGR reached the level of the National Surface Water Environmental Quality Standards (GB3838-2002) I of China, revealing that the water quality of the TGR was good overall. (2) There were significant positive correlations among the concentrations of Cu, As, and Cd, revealing that they may exhibit similar geochemical behaviors. (3) The spatial distribution of the heavy metal concentrations was diverse and complex. The Zn concentration obviously increased in the rainy season from upstream to downstream in the Yangtze River, while the other heavy metals exhibited no significant changes in their concentrations. The distribution characteristics of the heavy metal concentrations on both sides and the middle of the river were different at different sites. (4) The health risk of the six elements was assessed through a human health risk assessment (HHRA), and the assessment results were lower than the maximum acceptable risk level designed by the US EPA and International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). The HHRA model in the aquatic environment revealed that the risk of non-carcinogenic heavy metals (Cu, Zn, and Pb) was at a negligible risk level of 10(-11) similar to 10(-9) a(-1). At all the study sites, the risk of carcinogenic heavy metals (Cr, Cd, and As) was higher than the risk of non-carcinogenic heavy metals. As was the most important risk factor, followed by Cr. The results of this study hold great significance for a timely understanding of the changing water quality for affected departments to ensure the health of the residents in the TGR area.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				JAN	2017	24	3					2697	2710		10.1007/s11356-016-8046-6								WOS:000396138800049	27834048

The Rapid Bioassessment Protocols for Use in Streams and Wadeable Rivers, of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), was used as a support procedure to develop an integrated assessment, considering biotic, habitat and water quality partial assessments. In order to assess the river condition, two reference sites, located in a forest land, and nine perturbed sites, representatives of agricultural, urban and industrial lands, were selected in a geographical information system, with the support of field trips. The river biotic condition was based on families of benthic macroinvertebrates, the river habitat condition was assessed by using the habitat parameters established by the EPA, and the river water quality condition by developing an index from the nine measured physical and chemical parameters. The current river health was considered as the mode of the category of the partial assessments. While the river health of the reference sites was optimum, it was poor for all the perturbed sites, the worst condition in the index scale.																	0188-4999						2017	33	1					7	19										WOS:000396528700001

The application of water in the orchards from agricultural wells with high salt content, promotes their accumulation in the soil, hindering their mobility to tree roots. In order to chemically analyze the composition of water irrigation in the pecan-producing region of southern Chihuahua and contrast it with the current Mexican standards, the following research was conducted. Sampling was carried out in June 25, 2014. Ten orchards in the south of the Chihuahua State were selected and a water sample from each well was taken. The analyzed parameters were pH, chlorides, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, As, B, Pb, Cd, Ni, Na, total dissolved solids, nitrates, hardness, alkalinity, sodium adsorption ratio and electric conductivity (EC). For human use and consumption was considered the Mexican official norm (NOM 127), and for agricultural irrigation the Federal Law of Rights - Provisions Applicable to Matters of National Waters. Values obtained in the south of the Chihuahua State were within the parameters established for both drinking and agricultural irrigation water, thus being this water of good quality. However, it is suggested to have a periodic monitoring of the concentrations of Pb, Ni, As, B and CE to avoid the future possibility of repercussions to the human population of the surrounding communities in the region and of negative impacts on farming activity.

Vollenweider Model for Temporal Eutrophication Characteristics of Nagdaha Lake, Nepal	ASIAN JOURNAL OF WATER ENVIRONMENT AND POLLUTION												The study was carried out in Nagdaha (about five kilometres away from Lagankhel), Dhapakhel VDC, Lalitpur (between 27 degrees 37'53". N and 85 degrees 20'2.8". E at an altitude of 1340 m), Nepal. The status of trophic characteristics of the Nagdaha was calculated on the basis of normalized average phosphorus [P]. and chlorophyll [Chl]. through verified Vollenweider Model. The water quality parameters like pH; nitrate, total phosphate and alkalinity; temperature and dissolved oxygen were tested for the assessment purpose. The measurement of lake depth was done through depth sounding method where GPS co-ordinates were recorded, then analysed, managed and presented using GIS for bathymetric map. The area of lake as given by aerial photograph was determined to be 3.07 hectares; while various litreatures enlisted the area as 2.65-5 hectares. The bathymetric map area calculation entailed that the area was 2.51 hectares (decreased by 500 square metres). The depth of the lake varied from 0.30 metre to 4.70 metres. The residence time, in which mean depth of water body act as vital role in resulting various trophic level. The lake was hypereutrophic and eutrophic at average phosphorus loading up to first 2.5 metre and onward depth respectively. The normalized phosphorous and chlorophyll concentrations during winter were found greater than in summer seasons.																	0972-9860	1875-8568					2017	14	1					29	39		10.3233/AJW-170004								WOS:000394621100004

Indexing is a practical and concise way of representing the overall quality of water. Many such indexing methods are available with different goal and purpose. For indexing purpose importance of different Water Quality Parameters needs to be determined first. In the present study, importance of Water Quality Parameters were determined on the basis of important criteria like potential hazards, cost of mitigation, utilization scope and popularity among the researchers. The importance of criteria were determined by Response Surface Methodology (RSM), whereas the scoring of importance was performed by Analytic Network Process (ANP). For validation of the proposed index, a case study was performed by water quality data of different water bodies in Tripura, India. The proposed Water Quality Index of the sample water bodies were then compared with the Water Quality Indices of National Sanitation Foundation (NSF WQI). Results indicate that the proposed index is very close to NSF WQI. Thus the proposed index seems to be successful in expressing the overall quality of water.

Forty drainage ditches in the TGR from multiple land use types were extensively investigated for 10 parameters of water quality. The results showed that the concentrations of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) in the TGR drainage ditches were generally far higher than the internationally recognized eutrophication threshold. Based on this study, both ditch water and sediments from residential land and roadside land had the highest concentrations of nutrients. Possible sources of these nutrients include sewage water and septic tank overflow. Forestland had significantly lower concentrations of nutrients. Residential ditches had higher values of electrical conductivity (EC) and total dissolved solid (TDS) values and lower dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations. Forestland had lower values of EC and TDS values and higher DO concentrations. The results indicate that the nutrients that have accumulated in the sediments have significant impacts on the water quality in adjacent ditches. A long-term plan must be developed to more strictly control the external loading of nutrients from surrounding land. Action plans to promote the growth of wetland plants in drainage ditches are important for increasing agrochemical retention in the TGR drainage ditches. TGR drainage ditches from residential zones must be actively managed by cleaning and sediment removal to control the risk of nutrients being released into the reservoir.

J	Stephenson, K; Shabman, L				Stephenson, Kurt; Shabman, Leonard			Nutrient Assimilation Services for Water Quality Credit Trading Programs: A Comparative Analysis with Nonpoint Source Credits	COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Water quality trading programs allow regulated point sources to meet some nutrient control requirements by buying nutrient reduction credits from other pollutant sources. Reduction credits can be created when agricultural land managers implement best management practices and regulators predict that those practices will result in water quality conditions equivalent to controlling discharges at the regulated source. However, natural variability in runoff combines with model and data limitations to make predictions of water quality equivalence uncertain. Nutrient assimilation credits can be created by increasing the capacity of the ecosystem to assimilate nutrients through investments in aquatic plant biomass creation and harvest, shellfish aquaculture, stream restoration, and wetlands restoration and creation. Nutrient assimilation credits and agricultural nonpoint source reduction credits are evaluated based on a number of water quality criteria including service quantification certainty, temporal matching, additionality, and leakage. Nutrient assimilation credits can provide greater certainty than agricultural best management practices in producing equivalent water quality outcomes and should be an option in trading programs.																	0892-0753	1521-0421					2017	45	1					24	43		10.1080/08920753.2017.1237240								WOS:000394463800002

The occurrence and potential ecological risk assessment of bauxite mine-impacted water and sediments in Kuantan, Pahang,Malaysia	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Recent bauxite mining activities in the vicinity of Kuantan, Pahang, have been associated with apparent environmental quality degradation and have raised environmental concerns among the public. This study was carried out to evaluate the overall ecological impacts on water and sediment quality from the bauxite mining activities. Water and sediment samples were collected at seven sampling locations within the bauxite mining areas between June and December 2015. The water samples were analyzed for water quality index (WQI) and distribution of major and trace element geochemistry. Sediment samples were evaluated based on geochemical indices, i.e., the enrichment factor (EF) and geoaccumulation index (I (geo)). Potential ecological risk index was estimated to assess the degree to which sediments of the mine-impacted areas have been contaminated with heavy metals. The results showed that WQIs of some locations were classified as slightly polluted and contained metal contents exceeding the recommended guideline values. The EFs indicated minimal to moderate enrichment of metals (Pb, Cu, Zn, Mn, As, Cd, Cr, Ni, Co, and Sr) in the sediments. I (geo) showed slightly to partially polluted sediments with respect to As at some locations. The potential ecological risk index (RI) showed that As posed the highest potential ecological risk with RI of 52.35-60.92 at two locations, while other locations indicated low risk. The findings from this study have demonstrated the impact of recent bauxite mining activities, which might be of importance to the local communities and relevant authorities to initiate immediate rehabilitation phase of the impacted area.

In the present study, 112 water samples collected from 14 lakes and 11 drinking water source sites in Wuhan were detected for the residues of OCPs in November 2013 and July 2014, respectively. The I OCPs pound ranged from 5.61 to 13.62 ng L-1 in summer with the maximum value in Yezhi Lake and 3.18 to 7.73 ng L-1 in winter with the highest concentration in Yandong Lake. Except dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs), OCP concentrations in summer were significantly higher than those in winter mostly due to the non-point source pollution including land runoff in summer. Source apportionment of hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) and DDTs revealed the historical use of technical HCH and lindane and the new input of DDT, respectively. The spatial distribution of OCPs was not uniform in the surface water of Wuhan because of the significant influence of land development and fishery. The risk assessments showed the heptachlor, and heptachlor epoxide in most sampling sites exceeded the threshold set by the European Union, indicating the possible adverse effects for aquatic lives. Negligible non-carcinogenic risks for drinking and bathing as well as carcinogenic risks for bathing were found in the surface water. However, the total carcinogenic risks of all OCPs (aRs) caused by drinking in summer were higher than the safe level of 10(-7) in all sampling sites. It was implied that the surface water in Wuhan was not safe for directly drinking without effective purification.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				JAN	2017	24	2					1975	1986		10.1007/s11356-016-7956-7								WOS:000394254000081	27798806

In this study, aiming to evaluate potential impacts of metallic mining activities on the quality of a transboundary river (Selenge) in central northern Mongolia, we performed hydrochemical investigations of rivers (Tuul, Khangal, Orkhon, Haraa, and Selenge). Hydrochemical analysis of river waters indicates that, while major dissolved ions originate from natural weathering (especially, dissolution of carbonate minerals) within watersheds, they are also influenced by mining activities. The water quality problem arising from very high turbidity is one of the major environmental concerns and is caused by suspended particles (mainly, sediment and soil particles) from diverse erosion processes, including erosion of river banks along the meandering river system, erosion of soils owing to overgrazing by livestock, and erosion by human activities, such as mining and agriculture. In particular, after passing through the Zaamar gold mining area, due to the disturbance of sediments and soils by placer gold mining, the Tuul River water becomes very turbid (up to 742 Nephelometric Turbidity Unit (NTU)). The Zaamar area is also the contamination source of the Tuul and Orkhon rivers by Al, Fe, and Mn, especially during the mining season. The hydrochemistry of the Khangal River is influenced by heavy metal (especially, Mn, Al, Cd, and As)-loaded mine drainage that originates from a huge tailing dam of the Erdenet porphyry Cu-Mo mine, as evidenced by delta S-34 values of dissolved sulfate (0.2 to 3.8 aEuro degrees). These two contaminated rivers (Tuul and Khangal) merge into the Orkhon River that flows to the Selenge River near the boundary between Mongolia and Russia and then eventually flows into Lake Baikal. Because water quality problems due to mining can be critical, mining activities in central northern Mongolia should be carefully managed to minimize the transboundary movement of aquatic contaminants (in particular, turbidity, dissolved organic carbon, Fe and Al) from mining activities.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				JAN	2017	24	2					2019	2034		10.1007/s11356-016-7895-3								WOS:000394254000085	27807785					
J	Liu, ZH; Yin, H; Dang, Z				Liu, Ze-hua; Yin, Hua; Dang, Zhi			Do estrogenic compounds in drinking water migrating from plastic pipe distribution system pose adverse effects to human? An analysis of scientific literature	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												With the widespread application of plastic pipes in drinking water distribution system, the effects of various leachable organic chemicals have been investigated and their occurrence in drinking water supplies is monitored. Most studies focus on the odor problems these substances may cause. This study investigates the potential endocrine disrupting effects of the migrating compound 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol (2,4-d-t-BP). The summarized results show that the migration of 2,4-d-t-BP from plastic pipes could result in chronic exposure and the migration levels varied greatly among different plastic pipe materials and manufacturing brands. Based on estrogen equivalent (EEQ), the migrating levels of the leachable compound 2,4-d-t-BP in most plastic pipes were relative low. However, the EEQ levels in drinking water migrating from four out of 15 pipes may pose significant adverse effects. With the increasingly strict requirements on regulation of drinking water quality, these results indicate that some drinking water transported with plastic pipes may not be safe for human consumption due to the occurrence of 2,4-d-t-BP. Moreover, 2,4-d-t-BP is not the only plastic pipe-migrating estrogenic compound, other compounds such as 2-tert-butylphenol (2-t-BP), 4-tert-butylphenol (4-t-BP), and others may also be leachable from plastic pipes.				zehua, liu/C-5187-2009	zehua, liu/0000-0003-3293-5356												0944-1344	1614-7499				JAN	2017	24	2					2126	2134		10.1007/s11356-016-8032-z								WOS:000394254000094	27830418

Structural and morphological characterization was performed by X-ray diffractometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and FESEM imaging. The Cu-doped oxide was found to possess lattice strain which resulted in the induction of surface defects. The prepared materials were used as sensing materials for toxic Cr(VI) ions in aqueous medium. A novel sensing technique was proposed based on adsorption, which was found to be more effective in terms of reproducibility and reusability of the sensor than the conventional electrochemical sensing technique. The sensing mechanism was explained based on the phenomenon of adsorption. This makes the efficiency of the sensor surface-dependent rather than chemical reactivity-dependent, thereby making it a non-destructive sensing technique. The Cu-doped NiO nanostructure (10% Cu doping) was found to show maximum sensitivity (252.62 at 1 ppm) and high selectivity, together with a low response time (similar to 2 s), towards Cr(VI) ions relative to Cd(II), As(V) and Pb(II) ions. This was due to its enhanced surface properties compared with its un-doped variants. The effect of Cu doping on the nanostructure morphology and consequently on sensor efficiency was also studied. The limit of detection was found to be 1 ppm (1 mg L-1) of Cr(VI) ions in aqueous solution. This material, along with the technique proposed, can thus be advantageous for the cost-efficient monitoring of water quality and drinking water standards.

However, WTPs face numerous potential obstacles, including changes in source water quality and quantity, financial burdens related to operations and upgrades, and stringent water quality regulations. Moreover, these challenges may be exacerbated by climate change in the form of long-term climatic perturbations and the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. To help WTPs overcome these issues, decision support systems (DSSs), which are used to aid and enhance the quality and consistency of decision-making, have been developed. This paper reviews the scientific literature on the development and application of DSSs for water treatment, including physically-based models, statistical models, and artificial intelligence techniques, and suggests future directions in the field. We first set the context of how water quality is impacted by climate change and extreme weather events. We then provide a comprehensive review of DSSs and conclude by offering a series of recommendations for future DSS efforts for WTPs, suggesting that these tools should (1) more accurately reflect the practical needs of WTPs, (2) represent the tradeoffs between the multiple competing objectives inherent to water treatment, (3) explicitly handle uncertainty to better inform decision makers, (4) incorporate nonstationarity, especially with regard to extreme weather events and climate change for long-term planning, and (5) use standardized terminology to accelerate the dissemination of knowledge in the field.

Unlike static infrastructure, which cannot adapt its operation to individual storms or changing land uses, "smart" stormwater systems will use system-level coordination to maximize watershed pollutant removal and treatment. We illustrate that this vision is not limited by technology, which has matured to the point at which it can be ubiquitously deployed. Rather, the challenge is much more fundamental and rooted in a system-level understanding of environmental science. Once distributed stormwater systems become highly instrumented and controlled, how should they be operated to achieve desired watershed outcomes? The answer to this question demands the development of a theoretical framework for smart stormwater systems. In this paper, we lay out the requirements for such a theory. Acknowledging that the adoption of these systems may still be years away, we also present a modeling framework to allow for the simulation of controlled stormwater systems before they become commonplace. We apply this control framework to two simulated case studies in which stormwater sites are controlled to reduce nitrate loads to downstream water bodies.

J	Wang, J; Chua, LHC; Shanahan, P				Wang, Jia; Chua, Lloyd H. C.; Shanahan, Peter			Evaluation of pollutant removal efficiency of a bioretention basin and implications for stormwater management in tropical cities	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY												Non-point source pollution is a prevalent problem throughout the world. Bioretention basins have been deployed worldwide to treat stormwater runoff and alleviate eutrophication in downstream water resources. However, basin performance in the tropics is poorly understood. Given the distinctly different rainfall-runoff characteristics of tropical climates, whether basins that are built according to temperate design guidelines are effective is questionable. There have been no field studies based on continuous, high-resolution, long-term monitoring in the tropics. In this study, 96 storms were monitored in the first bio-retention basin in Singapore. Of these, flow measurements were made during 80 events and samples were collected and analyzed for 15 water quality parameters (including nitrogen and phosphorus species, total suspended solids, and chemical oxygen demand) during six events. The mean removal rates were 25%, 46%, and 53% for total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and total suspended solids respectively. Results show that a lack of storage capacity and resulting high overflow reduce pollutant removal efficiency for high-rainfall-depth events. The transition from efficient to non-efficient removal occurs at a rainfall depth between 10 and 30 mm. Low EMC (event mean concentration) and weak first flush as a result of frequent and intense rainfall in the tropics also contribute to low removal rate. The results suggest a need to revise bioretention basin design guidelines for the tropics to be based on WQV or WQD (water quality volume or depth) instead of ARI (average recurrence interval). A larger basin volume (WQD between 10 to 30 mm) is recommended.					/0000-0001-8667-8186												2053-1400	2053-1419				JAN 1	2017	3	1					78	91		10.1039/c6ew00285d								WOS:000394270400006

Membrane fouling profiles were quantified by water flux decline and permeate conductivity. Mechanisms of the synergistic effect of combined fouling were revealed by light scattering measurements and infrared spectra of foulant-foulant interaction and foulant- membrane interaction. Membrane fouling morphology and element mapping provided further details of transport of colloidal silica particles and elucidated the mechanisms for silica-induced pore wetting. Specially, gelation of alginate formed an alginate layer on membrane surface and prevented penetration of silica particles into the membrane matrix, which was confirmed by silicon element mapping as well as infrared spectra. Adsorption of BSA protein by colloidal silica aggregates led to a sharp water flux decline and a partial pore wetting. Humic acid, forming a coil structure in high salinity, exhibited limited interaction with colloidal silica that penetrated into the membrane matrix and wetted membrane pores, thereby compromising the product water quality. Results showed that the combined organic fouling with colloidal silica particle not only deteriorated water production, but also compromised product quality by partial membrane wetting.

Separating solids from the liquid phase is one of the main goals of water treatment practices. Above all, the settling process is the most commonly used for this purpose. Generally, settling column tests are used in the laboratory to assess the total PM removal. Besides the traditional graphical method used for the interpretation of the laboratory results, other mathematical methods were developed - with the goal of simplifying the settling efficiency evaluation procedure and making it less subjective. To make a contribution in that direction, a study based on the comparison of four different mathematical methods for estimating PM removal efficiencies was conducted. The analysis was carried out on 15 samples of wastewater and showed that only two methods gave satisfactory results, and only one of them was physically based. Consequently, it is recommended to assess the overall PM removal, Etot, by a monoparametric exponential function, depending on the settling time (t) and on the first-order decay coefficient (k).

In this paper, the nitrification/denitrification reactor allowed a reduction in organic load, but offered a weak efficiency in nitrate reduction. However, the additions of the activated sludge in the reactor improve this efficiency. A decrease of NO3--N values from 13.3 to 8 mg/l was noted. Nevertheless, sludge inoculation led to a net increase of the number of pathogenic bacteria. For this reason, a UV-C pilot reactor was installed at the exit of the biological nitrificationdenitrification device. Thus, a fluence of 50 mJ.cm(-2) was sufficient to achieve values of 20 MPN/100 ml for fecal coliform and 6 MPN/100 ml for fecal streptococci, conforms to Tunisian Standards of Rejection. On the other hand, the DGGE approach has allowed a direct assessment of the bacterial community changes upon the treated wastewater.																	0959-3330	1479-487X					2017	38	6					762	771		10.1080/09593330.2016.1230651								WOS:000396790600013	27628535

Therefore, plastic packages and plastic wastes being formed later on, no matter how meticulously they are collected, may lead to adverse effects on marine ecosystems in terms of their content. In coastal areas where macro plastics are detected, the entrance of materials into the marine ecosystem is very easy as a result of climatic and abiotic factors. The macro plastics that reach seas and oceans disintegrate in time and get a microplastic size and thus pose a threat for the marine organisms. This study aims to determine the possible entrance ways of macro and micro plastics, which were detected after they had been dimensioned in coastal area, into the marine ecosystem and their possible effects on living ecosystem on Istanbul coastal area. The studies, which have newly been started on microplastics, reveal the need for making a policy by predicting the conditions of globalized world apart from the country conditions. The role of researchers in the monitoring of plastic pollution will increase in the coming years, and the truly "big" data they document must become part of the science of plastic pollution. For the present, it is real that a few scientists around the Turkey are engaged in attempting to understand the consequences seas.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	1					208	215										WOS:000395724000030

Standard methods of analysis have been used to determine total alkalinity (TA), total hardness (TH), total dissolved solids (TDS), carbon dioxide, major positive ions concentrations, and major negative ions concentrations. The potential of scale formation and corrosivity of all water samples were also determined using Langelier Saturation Index (LSI), Ryznar Stability Index (RSI), Puckorius Scaling Index (PSI), Aggressive Index (AI), Calcium Carbonate Precipitation Potential Index (CCPP), and Larson-Skold Index (L&Skl). All measured parameters were found to be within the range of permissible values of both Jordanian standards and WHO guidelines for drinking water. Based on the calculated indices, it has been found that about 31 % of studied water samples suffered from corrosion, while 69% suffered from scale formation. L&Skl index calculations showed that chloride and sulphate ions interfered with the natural scale formation in 93% of the studied water samples, while no interferenece was seen in 7% of the samples. LSI results ranged from-1.5 to 0.92, RSI ranged from 6.11 to 9.73, PSI ranged from 4.45 to 9.14, AI range was 11.45-12.71, CCPP range is-50.1-34.7, and finally L&Skl range was 0.15-1.02. The degree of linear association between two of any water parameters was calculated for all meseared parameters. Correlation coefficient values show high interrelation between EC with TDS and Cl-, TDS with Cl-, and TH with Cal'. Mixing water from two different sources ( Disi and Zai) showed that the combination improved the water quality especially when the ratio was 1:1.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	1A					634	645										WOS:000395724300010

Based on the Saint-Venant equation and kappa-epsilon mixed model, this paper designed a 2D hydrodynamic and water quality model to optimize the layout of the sewage outlets along Jinsha River of Panzhihua city, and satisfactory results were obtained. Before optimization, numerical results showed that some sewage outlets had major pollution zones, and seriously affected the water quality downstream, thus it is necessary to further optimization design the sewage outlets. After optimization, numerical results demonstrated that, the river water could accommodate more discharge capacity, and even when the discharge concentration of chemical oxygen demand and ammonia nitrogen increased to 100mg/L and 15 mg/L, the sewage outlets still have minor pollution zone than before. Therefore, the proposed model is quite efficient to simulate the pollutant diffusion, and the optimization design is essential for the long-term plan.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	1A					674	685										WOS:000395724300015

The highest number of THB bacteria in water body was found in August at a site located in the Ergene River, and the lowest in December at a site located in the Meric (Maritsa, Evros) River. The highest number of THB in sediment was found in February at a site located in the Ergene River, and the lowest in July at a site located in the Meric River. Some physicochemical measurements have been done at the same time as the bacterial sampling to determine environmental conditions of the ecosystems. According to Spearman's correlation index, some environmental conditions were found to have a remarkable correlation with bacterial distribution (p<0.05). This research concluded that pollution load significantly increased bacteria count and played an important role in variation of bacterial quality of the rivers.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	1A					717	725										WOS:000395724300020

As the only one undammed river in Yangtze River basin, the Chishui River still maintains properties of natural rivers and is regarded as an ideal river for pilot biological monitoring on water quality. The aim of this study is to establish biocriteria based on macro invertebrates for water quality assessment and a sustainable management framework, and enhance integrated river basin management in the Yangtze River basin. Seventy-one sampling sites were set up to collect biological and water samples. According to certain steps, 4 core metrics were selected from 57 candidate metrics and regarded as sensitive to pollution and joined into the final system, including the metrics ScrapPct, EphemTax, ASPT and EPTPct. Four final metrics were from different metric groups and highly related to several water parameters, and the CSMMI index was also significantly correlated with the pollution gradient extracted from the macroinvertebrate community data. The deviation rates between chemical and biological assessment were acceptable. The results of application evaluation indicated the CSMMI index were a robust and reliable tool for bioassessment, possibly adapted and used in the adjacent rivers.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	1A					749	760										WOS:000395724300024

Heavy cyanobacterial blooms occur in this highly turbid and shallow lake during summer and early autumn months, and excessive fish kills were observed after the blooms. The purpose of the present study was to characterize the zooplankton fauna of the pelagic food web to its relationship with selected water quality variables, and to evaluate its contribution to the food chain namely as abundance and diversity in a hypereutrophic shallow lake. Zooplankton and water samples were collected bimonthly at five stations from the open water of the lake between July 2010 and February 2012. During the study period a total of 48 taxa were recorded (3 taxa for Copepoda, 6 taxa for Cladocera, and 39 taxa for Rotifera). Rotifera was the most abundant group of the zooplankton community, comprising 81.2% of all samples, followed by Copepods 10.3% and Cladocerans 8.5%. Zooplankton community of the lake was dominated by eurytopic euplanktonic species Keratella cochlearis (21.8%). According to the Q(B/T) index, Lake Manyas showed a eutrophic character (Q(B/T)=2.3). The outcome of the statistical analysis showed that zooplankton fauna and its abundance were influenced mainly by water temperature, suspended particulate matter, and Secchi disk depth (transparency), respectively. The dense turbidity of Lake Manyas may be responsible for the elimination of sensitive organisms (larger sized cladocerans and copepods) over time, and also allow the dominancy of rotifers. Moreover cyanobacterial blooms affected crustaceans negatively, through poor food quality and harmful toxins. Temperature had a positive effect on rotifers as a result of population growth rates and available food. Consequently, the main factors that altered the composition and abundance of zooplankton in Lake Manyas were determined to be physical variables and favorable food availability.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	1A					834	845										WOS:000395724300033

As the urbanization and population increasing, three types of surface water are simultaneously applied for drinking water sources in Huzhou. Based on the continuous monitoring and data analysis from 2011 to 2015, water quality evaluation was carried out by nine water quality indexes, in order to investigate the pollution characteristics and temporal variation trends of drinking water sources. The results showed that these three types of surface water generally conformed to the water quality standards of drinking water sources, and the water quality decreased in order of reservoir, lake and river. The water quality of reservoir was good and stable, while the main problem of Tai Lake was the exceeding standards of total nitrogen and total phosphorus which might lead to the algae growth. In the rivers, the indexes exceeding the national standards were total nitrogen, iron and manganese, and water quality indexes including chemical oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen, ammonia nitrogen and total nitrogen exhibited seasonal variation. More attention should be paid to water eutrophication and seasonal accidental risk in Huzhou.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	1A					969	976										WOS:000395724300051

The present study covers measurement and evaluation of water quality parameters. Omerli Dam Reservoir has eutrophic character in terms of secchi disc depth (varies between 1.0-3.0 m) and phosphorus parameter (varies between 0.001-3.52 mg/L). It has oligotrophic character in terms of phytoplankton and carbon produced per unit area. Although pH of the reservoir is often alkaline in character, it shows categorically weak acid character after heavy rains. The chlorophyll-a parameter measured in the reservoir varies in vertical and horizontal positions. The average chlorophyll-a in the reservoir is 1.03 mg/L. Based on the water temperature measurements in the reservoir, it was determined that there was stratification in the reservoir during summer months. This stratification (the thermocline) was determined to be destroyed during winter months and the spring. The mean value of the measured dissolved oxygen in the reservoir was 8.49 mg/L. The TKN average in the reservoir was calculated as 1.83 mg/L. With these parameters, Omerli Dam Reservoir water quality could not be considered in a very clean class. Some rehabilitation studies have been carried out to solve the pollution problem in the lake basin. Preventing the pollution and improving water quality have affected the nature of the reservoir basin but it is necessary to continuously monitor the ecological balance of the reservoir continuously, which is significant for drinking water, fisheries and recreation facilities.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	1A					977	988										WOS:000395724300052

Because of its water capacity and myriad benefits in aquaculture facility, agricultural activities and tourism. The lake is considered as an important wetland within Buyuk Menderes basin. This study investigate the aquaculture facilities and anthropogenic sources of pollutions and how they affect the water quality of Bafa Lake. The major factors that control the quality-of Bafa Lake water are agricultural activities in the basin, domestic and industrial wastes that come from Buyuk Menderes River and its surrounding lake, fisheries and aquaculture facilities. Contaminants located in the Lake are continuously having a negative impact on its water quality during the last three decades. The effect of sea bream (Sparus aurata) and sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) cultivation facilities on surface water quality in the Lake were determined. Water samples were taken from five stations between April 2013 and March 2014 from Bafa Lake. Sample were analyzed for water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity, amonium nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, and orthophosphate. From result surface water quality was assessed based on the comparison of samples collected near aquaculture stations. For reference, a sample was taken outside the cultivation area and compared with the Water Pollution Registration Act (WPRA) standards. According to the WPRA, surface water quality of the Lake was classified as level II. At the end of analyses, it was revealed that the area where aquaculture activities were intense showed high rate of polution than the other 3 stations as well as the reference station. The results show that, aquaculture activities on sea bream and sea bass have a negative impact in the entire Bafa Lake.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	2A					1538	1547										WOS:000396642600025

BACTERIOPLANKTON CHARACTERISTICS AND WATER CHEMISTRY IN TWO MAJOR TRIBUTARIES OF DRINKING WATER SOURCE	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN												Rasina and Blatasnica, two major tributaries of drinking water source, reservoir Celije, were sampled during one year investigation. The parameters that were determined were as follows: water temperature, KMnO4 consumption, concentrations of nutrients (total phosphorus, orthophosphates, ammonia nitrogen, nitrites, nitrates), and total bacterial count. Also, the morphotype diversity of bacterioplankton was investigated. Based on these parameters, Blatasnica had significantly poorer water quality than Rasina, primarily due to increased levels of total phosphorus, orthophosphates, ammonia nitrogen, and total bacteria. Also, Rasina had a worse quality of water after the inflow of Blatasnica than more upstream. The dominant bacteria morphotype at all sites were rods, followed by cocci and curved forms. Abundance of the rods was positively correlated with water turbidity, KMnO4 consumption and concentration of ammonia nitrogen. Abundance of cocci was also correlated with these parameters, including total phosphorus, orthophosphates and nitrites, but negatively. Curved bacteria were the only bacterial type showed positive correlation with water temperature.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	2A					1687	1697										WOS:000396642600044

In China, it has been increasingly widely applied in wastewater treatment and reclamation plants. This paper presented experience with several years of full-scale operation at the Wuxi New District, which has successfully adopted the large-scale application of membrane technology for water reclamation. The design and results of long-term operation of three MBRs in local wastewater treatment plant and a ultrafiltration-reverse osmosis plant in industry were introduced and discussed. Since 2009, the application of MBRs in three wastewater treatment plant with capacity ranging from 20,000 m(3)/d to 80,000 m3/d in Wuxi New District has allowed the 1A standard discharge of sewage that initially contained 360 similar to 510 mg/L CODcr, 250 similar to 300 mg/L SS, 43 similar to 55 mg/L total nitrogen and 3.1 similar to 5.0 mg/L total phosphate. With a product capacity of 10,000 m(3)/d, the high-purity reclamation of fluoride wastewater from a semiconductor manufacture which was recycled for industrial use and landscape irrigation was achieved by the adoption of a dual-membrane ultrafiltration-reverse osmosis plant. The dual membrane process yielded permeate with fluoride content below 1.0 mg/L and the product water quality meet the custom requirements. In the reverse osmosis operation, a positive correlation between feed temperature and permeate fluoride was observed.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	2A					1791	1799										WOS:000396642600057

Two centuries of nitrogen dynamics: Legacy sources and sinks in the Mississippi and Susquehanna River Basins	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Global flows of reactive nitrogen (N) have increased significantly over the last century in response to agricultural intensification and elevated levels of atmospheric deposition. Despite widespread implementation conservation measures, N concentrations in surface waters are often remaining steady or continuing to increase. Although such lack of response has been attributed to time lags associated with legacy N stores in subsurface reservoirs, it is unclear what the magnitudes of such stores are and how they are partitioned between shallow soil and deeper groundwater reservoirs. Here we have synthesized data to develop a 214year (1800-2014) trajectory of N inputs to the land surface of the continental U.S. We have concurrently developed a parsimonious, process-based model, Exploration of Long-tErM Nutrient Trajectories (ELEMeNT) that pairs this input trajectory with a travel time-based approach to simulate transport and retention along subsurface pathways. Using the model, we have reconstructed historic nitrate yields at the outlets of two major U.S. watersheds, the Mississippi River Basin (MRB) and Susquehanna River Basin (SRB). Our results show significant N loading above baseline levels in both watersheds before the widespread use of commercial N fertilizers, largely due to the conversion of forest and grassland to row crop agriculture. Model results also allow us to quantify the magnitudes of legacy N in soil and groundwater pools and to highlight the dominance of soil legacies in MRB and groundwater legacies in SRB. Approximately 55% and 18% of the current annual N loads in the MRB and SRB were found to be older than 10years of age.

In this study, a geographic information system based LVF model for a semiquantitative assessment of groundwater pollution risk is established, based on the groundwater pollution source load (L), groundwater vulnerability (V), and groundwater function value (F). Further, the pollution source load is characterized by seven specific pollution sources, the vulnerability is calculated by the modified DRASTIC method, and the groundwater function value is evaluated with the water quality and quantity. The model was used to assess the risk of shallow groundwater pollution in Shenyang city, Northeast China, with an area of 8,263 km(2). The results show that highest risk areas account for 16.3% of the study area and are mainly distributed in the east of the study area. High risk areas are significantly affected by a shallow buried depth of groundwater and many types of harmful pollutants from industrial, agricultural, and domestic pollution sources. The evaluation results reflect the risk of groundwater pollution in the Shenyang area, which is relevant to the management and sustainable use of groundwater resources in the area.																	1080-7039	1549-7860					2017	23	2					276	298		10.1080/10807039.2016.1245099								WOS:000396866900006						
J	Zhang, YH; Liang, SX; Sun, ZC				Zhang Yihui; Liang Shuxiu; Sun Zhaochen			Measurement and Numerical Study of Vertical Mixing Microstructure in the Bohai Strait	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Vertical mixing plays an important role in three-dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality models. The purpose of this study is to analyze the characteristics of vertical mixing in strong tidal waters and the simulation capability of turbulence closure models under the influence of flow velocity variations and temperature distribution. The distribution characteristics of thermocline and vertical mixing in the Bohai Strait is analyzed through field observations conducted using the Turbulence Ocean Microstructure Acquisition Profiler in summer. Based on the measured temperature and mixing data, three-dimensional numerical models are established with various temperature distribution and turbulence closure schemes. It is concluded that the vertical eddy viscosity K-m and the thermal-diffusion coefficient K-h, using the Mellor and Yamada level 2.5 (MY-2.5) and the k-epsilon turbulence closure models, exhibit a significant change with change in flow velocity and a time delay compared with the flow velocity process disregarding the effect of wind. The vertical mixing coefficients due to changing flow velocity under isothermality or temperature stratification could vary by one or two orders of magnitude, respectively. Simulated mixing coefficients using two different turbulence closure models exhibit different variations under isothermality and temperature stratification and have a significant discrepancy with the measurement data. Thermocline evolution is compared using three different methods for K-m and K-h. It is found that the temperature mixes gradually using constant mixing coefficients in the vertical direction. When the mixing coefficients are computed with the MY-2.5 and k-epsilon models, the temperature mixes rapidly in the shallow water zone. The mixing of temperature is even faster in the lower layer than in the upper layer in the deepwater zone, leading to the thermocline moving toward the upper layer. Moreover, the temperature mixes faster in the k-epsilon model than in the MY-2.5 model.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				JAN	2017	33	1					158	172		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-15-00235.1								WOS:000394926100014

They represent an important concern due to their widespread distribution in the environment, their resistance to biodegradation, their potential to bioaccumulate and their harmful effects. Several pilot treatments have been implemented to prevent economic consequences and deterioration of soil and water quality. As a promising option, fungal enzymes are regarded as a powerful choice for degradation of PAHs. Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Pleurotus ostreatus and Bjerkandera adusta are most commonly used for the degradation of such compounds due to their production of ligninolytic enzymes such as lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidase and laccase. The rate of biodegradation depends on many culture conditions, such as temperature, oxygen, accessibility of nutrients and agitated or shallow culture. Moreover, the addition of biosurfactants can strongly modify the enzyme activity. The removal of PAHs is dependent on the ionization potential. The study of the kinetics is not completely comprehended, and it becomes more challenging when fungi are applied for bioremediation. Degradation studies in soil are much more complicated than liquid cultures because of the heterogeneity of soil, thus, many factors should be considered when studying soil bioremediation, such as desorption and bioavailability of PAHs. Different degradation pathways can be suggested. The peroxidases are heme-containing enzymes having common catalytic cycles. One molecule of hydrogen peroxide oxidizes the resting enzyme withdrawing two electrons. Subsequently, the peroxidase is reduced back in two steps of one electron oxidation. Laccases are copper-containing oxidases. They reduce molecular oxygen to water and oxidize phenolic compounds.

GIS-based prediction of stream chemistry using landscape composition, wet areas, and hydrological flow pathways	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Landscape morphology exerts strong, scale-dependent controls on stream hydrology and biogeochemistry in heterogeneous catchments. We applied three descriptors of landscape structure at different spatial scales based on new geographic information system tools to predict variability in stream concentrations for a wide range of solutes (Al, Ba, Be, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Na, S, Si, Sr, Sc, Co, Cr, Ni, Cu, As, Se, Rb, Y, Cd, Sb, Cs, La, Pb, Th, U, DOC, and Cl) using a linear regression analysis. Results showed that less reactive elements, which can be expected to behave more conservatively in the landscape (e.g., Na, K, Ca, Mg, Cl, and Si), generally were best predicted from the broader-scale description of landscape composition (areal coverage of peat, tills, and sorted sediments). These results highlight the importance of mineral weathering as a source of some elements, which was best captured by landscape-scale descriptors of catchment structure. By contrast, more nonconservative elements (e.g., DOC, Al, Cd, Cs, Co, Th, Y, and U), were best predicted by defining wet areas and/or flow path lengths of different patches in the landscape. This change in the predictive models reflect the importance of peat deposits, such as organic-rich riparian zones and mire ecosystems, which are favorable environments for biogeochemical reactions of more nonconservative elements. As such, using this understanding of landscape influences on stream chemistry can provide improved mitigation strategies and management plans that specifically target source areas, so as to minimize mobilization of undesired elements into streams.

Data was acquired from the State Environmental Monitoring database for the period before and after changing the location of discharge from the treatment plant. The before-after (BA) and before-after-control-impact (BACI) analyses were used to determine the effectiveness of applied solutions. The BA study covered 12 physicochemical parameters and showed improvement of water quality in terms of phosphorous compounds, EC, ammonium nitrogen, TKN, TN, and BOD5. Lack of statistically significant differences for nitrates, pH, and TOC were noted. The BACI analysis was only applicable for six physicochemical parameters, and statistically significant differences were shown for TN, TKN, ammonium nitrogen, and TP. There were no differences in the case of nitrates and DO. After wastewater effluent diversion, a high concentration of nitrates in Trzemna water was still observed, with a statistically confirmed increasing trend. This is an effect of the negative impact of agricultural diffuse pollution. Modernisation of a WWTP and wastewater effluent diversion positively affected the quality of Trzemna water. The BA and BACI analyses in relation to statistical tests applied in hydrology can be successfully used to evaluate the impact of changes in the environment on water quality. In the case of BA design it was possible to analyse 12 parameters, whereas in BACI analysis it was only half of them. However, this method is recognised as more reliable and eliminates the impact of natural temporary variations.

The current study aims to investigate the water quality and fish diversity at Rasul Barrage in the Jhelum River. A total of six sampling sites were assessed for pollution levels and fish fauna of the Barrage. Physicochemical parameters such as turbidity, biological oxygen demand (BOD), and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were deviating from the permissible limits of fresh water set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), but meeting the criteria of NEQS, whereas pH, temperature, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), total suspended solids (TSS), sodium, and chloride were below the permissible limits of NEQS, but the TSS level was above EPA standards. However, the concentrations of metals such as iron (2.62-3.98 mg L-1), chromium (0.03-0.59 mg L-1), and nickel (0.49-1.71 mg L-1) were higher than the permissible limits for drinking and irrigation waters. hi addition, a total of 35 fish species belonging to eight families were identified. Survey and result of study showed that concentrations of pollutants and non-stop fishing activities of commercial fish are the main reasons for the reduction of fish fauna. Two exotic fish species, Oreochromismossambicus and Ctenopharyngodon idella, were found to be abundant where population of native fish fauna numbers were being reduced. We concluded that the surface water quality is poor, as is evident from the higher concentrations of BOD, COD, and metals. Urgent measures are required to prevent such contamination and regular monitoring of water quality in the study area.

Contents of heavy metals (Sb, As, Cd, Pb, Zn) in both water and sediments were detected via atomic absorption spectrophotometry and atomic fluorescence spectrometry, respectively. The variation coefficient (C.V) of each heavy metal as well as the partition coefficient (Kd) between surficial sediments and water was calculated. The ecological risks of heavy metals in collapsed lakes were assessed via geoaccumulation index (I-geo), and we estimated the Pearson correlation coefficients between heavy metals. Together with the real situations around collapsed lakes, we resolved the sources of heavy metals. We found that the contents of heavy metals in water were basically below Surface Water Quality Standard I. The contents of heavy metals in the majority of sediment samples exceeded the background levels in the Yangtze River and Huai River areas, but were below the threshold effect concentration. The spatial distributions of heavy metals in surficial sediments were not uniform, as the C.V.s indicate medium variations. Analysis of Partition coefficient showed that Lieshan collapsed lake (LSH) was under severe risk. An analysis of I-geo revealed gentle-medium ecological risks from Sb, As, and Cd. The classification and frequency distributions of I-geo of five heavy metals indicate that the ecological risk of Cd was the largest. The ecological risk was lowest in Yangzhuang collapsed lake (YZH). These results were confirmed by analysis of C.V and Kd. Analysis of heavy metal sources showed that the inputs of Sb and As into the three collapsed lakes were human-driven and very complex, probably due to point-source pollution, including leaching from gangue piles and industrial discharge. Cd mainly originated from non-point-source agricultural pollution, while Pb and Zn might mainly originate from natural sources.																	1230-1485	2083-5906					2017	26	1					181	188		10.15244/pjoes/64379								WOS:000394830000020

Determining Multivariate Analysis Sampling Frequency for Monitoring Contamination Caused by Trout Farms	POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES												Recent rapid growth of the aquaculture industry and the necessity to comply with environmental standards suggest the need for studies on the possible negative effects of this type of industry. One of the most devastating effects of aquaculture is water pollution caused by the discharge of untreated effluent from fish farms into aquatic ecosystems. Assessment of the pollutants requires an optimal design of a water monitoring network in a way to demonstrate changes in aquatic environments. Accordingly, the present study used multivariate statistical analysis to determine sampling frequency for optimal monitoring of the contaminants resulting from trout farms in the Haraz River in northern Iran. For this purpose, a total number of 17 physical and chemical water quality parameters were sampled monthly over a one-year period based on the instructions recommended in the standard method (2005) [1]. The results showed that changes in biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) during the warm months of summer were very high and reached its peak in August and September. This may be attributed to the increased fish production in fish farms, increased food intake to feed the fish, and higher rate of discharge from fish farms containing waste feed and fish faeces. The nitrate also reached its maximum level in June due to the same reasons. Conversely, dissolved oxygen (DO) level was the lowest in the warm months (August and September). The reason would be increased consumption of DO due to higher production rate in the fish farms and increased metabolism of fish in warm months. Overall, the findings confirmed the applicability of multivariate techniques in determining temporal frequency of the measurements during the monitoring period. By which it would be possible to recognize the reality of changes in water quality, with fewer measurements, and in less time and cost.																	1230-1485	2083-5906					2017	26	1					337	346		10.15244/pjoes/64377								WOS:000394830000036

NPS pollution is influenced by a multitude of site-related factors whose effects are complicated. We estimated NPS pollution with a soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model in China's Fan River watershed. A new method, boosted regression tree (BRT), was proposed to study the relationship of impact factors on NPS pollution. We analyzed the effects of elevation, land use, soil, and slope on the patterns of sediment transport, total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP). The results showed that R-2 values were higher than 0.76, and NSE was higher than 0.67. The SWAT model can estimate NPS pollution effectively in a study area. Although the spatial pattern of sediment and TP was quite consistent, the relationship between sediment and TN was weak. The contribution of impact factors for sediment TN and TP were different. Slope is the most important impact factor for sediment and TP load. Land use is the most important impact factor for TN load. The BRT model can reduce barriers to factor complexity and promote understanding of the NPS pollution formation mechanism. We proposed control strategies of pollution sources, and our research has proven to be useful for the explanation of impact factors in NPS pollution study, which is meaningful for NPS pollution control.																	1230-1485	2083-5906					2017	26	1					403	411		10.15244/pjoes/64381								WOS:000394830000043

Simulation calculations were performed based on a range of climate and river flow projections for the near (2021-2050) and for the far future (2071-2100) compared to a reference period (1961-1990). Changes in mean annual water temperature in the near future range between +0.6 and +1.4 A degrees C and between +1.9 and +2.2 A degrees C in the far future (average of nine stations). Monthly mean values of the far future change in a more differentiated way by +0.4 to +1.3 A degrees C in spring and +2.7 to +3.4 A degrees C in late summer. The length of periods of high water temperature, expressed as successive days with water temperatures over 27 A degrees C, increases by a factor of four until 2100. These prolonged durations of periods with unusually high water temperatures may provoke changes in the food web and in the rates of biological processes in the Rhine.																	1436-3798	1436-378X				JAN	2017	17	1			SI		299	308		10.1007/s10113-016-1006-3								WOS:000394157300023

Communities around the world are motivated to sustain and restore freshwater resources and are interested in processes controlling nutrient inputs. We studied the environment where streams flow into lakes, referred to as the stream-lake interface (SLI), for a channelized and unmodified stream outlet. Channelization is done to protect infrastructure or recreational beach areas. We collected hydraulic and nutrient data for surface water and shallow groundwater in two SLIs to develop conceptual models that describe characteristics that are representative of these hydrologic features. Water, heat, and solute transport models were used to evaluate hydrologic conceptualizations and estimate mean residence times of water in the sediment. A nutrient mass balance model is developed to estimate net rates of adsorption and desorption, mineralization, and nitrification along subsurface flow paths. Results indicate that SLIs are dynamic sources of nutrients to lakes and that the common practice of channelizing the stream at the SLI decreases nutrient concentrations in pore water discharging along the lakeshore. This is in contrast to the unmodified SLI that forms a barrier beach that disconnects the stream from the lake and results in higher nutrient concentrations in pore water discharging to the lake. These results are significant because nutrient delivery through pore water seepage at the lakebed from the natural SLI contributes to nearshore algal communities and produces elevated concentrations of inorganic nutrients in the benthic zone where attached algae grow.

A coupled three-dimensional hydrodynamic model for predicting hypolimnetic oxygenation and epilimnetic mixing in a shallow eutrophic reservoir	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Artificial mixing and hypolimnetic oxygenation are two common methods for improving water quality in reservoirs. To examine the effects of their operation on the thermal structure of the water column, we used a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model coupled with a newly developed water-jet model and an existing linear bubble-plume model in conjunction with whole-reservoir in situ mixing experiments in a drinking-water reservoir. This reservoir has a side-stream supersaturation (SSS) hypolimnetic oxygenation system and a bubble-plume epilimnetic mixing (EM) system installed to reduce hypolimnetic hypoxia and algal blooms. The results show that the SSS successfully adds dissolved oxygen to the hypolimnion without destratifying the reservoir, whereas the EM, located at the lower metalimnetic boundary, deepens this boundary and partially mixes the metalimnion and epilimnion. The newly developed water-jet model coupled with the hydrodynamic model can successfully predict the variation of the thermal structure in the reservoir. The extent to which the SSS and EM systems affect the thermal structure of the reservoir is also quantified by further application of the coupled hydrodynamic model.

We developed a one-dimensional, fluid flow and solute transport model that quantifies the influence of tidal pumping on nitrate removal and applied it to the tidal freshwater zone (TFZ) of White Clay Creek (Delaware, USA). In field observations and models, both oxygenated river water and anoxic groundwater deliver nitrate to carbon-rich riverbed sediment. A zone of nitrate removal forms beneath the aerobic interval, which expands and contracts over daily timescales due to tidal pumping. At high tide when oxygen-rich river water infiltrates into the bed, denitrification rates decrease by 25% relative to low tide. In the absence of tidal pumping, our model predicts that the aerobic zone would be thinner, and denitrification rates would increase by 10%. As tidal amplitude increases toward the coast, nitrate removal rates should decrease due to enhanced oxygen exchange across the sediment-water interface, based on sensitivity analysis. Denitrification hot spots in TFZs are more likely to occur in less permeable sediment under lower tidal ranges and higher rates of ambient groundwater discharge. Our models suggest that tidal pumping is not efficient at removing surface water nitrate but can remove up to 81% of nitrate from discharging groundwater in the TFZ of White Clay Creek. Given the high population densities of coastal watersheds, the reactive riverbeds of TFZs play a critical role in mitigating new nitrogen loads to coasts.

Integrated modeling in urban hydrology: reviewing the role of monitoring technology in overcoming the issue of 'big data' requirements	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER												Increasingly, the application of models in urban hydrology has undergone a shift toward integrated structures that recognize the interconnected nature of the urban landscape and both the natural and engineered water cycles. Improvements in computational processing during the past few decades have enabled the application of multiple, connected model structures that link previously disparate systems together, incorporating feedbacks and connections. Many applications of integrated models look to assess the impacts of environmental change on physical dynamics and quality of landscapes. Whilst these integrated structures provide a more robust representation of natural dynamics, they often place considerable data requirements on the user, whereby data are required at contrasting spatial and temporal scales which can often transcend multiple disciplines. Concomitantly, our ability to observe complex, natural phenomena at contrasting scales has improved considerably with the advent of increasingly novel monitoring technologies. This has provided a pathway for reducing model uncertainty and improving our confidence in modeled outputs by implementing suitable monitoring regimes. This commentary assesses how component models of an exemplar integrated model have advanced over the past few decades, with a critical focus on the role of monitoring technologies that have enabled better identification of the key physical process. This reduces the uncertainty of processes at contrasting spatial and temporal scales, through a better characterization of feedbacks which then enhances the utility of integrated model applications.

Annual precipitation regulates spatial and temporal drivers of lake water clarity	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Understanding how and why lakes vary and respond to different drivers through time and space is needed to understand, predict, and manage freshwater quality in an era of rapidly changing land use and climate. Water clarity regulates many characteristics of aquatic ecosystems and is responsive to watershed features, making it a sentinel of environmental change. However, whether precipitation alters the relative importance of features that influence lake water clarity or the spatial scales at which they operate is unknown. We used a data set of thousands of northern temperate lakes and asked (1) How does water clarity differ between a very wet vs. dry year? (2) Does the relative importance of different watershed features, or the spatial extent at which they are measured, vary between wet and dry years? (3)What lake and watershed characteristics regulate long-term water clarity trends? Among lakes, water clarity was reduced and less variable in the wet year than in the dry year; furthermore, water clarity was reduced much more in high-clarity lakes during the wet year than in low-clarity lakes. Climate, land use/land cover, and lake morphometry explained most variance in clarity among lakes in both years, but the spatial scales at which some features were important differed between the dry and wet years. Watershed percent agriculture was most important in the dry year, whereas riparian zone percent agriculture (around each lake and upstream features) was most important in the wet year. Between 1991 and 2012, water clarity declined in 23% of lakes and increased in only 6% of lakes. Conductance influenced the direction of temporal trend (clarity declined in lakes with low conductance), whereas the proportion of watershed wetlands, catchment-to-lake-area ratio, and lake maximum depth interacted with antecedent precipitation. Many predictors of water clarity, such as lake depth and landscape position, are features that cannot be readily managed. Given trends of increasing precipitation, eliminating riparian zone agriculture or keeping it <10% of area may be an effective option to maintain or improve water clarity.

Phosphorus cycling in urban aquatic ecosystems: connecting biological processes and water chemistry to sediment P fractions in urban stormwater management ponds	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Phosphorus (P) dynamics in urban landscapes may differ from that in natural landscapes due to different P sources and unique environmental conditions. However, many aspects of P cycles in urban areas, especially within engineered aquatic ecosystems, remain largely unknown. Through this work, we aim to contribute to better understanding of P cycling in urban aquatic ecosystems by investigating P fractions in sediment and their relationship with ambient chemistry in surface water from six urban stormwater management ponds located in Ontario, Canada. We found that organic P contributed up to 75% of total P in pond sediment, but this percentage decreased significantly between our two sampling events in June and September 2012. This decrease coincided with increased rates of extracellular enzyme (especially phosphatase) activities, which is indicative of fast mineralization processes in these ecosystems. Moreover, the decreased sediment organic P was matched by increased water column P concentration. This inverse relationship suggests that the large organic P pool in pond sediment, and its fast decomposition, contributed to internal release of P from sediment and increased water column P concentrations. The dominance of organic P in sediment and the putative role of relevant biological processes (i.e., decomposition and productivity) in urban ponds found in this study strongly contrast with classic water management expectations of physicochemically controlled P dynamics and long-term P storage in sediment of aquatic ecosystems. This difference suggests that urban stormwater ponds may perform poorly in terms of P retention and thereby contribute to poor water quality in terms of P pollution to downstream urban watersheds. Thus, stormwater pond design and future management strategies should consider these biogeochemical features of urban ponds, including internal P release, to help prevent eutrophication of downstream ecosystems.																	0168-2563	1573-515X				JAN	2017	132	1-2					203	212		10.1007/s10533-017-0293-1								WOS:000394351700012

Review on river bank filtration as an in situ water treatment process	CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY												Surface and ground water are valuable sources for drinking water. Certain industrial, mining, and agricultural practices pollute these critical resources. Riverbank filtration (RBF) is a cost-effective in situ water treatment process, which removes suspended solids and organic and inorganic pollutants. The RBF process is defined as a natural filter of soils and aquifer sediments at the river site. In RBF, river water moves through the pores of the natural soils of the riverbed and riverbank. RBF improves several physical, chemical, and biological properties of the river water. Several treatment actions including, filtration, sorption, and biological degradation occur during this process. Under specific conditions, RBF could be used as a treatment or pretreatment process to remove or decrease pollutants in surface water. In this paper, the effectiveness of RBF in improving the river water quality is presented. RBF as a cost-effective water treatment process is also discussed. Furthermore, factors that affect the performance of the RBF process and its overall effectiveness for developing countries are also discussed.																	1618-954X	1618-9558					2017	19	2					349	359		10.1007/s10098-016-1266-0								WOS:000394319300006

This two and half-year study covering several wet and dry seasons evaluated the impacts of small headwater dams without a base flow on downstream herbaceous dynamics. Results showed herb aerial cover and diversity below dams (new stream sources) are unique and different to original stream sources as well as to a comparable unregulated reach. The geomorphological habitats formed subsequent to damming did not show major influence on aerial cover of herbs; nevertheless, diversity showed a clear dependence. Downstream of dams were dominated by Acorus gramineus, which had >40% aerial cover, and this figure increased up to 60% within 2years (in between a major flood event). Simultaneously, downstream herb diversity decreased by 33%. However, diversity and aerial cover of the unregulated reach and original sources remained more or less the same. Herb pulling tests (simulating an uprooting mechanism during a flood) showed A.gramineus can withstand an eightfold higher force than the other herbs, especially in concrete surfaces and rock/sand pools. The estimated shear force on bed during the major flood was several folds less than the observed. This suggests downstream of dams behave opposite to the conventional understanding that large floods are considered as an agent of restoration.																	1936-0584	1936-0592				JAN	2017	10	1							e1774	10.1002/eco.1774								WOS:000393870100014

Macroinvertebrate responses to flow and stream temperature variability across regulated and non-regulated rivers	ECOHYDROLOGY												Flow regulation via impoundments threatens lotic ecosystems and the services they provide globally. Impoundments drastically alter flow and stream temperature variability within fluvial environments, but efforts to quantify ecohydrological and ecothermal responses to flow regulation in conjunction have been sparsely explored to date. This study examined macroinvertebrate community responses to antecedent flow (discharge) and stream temperature variability across paired regulated and non-regulated systems associated with three reservoirs located in adjacent catchments. Community abundances, functional traits, and biomonitoring indices were examined, and ecological differences between non-regulated and regulated sites were quantified, with the most sensitive faunal response being correlated against a suite of flow and thermal indices. Regulated sites exhibited reduced low-flow variability and rapid increases in discharge during peak flows that regularly exceeded those conveyed by non-regulated sites, while stream temperature variability was highly congruent between sites. Macroinvertebrate functional traits were particularly sensitive to flow regulation, and incorporating biomonitoring indices marginally improved the ecological discrimination between regulated and non-regulated sites. Unlike community abundances, functional traits did not vary spatially between catchments, highlighting that such information could guide the implementation of regional environmental flows. Macroinvertebrate communities responded significantly to various hydrological parameters, particularly those associated with the timing of extreme flows, but were less sensitive to thermal controls. Future research should explore ecological responses to antecedent hydrological and stream temperature variability associated with flow regulation to provide a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving biotic alterations, which could guide future environmental flow methodologies.

The plant growth and removal efficiencies under saline condition were evaluated. The evaluation was based entirely on routinely collected water quality data and the physical and chemical characteristics of the plants (Phragmites australis, Typha latifolia, Iris wilsonii, and Scirpus planiculmis). The principal parameters of concern in the effluent were chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP). The results showed that the CWs were able to remove COD, TN, and TP from ROC. S. planiculmis was not suitable for the treatment of high-saline wastewater. The sequence of metals accumulated in CW plants was K>Ca>Na>Mg>Zn>Cu. More than 70% of metals were accumulated in the aboveground of P. australis. The CW filled with gravel and manganese ore and planted with P. australis and T. latifolia had the best performance of pollutant removal, with average removal of 49.96%, 39.45%, and 72.01% for COD, TN, and TP, respectively. The effluent water quality met the regulation in China. These results suggested that HSF CW planted with P. australis and T. latifolia can be applied for ROC pollutants removal.				黄, 翔峰/C-3039-2017	黄, 翔峰/0000-0003-4898-7951												1522-6514	1549-7879					2017	19	3					262	269		10.1080/15226514.2016.1217392								WOS:000393783500008	27712090

When Permaculture Principles are used in the creation of water purification and harvesting systems, there can be multiple environmental and economic benefits. In the context of energy descent, it may be considered desirable to treat wastewater using minimal energy. The constructed wetland design presented here is a low-entropy system in which wastewater is harvested and transformed into lush and productive wetland, eliminating the requirement for non-renewable energy in water purification, and also maximising benefits: biodiversity, flood resilience and yield. In permaculture design, the high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorous compounds in sewage are viewed as valuable nutrients, resources to be harvested by a constructed wetland ecosystem and converted into useful yield. Similarly, rainwater runoff is not viewed as a problem which can cause flooding, but as a potential resource to be harvested to provide a yield. This paper presents a case study, with both water quality and productivity data, from Brookside Farm UK, where the use of Permaculture Design Principles has created a combined wastewater management and purification system, accepting all site water.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggested three factors of vulnerability; namely, exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity were used in this study with respect to water quantity and quality. In this study, 16 water quantity indicators and 13 water quality indicators were selected to identify the vulnerability using the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method. Environmental and socioeconomic data were obtained from the national statistics database, and hydrological data were simulated using the calibrated Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. Expert surveys and Shannon entropy method were used to determine subjective and objective weights for all indicators, individually. As a result, water quantity-vulnerable sub-basins were associated with high water use and water leakage ratios. Water quality-vulnerable sub-basins were associated with relatively high values of maximum consecutive dry days and heatwave days. The water quantity indices of both weighting methods showed relatively similar spatial distributions, while the distribution of water quality indices was distinct. These results suggest that considering different weighting methods is important for assessing the robust water resource vulnerability of sub-basins.

The turbidity in Lake Imha which is the eighth largest multipurpose dam in Korea has been the cause of major water quality problems for use as drinking water. The turbidity rose to 882 NTU, and it remained over 30 NTU continuously for 170 days during 2002, as the result of significant amounts of soil erosion from the watershed during the Asian monsoon typhoon. In this study, characteristics of suspended sediment loadings under the Asian summer monsoon climate was investigated by comparing the variation of yearly suspended sediment loads and the ratio of maximum suspended sediment loads in a single event to yearly suspended sediment load from Lake Imha watershed using the Hydrologic Simulation Program-FORTRAN (HSPF). The model calibration is performed according to the 2009-2010 events, and simulation results characterized suspended sediment loadings under the Asian summer monsoon climate for 2001-2010. Water sampling and flow rate measurements were performed every 4-6 h, and calibration was performed using hourly simulated sediment loads. The calibration results demonstrated good agreement with the observed data. The characteristics of suspended sediment loadings under the Asian summer monsoon climate are a high variance of the yearly suspended sediment load and a significant of amount of suspended sediment load during a single event influenced by the typhoon intensity. The maximum yearly suspended sediment load was 10 times higher than the minimum yearly value. About half of the yearly suspended sediment load was loaded with a single event under the Asian summer monsoon climate and the ratio of suspended sediment loads by a single event to total yearly loads ranged from 29% to 90%. Structural best management practices (BMPs) to trap suspended sediment in stormwater such as stormwater ponds or wetlands rely on much more storage volume or area and non-structural BMPs to minimize soil erosion by source control such as mulching or revegetation in disturbed areas, which are important BMPs, especially in the Asian summer monsoon region.																	2071-1050					JAN	2017	9	1							44	10.3390/su9010044								WOS:000394842700044

This study aims to review the technological innovations applied for landfill leachate treatment, taking into consideration the experiences obtained during the past years and the solutions which have been implemented. The review showed that both biological and physiochemical treatments are not able to achieve the requested water quality level, according to the limits established by regulations, whether applied in a single treatment or multiple treatments. In order to respect sustainable release limits to guarantee environmental protection, the construction of depuration systems and combining biological and physiochemical treatment methods is considered of the utmost importance. The review looks at possible joint applications of different treatment techniques reviewed by other studies and considers the state of the art of current research. Combined technical solutions suggested within the 2016 peer-reviewed papers are presented and discussed as a sustainable way to effectively treat landfill leachate, giving particular attention to feasible solutions for developing countries.

This population density, combined with poor wastewater management, results in aquatic ecosystems receiving a large volume of wastewater which may promote methane (CH4) emission. We measured water quality and CH4 emission from 11 aquatic ecosystems in Mexico City during 1 year, including reservoirs, rivers, lakes, canals and chinampas (system of floating garden on shallow lakes). The total CH4 emission from aquatic ecosystems was estimated as 3679 Mg CH4 year(-1), which represents 3.5 % of the annual CH4 emission of Mexico City. The main contributors are chinampas (33 %), followed by lakes (27 %), reservoirs (19 %), rivers (12 %) and canals (9 %). Water quality indicators were positively correlated with CH4 emission, therefore a decrease in untreated wastewater discharge may result in a significant reduction of the greenhouse gas footprint of Mexico City, after a transitional period during which the organic content of the sediment would be degraded.

J	Tiwari, AK; Singh, AK; Mahato, MK				Tiwari, Ashwani Kumar; Singh, Abhay Kumar; Mahato, Mukesh Kumar			GIS based evaluation of fluoride contamination and assessment of fluoride exposure dose in groundwater of a district in Uttar Pradesh, India	HUMAN AND ECOLOGICAL RISK ASSESSMENT												Groundwater is the main source of drinking water in both rural and urban areas of the Pratapgarh district in the eastern Uttar Pradesh. Fifty-five groundwater samples were collected from 17 blocks of the Pratapgarh district and analyzed for fluoride (F-) and other water quality parameters (pH, EC, TDS, turbidity, Cl-, HCO3-, SO42-, NO3-, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, silica and total hardness) to assess its suitability for drinking uses. The fluoride concentration in the analyzed groundwater of the Pratapgarh district varied between 0.41 and 3.99mg/L. Fluoride concentration in about 78% of the groundwater samples exceeded the acceptable level of 1.0mg/L, while in 70% samples it exceeded the maximum permissible limit of 1.5mg/L. A geographic information system (GIS) tool was used to study the spatial variation of fluoride concentrations in the groundwater of the Pratapgarh district. Fluoride is positively correlated with pH (0.36) and HCO3- (0.22) and negatively with Ca2+ (-0.23) and Mg2+ (-0.08), suggesting dissolution of fluoride-bearing minerals with the precipitation of Ca/Mg carbonate in the alkaline environment. The maximum exposure dose to fluoride for adults in the study area was found to be 6.8times higher than the minimum risk level (MRL) of 0.05mg kg(-1) day(-1) estimated by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR).

Multiobjective Design of Water-Quality Monitoring Networks in River-Reservoir Systems	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												This study develops and tests a method for multiobjective optimization of water-quality monitoring networks in river-reservoir systems. The optimization method identifies optimal sampling locations to detect the sudden release of contaminants to a reservoir, and meets two objectives: (1) minimizing the prediction error of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) at the reservoir's outlet valve; and (2) minimizing the average time during which MTBE is detected at sampling locations. The optimization method considers 36 contaminant scenarios, corresponding to three volumes of contaminant release, three release locations, and four different seasonal release times. The MTBE pollutant chemograph was simulated at the outlet valve of the reservoir and at 16 possible sampling locations with the CE-QUAL-W2 model for each of the 36 scenarios of contaminant release. A support vector regression (SVR) tool is coupled to the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGAII) to optimize the water-quality sampling locations. Implementation of the NSGAII-SVR method demonstrates its capacity to design water-quality monitoring networks that meet multiple objectives in a river-reservoir system.

For such purposes, the models to be used in water quality simulators must describe chlorine decay in the systems as accurately as possible, requiring a minimum number of parameters and still be sufficiently robust to predict chlorine residuals under changing operational conditions. In this paper, two second-order decay models (single reactant and two reactants) were examined for their ability to predict chlorine residuals in surface raw and treated waters at a range of initial chlorine and natural organic matter concentrations. The two reactants model is necessary for chlorine residuals prediction in raw waters. However, for treated waters it only performed marginally better than the simpler single reactant model, with half the number of parameters that needed to be estimated. In addition, correlations were observed between both models parameters for reactive natural organic matter (NOM) concentration and measured fluorescence and ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopic data associated with humic-like compounds. Such findings are likely to open the door for a more exact determination of the models' parameters and, thus, for improving the chlorine decay models' adequacy and accuracy.

Characterizing Runoff from Roads: Particle Size Distributions, Nutrients, and Gross Solids	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												Particulate matter, nutrients, and gross solids from roads contribute nonpoint-source pollution to waterways. To inform road runoff management, a field monitoring study was undertaken at eight road sites across North Carolina. Particle size distributions (PSD) of edge-of-pavement runoff samples were analyzed to understand the granulometry of the particulate matter. Knowledge of PSDs is critical when attempting to understand sediment fate and transport through stormwater control measures (SCMs), especially when the primary removal mechanism is particle settling. For 43 road runoff events, median particle size varied from 31 to 144 mu m. The median PSD from hot mix asphalt (HMA) was 2.6% clay, 44.8% silt, and 52.6% sand. PSD was not correlated to roadway classification or ecoregion; however, PSD was significantly correlated to the presence of a permeable friction course (PFC) overlay, which is a layer of porous asphalt placed over traditional HMA. The median d(90) for PFC (131 mu m) was significantly smaller than for HMA (428 mu m), with 11.5% less sand fraction present in the PFC runoff. Smaller particles emitted from PSD will diminish performance for downslope highway SCMs, including swales and filter strips. PFC also emitted lower median effluent total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations (9 mg/ L) than HMA (23 mg/L). Gross solids may represent a substantial portion of the total nutrient load from roads, but they are often entirely overlooked. Dry mass of leaf litter from roads in North Carolina was correlated to rainfall depth and peak rainfall intensity. Total nitrogen (TN) loads from gross solids varied from 0.2 to 0.9 kg/ ha/year, while total phosphorus (TP) loads ranged between 0.03 and 0.12 kg/ha/year, approximately one order of magnitude less than reported TN and TP nutrient loads in stormwater runoff. Given the typical fraction of TN and TP leaching into stormwater as leaves and organic matter break down, gross solids represented about 0.6% of TN and 3.6% of TP yearly nutrient loading for the evaluated highway sites, suggesting gross solids were a relatively inconsequential portion of the total nutrient load from roads.

J	Winston, RJ; Anderson, AR; Hunt, WF				Winston, Ryan J.; Anderson, Andrew R.; Hunt, William F.			Modeling Sediment Reduction in Grass Swales and Vegetated Filter Strips Using Particle Settling Theory	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												Two of the most common and simple stormwater control measures are swales and filter strips. However, an overly simplistic one-size-fits-all design approach typically is used for these practices. To provide more flexibility in design, a coupled hydraulics and particle-settling model was created to predict swale and filter strip total suspended solids (TSS) reduction as a function of catchment area, longitudinal slope, side slope, cross section type (triangular swale, trapezoidal swale, or filter strip), and length. The hydraulics and hydrology models were based on Manning's equation and the rational method, respectively, with the underlying requirement that the water quality design storm does not exceed the height of the grass. The particle-settling model was underpinned by the Aberdeen equation. The model predicts that triangular swales produce the least and filter strips the most TSS removal because of increased hydraulic retention time; trapezoidal swales had on average 10% greater TSS removal than triangular swales with similar design characteristics. Grass filter stormwater controls performed better with decreasing slope, increasing length, smaller catchment area, and shallower side slopes. Filter strips registered the majority of their TSS reduction within the first meter of their width and were insensitive to increases in longitudinal slope. This water quality design storm-abating modeling approach could be coupled with modeling for infrequent-return-interval storms to obtain dual benefits of sediment reduction and conveyance. This water quality model may provide regulatory agencies a tool to provide variable TSS credit to swales and filter strips as a function of design.

This research investigated the role of land use change and its effect on soil degradation in cultivated, pasture, and urban lands, when compared with native forest in terms of declining of soil quality and fertility. Multivariate statistical methods including principal component analysis and cluster analysis were employed to determine the relative magnitude of anthropogenic and natural influences on soil quality. Partial least squares (PLS), principal component regression, and ordinary least squares regression were used to predict soil cation exchange capacity using soil characteristics. Principal component analysis identified five primary components of soil quality. PC1 explained 4101% of the total variance, PC2 accounted for 1529%, and PC3 accounted for 113%. PC4 and PC5 accounted for 737% and 419% of the total variance, respectively. Cluster analysis revealed that the lowest soil quality occurred in urban soils. An exponential semivariogram using PLS predictions revealed stronger spatial dependence among cation exchange capacity [r(2)=080, root mean square error (RMSE)=199] than the other methods, principal component regression [r(2)=084, RMSE=245] and ordinary least squares [r(2)=084, RMSE=245]. Therefore, the PLS method provided the best model for the data. In stepwise regression analysis, mean weight diameter and labile carbon were selected as influential variables in all soils. This study quantified reductions in numerous soil quality parameters resulting from extensive land-use changes and urbanization in the Ziarat watershed in northern Iran.

To evaluate such impacts, international laws require undertaking local studies based on direct sampling to establish baseline conditions of parameters modified by human activities. Mining takes place near the Alto Tajo Natural Park, where a suspended sediment concentration (SSC) baseline is required to determine whether mining affects water quality. To this end, we have monitored the Tajo River and its tributary the Tajuelo following Before-After Control-Impact (BACI) techniques, recommended by Australian and New Zealand laws, requiring a specific method based on continuous monitoring and sampling to enable evaluation of SSCs. An SSC baseline has been defined at stations situated upstream of the mining area and compared with those downstream. The highest detected SSC upstream of the Tajuelo mines was 24gl(-1) whereas the highest simultaneous downstream value was 391gl(-1), more than one order of magnitude higher than the supposed baseline (24gl(-1)). Additionally, this value is 1000 times more than the average concentration of 25mgl(-1), used by the European Union until 2015, to guarantee the quality of salmonid waters. Following a BACI approach, a statistically significant SSC impact has been identified. The mined areas are the only source that can explain this increase. This is the first instance that such an increase and baseline have been found using this method. BACI is a simple and reliable method recommended for studying degraded areas rather than an irrelevant, fixed standard as included in most international laws.

The Impacts of Natural Flood Management Approaches on In-Channel Sediment Quality	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Natural Flood Management (NFM) techniques aim to reduce downstream flooding by storing and slowing the flow of stormwater to river channels. These techniques include a range of measures, including setback stormwater outfalls and the physical restoration of channels and floodplains, to improve the natural functioning of catchments. An additional benefit of NFM measures is the potential reduction in sediment and pollutant delivery to the channel. Urban development releases a variety of heavy metal and nutrient pollutants that enter rivers through stormwater outfalls with adverse effects on the aquatic ecosystem. In this study, the influence of channel modification and quality of the river habitat on the sediment quality surrounding stormwater outfalls was assessed. Sediment samples were taken at several outfalls within the Johnson Creek catchment, Oregon, USA, and analysed for a variety of urban pollutants. The level of river habitat quality and modification at each site were assessed using a semi-quantitative scoring methodology. Significant increases in pollutant levels were observed at outfalls, with a greater and more variable increase at direct compared to setback outfalls. Removal efficiency of certain pollutants was found to be significantly correlated to the level of habitat quality or modification (for Fe, Ba, Sn, Mg, P, K) indicating that more natural reaches had greater potential for pollutant removal. The findings highlight the multiple benefits associated with NFM and river restoration approaches in relation to sediment quality and pollutant content.

Water Quality Changes Shortly After Low-Head Dam Removal Examined With Cultural and Microbial Source Tracking Methods	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Short-term effects of low head dam removal on water quality of urbanized stream were evaluated, focusing on fecal pollution indicators. Composite river samples were analyzed for Escherichia coli concentrations, nitrates, phosphates, turbidity and human-specific marker (HF183) and antibiotic resistance marker (tetQ) before and after dam removal during dry weather conditions. The sampled Olentangy River water in summer before the dam removal showed poor water quality with mean E. coli concentration of 439 colony forming unit (CFU)/100mL, mean turbidity of 10 NTU and mean nutrient concentrations of 0.61 and 0.41mg/L for nitrate and phosphate, respectively. Surprisingly, even one month after the dam removal, E. coli numbers doubled and nitrate concentration tripled compared to pre-removal concentrations. Although the detected HF183 concentrations were below the quantifiable levels, they did not correlate with E. coli concentrations, suggesting E. coli from other than human fecal origin. The correlation between turbidity and E. coli during dry weather further suggests E. coli accumulation in impoundment sediments and release once dam was removed. These short-term effects of dam removal on water quality should be further evaluated, especially if recreation and other beneficial uses of water in the area are expected.

Effect of Thermal Stratification on Phytoplankton and Nutrient Dynamics in a Regulated River (Saar, Germany)	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												The weir pool Serrig is the deepest one along the impounded river Saar. Damming caused massive changes in the river's hydrodynamics. We analyzed the spatio-temporal variability of thermal density stratification in the weir pool and its effect on phytoplankton and nutrient dynamics. In the analysis, continuous measurements from the years 2014 and 2015 were combined with three two-day sampling campaigns in spring 2015. Thermal stratification occurred regularly in the downstream section of the weir pool during spring and summer and showed a diurnal rhythm. Temperature differences >1K between the 1 and 2m water layer were observed during 34 out of 217days (16%) in 2014, with maximum temperature gradients up to 3.71K. Whereas the influence of thermal stratification on phytoplankton biomass and distribution was low during the algal bloom in early spring, stratification events between May and July promoted temporary algal blooms in the surface layer with chlorophyll a concentrations up to 98 mu g Chla l(-1) and a maximum difference between the 1 and 2m water layer of 36 mu g Chla l(-1). Some of the stratification events resulted in reduced concentrations of dissolved nutrients in the surface layer as a result of increased uptake by algae, with maximum gradients between the surface and the 8m water layer of 0.070mg ortho-PO43--P l(-1), 0.136mg NH4+-N l(-1) and 0.24mg NO3--Nl(-1). These vertical gradients should be considered in sampling protocols for the assessment of the water quality of temporarily stratified river sections.

This study shows that integrated rice-fish farming and integrated pest management strategies provide sustainable options to intensive rice farming, because of a more balanced use of multiple ecosystem services that benefit the farmers' health, economy and the environment. The study investigates and compares farming strategies among 40 rice and 20 rice-fish farmers in two locations in the Mekong Delta. Production costs and income are used to compare the systems' financial sustainability. The farmers' perception on how their farming practices influence on ecosystem services and their livelihoods are used as an indication of the systems' ecological and social sustainability. Although rice-fish farmers used lower amount of pesticides and fertilisers than rice farmers, there were no statistical differences in their rice yields or net income. Rice was seen as the most important ecosystem service from rice fields and related wetlands, but also several other ecosystem services, such as water quality, aquatic animals, plants, habitats, and natural enemies to pests, were seen as important to the farmers' livelihoods and wellbeing. All farmers perceived that there had been a general reduction in all these other ecosystem services, due to intensive rice farming during the last 15 years, and that they will continue to decline. The majority of the farmers were willing to reduce their rice yields slightly for an improved quality of the other ecosystem services.																	1862-4065	1862-4057				JAN	2017	12	1					137	154		10.1007/s11625-016-0409-x								WOS:000393593200009

Data analytics methodology for monitoring quality sensors and events in the Barcelona drinking water network	JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS												Water quality management is a key area to guarantee drinking water safety to users. This task is based on disinfection techniques, such as chlorination, applied to the drinking water network to prevent the growth of microorganisms present in the water. The continuous monitoring of water quality parameters is fundamental to assess the sanitary conditions of the drinking water and to detect unexpected events. The whole process is based on the assumption that the information retrieved from quality sensors is totally reliable, but due to the complexity of the calibration and maintenance of these chemical sensors, several factors affect the accuracy of the raw data collected. Consequently, any decision might be based on a non-solid base. Therefore, this work presents a data analytics monitoring methodology based on temporal and spatial models to discover if a sensor is detecting a real change in water quality parameters or is actually providing inconsistent information due to some malfunction. The methodology presented anticipated by 12.4 days, on average, the detection of a sensor problem before the fault was reported by the water utilities expert using knowledge accumulated with visual analysis. The proposed methodology has been satisfactorily tested on the Barcelona drinking water network.

Nitrogen Dynamics in Two Created Riparian Wetlands over Space and Time	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING												Temporal and spatial variations of nitrogen (N) soil storages and fluxes were examined at two 1-ha created riverine wetlands in the U.S. Midwest. Soil N content (total N, organic-N, NO3-N, and NH4-N), N accumulation rates, and soil C:N ratios were compared between the two wetlands constructed 15 years earlier (one was planted and the other left to naturally colonize). Differences in wetland soil N content and accumulation were also examined in relation to proximity of river input and relative to a range of topographic features related to wetland water depth. The planted and naturally colonized wetlands showed similar rates of N accumulation. However, differences were detected related to the content of mineralized forms of N (NO3-N and NH4-N) that may relate to the history of vegetation communities at these wetlands. Significant spatial variation of N accumulation was detected within the wetlands, with the highest rates found in the deeper open water communities compared to shallow emergent marsh/edge vegetation communities (23.5 +/- 2.0 versus 17.3 +/- 1.3/18.2 +/- 1.4 g N m(-2) y(-1)). Nitrogen budgets comparing two ages of the wetlands illustrate higher N accumulation rates (by 19%), higher N reduction in the surface water (47 to 52% reduction), and increased denitrification rates (by 13%) from year 10 to year 15. We also found out that nitrogen accumulation in the soil was 7.1 to 7.5% higher than were denitrification rates in these young wetlands. We discuss the importance of efforts such as this to support better understanding of N pathways in both created and natural wetlands, while providing critical data needed to improve modelling efforts and assess the long-term effectiveness of wetlands for improving water quality.

The water quality parameters include pH, COD, DO, alkalinity, hardness, chloride, TDS, total suspended solids (TSS), turbidity, electric conductivity and phosphate. Regression analysis was performed using atmospherically corrected true reflectance values of original OLI bands, images after applying enhancement techniques (NDVI, principal components) and the values of the water quality parameters at different sample locations to obtain the empirical relationship. Most of the parameters were well correlated with single OLI bands with R-2 greater than 0.5, whereas phosphate showed a good correlation with NDVI image. The parameters like pH and DO showed a good relation with the principal component I and IV, respectively. The high concentration of pH, COD, turbidity and TSS and low concentration of DO infers the anthropogenic impact on lake.																	1010-6049	1752-0762					2017	32	3					274	285		10.1080/10106049.2016.1140818								WOS:000393207700004

Ten young fish were collected in an area influenced by the discharge of effluents and from a fish farm (control group). The fish were anesthetized and caudal puncture was used to collect the blood. Differential white blood cell counting was performed, as well as the counting of total leukocytes and thrombocytes (in 2000 cells). Physicochemical parameters of the water from both sites were analyzed. The water from the polluted area was found to have high conductivity and low levels of dissolved oxygen, factors that indicate poor environmental quality. Fish collected from the polluted site presented higher percentages of eosinophils and monocytes and fewer thrombocytes because of exposure to pollution and hypoxic conditions. The differential white blood cell count represents a suitable biomarker of environmental health and provides a tool for biomonitoring water quality.

In this study, correlations between cyanobacterial blooms and hydro-meteorological factors, including water quality, temperature and precipitation were investigated. Results demonstrated that South Taihu Lake was heavily affected by cyanobacteria and the proliferation of cyanobacteria due to variations in hydro-meteorological factors and water quality conditions. Water quality parameters, including COD, NH3-N, TN and TP improved significantly since 2008 even at an elevated cyanobacterial bloom situation. Correlation analyses have shown that the development of cyanobacterial density and chlorophyll a concentration was sensitive to a wider temperature variation. The optimum temperature for cyanobacteria was 20 degrees C, while extremely low and high temperatures were found to suppress their growth. Moreover, unusual rainfall patterns were measured during the study period (2003-2009), which showed an adverse impact on cyanobacterial development. Findings from this study suggested that seasonal lake's water quality monitoring; suitable treatment of cyanobacterial blooms and strict policy implementation can solve the water quality issues in highly eutrophic lakes like Taihu.																	0275-7540	1029-0370				JAN	2017	33	1					76	87		10.1080/02757540.2016.1261122								WOS:000392971400006

Eight different treatments were tested varying the presence or absence of a toxicant (NaOCl) and two disturbances: the passing of a shadow (mimicking a predator) and entrapment of the fish. The concentration tested corresponded to a sublethal (1 % 24 h-LC50) and short term exposure (2 h). A total of 56 organisms were tested resulting in 112 diagnoses (before and after the contamination). A statistical model of diagnosis was developed using Self-organizing Map (SOM) and Correspondence Analysis (CA). Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, false positive and false negative values were calculated to evaluate the diagnostic performance. The disturbances did not negatively affect the capability of the model. In the presence of at least one of these variables, the diagnostic performance was similar or even superior to the baseline results without disturbances. Furthermore, the system produced a large number of correct diagnoses, at an ecologically relevant concentration of exposure, in a non-invasive way.

Monitoring the seasonal dynamics of physicochemical parameters from Atoyac River basin (Puebla), Central Mexico: multivariate approach	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Spatiotemporal variations of ten physicochemical parameters in the water quality of Atoyac River basin, Central Mexico, were obtained from 22 sampling sites (66 samples in total) located all along the basin for three different seasons (dry, rainy and winter). Multivariate statistical techniques such as correlation matrix, factor analysis (FA) and cluster analysis (CA) were used as a tool to understand the process. Physicochemical parameters such as temperature (T), pH, conductivity (lambda), dissolved oxygen (DO), spectral absorption coefficient (SAC), oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), turbidity, 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total suspended solids (TSS) were analyzed. Extremely high values of pH (10.24), conductivity (1870 mu S/cm) and reduced redox potential (-370.1 mV) were observed in the dry season, whereas elevated TSS of 2996 mg/L was detected during the rainy season. The results elucidated high influence from the adjoining industrial, agricultural and urban zones, making the river unsuitable for life. FA generated varifactors, which accounted for cumulative % of 75.04 (dry), 76.22 (rainy) and 79.96 (winter) clearly grouping the external factors responsible for these significant values indicating the source of contamination. Cluster analysis facilitated the ease of classifying the sampling sites based on the similarities of physicochemical parameters. This study carried out in different seasons using multivariate statistical techniques would definitely prove to be an efficient tool for the restoration and establishing the real-time monitoring stations along this important river basin of Mexico.

Cross-sectional surveys were carried out in March and June 2015. A Delagua water quality testing kit was employed on 634 water samples obtained from 16 purposively selected schools, 40 community water sources, and 562 households to examine water quality. Aflame atomic absorption spectrophotometer was used to test lead and arsenic content of the same samples. Additionally, a questionnaire survey was conducted to obtain WASH predictors. A total of 75% of school drinking water source samples and 76.9% point-of-use samples (water bottles) at schools, 39.5% water source samples in the community, and 27.4% point-of-use samples at household levels were contaminated with thermo-tolerant coliforms. The values of water samples for pH (6.8-7.6), free and total residual chlorine (0.1-0.5 mg/L), mean lead concentration (0.01 mg/L), and mean arsenic concentration (0.05 mg/L) were within national drinking water quality standards. The presence of domestic animals roaming inside schoolchildren's homes was significantly associated with drinking water contamination (adjusted odds ratio: 1.64; 95% confidence interval: 1.08-2.50; p = 0.02). Our findings call for an improvement of WASH conditions at the unit of school, households, and communities.																	1660-4601					JAN	2017	14	1							89	10.3390/ijerph14010089								WOS:000392578200087

Effects of Suspended Sediment on Early Life Stages of Smallmouth Bass (Micropterus dolomieu)	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												The resuspension of sediments caused by activities, such as dredging operations, is a concern in Great Lakes harbors where multiple fish species spawn. To address such concerns, smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) were exposed to uncontaminated suspended sediment (nominally 0, 100, 250, and 500 mg/L) continuously for 72 h to determine the effects on egg-hatching success and swim-up fry survival and growth. The test sediments were collected from two harbors: (1) fine-grained sediment in Grand Haven Harbor, Lake Michigan, and (2) coarser-grained sediment in Fairport Harbor, Lake Erie. Eggs exposed to total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations > 100 mg/L resulted in decreased survival of post-hatch larval fish. Fry survival was > 90 % at the highest exposure concentration (500 mg/L), but growth was decreased when the exposure concentration was > 100 mg/L. Growth and survival of swim-up fry held for a 7- and 26-day post-exposure the grow-out period was variable suggesting that the sediment grain size and strain of fish may influence lingering effects after the cessation of exposure. The results suggest that exposed eggs hatched normally; however, newly hatched larvae, which are temporarily immobile, are more vulnerable to the effects of suspended sediment. The swim-up fry were found to be more sensitive to high TSS concentrations in sandy relative to silty sediment. These data represent a conservative exposure scenario that can be extrapolated to high-energy systems in the field to inform management decisions regarding the necessity for dredging windows or need to implement controls to protect M. dolomieu.																	0090-4341	1432-0703				JAN	2017	72	1					119	131		10.1007/s00244-016-0322-4								WOS:000392305400011	27778053

We first performed acute toxicity tests to determine the Cu LC50 value for each species in water with varying characteristics. The biotic ligand model (BLM) was then calibrated using the toxicity data for these species together with binding properties specific to Cu. The BLM calibration involved the calculation of the level of Cu accumulation in the gills that resulted in 50% lethality (i.e., LA(50)). The LA(50) values for A. nobilis, C. idellus and C. carpio were 5.16, 11.60 and 9.00 nmol g(-1). The model calibrated to these data was improved by adjusting the Cu-proton exchange constant (pK (CuHA-A)) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to values of 1.84 and 4.67E-3 mol g(-1), respectively. The calibrated Cu-BLM was validated for these three common fish species by comparing predicted and observed LC50 values, which were in agreement to within a factor of 2. The results of this study provide an important contribution to ecological risk assessment and establishment of water quality criteria for Cu in China.																	0007-4861	1432-0800				JAN	2017	98	1					22	26		10.1007/s00128-016-1999-9								WOS:000392321300005	27928618

Two new in situ passive sampling techniques, high-resolution pore-water equilibrators (HR-Peeper) and zirconium oxide-based diffusive gradients in thin films (Zr-oxide DGT), were combined to measure dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) (C-Peeper) and labile phosphorus (C-DGT) at five sites in South Dongting and West Dongting Lakes. The vertical distribution of C-Peeper and C-DGT displayed similarity, which demonstrated that the buffering capacity of the labile P in sediments was similar at different depths. The diffusion flux of P from the sediments at the sediment-water interface ranged from 1.9 to 88 ng m(-2) day(-1), with an average value of 38 ng m(-2) day(-1). The P flux at the entrances to the Yuan, Li and Zi Rivers was fairly large at all five sites. The sediments at the five sites released P into overlying water, indicating that the sediments are an important source of P for Dongting Lake.																	1448-2517	1449-8979					2017	14	1					48	54		10.1071/EN16072								WOS:000392205800006						
J	Arslan, H				Arslan, Hakan			Determination of temporal and spatial variability of groundwater irrigation quality using geostatistical techniques on the coastal aquifer of Carsamba Plain, Turkey, from 1990 to 2012	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The present study was conducted to investigate variations in groundwater quality parameters between 1990 and 2012, and to assess the suitability of groundwater for irrigation. Groundwater samples were taken in the summers of 1990 and 2012, and hydrochemical characteristics were investigated through Piper and USSL diagrams. The electrical conductivity (EC), sodium percentage (% Na), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), magnesium hazard (MR), potential salinity (PS), and Kelly's ratios (KI) were used as the indicators for the water quality. Water quality parameters were assessed through geostatistical techniques and geographical information systems. Initially, semivariograms were determined for each water quality index, and spatial distribution maps were created for each sampling period through ordinary kriging techniques. Results revealed excessive increases in EC, Na, and Cl values with time. EC values of groundwater were over 1.25 dS/m in 4.64% of the study area in 1990. The area increased to 37.38% in the year 2012. With regard to the Kelly Index, there were not any problems in the study area in 1990, but problems were encountered over 5.75% of the study area in the year 2012. While the ratio of problematic sites with regard to RSC was 2.44% in 1990, the ratio increased to 12.13% in the year 2012. Similar increases were also observed in other water quality parameters except for MR. Higher deteriorations were observed in water quality parameters through the eastern sections of the study area. From 1990 to 2012, increased deteriorations were observed in water quality parameters, and excessive groundwater withdrawal and resultant seawater intrusion were considered as the basic reasons for such deteriorations. Therefore, groundwater withdrawals along the coastal lines should be performed in a controlled fashion, and water quality should continuously be monitored.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JAN	2017	76	1							38	10.1007/s12665-016-6375-x								WOS:000392286300038

The threat to groundwater contamination is increasing day by day due to rapid increase in industrialization and urbanization. The present study aims at assessing the groundwater quality contamination threat around industrial cluster at Rajasthan State Industrial Development and Investment Corporation (RIICO) in Jaipur district of Rajasthan, India. The cluster does not have common effluent treatment plant, and very few units have their effluent treatment plants. Groundwater samples were collected around the industrial cluster and its vicinity and analyzed for major cations, anions and trace elements. The water quality data indicate that total dissolved solids exceed the drinking water standard set by the Bureau of Indian Standards in few samples, and trace elements of health significance are not detected in any sample. The soil analysis indicates that only the top surface near the point of disposal of the treated effluent is affected. In view of the thick alluvium of 60-80 m and the water table above 30 m, the effluents are retarded significantly before reaching the water table. The sodium adsorption ratio of water samples indicates its suitability for irrigation and falls in the category of fairly suitable to excellent. Piper plot reveals that dominant cations are Na+, K++ and Mg++ and dominant anions are HCO3- and CO3-. The Gibbs plot indicates that rock-water interactions influence the groundwater quality. The study reveals that the groundwater quality from most of the sources meets the requirements of drinking water standards, and there is enough environmental space available for the expansion of industrial belt in this RIICO hub.

Reconstructing the formation of a costal aquifer in Nampula province, Mozambique, from ERT and IP methods for water prospection	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												In continental margin basins, the hydrogeological setting is complex due to transgression/regression events that removed old sediments in the basin and formed new geologic units. Due to the geological complexity, the use of vertical electrical sounding has proven to be insufficient for groundwater explorations. The lack of understanding the geological underground has resulted in many boreholes with low yield or poor water quality. By performing electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and induced polarization (IP) measurements in 11 villages in Mongicual district, three different layers covering the basement were identified: a weathered autochthon layer, a weathered allochthon layer (paleo-coastal dune) and eolian white sand layer. The drilling at successful boreholes penetrates formations where the resistivity value is between 220 and 770 Omega m, whereas at unsuccessful boreholes the lower parts of the drilled range have resistivity values higher than 770 Omega m. Also, the thickness ratio of the weathered and semi-weathered layer in the unsuccessful boreholes is less than 1/3, whereas in all successful boreholes the ration is higher than 1/2. The difference between autochthon and allochthon layers was detected by heavy minerals content in the red eolian sand layer (Tupuito formation) that increased the chargeability value. The groundwater with a conductivity higher than 2000 mu S/cm is linked to the white eolian sand. The surface extension of white eolian sand layer is small to be mapped; therefore, bymapping the eolian white sand formation and the use of ERT and enhanced with IP method would lower the failure rate.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JAN	2017	76	1							36	10.1007/s12665-016-6364-0								WOS:000392286300036

The hardness of water samples is in the category of very hard (over 300 ppm CaCO3), and Fe, Mn and Pb values are more than standards. In new sampling and 12-month monitoring of anions, cations, heavy metals and microbial parameters indicate that Hg, Cd, Cr, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn, OC, T-coliforms and fecal coliforms in all stations for agricultural purposes and surface waters are more than standards and the sewage factories near the river have a noticeable effect on these contaminations. Furthermore, the high values of phosphate, ammonia and nitrate of some stations in wet seasons can be generated from agriculture wastes near the villages of the study area. In addition, because of outcrops of Gachsaran Formation in some stations, the concentration of ions is more than standards. So the results of Schuler diagrams indicate the water surface in the most cases is not suitable for drinking and based on Wilcox diagram all stations are located in C4S4 class.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JAN	2017	76	1							15	10.1007/s12665-016-6291-0								WOS:000392286300015

Surface water pathways and fluxes of metals under changing environmental conditions and human interventions in the Selenga River system	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												This paper presents the results of novel field campaigns in the extensive (447,000 km(2)) Selenga River basin, through which 304 samples of river water and 308 samples of suspended matter were collected during high and low water periods between 2011 and 2013. The Selenga River is the largest tributary (more than 50% of the inflow) to the Lake Baikal. Due to ongoing hydroclimatic change and human pressures under conditions of economic growth, the rivers of the area experience significant change in water quality. A key issue for improved understanding of regional impacts of the environmental change is to disentangle the influence of climate change from that of other pressures within the catchment. Our research aims to evaluate the pathways and mass flows of heavy metals and metalloids both in dissolved and suspended forms, taking a basin- scale perspective that previously has not been fully pursued in the Lake Baikal region. Results showed quality deterioration over short distances due to strong impact of hot spots from urban and industrial activities, including mining. The determined enrichment of dissolved metals in waters of Selenga River as well as the spatial and temporal variability of water and suspended sediment composition is further analyzed in the context of climatic, hydrological and land use drivers.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JAN	2017	76	1							1	10.1007/s12665-016-6304-z								WOS:000392286300001

Leather processing and its possible impact on groundwater quality in Silk Road sites: a case study from Chennai, India	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Water plays an important role in human civilisation. Since ancient times people started to settle in regions with ensured water availability. Trade was an important factor for the development of civilisation. Silk Road is an important route used for the trading between China and other countries across Eurasia. Not only silk, many goods including leather were exchanged during trading. Leather was processing lead to release of large amount of wastewater. This study was carried out to understand how the leather processing would have affected the groundwater quality in Silk Road sites by studying the current scenarios of groundwater quality near tanning industries. Chennai and nearby cities such as Ranipet and Vaniyambadi are chosen for case studies. Groundwater quality around the tanneries was poor due to high electrical conductivity and concentration of chromium. This is due to the effluents released by the tanneries into the ground or open drains without proper treatment. Similarly, the leather processing in Silk Road sites would have also affected the groundwater quality.

Some of these geothermal resources have been used for power generation and direct heating. Most of the high enthalpy geothermal systems are located in western part of Turkey. Alasehir is the most important geothermal site in western part of Turkey. Many geothermal wells have been drilled in Alasehir Plain to produce the geothermal fluid from the deep reservoir in the last 10 years. A blowout accident happened during a geothermal well drilling operation in Alasehir Plain, and significant amount of geothermal fluid surfaced out along the fault zone in three locations. When drilling string entered the reservoir rock about 1000 m, blowout occurred. As the well head preventer system was closed because of the blowout, high-pressure fluid surfaced out along the fault zone cutting the Neogene formation. In order to understand the geothermal fluid effects on groundwater chemistry, physical and chemical compositions of local cold groundwater were monitored from May 2012 to September 2014 in the study area. The geothermal fluid was found to be of Na-HCO3 water type, and especially, arsenic and boron concentrations reached levels as high as 3 and 127 mg/L, respectively. The concentrations of arsenic and boron in the geothermal fluid and groundwater exceeded the maximum allowable limits given in the national and international standards for drinking water quality. According to temporally monitored results, geothermal fluid has extremely high mineral content which influenced the quality of groundwater resources of the area where water resource is commonly used for agricultural irrigation.

J	Varanka, S; Hjort, J				Varanka, Sanna; Hjort, Jan			Spatio-temporal aspects of the environmental factors affecting water quality in boreal rivers	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												River water quality is the outcome of multiple processes and factors, which vary spatially and temporally. In this study, the key spatial and temporal scales and the most important environmental factors explaining river water quality at these scales were analysed by generalized additive models (GAMs). Water quality was studied through total phosphorus (median = 61.9 mu g l(-1)) and nitrogen (1388.1 mu g l(-1)), pH (6.7) and water colour (143.3 mg Pt l(-1)). Environmental factors covered variables from land use/cover, climate and other landscape characteristics. The spatial scales used were the closest 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1000 m buffer zones around the river channel, in addition to the entire catchment area. Temporality was studied through the entire year and four periods, which were determined by the natural variation in discharge. In the comparison of spatial scales of environmental factors, the variation in phosphorus, nitrogen and water colour was best explained using environmental data from the broadest scale, the entire catchment. In contrast, the variation in pH was best explained using data from the closest (50 m) buffer zone, the riparian area. In modelling temporal scales, the variation in water quality variables was best explained during discharge maximum periods and when the environmental data covering the entire year were considered. Nutrients were related specifically to agriculture, water colour to lake percentage and pH to pastures. The results showed the suitability of GAMs in water quality studies.

J	Ye, M; Sun, HW; Hallas, K				Ye, Ming; Sun, Huaiwei; Hallas, Katie			Numerical estimation of nitrogen load from septic systems to surface water bodies in St. Lucie River and Estuary Basin, Florida	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Nitrogen pollution is one of the most prevalent and challenging environmental problems worldwide. Wastewater treatment using onsite sewage treatment and disposal systems (aka septic systems) is one source of nitrogen sources in the environment. This study presents a numerical study for estimating nitrogen load from septic systems to surface water bodies in the St. Lucie River and Estuary Basin, Florida, USA. The load estimation is conducted using an ArcGIS-based nitrogen load estimation toolkit, a screening-level modeling software that considers key mechanisms (i.e., advection, dispersion, and denitrification) controlling nitrogen transport as well as spatial variability of model parameters (e.g., hydraulic conductivity, porosity, septic system locations, and surface water bodies). The simulated nitrogen plumes and load estimates demonstrate the importance of considering spatial variability in the load estimation for nitrogen pollution management. The load estimates are strongly correlated with nitrogen concentrations in surface water quality data, suggesting that septic systems are an important factor for water quality deterioration in the St. Lucie River. The estimates can be used directly to support Basin Management Action Plan (BMAP). Evaluating the load estimates in the BMAP context indicates that nitrogen load from septic systems is a significant nitrogen source in the St. Lucie River and Estuary Basin. It is found in this study that the load estimates depend on lengths of flow paths, groundwater flow velocities, and soil drainage conditions. These findings are useful for nitrogen pollution management in similar areas facing nitrogen pollution problems.

J	Sarvilinna, A; Lehtoranta, V; Hjerppe, T				Sarvilinna, Auri; Lehtoranta, Virpi; Hjerppe, Turo			Are Urban Stream Restoration Plans Worth Implementing?	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												To manage and conserve ecosystems in a more sustainable way, it is important to identify the importance of the ecosystem services they provide and understand the connection between natural and socio-economic systems. Historically, streams have been an underrated part of the urban environment. Many of them have been straightened and often channelized under pressure of urbanization. However, little knowledge exists concerning the economic value of stream restoration or the value of the improved ecosystem services. We used the contingent valuation method to assess the social acceptability of a policy-level water management plan in the city of Helsinki, Finland, and the values placed on improvements in a set of ecosystem services, accounting for preference uncertainty. According to our study, the action plan would provide high returns on restoration investments, since the benefit-cost ratio was 15-37. Moreover, seventy-two percent of the respondents willing to pay for stream restoration chose "I want to conserve streams as a part of urban nature for future generations" as the most motivating reason. Our study indicates that the water management plan for urban streams in Helsinki has strong public support. If better marketed to the population within the watershed, the future projects could be partly funded by the local residents, making the projects easier to accomplish. The results of this study can be used in planning, management and decision making related to small urban watercourses.																	0364-152X	1432-1009				JAN	2017	59	1					10	20		10.1007/s00267-016-0778-z								WOS:000392061800002	27812794					
J	Akurut, M; Niwagaba, CB; Willems, P				Akurut, Mary; Niwagaba, Charles B.; Willems, Patrick			Long-term variations of water quality in the Inner Murchison Bay, Lake Victoria	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The water quality in the Inner Murchison Bay (IMB) located in Uganda on the northern shores of Lake Victoria is affected by a complex mixture of processes and driving factors including pollution, river inflows, lake water levels, wetland management and flora and fauna populations. This study attempts to explain long-term variations of the IMB water quality and to provide a plausible water quality model. Because intermittent monitoring around the Bay hinders accurate determination of pollution, concentrations at the extreme northern shores (hotspots) are considered indicative of the pollutant loading into the bay. Delft3D-Flow was applied to study the Bay hydrodynamics and coupled with the Delwaq module to investigate water quality processes related to oxygen: organic and nutrient components i.e. dissolved oxygen (DO), biological oxygen demand (BOD) and ammonium (NH4+). It is found that the IMB water quality deteriorated exponentially in the period 2001-2014 due to increased pollution and the high residence time of water. The worst water quality was in 2010 when diffuse pollution intensified due to the lining of more drainage channels within Kampala City in addition to the declining wetland effect. The water quality towards the Outer Murchison Bay (OMB) deteriorated over time with dilution accounting for 40-60% of pollutant reduction. Although the effect of lake level variations is negligible compared to pollution into the IMB, increased lake levels after 2011 improved DO levels and mixing and hence BOD levels in the IMB.

Metal pollution, in particular, is a reported consequence of elevated anthropogenic inputs, especially from urbanized areas. The objectives of this study were to quantify metal (Cu, Al, Cd, Ni, and Pb) concentrations in the waters and biota of four streams in South Georgia, USA, and relate metal concentrations to land use and abiotic and biotic stream processes. Additionally, macrophytes, invertebrates, and fish were identified to assess biodiversity at each site. Metal concentrations in the three trophic levels differed among sites and species, correlating to differences in land use surrounding the rivers. The highest metal concentrations (except Al) were found in the streams most impacted by urbanization and development. Al concentrations were highest in streams surrounded by land dominated by forested areas. Metal content in macrophytes reflected metal concentrations in the water and was at least three orders of magnitude higher than any other trophic level. Despite metal concentration differences, all four streams contained similar water quality and were healthy based on macroinvertebrate community structure. This study provides insight into the impact of urbanization and the fate and effects of metals in river ecosystems with varying degrees of anthropogenic impact.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				JAN	2017	189	1							23	10.1007/s10661-016-5738-9								WOS:000392300300023	27987131

Thermotolerant coliform loadings to coastal areas of Santa Catarina (Brazil) evidence the effect of growing urbanisation and insufficient provision of sewerage infrastructure	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Thermotolerant coliform (TC) loadings were quantified for 49 catchments draining into the North and South Bays of Santa Catarina (SC, southeastern Brazil), an area known for its tourism and aquaculture. TC loadings were calculated based on flow measurements taken in 26 rivers. TC concentrations ere quantified based on surface water samples collected at 49 catchment outlets in 2012 and 2013. Median TC loads ranged from 3.7 x 10(3) to 6.8 x 10(8) MPN s(-1). TC loadings in the catchments increased in proportion to increases in resident human population, population density and percentage of urbanised area. Catchments with more than 60% of area covered by wastewater collection and treatment systems had higher TC loads per person than catchments with less than 25%. Based on the study catchments, these results indicate that current sewerage infrastructure is ineffective in reducing contamination of faecal origin to surface waters. These findings have important implications for the management of microbiological health hazards in bathing, recreational and shellfish aquaculture waters in the North and South Bays of Santa Catarina Island.

J	Jones, C; Kim, SW; Schilling, K				Jones, Christopher; Kim, Sea-Won; Schilling, Keith			Use of continuous monitoring to assess stream nitrate flux and transformation patterns	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Delivery of nitrogen from farmed fields to the stream network is an ongoing water quality issue in central North America and other parts of the world. Although fertilization and other farming practices have been refined to produce environmental improvements, stemming loss of nitrogen, especially in the soluble nitrate form, is a problem that has seemingly defied solution. The Iowa Nutrient Reduction Strategy is a policy initiative designed to implement conservation and other farm management practices to produce reductions in nitrate loading. The strategy does not focus on how the streams themselves may or may not be processing nitrogen and reducing downstream loading. We used continuous high-frequency nitrate and discharge monitoring over 3 years at two sites separated by 18 km in a low-order, agricultural stream in eastern Iowa to estimate how nitrogen is processed, and whether or not these processes are reducing downstream loading. We conclude that the upstream to downstream nitrate concentration decline between the two sites was not driven by denitrification. These data also show that nitrate concentrations are closely coupled to discharge during periods of adequate moisture, but decoupling of concentration from discharge occurs during dry periods. This decoupling is a possible indicator of in-stream nitrate processing. Finally, nitrate concentrations are likely diluted by water sourced from non-row crop land covers in the lower reaches of the watershed.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				JAN	2017	189	1							35	10.1007/s10661-016-5749-6								WOS:000392300300035	28013474

Trophic state assessment of Bhindawas Lake, Haryana, India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Trophic state allows for identification of problems and pressures that an ecosystem faces as well as demarcation of remedial measures. This study focuses on spatial and temporal variations in the trophic state and detection of possible causes of its divergence in Bhindawas Lake, India. The trophic state of the lake undulated between eutrophic and hyper-eutrophic state throughout the study period. Higher phosphorus concentration within the lake ecosystem is the dominant causal factor for its eutrophic state. The influence of other water quality parameters has also been analyzed using Spearman's coefficient of correlation. Deviations between trophic state index (TSI)-chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), TSI-total phosphorus (TP), and TSI-Secchi depth (SD) pointed out that the lake is principally phosphorus limited, and its trophic status is influenced by non-algal turbidity to a large extent. Spatial analysis of trophic levels in geographic information system (GIS) helped in identification of pollution sources and chemical attributes affecting the trophic state of the lake. This study provides a rationale for further investigation of nutrient and sediment loading into the lake system and development of sustainable management and conservation strategy identifying suitable measures ascertaining the ecosystem integrity.

A way to detect Ni is the use of whole-cell biosensors. The aim of the present work was to build a light-emitting bacterial biosensor for the detection of Ni with high specificity and low detection limit properties. For that purpose, the regulatory circuit implemented relied on the RcnR Ni/Co metallo-regulator and its rcnA natural target promoter fused to the lux reporter genes. To convert RcnR to specifically detect Ni, several mutations were tested and the C35A retained. Deleting the Ni efflux pump rcnA and introducing genes encoding several Niuptake systems lowered the detection thresholds. When these constructs were assayed in several Escherichia coli strains, it appeared that the detection thresholds were highly variable. The TD2158 wild-type E. coli gave rise to a biosensor ten times more active and sensitive than its W3110 E. coli K12 equivalent. This biosensor was able to confidently detect Ni concentrations as little as 80 nM (4.7 mu g l(-1)), which makes its use compatible with the norms governing the drinking water quality.

The key challenge of the COMBITOX project is to develop a unique instrument that can accommodate several biodetector systems (see the accompanying COMBITOX papers) able to detect different pollutants such as bacteria, toxins, and heavy metals. The output signal chosen by our consortium is based on luminescence detection. Our group recently developed phage-based biosensors using gfp as a reporter gene to detect enteric bacteria in complex environments such as sea water, and the main challenge we faced was to adapt our biodetector to a luminescent signal that could fit the COMBITOX project requirements. Another key point was to use a substrate-independent reporter system in order to avoid substrate addition in the detection prototype. This paper describes the development of a phage-based biodetector using a luminescent and substrate-independent output to detect some enteric bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, in water samples. We have successfully engineered various prototypes using the HK620 and HK97 bacteriophages that use different packaging systems, and both proved functional for the integration of the full luxCDABE operon controlled by two different bacterial promoters. We show that the luxCDABE operon controlled by the PrplU bacterial promoter is the most efficient in terms of signal emission. The emission of luminescence is specific and allows the detection of 10(4) bacteria per milliliter in 1.5 h post-infection with neither a concentration nor enrichment step.

Results of the continuous 68-day experiment showed that calcium nitrate was the most effective for controlling phosphorus concentration in overlying and interstitial water, where the efficiency of locking phosphorus was > 97 and 90 %, respectively. Meanwhile, the addition of calcium nitrate caused Fe/Al-bound phosphorus (Fe/Al-P) content in sediment declining but Ca-bound phosphorus (Ca-P) and organic phosphorus (OP) content ascending. The phosphorus-locking efficiency of sponge-iron in overlying and interstitial water was > 72 and 66 %, respectively. Meanwhile, the total phosphorus (TP), OP, Fe/Al-P, and Ca-P content in sediment increased by 33.8, 7.7, 23.1, and 23.1 %, respectively, implying that under the action of sponge-iron, the locked phosphorus in sediment was mainly inorganic form and the phosphorus-locking efficiency of sponge-iron could be stable and persistent. In addition, the phosphorus-locking efficiency of fly ash was transient and limited, let alone silica alumina clay had almost no capacity for phosphorus-locking efficiency. Therefore, calcium nitrate and sponge-iron were excellent phosphorus-locking agents to repair the seriously polluted water derived from an internal source.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				JAN	2017	24	1					264	274		10.1007/s11356-016-7796-5								WOS:000392105700025	27714656

However, the DIN sources are poorly constrained. In this study, the contributions of major sources in the Taipei metropolitan area to the DIN export in the Danshui River were investigated. It is observed that ammonium is the major DIN species in the downstream reaches, resulting from the ammonium-dominated inputs of the effluents of wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) and rain water pumping stations (RWPS). DIN concentrations in the downstream (urban) reaches are substantially elevated. The upstream tributaries annually discharge similar to 2709 t DIN to the downstream reaches. However, the DIN discharge off the downstream reaches rises to similar to 17,918 t, resulting from the contribution of RWPS-collected water, i.e., similar to 14,632 t, and the effluents of two WWTP, i.e., similar to 577 t. RWPS-collected water inherently contains the contribution of atmospheric deposition, similar to 2937 t DIN. This finding implies that similar to 11,695 t (similar to 66 % of the downstream output) DIN flux off the Danshui River is from urban runoff and can be attributed to human activities in the Taipei metropolitan area. To improve the water quality in the Danshui River, water quality controls in urban runoff are important.

Despite the potential use of sewage water in crop irrigation as effective and sustainable strategy, the environmental and human risks behind this use need to be deeply investigated. In this regard, an experiment was carried out under field conditions in Nursery, University College of Agriculture Sargodha, to evaluate the possible health risks of undesirable metals in wheat grains. Wheat variety Sarang was cultivated and irrigated with different combinations of ground (GW) and sewage water (SW). The concentrations of heavy metals (Cr, Cd, Ni, and Pb) and trace elements (Cu, Zn, and Fe) in wheat grains as well as in soil were determined. Moreover, the pollution load index (PLI), accumulation factor (AF), daily intake of metals (DIM), and health risk index (HRI) were calculated. Results showed that the concentration trend of heavy metals was Pb<Cr<Cu<Ni<Cd<Zn<Fe and Cr<Cu<Pb<Cd<Ni<Fe<Zn in soil and wheat, respectively. Among metals, Cd concentration in wheat exceeded the permissible limits regardless water quality, whereas Pb concentration in grain was within the acceptable levels as suggested by World Health Organization, when 100 % of SW was used for irrigation. Similar observation was reported for Cd concentration in the soil when wheat was irrigated with 100 % SW. In comparison to soil, the edible part of wheat presented lower concentration of all studied metals, except for Zn which was much higher compared to the tested soil samples. The higher concentration of Zn was responsible for increasing the DIM of Zn where, in average, the highest value was reported, particularly in 75 % SW treatment. This was reflected also in HRI where the maximum value was reported for Zinc under the same treatment. Higher value of HRI for wheat cultivated on polluted soils suggested that appropriate management of cultivated area is necessary for food safety and thus for public health. The results are expected to create awareness among the public on the safety of consuming food products grown in particular areas.

The Multiple Stressor Ecological Risk Assessment for the Mercury-Contaminated South River and Upper Shenandoah River Using the Bayesian Network-Relative Risk Model	INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT												We have conducted a regional scale risk assessment using the Bayesian Network Relative Risk Model (BN-RRM) to calculate the ecological risks to the South River and upper Shenandoah River study area. Four biological endpoints (smallmouth bass, white sucker, Belted Kingfisher, and Carolina Wren) and 4 abiotic endpoints (Fishing River Use, Swimming River Use, Boating River Use, and Water Quality Standards) were included in this risk assessment, based on stakeholder input. Although mercury (Hg) contamination was the original impetus for the site being remediated, other chemical and physical stressors were evaluated. There were 3 primary conclusions from the BN-RRM results. First, risk varies according to location, type and quality of habitat, and exposure to stressors within the landscape. The patterns of risk can be evaluated with reasonable certitude. Second, overall risk to abiotic endpoints was greater than overall risk to biotic endpoints. By including both biotic and abiotic endpoints, we are able to compare risk to endpoints that represent a wide range of stakeholder values. Third, whereas Hg reduction is the regulatory priority for the South River, Hg is not the only stressor driving risk to the endpoints. Ecological and habitat stressors contribute risk to the endpoints and should be considered when managing this site. This research provides the foundation for evaluating the risks of multiple stressors of the South River to a variety of endpoints. From this foundation, tools for the evaluation of management options and an adaptive management tools have been forged. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2017; 13: 85-99.

Using the Bayesian Network Relative Risk Model Risk Assessment Process to Evaluate Management Alternatives for the South River and Upper Shenandoah River, Virginia	INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT												We have conducted a series of regional scale risk assessments using the Bayesian Network Relative Risk Model (BN-RRM) to evaluate the efficacy of 2 remediation options in the reduction of risks to the South River and upper Shenandoah River study area. The 2 remediation options were 1) bank stabilization (BST) and 2) the implementation of best management practices for agriculture (AgBMPs) to reduce Hg input in to the river. Eight endpoints were chosen to be part of the risk assessment, based on stakeholder input. Although Hg contamination was the original impetus for the site being remediated, multiple chemical and physical stressors were evaluated in this analysis. Specific models were built that incorporated the changes expected from AgBMP and BST and were based on our previous research. Changes in risk were calculated, and sensitivity and influence analyses were conducted on the models. The assessments indicated that AgBMP would only slightly change risk in the study area but that negative impacts were also unlikely. Bank stabilization would reduce risk to Hg for the smallmouth bass and belted kingfisher and increase risk to abiotic water quality endpoints. However, if care were not taken to prevent loss of nesting habitat to belted kingfisher, an increase in risk to that species would occur. Because Hg was only one of several stressors contributing to risk, the change in risk depended on the specific endpoint. Sensitivity analysis provided a list of variables to be measured as part of a monitoring program. Influence analysis provided the range of maximum and minimum risk values for each endpoint and remediation option. This research demonstrates the applicability of ecological risk assessment and specifically the BN-RRM as part of a long-term adaptive management scheme for managing contaminated sites.

Passive Biological Treatment of Mine Water to Reduce Conductivity: Potential Designs, Challenges, and Research Needs	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												The remediation of mine water to preserve receiving water quality has advanced substantially over the past half century, but prospective regulations to limit the conductivity of mining-impacted waters pose a significant new challenge. Conventional approaches to reduce high levels of conductivity in these mine waters are often costly, requiring high levels of maintenance and significant inputs of energy and refined chemicals. In contrast, passive biological treatment (PBT) systems are a relatively low-cost, low-maintenance treatment technology for mine waters that have been used for over three decades. However, their practical ability to reduce conductivity is unclear, given previous research reports focused on the removal of metals, acidity, and solids. A systematic literature review to identify previous reports of PBT systems at the laboratory or field scale that include evaluations of changes in conductivity suggests that decreases in conductivity of 30 to 40% are achievable. Substantial variability in performance is common, however, and conductivity increased markedly in some systems. This variation may be associated with the dissolution of limestone, which is a key treatment material in some systems. Although the development of PBT to serve as pre, post-, or stand-alone treatment systems targeting conductivity may reduce overall treatment cost in some settings, optimization of these designs requires an increase in the number of published conductivity datasets from similar systems, detailed reports on the key ions contributing to elevated conductivity region to region, and further investigation of the underlying biochemical processes responsible for conductivity reductions.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				JAN-FEB	2017	46	1					1	9		10.2134/jeq2016.06.0216								WOS:000392271400001	28177423

Modeling Patterns of Total Dissolved Solids Release from Central Appalachia, USA, Mine Spoils	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Surface mining in the central Appalachian coalfields (USA) influences water quality because the interaction of infiltrated waters and O-2 with freshly exposed mine spoils releases elevated levels of total dissolved solids (TDS) to streams. Modeling and predicting the short-and long-term TDS release potentials of mine spoils can aid in the management of current and future mining-influenced watersheds and landscapes. In this study, the specific conductance (SC, a proxy variable for TDS) patterns of 39 mine spoils during a sequence of 40 leaching events were modeled using a five-parameter nonlinear regression. Estimated parameter values were compared to six rapid spoil assessment techniques (RSATs) to assess predictive relationships between model parameters and RSATs. Spoil leachates reached maximum values, 1108 +/- 161 mu S cm(-1) on average, within the first three leaching events, then declined exponentially to a breakpoint at the 16th leaching event on average. After the breakpoint, SC release remained linear, with most spoil samples exhibiting declines in SC release with successive leaching events. The SC asymptote averaged 276 +/- 25 mu S cm(-1). Only three samples had SCs > 500 mu S cm(-1) at the end of the 40 leaching events. Model parameters varied with mine spoil rock and weathering type, and RSATs were predictive of four model parameters. Unweathered samples released higher SCs throughout the leaching period relative to weathered samples, and rock type influenced the rate of SC release. The RSATs for SC, total S, and neutralization potential may best predict certain phases of mine spoil TDS release.

Small Reservoirs as a Beneficial Management Practice for Nitrogen Removal	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												There are few beneficial management practices (BMPs) with demonstrated efficacy in snowmelt-dominated regions. Small reservoirs are a BMP that can help mitigate flooding and reduce sediment transport, while reducing export of dissolved nutrients. To understand controls on nitrate removal and assess how this ecosystem service can be optimized, denitrification activity was measured in reservoirs and stream pools of the Tobacco Creek Model Watershed (Manitoba, Canada) via the chloramphenicol-amended acetylene block technique. Denitrification activity was positively correlated with nitrate and sediment organic carbon (SOC), and negatively correlated with sediment particle size and pH. Reservoirs exhibited higher denitrification activity than stream pools and were associated with higher levels of SOC, higher nitrate in early summer, and lower concentrations of dissolved oxygen. Nitrate was added to a set of samples to test for nitrate saturation, an indicator of poor ecological status, where nitrate concentrations exceed the denitrification capacity of microbes. Forty-nine percent of measurements demonstrated nitrate saturation, indicative of the need for additional remediation activity. Findings from this research suggest this BMP has higher capacity for nitrogen removal than stream pools because of higher denitrification rates and a higher apparent threshold for nitrate saturation, coupled with increased residence times. Results also inform the construction of additional reservoirs, which have been identified as a priority BMP in this region. Siting reservoirs in areas where conditions contribute to buildup of fine sediments and planting riparian vegetation to foster high organic C availability may help optimize denitrification, although tradeoffs in terms of other ecosystem services must be considered.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				JAN-FEB	2017	46	1					96	104		10.2134/jeq2016.07.0252								WOS:000392271400012	28177420

The Relationship between Land Use and Vulnerability to Nitrogen and Phosphorus Pollution in an Urban Watershed	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Characterization of the vulnerability of water bodies to pollution from natural and anthropogenic sources requires understanding the relationship between land use and water quality. This study aims (i) to explore the influence of upstream land use on annual stream water concentrations and loads of total nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP) and (ii) to characterize the vulnerability of water bodies to TN and TP pollution as a function of land use under varying climatic conditions. Multiple linear regression models were used across 23 stream locations within the Jordan Lake watershed in North Carolina between 1992 and 2012 to explore land use-water quality relationships. The percentage of urban land use and wastewater treatment plant capacity were the most important factors with strong (R-2 > 0.7) and significant (p < 0.01) positive correlations with annual TN and TP concentrations and loads. Percent agricultural land was negatively correlated with TN in 18 out of 21 yr of the study period. Using analysis of covariance, significant (p < 0.01) differences were determined between models developed for urban land use with TN and TP loads based on annual precipitation. Using concentrations instead of loads resulted in a nonsignificant difference between models for average and wet years. Finally, a procedure was developed to characterize the vulnerability to TN and TP pollution, computed as the probability of exceeding the nutrient standard limits. Results indicated that the vulnerability to TN and TP was controlled primarily by urban land use, with higher values in dry years than normal and wet years.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				JAN-FEB	2017	46	1					113	122		10.2134/jeq2016.06.0239								WOS:000392271400014	28177402

JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Cumulative daily load time series show that the early 2000s marked a step-change increase in riverine soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) loads entering the Western Lake Erie Basin from three major tributaries: the Maumee, Sandusky, and Raisin Rivers. These elevated SRP loads have been sustained over the last 12 yr. Empirical regression models were used to estimate the contributions from (i) increased runoff from changing weather and precipitation patterns and (ii) increased SRP delivery (the combined effects of increased source availability and/or increased transport efficiency of labile phosphorus [P] fractions). Approximately 65% of the SRP load increase after 2002 was attributable to increased SRP delivery, with higher runoff volumes accounting for the remaining 35%. Increased SRP delivery occurred concomitantly with declining watershed P budgets. However, within these watersheds, there have been long-term, largescale changes in land management: reduced tillage to minimize erosion and particulate P loss, and increased tile drainage to improve field operations and profitability. These practices can inadvertently increase labile P fractions at the soil surface and transmission of soluble P via subsurface drainage. Our findings suggest that changes in agricultural practices, including some conservation practices designed to reduce erosion and particulate P transport, may have had unintended, cumulative, and converging impacts contributing to the increased SRP loads, reaching a critical threshold around 2002.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				JAN-FEB	2017	46	1					123	132		10.2134/jeq2016.07.0248								WOS:000392271400015	28177409

Effects on the Underlying Water Column by Extensive Floating Treatment Wetlands	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Floating treatment wetlands (FTWs) are an emerging engineering option with promise for simultaneous water quality improvement and habitat creation. Relatively little research has been published regarding their construction or effects on the underlying water column. In this field-scale experiment, four different extensive FTW designs were constructed using minimal materials, including drainpipe, burlap, mulch, utility netting, and reused polyethylene bottles. The FTWs were then planted with Typha spp. (cattail) and Juncus effusus L. (common rush). Over 28 mo, the water column beneath FTWs in two test ponds was compared to that in an open water control pond. The ponds (190 +/- 10 m(2)) were fed with well water enriched with nitrate to emulate agricultural ponds. Although observed differences were relatively small, statistically significant differences were noted. With respect to the control, waters underneath FTWs had lower dissolved oxygen, sulfate, nitrate, and pH, dampened diurnal temperature fluctuations, and greater alkalinity. The FTWs created habitat and were colonized by species of insects, birds, amphibians, snails, and spiders. Results indicated that Typha spp. is suitable for FTW creation. However, a more supportive planting matrix is suggested to encourage faster plant growth and protect against wind and wave action damage. Although plant growth was limited, results suggest that FTWs may be applied to encourage less aerobic and more organic rich and thermally insulated conditions for water quality improvement in agricultural ponds and other aquatic systems while also creating valuable habitat.

Use pattern of pesticides and their predicted mobility into shallow groundwater and surface water bodies of paddy lands in Mahaweli river basin in Sri Lanka	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART B-PESTICIDES FOOD CONTAMINANTS AND AGRICULTURAL WASTES												Pesticides applied on agricultural lands reach groundwater by leaching, and move to offsite water bodies by direct runoff, erosion and spray drift. Therefore, an assessment of the mobility of pesticides in water resources is important to safeguard such resources. Mobility of pesticides on agricultural lands of Mahaweli river basin in Sri Lanka has not been reported to date. In this context, the mobility potential of 32 pesticides on surface water and groundwater was assessed by widely used pesticide risk indicators, such as Attenuation Factor (AF) index and the Pesticide Impact Rating Index (PIRI) with some modifications. Four surface water bodies having greater than 20% land use of the catchment under agriculture, and shallow groundwater table at 3.0m depth were selected for the risk assessment. According to AF, carbofuran, quinclorac and thiamethoxam are three most leachable pesticides having AF values 1.44 x 10(-2), 1.87 x 10(-3) and 5.70 x 10(-4), respectively. Using PIRI, offsite movement of pesticides by direct runoff was found to be greater than with the erosion of soil particles for the study area. Carbofuran and quinclorac are most mobile pesticides by direct runoff with runoff fractions of 0.01 and 0.08, respectively, at the studied area. Thiamethoxam and novaluron are the most mobile pesticides by erosion with erosion factions of 1.02 x 10(-4) and 1.05 x 10(-4), respectively. Expected pesticide residue levels in both surface and groundwater were predicted to remain below the USEPA health advisory levels, except for carbofuran, indicating that pesticide pollution is unlikely to exceed the available health guidelines in the Mahaweli river basin in Sri Lanka.

The total amount of organic carbon recorded during the period 2000-2014 was 11.4 times that of SO4 (2-). The amounts of organic carbon and SO4 (2-) removed through landfill gas were 16.0 and 6.1 %, respectively, during the same period. The COD/SO4 (2-) ratio of the leachate was 10.9 in 2001, which drastically decreased to 4.5 in 2007 by the increase in CH4 concentration; thereafter, no great variations in this ratio were observed up to 2014. It was found that the concentration of H2S sharply increased after methane concentrations reached their highest levels. The year around 2006 may be the equilibrium time point among the waste supply, LFG generation, and leachate water quality. In conclusion, if the ratio of landfill organic carbon to SO4 (2-) is about 10, and the COD/SO4 (2-) ratio is about 9 in the state of equilibrium, there appears to be no hindrance to the generation of CH4 and H2S.																	1438-4957	1611-8227				JAN	2017	19	1					443	452		10.1007/s10163-015-0441-4								WOS:000392385300045						
J	Wang, SW; Li, ZW; Yu, QL				Wang, Shunwu; Li, Ziwang; Yu, Qinglong			Kinetic degradation of guar gum in oilfield wastewater by photo-Fenton process	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Guar gum is considered as a main component of oilfield wastewater. This work is intended to optimize the experimental conditions (H2O2 dosage, Fe2+ dosage, initial concentration of organics, initial pH and temperature) for the maximum oxidative degradation of guar gum by Fenton's reagent. The kinetics of guar gum removal were evaluated by means of the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and the absorbance measurements. The batch experiment results showed that the optimum conditions were: H2O2 dosage, 10,000 mg/L; Fe2+ dosage, 2,000 mg/L; initial concentration of organics, 413 mg/L; pH, 3 and temperature, 35 degrees C, under which the COD removal could reach 61.07% and fairly good stability could be obtained. Under the optimum experimental conditions, using UV irradiation to treat the wastewater, the photo-Fenton systems can successfully eliminate COD from guar gum solution. The COD removal always obeyed a pseudo-first-order kinetics and the degradation rate (k(app)) was increased by 25.7% in the photo-Fenton process compared to the Fenton process. The photo-Fenton system needed less time and consequently less quantity of H2O2 to obtain the same results as the Fenton process. The photo-Fenton process needs a dose of H2O2 20.46% lower than that used in the Fenton process to remove 79.54% of COD. The cost of the photo/ Fenton process amounted to RMB9.43/m(3), which was lower than that of the classic Fenton process alone (RMB10.58/m(3)) and the overall water quality of the final effluent could meet the class. national wastewater discharge standard for the petrochemical industry of China.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				JAN	2017	75	1					11	19		10.2166/wst.2016.470								WOS:000392391100002	28067641

The response of phytoplankton and microlayer-adapted bacteria to monolayer application in a humic, eutrophic irrigation dam	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Repeat applications of artificial monolayers to farm irrigation dams to reduce evaporative loss may adversely affect water quality by enhancing populations of microlayer-adapted bacteria and blue-green algae. The microlayer, subsurface and water column of a 16 ha dam were monitored every two weeks for 18 months, to benchmark the seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton and microlayer-adapted bacteria prior to monolayer application. Results for Secchi depth, total P, total N, chlorophyll a, phytobiovolume and UV254 absorbance, characterise Logan's Dam as humic and hypereutrophic. Seasonal peaks in the cyanobacterial species Microcystis aeruginosa and Anabaena sp. associated with regular thermal stratification periods over summer, exceeded the Queensland algal bloom alert level. Dissolved organic matter derived from aromatic char in the black soil used to construct the dam was the main substrate for microlayer-adapted bacteria. Intermittent monolayer application over seven weeks in late summer temporarily increased surface pressure, indicating a condensed monolayer had formed, with no increase in chemical oxygen demand or in populations of cyanobacteria or microlayer-adapted bacteria. The increase in dissolved organic carbon was well below the concentration recorded after a pump ingress event in late spring. In this humic hypereutrophic irrigation dam, repeat applications of the experimental monolayer formulation did not adversely affect water quality.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				JAN	2017	75	2					322	327		10.2166/wst.2016.515								WOS:000392395800009	28112659

Since it is not possible to analyze every single substance, a prioritization methodology is needed for the selection of those to be monitored. Existing well-developed models require significant amount of data for reliable outcomes. This paper presents a methodology to prioritize the dangerous substances having adverse effects on freshwaters in Turkey, where data are scarce. Such a methodology will also serve as a solid model for other countries with limited background data. The adopted methodology enabled the elimination of chemicals to generate a candidate list composed of 608 substances among more than 5000 substances. Further screening and prioritization were conducted using different assessment methods (i.e., Total Hazard Value, Total Impact Value, Combined Monitoring-based, and Modelling-based Priority Setting) to obtain a proposed Final Candidate Specific Pollutants List of 150 dangerous substances. The proposed Candidate National Pollutant List of Turkey was established by combining 45 priority pollutants of the European Union with a list of candidate specific pollutants. According to the outcomes of this study, monitoring and controlling of 195 dangerous substances in freshwaters are recommended. Further detailed studies should be conducted in order to observe the actual levels of these dangerous substances in freshwaters followed by a review of the monitoring list accordingly. Moreover, further revisions might be required in the proposed list due to some possible versatile conditions in terms of sampling points (i.e., change in the location of industries).

Oceans in Peril: Grand Challenges in Applied Water Quality Research for the 21st Century	ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE												Oceans cover most of the planet and 60% of the world's population lives near the coast. Anthropogenic activities along coastlines and in the open ocean have placed the oceans in peril. According to a Pew Oceans Commission Report, among the greatest threats to the ocean are land-based runoff from coastal development, nutrient pollution, overfishing, and invasive species. Here, we describe threats due to microbial, nutrient, chemical, and plastic pollution in addition to declining biodiversity and describe fundamental and applied research needed to mitigate the threats. While the research needs are diverse, we identify several research foci that transcend individual threats: monitoring, fate and transport studies, modeling, innovative natural and engineered treatment systems, and toxicity and health studies. Research within the environmental engineering and science community that addresses these needs will contribute to improving ocean health.																	1092-8758	1557-9018				JAN	2017	34	1			SI		3	15		10.1089/ees.2015.0252								WOS:000391851300002						
J	Staehr, PA; Testa, J; Carstensen, J				Staehr, Peter A.; Testa, Jeremy; Carstensen, Jacob			Decadal Changes in Water Quality and Net Productivity of a Shallow Danish Estuary Following Significant Nutrient Reductions	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												We utilized an extensive data set (1977-2013) from a water quality monitoring program to investigate the recovery of a Danish estuary following large reductions in total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) loading. Monthly rates of net transport and biogeochemical transformation of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and phosphorus (DIP) were computed in two basins of the estuary using a box model approach, and oxygen-based rates of net ecosystem production (NEP) were determined. Since 1990, nutrient loading was reduced by 58 % for nitrogen and 80 % for phosphorus, causing significant decreases in DIN (60 %) and DIP (85 %) concentrations. Reductions in nutrient loadings and concentrations reduced annual chlorophyll levels by 50 % in the inner estuary and improved Secchi depth by approximately 1 m during the same period, particularly in the summer period. In the outer, deeper region of the estuary trends in water quality was less evident. Improvements in the inner estuary were strongly coupled to declines in DIN. Thresholds of DIN and DIP concentrations limiting phytoplankton growth indicated that both regions of the estuary were nitrogen limited. NEP rates indicated the development of more net autotrophic conditions over time that were likely associated with higher benthic primary production stimulated by improved light conditions. Box model computations revealed a modest reduction in summer net production of DIP over time, despite the persistence of elevated fluxes for several years after external loads were reduced. Since the mid-1990s, nutrient loading and transformation were stable while nutrient concentrations continued to decline and water quality improved in the inner estuary. The oligotrophication trajectory involved an initial fast transformation and modest retention of nutrients followed by a gradual decline in the rate of improvement towards a new stable condition.

The Influence of Storms on Water Quality and Phytoplankton Dynamics in the Tidal James River	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Due to the unpredictable nature of intense storms and logistical constraints of sampling during storms, little is known about their immediate and long-term impacts on water quality in adjacent aquatic ecosystems. By combining targeted experiments with routine monitoring, we evaluated immediate impacts of two successive storm events on water quality and phytoplankton community response in the tidal James River and compared these findings to a non-storm year. The James River is a subestuary of the Chesapeake Bay and sampling was conducted before, during, and after Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm (TS) Lee in 2011 and during the same time period (late summer/early fall) in 2012 when there were no storms. We collected and compiled data on nutrient and chlorophyll a concentrations, phytoplankton abundance, nitrogen uptake, primary productivity rates, and surface salinity, temperature, and turbidity in the meso- and polyhaline segments of the James River. Hurricane Irene introduced significant amounts of freshwater over the entire James River and Chesapeake Bay watersheds, while rainfall from TS Lee fell primarily on the tidal fresh region of the James River and headwaters of the Chesapeake Bay. Dinoflagellates dominated the algal community in the meso- and polyhaline segments prior to the storms in 2011, and a mixed diatom community emerged after the storms. In the mesohaline river segment, cyanobacteria abundance increased after TS Lee when salinities were depressed, likely due to washout from the oligohaline and tidal fresh regions of the river. In 2012, dinoflagellates dominated the community in both segments of the river during late summer but diatoms were also abundant and their biomass fluctuated throughout the summer and fall. Cyanobacteria were not present in either segment. Overall, we observed that the high-intensity rainfall from Hurricane Irene combined with high flushing in the headwaters as a result of TS Lee likely reduced primary productivity and altered community composition in the mesohaline segment but not the more estuarine-influenced polyhaline segment. Understanding the influence of high freshwater flow with a short residence time associated with storms is key to the planning and management of estuarine restoration as such disturbances are projected to increase as a result of climate change.

Removal of cyanobacteria from the water column using a combination of coagulant and ballast is a promising technique for mitigation and an alternative to the use of algaecides. In laboratory, we tested experimentally the efficiency of two coagulants, polyaluminium chloride (PAC) and chitosan (made of shrimp shells), alone and combined with two ballasts: red soil (RS) and the own lagoon sediment, to remove natural populations of cyanobacteria, from an urban brackish coastal lagoon. PAC was a very effective coagulant when applied at low doses (ae<currency>8 mg Al L-1) and settled the cyanobacteria, while at high doses (ae<yen>16 mg Al L-1) large flocks aggregated in the top of test tubes. In contrast, chitosan was not able to form flocks, even in high doses (> 16 mg L-1) and did not efficiently settle down cyanobacteria when combined with ballast. The RS itself removed 33-47 % of the cyanobacteria. This removal was strongly enhanced when combined with PAC in a dose-dependent matter; 8 mg Al L-1 was considered the best dose to be applied. The lagoon sediment alone did not promote any settling of cyanobacteria but removal was high when combined with PAC. Combined coagulant and ballast seems a very efficient, cheap, fast and safe curative measure to lessen the harmful cyanobacteria bloom nuisance in periods when particularly needed, such as around the 2016 Olympics in Jacarepagua Lagoon.

Global transcriptomic profiling in barramundi (Lates calcarifer) from rivers impacted by differing agricultural land uses	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Most catchments discharging into the Great Barrier Reef lagoon have elevated loads of suspended sediment, nutrients, and pesticides, including photosystem II inhibiting herbicides, associated with upstream agricultural land use. To investigate potential impacts of declining water quality on fish physiology, RNA sequencing (RNASeq) was used to characterize and compare the hepatic transcriptomes of barramundi (Lates calcarifer) captured from 2 of these tropical river catchments in Queensland, Australia. The Daintree and Tully Rivers differ in upstream land uses, as well as sediment, nutrient, and pesticide loads, with the area of agricultural land use and contaminant loads lower in the Daintree. In fish collected from the Tully River, transcripts involved in fatty acid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and citrate cycling were also more abundant, suggesting elevated circulating cortisol concentrations, whereas transcripts involved in immune responses were less abundant. Fish from the Tully also had an increased abundance of transcripts associated with xenobiotic metabolism. Previous laboratory-based studies observed similar patterns in fish and amphibians exposed to the agricultural herbicide atrazine. If these transcriptomic patterns are manifested at the whole organism level, the differences in water quality between the 2 rivers may alter fish growth and fitness.

Biomining utilizes microbes to extract metals from the ore, and it has been suggested as a new sustainable way to produce metals. However, little is known of the potential ecotoxicological effects of biomining. In the present study, biomining impacts were assessed using survival and behavioral responses of aquatic macroinvertebrates at in situ exposures in streams. The authors used an impedance conversion technique to measure quantitatively in situ behavioral responses of larvae of the regionally common mayfly, Heptagenia dalecarlica, to discharges from the Talvivaara mine (Sotkamo, Northern Finland), which uses a biomining technique. Behavioral responses measured in 3 mine-impacted streams were compared with those measured in 3 reference streams. In addition, 3-d survival of the mayfly larvae and the oligochaete Lumbriculus variegatus was measured in the study sites. Biomining impacts on stream water quality included increased concentrations of sulfur, sulfate, and metals, especially manganese, cadmium, zinc, sodium, and calcium. Survival of the invertebrates in the short term was not affected by the mine effluents. In contrast, apparent behavioral changes in mayfly larvae were detected, but these responses were not consistent among sites, which may reflect differing natural water chemistry of the study sites.

Trace element distribution and risk assessment in South Indian surface waterways	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The concentrations of 27 major and trace elements are determined in surface water samples collected from 48 sites of diverse waterways in four states (Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, and Telangana) of South India. The aims of this study are to identify the element distribution, comparatively assess the pollution risk, and evaluate human health risks related to diverse waterways in the study area. The results indicate that elements such as Cr, Se, As, Fe, and Mn are the major pollutants, as their concentrations exceeded the acceptable national and international water quality standards in several sites of Ennore, Adyar, Cooum, Periyar, and Vrishabhavathi rivers. Furthermore, statistical analysis reveals that the Ennore, Adyar, Cooum, Periyar, and Kaveri river basins are affected by various anthropogenic activities, leading to moderate-to-high pollution by As, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Se. Potential pollution sources are industrial waste, sewage intrusion, paint industry waste, and automobile runoff. Overall, the investigated sites are categorized into three major groups: highly, moderately, and least polluted. Risk on human health by metals is then evaluated using hazard quotients (HQs) and carcinogenic risk evaluation; the results indicated that As with HQ > 1 is the most hazardous pollutant, which could lead to non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic concerns, particularly in children. This study helps in establishing pollutant loading reduction goal and the total maximum daily loads and consequently contributes to preserving public health and developing water conservation strategies.

Physico-chemical and biological characterization of urban municipal landfill leachate	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Unscientific management and ad-hoc approaches in municipal solid waste management have led to a generation of voluminous leachate in urban conglomerates. Quantification, quality assessment, following treatment and management of leachate has become a serious problem worldwide. In this context, the present study investigates the physico-chemical and biological characterization of landfill leachate and nearby water sources and attempts to identify relationships between the key parameters together with understanding the various processes for chemical transformations. The analysis shows an intermediate leachate age (5-10 years) with higher nutrient levels of 10,000-12,000 mg/ls and similar to 2000-3000 mg/l of carbon (COD) and nitrogen (TKN) respectively. Elemental analysis and underlying mechanisms reveal chemical precipitation and co-precipitation as the vital processes in leachate pond systems resulting in accumulation of trace metals. Based on the above criteria the samples were clustered into major groups that showed a clear distinction between leachate and water bodies. The microbial analysis showed bacterial communities correlating with specific factors relevant to redox environments indicating a gradient in nature and abundance of biotic diversity with a change in leachate environment. Finally, the quality and the contamination potential of the samples were evaluated with the help of leachate pollution index (LPI) and water quality index (WQI) analysis. The study helps in understanding the contamination potential of landfill leachate and establishes linkages between microbial communities and physico-chemical parameters for effective management of landfill leachate.

To compensate for the effects of temporal variability, we deployed polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS) in 100 small streams across the Midwest for about 5 weeks during summer 2013 and analyzed the extracts for 227 pesticide compounds. Analysis of water samples collected weekly for pesticides during POCIS deployment allowed for comparison of POCIS results with periodic water-sampling results. The median number of pesticides detected in POCIS extracts was 62, and 141 compounds were detected at least once, indicating a high level of pesticide contamination of streams in the region. Sixty-five of the 141 compounds detected were pesticide degradates. Mean water concentrations estimated using published POCIS sampling rates strongly correlated with means of weekly water samples collected concurrently, however, the POCIS-estimated concentrations generally were lower than the measured water concentrations. Summed herbicide concentrations (units of ng/POCIS) were greater at agricultural sites than at urban sites but summed concentrations of insecticides and fungicides were greater at urban sites. Consistent with these differences, summed concentrations of herbicides correlate to percent cultivated crops in the watersheds and summed concentrations of insecticides and fungicides correlate to percent urban land use. With the exception of malathion concentrations at nine sites, POCIS-estimated water concentrations of pesticides were lower than aquatic-life benchmarks. The POCIS provide an alternative approach to traditional water sampling for characterizing chronic exposure to pesticides in streams across the Midwest region. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Seasonal variation in the nature of DOM in a river and drinking water reservoir of a closed catchment	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in surface waters used for drinking purposes can vary markedly in character depending on its source within catchments and the timing and intensity of rainfall events. Here we report the findings of a study on the character and concentration of DOM in waters collected during different seasons from Myponga River and Reservoir, South Australia. The character of DOM was assessed in terms of its treatability by enhanced coagulation and potential for disinfection by-product i.e. trihalomethane (THM) formation. During the wet seasons (winter and spring), water samples from the river had higher DOC concentrations ((X) over bar: 21 mg/L) and DOM of higher average molecular weight (AMW: 1526 Da) than waters collected during the dry seasons (summer and autumn: DOC: 13 mg/L; AMW: 1385 Da). Even though these features led to an increase in the percentage removal of organics by coagulation with alum (64% for wet compared with 53% for dry season samples) and a lower alum dose rate (10 versus 15 mg alum/mg DOC removal), there was a higher THM formation potential (THMFP) from wet season waters (treated waters: 217 mu g/L vs 172 mu g/L). For reservoir waters, samples collected during the wet seasons had an average DOC concentration (X: 15 mg/L), percentage removal of organics by alum (54%), alum dose rates (13 mg/mg DOC) and THMFP (treated waters: 207 mu g/L) that were similar to samples collected during the dry seasons (mean DOC: 15 mg/L; removal of organics: 52%; alum dose rate: 13 mg/mg DOC; THMFP: 212 mu g/L, for treated waters). These results show that DOM present in river waters and treatability by alum are highly impacted by seasonal environmental variations. However these in reservoir waters exhibit less seasonal variability. Storage of large volumes of water in the reservoir enables mixing of influent waters and stabilization of water quality.

To better predict the sorption and mobility of U in aquatic ecosystems, we investigated the sediment-solution partition coefficients (K-d) of U for nine uncontaminated freshwater sediments with a wide range of physicochemical characteristics over an environmentally relevant pH range. Test solutions were reconstituted to mimic water quality conditions and U(VI) concentrations (0.023-2.3 mg U/L) found downstream of Canadian U mines. Adsorption of U(VI) to each sediment was greatest at pH 6 and 7, and significantly reduced at pH 8. There were significant differences in pH-dependent sorption among sediments with different physicochemical properties, with sorption increasing up until thresholds of 12% total organic carbon, 37% fine fraction (<= 50 mu m), and 29 g/kg of iron content. The Kd values for U(VI) were predicted using the Windermere Humic Aqueous Model (WHAM) using total U(VI) concentrations, and water and sediment physicochemical parameters. Predicted K-d-U values were generally within a factor of three of the observed values. These results improve the understanding and assessment of U sorption to field sediment, and quantify the relationship with sediment properties that may influence the bioavailability and ecological risk of U-contaminated sediments.

Widespread, routine occurrence of pharmaceuticals in sewage effluent, combined sewer overflows and receiving waters	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Research addressing the occurrence, fate and effects of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment has expanded rapidly over the past two decades, primarily due to the development of improved chemical analysis methods. Significant research gaps still remain, however, including a lack of longer term, repeated monitoring of rivers, determination of temporal and spatial changes in pharmaceutical concentrations, and inputs from sources other than wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), such as combined sewer overflows (CSOs). In addressing these gaps it was found that the five pharmaceuticals studied were routinely (51-94% of the time) present in effluents and receiving waters at concentrations ranging from single ng to mu g L-1. Mean concentrations were in the tens to hundreds ng L-1 range and CSOs appear to be a significant source of pharmaceuticals to water courses in addition to WWTPs. Receiving water concentrations varied throughout the day although there were no pronounced peaks at particular times. Similarly, concentrations varied throughout the year although no consistent patterns were observed. No dissipation of the study compounds was found over a 5 km length of river despite no other known inputs to the river. In conclusion, pharmaceuticals are routinely present in semi-rural and urban rivers and require management alongside more traditional pollutants. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Many different restoration methods have already implemented in order to improve the quality of lake water in Poland and around the world. Science reports on lake restoration mostly present short-term results achieved with one method, sometimes with a combination of few technologies, methods. Noteworthy is the scarcity of longitudinal observations and descriptions of persisting changes in environmental conditions and trophic status after a lake restoration process. The aim of the study was to present long-term changes in the trophic status of an urban lake which were been achieved through artificial aeration with thermal destratification and phosphorus inactivation, based on water quality parameters and an analysis of biotic and abiotic conditions prevailing in this lake. The study was conducted on Dlugie Lake, situated in the town of Olsztyn. This lake had acted as a sink of raw domestic sewage (400 m(3) day(-1)) for 20 years. After preliminary conservation operations, the lake was restored by the artificial circulation and phosphorus inactivation methods. Prior to the restoration effort, the lake had been classified as hypertrophic, with an average TSI index value of 79. The average chlorophyll a concentration was 63 mu g l(-1) and water transparency did not exceed 0.3 m. The implementation of two restoration methods improved the trophic level and the lake became mesotrophic. The improvement seems permanent, as the mean TSI index is 50 ten years since the termination of the restoration procedures.

Assessing the potential impacts of WWTP effluent reductions within the Reedy River watershed	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												The Reedy River Basin originates along the northern fringe of the Greenville Metro Area and flows southward through downtown Greenville and continues for about 40 miles through increasingly rural lands until it empties into Lake Greenwood. This project evaluated the potential downstream impact to the Reedy River, Boyd Millpond, and Lake Greenwood from the removal of 100% of the effluent generated from various wastewater treatment plants along the river. Evaluation was performed using the Reedy River Model which is a combination of different programs including the EPA's Loading Simulation Program in C++ (LSPC) and the Water Quality Analysis Simulation Program (WASP). Both water quality and quantity were analyzed as part of this study. The nitrogen and phosphorus species investigated in this study were total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP). Simulation runs were conducted for the Reedy River Model holding all original parameters constant to those used in the TMDL analysis. The second simulation consisted of eliminating wastewater treatment plants from the model to simulate 100% removal of their wastewater effluent. To reflect dry, wet, and average years of rainfall, seven years of actual weather data for Greenville County were used within these simulation runs. Flow was modeled from the headwaters to the Reedy River Arm of Lake Greenwood. River sections analyzed included the river section immediately upstream and downstream of the wastewater treatment plant locations and Boyd Millpond and Reedy River Arm of Lake Greenwood. Removal of effluent resulted in a reduced average flow at Boyd Millpond from 8.52 m(3)/s (301.23 cfs) to 7.34 m(3)/s (259.21 cfs), a reduction in flow of 14%; and reduced average flow at Reedy River Arm of Lake Greenwood from 9.15 m3/s (323.13 cfs) to 7.97 m3/s (281.46 cfs), a reduction in flow of 12.9%. The removal of wastewater effluent had the greatest impact during periods of minimum flow when effluent makes up the largest percentage of total flow. During periods of drought, effluent removal resulted in a reduction in flow of almost 70% at the upper wastewater treatment plant, 66% at the lower wastewater treatment plant, 59% at Boyd Millpond, and 55% at Reedy River Arm of Lake Greenwood. Based on daily flow values averaged over seven years, total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentration and mass loads at Boyd Millpond and Reedy Arm will both decrease by approximately 50% with the elimination of effluent. This report only considers the impacts of effluent removal to flow, total phosphorus and total nitrogen as modeled by LSPC and WASP. Other variables that may be influenced from effluent removal include, pH, Dissolved Oxygen, fecal matter, heavy metals, water temperature, habitat quality, species diversity, macroinvertabrates, recreational uses, and economic impacts but are not included in this study.

To explore the composition and distribution of microbial communities in different wetland types, sediments from different sites of Xinxue River (XR) and Zhaoniu River (ZR), and the corresponding Xinxue River Constructed Wetland (XRCW) and Zhaoniu River Constructed Wetland (ZRCW) were sampled and analyzed using high throughput sequencing. The constructed wetlands were found to have more taxa of microbes in sediments than their corresponding river wetlands. The community richness index suggests that microbial richness in XR and XRCW is higher than that in ZR and ZRCW. High potential of sulfur cycle in XRCW is suggested by the superior distribution of Desulfobacterales, Syntrophobacterales orders, and Thiobacillus genus of Proteobacteria. Moreover, ZRCW has relatively lower nitrification ability than other three wetlands according to the distribution of Nitrospirae, Planctomycetes, and Acidobacteria phyla. XR and XRCW show high potential of methanogenesis as the distribution of Methanomicrobia order in Archaea. ZRCW is suggested in a state that organic carbon mineralization exceeds aggregation, denitrification exceeds nitrification based on different distributions of the functional bacteria (such as Nitrospirae, Acidobacteria, and Planctomycetes). Furthermore, it indicates that ammonia removal process in ZRCW sediments is mostly limited to nitrification. This study demonstrated that wetland functions can be detected by the composition and distribution of microbial communities and influenced by the pollution status and surroundings probably. Our results are essential for understanding the interrelationship between microbial distribution and the pollution status of wetlands for the evaluation of constructed wetland. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Kimura, A; Baptista, MB; Scotti, MR				Kimura, Andrei; Baptista, Marcio B.; Scotti, Maria Rita			Soil humic acid and aggregation as restoration indicators of a seasonally flooded riparian forest under buffer zone system	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												A degraded riparian forest that has lost vegetation and has suffered periodic flooding was rehabilitated using native species under buffer zone system which was stratified according to the distance from the river (Zones I, II, III). To restore the soil stabilisation and water flow we compared the soil aggregation, porosity and soil humic substances of the experimental site (ES) with those of a disturbed site (DS) and a preserved site (PS). Six years post-transplantation, soil aggregation and micro-porosity were improved in the ES relative to the DS, but only micro-porosity achieved a pattern similar to that of the PS in Zone III. Differences in soil aggregation between ES and PS were correlated with the negative effect promoted by a high aliphatic-humic acid composition in Zone I and by an undifferentiated distribution of fulvic acid among sites which were attributed to the flooding effect. Similarities among ES and PS were related to aromatic:vinylhumic acid ratio, allowing for the clustering of samples from Zones II and III of both the PS and the ES, via a principal component analysis. Samples from Zones I of ES and PS were separated driven by aliphatic and fulvic acid contributions, while all of the DS samples formed an isolated group under the influence of aliphatic species and macro-porosity. Based on these attributes, the ES is evolving towards the PS, and the rehabilitation process has attained an intermediate phase of restoration. The zones system adopted for riparian forest restoration allowed the use of soil humic substances, aggregates and micro-porosity as indicators of restoration. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Seasonal variation in nutrient removal efficiency of a boreal wetland detected by high-frequency on-line monitoring	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING					6th International Symposium on Wetland Pollutant Dynamics and Control (WETPOL) / Annual Conference of the Constructed-Wetlands-Association (CWA)	SEP 13-18, 2015	York, ENGLAND	Cranfield Univ, Constructed Wetlands Assoc				Wetlands play an important role in reducing nutrient loads to receiving waters. The efficiency of a wetland in nutrient removal is commonly evaluated from discrete water samples taken at the inflow and at the outflow of the target wetland. In order to reveal variation in removal efficiency we carried out one year of high-frequency monitoring (HFM) of water quality and quantity at a wetland established at the mouth of an urban/agricultural watershed in boreal southern Finland. Data collected at the inflow and outflow of the 0,5 ha wetland was used to determine the range of total phosphorus (TP) and nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) concentrations. The incoming and outgoing TP and NO3-N loads were calculated and the relative and absolute reduction rates were determined. The wetland received 24 g P m(-2) year(-1) and 130 g NO3-N m(-2) year(-1) and it retained 3.1 g m(-2) year(-1) of P and 18 g m(-2) year(-1) of NO3-N. Annual TP reduction was 13% and NO3-N reduction 14%. The relative removal efficiency of TP was found to be dependent on retention time and NO3-N removal efficiency was dependent on temperature, oxygen concentration, NO3-N concentration and discharge.

Sedimentation and resuspension modelling in free water surface constructed wetlands	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING					6th International Symposium on Wetland Pollutant Dynamics and Control (WETPOL) / Annual Conference of the Constructed-Wetlands-Association (CWA)	SEP 13-18, 2015	York, ENGLAND	Cranfield Univ, Constructed Wetlands Assoc				Eutrophication is a widespread problem that is being tackled from many perspectives and the recently applied technology of constructed wetlands is being used in the treatment of eutrophic water. However, process-based models to simulate their performance are scarce, so in this work a mechanistic model was developed to simulate the removal of total suspended solids, phytoplankton and total phosphorus in free water surface constructed wetlands treating eutrophic water. The model represents the influence of the main factors of the biotope and biota on these water quality variables, and particular attention is paid to resuspension produced by wind and by avifauna. Likewise, the effect of emergent vegetation cover in sedimentation, resuspension and phytoplankton growth is included. Phytoplankton is considered to store phosphorus internally in order to use it when growing, and the contribution of phytoplankton concentration to the suspended solids budget is included. The software AQUASIM was used to calibrate and validate the model in two full-scale constructed wetlands treating eutrophic water from Lake l'Albufera de Valencia (Spain) for three years. The simulated data and field measurements showed satisfactory adjustments for the three studied variables. The budgets obtained for each variable reveal that sedimentation and resuspension are the main processes in total suspended solids performance. Sedimentation of organic particulate phosphorus is the most important process in total phosphorus removal. The sum of the effect of resuspension by avifauna and by wind increases by more than 50% the quantity of solids that enters the water column. The model reveals that simulating the effects of the emergent vegetation cover and resuspension is crucial for representing the performance of the studied variables. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Masi, F; Rizzo, A; Bresciani, R; Conte, G				Masi, Fabio; Rizzo, Anacleto; Bresciani, Riccardo; Conte, Giulio			Constructed wetlands for combined sewer overflow treatment: Ecosystem services at Gorla Maggiore, Italy	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING					6th International Symposium on Wetland Pollutant Dynamics and Control (WETPOL) / Annual Conference of the Constructed-Wetlands-Association (CWA)	SEP 13-18, 2015	Cranfield, ENGLAND	Cranfield Univ, Constructed Wetlands Assoc				Three sampling campaigns have been done in 2014-2015 in order to temporally characterize CSOs quality and quantity during representative and seasonal-specific rain events, and to estimate the ecosystem service of a CSO-CW located in Northern Italy in terms of water quality improvement. The adoption of an on-site treatment by Constructed Wetlands for the Combined Sewer Overflows is an example of decentralized approach for the optimization of the existing sewer networks and the needed reduction of their impacts on the water quality of the receiving water bodies. The CW system, that is treating the first flush of the overflows, is joined with an extended retention basin that is acting as a tertiary treatment for the CW effluents and is also storing and treating the whole second flush, slowing down by a throttle the discharge in the river and therefore playing a role in the flooding risk control. During the monitored time interval 69 events of overflow discharges have been observed and quantified; this quantification of the total volumes discharged by the specific CSO have been useful for evaluating the approach performances also in terms of mass loads in a single year, that is in the author's opinion a more conservative evaluation than comparing only the average concentrations removal rates. The obtained results have shown that on-site treatment for the first flush by CWs can obtain appropriate performances, as demonstrated by the about 87% and 93% of removal for COD and NH4+ respectively in terms of concentrations and the 68% and 94% in terms of mass loads in a year. A relevant analysis of the sampling program and the secondary services provided by this specific artificial ecosystems are discussed in the paper, together with a unique characterization of the role of the specific sources (washout, urban wastewater) to the loads that are reaching the on-site treatment unit.

Dry conditions disrupt terrestrial-aquatic linkages in northern catchments	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Aquatic ecosystems depend on terrestrial organic matter (tOM) to regulate many functions, such as food web production and water quality, but an increasing frequency and intensity of drought across northern ecosystems is threatening to disrupt this important connection. Dry conditions reduce tOM export and can also oxidize wetland soils and release stored contaminants into stream flow after rainfall. Here, we test whether these disruptions to terrestrial-aquatic linkages occur during mild summer drought and whether this affects biota across 43 littoral zone sites in 11 lakes. We use copper (Cu) and nickel (Ni) as representative contaminants, and measure abundances of Hyalella azteca, a widespread indicator of ecosystem condition and food web production. We found that tOM concentrations were reduced but correlations with organic soils (wetlands and riparian forests) persisted during mild drought and were sufficient to suppress labile Cu concentrations. Wetlands, however, also became a source of labile Ni to littoral zones, which was linked to reduced abundances of the amphipod H. azteca, on average by up to 70 times across the range of observed Ni concentrations. This reveals a duality in the functional linkage of organic soils to aquatic ecosystems whereby they can help buffer the effects of hydrologic disconnection between catchments and lakes but at the cost of biogeochemical changes that release stored contaminants. As evidence of the toxicity of trace contaminant concentrations and their global dispersion grows, sustaining links among forests, organic soils and aquatic ecosystems in a changing climate will become increasingly important.

J	Coats, ER; Brinkman, CK; Lee, S				Coats, Erik R.; Brinkman, Cynthia K.; Lee, Stephen			Characterizing and contrasting the microbial ecology of laboratory and full-scale EBPR systems cultured on synthetic and real wastewaters	WATER RESEARCH												The anthropogenic discharge of phosphorus (P) into surface waters can induce the proliferation of cyanobacteria and algae, which can negatively impact water quality. Enhanced biological P removal (EBPR) is an engineered process that can be employed to efficiently remove significant quantities of P from wastewater. Within this engineered system, the mixed microbial consortium (MMC) becomes enriched with polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs). To date much knowledge has been developed on PAOs, and the EBPR process is generally well understood; nonetheless, the engineered process remains underutilized. In this study, investigations were conducted using qPCR and Illumina MiSeq to assess the impacts of wastewater (synthetic vs. real) on EBPR microbial ecology. While a strong relationship was demonstrated between EBPR metrics (P:C; influent VFA:P) and excellent P removal across diverse EBPR systems and MMCs, no such correlations existed with the specific MMCs. Moreover, MMCs exhibited distinct clusters based on substrate, and qPCR results based on the putative PAO Accumulibacter did not correlate with BLASTN eubacterial results for either Accumulibacter or Rhodocyclaceae. More critically, PAO-based sequences aligned poorly with Accumulibacter for both eubacterial and PAO primer sets, which strongly suggests that the conventional PAO primers applied in FISH and qPCR analysis do not sufficiently target the putative PAO Accumulibacter. In particular, negligible alignment was observed for PAO amplicons obtained from a MMC performing excellent EBPR on crude glycerol (an atypical substrate). A synthetic wastewater-based MMC exhibited the best observed BLASTN match of the PAO amplicons, raising concerns about the potential relevance in using synthetic substrates in the study of EBPR.

J	Chaudhary, A; Hantush, MM				Chaudhary, Abhishek; Hantush, Mohamed M.			Bayesian Monte Carlo and maximum likelihood approach for uncertainty estimation and risk management: Application to lake oxygen recovery model	WATER RESEARCH												Model uncertainty estimation and risk assessment is essential to environmental management and informed decision making on pollution mitigation strategies. In this study, we apply a probabilistic methodology, which combines Bayesian Monte Carlo simulation and Maximum Likelihood estimation (BMCML) to calibrate a lake oxygen recovery model. We first derive an analytical solution of the differential equation governing lake-averaged oxygen dynamics as a function of time-variable wind speed. Statistical inferences on model parameters and predictive uncertainty are then drawn by Bayesian conditioning of the analytical solution on observed daily wind speed and oxygen concentration data obtained from an earlier study during two recovery periods on a eutrophic lake in upper state New York. The model is calibrated using oxygen recovery data for one year and statistical inferences were validated using recovery data for another year. Compared with essentially two-step, regression and optimization approach, the BMCML results are more comprehensive and performed relatively better in predicting the observed temporal dissolved oxygen levels (DO) in the lake. BMCML also produced comparable calibration and validation results with those obtained using popular Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique (MCMC) and is computationally simpler and easier to implement than the MCMC. Next, using the calibrated model, we derive an optimal relationship between liquid film-transfer coefficient for oxygen and wind speed and associated 95% confidence band, which are shown to be consistent with reported measured values at five different lakes. Finally, we illustrate the robustness of the BMCML to solve risk-based water quality management problems, showing that neglecting cross-correlations between parameters could lead to improper required BOD load reduction to achieve the compliance criteria of 5 mg/L.

In this study multiple approaches including targeted sampling and monitoring of host-specific Bacteroidales markers were used to identify the impact of septic systems on microbial water quality. Twenty four watersheds with septic density ranging from 8 to 373 septic units/km(2) were monitored for water quality under baseflow conditions over a 3-year period. The levels of the human-associated HF183 marker, as well as total and ruminant Bacteroidales, were quantified using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Human-associated Bacteroidales yield was significantly higher in high density watersheds compared to low density areas and was negatively correlated (r = -0.64) with the average distance of septic systems to streams in the spring season. The human marker was also positively correlated with the total Bacteroidales marker, suggesting that the human source input was a significant contributor to total fecal pollution in the study area. Multivariable regression analysis indicates that septic systems, along with forest cover, impervious area and specific conductance could explain up to 74% of the variation in human fecal pollution in the spring season. The results suggest septic system impact through contributions to groundwater recharge during baseflow or failing septic system input, especially in areas with >87 septic units/km(2). This study supports the use of microbial source tracking approaches along with traditional fecal indicator bacteria monitoring and land use characterization in a tiered approach to isolate the influence of septic systems on water quality in mixed-use watersheds.

More wastewater is being generated and the demand for clean water is increasing. To ensure the safety and health of humans and the environment, highly efficient wastewater treatment systems, and a reliable assessment of water quality and pollutants are required. The advance of holistic approaches to water quality management and the increasing use of ecological water treatment technologies, such as constructed wetlands and waste stabilisation ponds (WSPs), challenge the appropriateness of commonly used water quality indicators. Instead, additional indicators, which are direct measures of the processes involved in the stabilisation of human waste, have to be established to provide an in-depth understanding of system performance. In this study we identified the sterol composition of wastewater treated in WSPs and assessed the suitability of human sterol levels as a bioindicator of treatment efficiency of wastewater in WSPs. As treatment progressed in WSPs, the relative abundance of human faecal sterols, such as coprostanol, epicoprostanol, 24-ethylcoprostanol, and sitostanol decreased significantly and the sterol composition in wastewater changed significantly. Furthermore, sterol levels were found to be correlated with commonly used wastewater quality indicators, such as BOD, TSS and E. coli. Three of the seven sterol ratios that have previously been used to track sewage pollution in the environment, detected a faecal signal in the effluent of WSPs, however, the others were influenced by high prevalence of sterols originating from algal and fungal activities. This finding poses a concern for environmental assessment studies, because environmental pollution from waste stabilisation ponds can go unnoticed. In conclusion, faecal sterols and their ratios can be used as reliable indicators of treatment efficiency and water quality during wastewater treatment in WSPs. They can complement the use of commonly used indicators of water quality, to provide essential information on the overall performance of ponds and whether a pond is underperforming in terms of stabilising human waste. Such a holistic understanding is essential when the aim is to improve the performance of a treatment plant, build new plants or expand existing infrastructure. Future work should aim at further establishing the use of sterols as reliable water quality indicators on a broader scale across natural and engineered systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Bonhomme, C; Petrucci, G				Bonhomme, Celine; Petrucci, Guido			Should we trust build-up/wash-off water quality models at the scale of urban catchments?	WATER RESEARCH												Models of runoff water quality at the scale of an urban catchment usually rely on build-up/wash-off formulations obtained through small-scale experiments. Often, the physical interpretation of the model parameters, valid at the small-scale, is transposed to large-scale applications. Testing different levels of spatial variability, the, parameter distributions of a water quality model are obtained in this paper through a Monte Carlo Markov Chain algorithm and analyzed. The simulated variable is the total suspended solid concentration at the outlet of a periurban catchment in the Paris region (2.3 km(2)), for which high-frequency turbidity measurements are available. This application suggests that build-up/wash-off models applied at the catchment-scale do not maintain their physical meaning, but should be considered as "black-box" models. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Several studies about Water Quality Criteria (WQC) for PCP had been performed to protect the aquatic ecosystem, but in most of these studies the toxicity data were not properly analyzed (e.g. screening and processing methods). Moreover, little study was carried out on the ecological risk assessment (ERA) based on environmental factors. In this study, through collecting published native toxicity data of PCP along with relationships between toxicity and pH, pH-dependent WQC was established using a standardized scientific statistical method in China. The Criterion Maximum Concentration (CMC) and Criterion Continuous Concentration (CCC) were expressed as a function of pH. These were (1) CMC = exp(1.361 x pH-8.034) and (2) CCC = exp(1.361 x pH-10.434). At pH 7.8, the derived CMC and CCC were 13.21 and 1.20 nil., respectively. In addition, four tiers of the ERA were conducted based on pH for different waterbodies at different seasons. In tiered 1, 2, 3 and 4 ERA, PCP exposure concentrations were standardized to that at pH 7.8. Results showed that all levels of ERA method in the tiered framework were consistent with each other, and the risks of PCP in Liaohe river of wet season, Taihu lake and Liaohe river of dry season increased successively. The Hazard quotient (HQ) method indicated that small fluctuations in pH would lead to misleading hazard results. PCP concentrations of 8.66 mu g/L. at pH 7.37 in one site posed more risk than PCP of 9.57 mu g/L, at pH 7.93 in another site. The joint probability suggested that ecological risks may exist 11.84% in the dry season and 1.51% in the wet season in Liaohe River, and 4.98% in Taihu Lake, respectively while 5% thresholds (HC5) were set up to protect aquatic organisms. We hope this work could provide more information to manage and control PCP pollution in Taihe Lake and Liaohe River. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

J	Hossard, L; Guichard, L; Pelosi, C; Makowski, D				Hossard, Laure; Guichard, Laurence; Pelosi, Celine; Makowski, David			Lack of evidence for a decrease in synthetic pesticide use on the main arable crops in France	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The frequent, widespread use of pesticides in agriculture adversely affects biodiversity, human health, and water quality. In 2008, the French government adopted an environmental policy plan, "Ecophyto 2018", to halve pesticide use within 10 years. Trends in synthetic pesticide sales and use in France were described, through three different indicators: the number of unit doses (NUD), the quantity of active ingredient (QAI), and the treatment frequency index (TFI). Changes in pesticide use on seven of the principal arable crops in France since the implementation of this policy plan were analyzed, together with the impact of changes in pesticide use on water quality. No evidence was found for a decrease in pesticide sales at national level between 2008 and 2013. In terms of the TFI values for individual crops, the only decrease in pesticide use observed since 2001 was for soft wheat. This decrease was very slight, and pesticide use did not decline more rapidly after 2006 than before. Changes in pesticide use differed between French regions and crops.

Freshwater mussel shells (Unionidae) chronicle changes in a North American river over the past 1000 years	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The Illinois River was substantially altered during the 20th century with the installation of navigational locks and dams, construction of extensive levee networks, and degradation of water quality. Freshwater mussels were affected by these changes. We used sclerochronology and stable isotopes to evaluate changes over time in age-and-growth and food sources for two mussel species: Amblema plicata and Quadrula quadrula. Specimens were collected in years 1894, 1897, 1909, 1912, 1966, and 2013, and archeological specimens were collected circa 850. The von Bertalanffy growth parameter (K) was similar between 850 and 1897, but it increased by 1912 and remained elevated through 2013. Predicted maximum size (L-inf) increased over the past millennium, and 2013 individuals were over 50% larger than in 850. Growth indices showed similar patterns of continual increases in growth. Shells were enriched in C-13 and N-15 during the 20th century, but exhibited a partial return to historical conditions by 2013. These patterns are likely attributable to impoundment, nutrient pollution and eutrophication beginning in the early 20th century followed by recent water quality improvement.

SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Cyanobacteria blooms are a major environmental issue worldwide. Our understanding of the biophysical processes driving cyanobacterial proliferation and the ability to develop predictive models that inform resource managers and policy makers rely upon the accurate characterization of bloom dynamics. Models quantifying relationships between bloom severity and environmental drivers are often calibrated to an individual set of bloom observations, and few studies have assessed whether differences among observing platforms could lead to contrasting results in terms of relevant bloom predictors and their estimated influence on bloom severity. The aim of this study was to assess the degree of coherence of different monitoring methods in (1) capturing short-and long-term cyanobacteria bloom dynamics and (2) identifying environmental drivers associated with bloom variability. Using western Lake Erie as a case study, we applied boosted regression tree (BRT) models to long-term time series of cyanobacteria bloom estimates from multiple in-situ and remote sensing approaches to quantify the relative influence of physico-chemical and meteorological drivers on bloom variability. Results of BRT models showed remarkable consistency with known ecological requirements of cyanobacteria (e.g., nutrient loading, water temperature, and tributary discharge). However, discrepancies in inter-annual and intra-seasonal bloom dynamics across monitoring approaches led to some inconsistencies in the relative importance, shape, and sign of the modeled relationships between select environmental drivers and bloom severity. This was especially true for variables characterized by high short-term variability, such as wind forcing. These discrepancies might have implications for our understanding of the role of different environmental drivers in regulating bloom dynamics, and subsequently for the development of models capable of informing management and decision making. Our results highlight the need to develop methods to integrate multiple data sources to better characterize bloom spatio-temporal variability and improve our ability to understand and predict cyanobacteria blooms.

Results showed that the total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) loads from upstream discharge were the major external loads in the lake, accounting for 70% and 63% of the total loads, respectively. Scenario simulation results indicated that 93.2% of the lake area in summer (August) and 89.5% in autumn (November) could reach the protective targets (TN < 1.0 mg/L) under 50% reduction of inflow TN loads. Meanwhile, 58.7% of the lake area in summer and 63.1% in autumn could reach the protective targets (TP < 0.05 mg/L) under 50% reduction of aquaculture areas. The mass budget results of TN and TP showed that TP immobilisation was larger than TN immobilisation. The immobilisations for TN and TP from July to September were higher than those of other months under the combined impacts of increasing runoff during the wet period, phytoplankton bloom and water residence time. The 2D water quality model provided a relevant example for assessing the effects of runoff and aquaculture activities and served as scientific support for lake management to improve water quality in large shallow macrophytic lakes.

Impact of legacy soil phosphorus on losses in drainage and overland flow from grazed grassland soils	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Rates and quantities of legacy soil phosphorus (P) lost from agricultural soils, and the timescales for positive change to water quality, remain unclear. From 2000 to 2004 five 0.2 ha grazed grassland plots located on a drumlin hillslope in Northern Ireland, received chemical fertiliser applications of 0, 10, 20, 40, 80 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1) resulting in soil Olsen P concentrations of 19, 24, 28, 38 and 67 mg P L-1, respectively, after which applications ceased. Soil Olsen P and losses to overland flow and drainage were monitored from 2005 to 2011 on an event and weekly flow proportional basis, respectively. Soluble reactive P and total P time series were synchronised with daily rainfall and modelled soil moisture deficits. From 2005 to 2011 soil Olsen P decline was proportional to soil P status with a 43% reduction in the plot at 67 mg P L-1 in 2004 and a corresponding 12% reduction in the plot with lowest soil P. However, there was no significant difference in the flow-weighted mean concentration for overland flow among plots, all of which exceeded 0.035 mg L-1 in >98% of events. Strong interannual and event variations in losses were observed with up to 65% of P being lost during a single rainfall event. P concentrations in drainage flow were independent of Olsen P and drain efficiency was potentially the primary control on concentrations, with the highest concentrations recorded in the plot at 38 mg L-1 Olsen P in 2004 (up to 2.72 mg L-1). Hydrological drivers, particularly antecedent soil moisture, had a strong influence on P loss in both overland and drainage flow, with higher concentrations recorded above a soil moisture deficit threshold of 7 mm. This study demonstrates that on some soil types, legacy P poses a significant long term threat to water quality, even at agronomically optimum soil P levels. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Jarvie, HP; King, SM; Neal, C				Jarvie, Helen P.; King, Stephen M.; Neal, Colin			Inorganic carbon dominates total dissolved carbon concentrations and fluxes in British rivers: Application of the THINCARB model - Thermodynamic modelling of inorganic carbon in freshwaters	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												River water-quality studies rarely measure dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) routinely, and there is a gap in our knowledge of the contributions of DIC to aquatic carbon fluxes and cycling processes. Here, we present the THINCARB model (THermodynamic modelling of INorganic CARBon), which uses widely-measured determinands (pH, alkalinity and temperature) to calculate DIC concentrations, speciation (bicarbonate, HCO3-; carbonate, CO32-; and dissolved carbon dioxide, H2CO3*) and excess partial pressures of carbon dioxide (EpCO(2)) in freshwaters. If calcium concentration measurements are available, THINCARB also calculates calcite saturation. THINCARB was applied to the 39-year Harmonised Monitoring Scheme (HMS) dataset, encompassing all the major British rivers discharging to the coastal zone. Model outputs were combined with the HMS dissolved organic carbon (DOC) datasets, and with spatial land use, geology, digital elevation and hydrological datasets. We provide a first national-scale evaluation of: the spatial and temporal variability in DIC concentrations and fluxes in British rivers; the contributions of DIC and DOC to total dissolved carbon (TDC); and the contributions to DIC from HCO3- and CO32- from weathering sources and H2CO3* from microbial respiration. DIC accounted for >50% of TDC concentrations in 87% of the HMS samples. In the seven largest British rivers, DIC accounted for an average of 80% of the TDC flux (ranging from 57% in the upland River Tay, to 91% in the lowland River Thames). DIC fluxes exceeded DOC fluxes, even under high-flowconditions, including in the Rivers Tay and Tweed, draining upland peaty catchments. Given that particulate organic carbon fluxes from UK rivers are consistently lower than DOC fluxes, DIC fluxes are therefore also the major source of total carbon fluxes to the coastal zone. These results demonstrate the importance of accounting for DIC concentrations and fluxes for quantifying carbon transfers from land, via rivers, to the coastal zone. (C) 2016 The Authors.

However, there were scarcely reports on whether existing agrochemicals such as herbicides have potential effects on Microcystis aeruginosa (M. aeruginosa) which may form large surface blooms. In this study, we aimed to demonstrate the effects of glufosinate, a widely use herbicide in the world, on the growth of M. aeruginosa. The change of the content of intracellular (intra-) and extracellular (extra-) levels of microcystin-LR (MC-LR) were also determined by HPLC. The mRNA level of mcyA, mcyD, mcyH related to the production of MC-LR was detected after 48 h exposure to glufosinate. Our results revealed that low concentrations of glufosinate exposure (0.5 mg/L, 1 mg/L) would promote the growth of M. aeruginosa. It was worth noting intra-MC-LR contents of algal cells were also significantly increased at low concentrations of glufosinate exposure (1 mg/L). While at high concentrations (5 mg/L, 10 mg/L), glufosinate could induce the MDA level and inhibit the growth of M. aeruginosa that would limit the production of MC-LR to the water body. At last, the transcription levels of algae toxin synthesis related genes mcyA and mcyD were increased significantly at environmentally relevant concentrations of glufosinate, which may affect the MC production. This study not only illuminated effects of glufosinate on growth of and MC-LR synthesis of M. aeruginosa at environmentally relevant concentrations, but also reminding us the potential risk caused by herbicide use should arouse concerns.

Using in-situ optical sensors to study dissolved organic carbon dynamics of streams and watersheds: A review	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												It is important to understand how dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is processed and transported through stream networks because DOC is a master water quality variable in aquatic ecosystems. High-frequency sampling is necessary to capture important, rapid shifts in DOC source, concentration, and composition (i.e. quality) in streams. Until recently, this high-frequency sampling was logistically difficult or impossible. However, this type of sampling can now be conducted using in-situ optical measurements through long-term, field-deployable fluorometers and spectrophotometers. The optical data collected from these instruments can quantify both DOC concentration and composition properties (e.g., specific ultra-violet absorbance at 254 nm, spectral slope ratio, and fluorescence index). Previously, the use of these sensors was limited to a small number of specialized users, mainly in Europe and North America, where they were used predominantly in marine DOC studies as well as water treatment and management infrastructure. However, recent field demonstrations across a wide range of river systems reveals a large potential for the use of these instruments in freshwater environments, heightening interest and demand across multiple environmental research and management disciplines. Hence, this review provides an up-to-date synthesis on 1) the use of spectroscopy as a diagnostic tool in stream DOC studies, 2) the instrumentation, its applications, potential limitations and future considerations, and 3) the new watershed DOC research directions made possible via these in-situ optical sensors.

J	Arauzo, M				Arauzo, Mercedes			Vulnerability of groundwater resources to nitrate pollution: A simple and effective procedure for delimiting Nitrate Vulnerable Zones	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												This research was undertaken to further our understanding of the factors involved in nonpoint-source nitrate pollution of groundwater. The shortcomings of some of the most commonly used methods for assessing groundwater vulnerability have been analysed and a new procedure that incorporates key improvements has been proposed. The new approach (LU-IV procedure) allows us to assess and map groundwater vulnerability to nitrate pollution and to accurately delimit the Nitrate Vulnerable Zones. The LU-IV procedure proved more accurate than the most widely used methods to assess groundwater vulnerability (DRASTIC, GOD), when compared with nitrate distribution in the groundwater of 46 aquifers included in the study (using the drainage basin as the unit of analysis). The proposed procedure stands out by meeting the following requirements: (1) it uses readily available parameters that provide enough data to feed the model, (2) it excludes redundant parameters, (3) it avoids the need to assign insufficiently contrasted weights to parameters, (4) it assess the whole catchment area that potentially drains N-polluted waters into the receptor aquifer, (5) it can be implemented within a GIS, and (6) it provides a multi-scale representation. As the LU-IV procedure has been demonstrated to be a reliable tool for delimiting NVZ, it could be particularly interesting to use it in countries where certain types of environmental data are either not available or have only limited availability. Based on this study (and according to the LU-IV procedure), it was concluded that an area of at least 1728 km(2) should be considered as NVZ. This sharply contrasts with the current 328 km2 officially designated in the study area by the Spain's regional administrations. These results highlight the need to redefine the current NVZ designation, which is essential for an appropriate implementation of action programmes designed to restore water quality in line with Directive 91/676/EEC.

Addition of calcium nitrate to sediment has been applied to control the release of phosphorus from sediments. In this study, laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of water quality improvement on the remediation of river sediment with the addition of calcium nitrate. The results demonstrated that the redox-potential of sediments increased from -282 mV to -130 mV after 28 days of calcium nitrate treatment. The acid volatile sulphide in the sediments significantly decreased (by 54.9% to 57.1%), whereas the total organic carbon decreased by 9.7% to 10.2%. However, the difference between these and water quality improvement was not significant. Due to the addition of calcium nitrate, low phosphate concentration in the water column and interstitial phosphate in the sediment were observed, indicating that the calcium nitrate was beneficial to controlling the release of phosphorus from river sediment. The decrease in phosphorus release could be attributed to the fixation of iron-phosphorus and calcium-phosphorus due to the addition of calcium nitrate. The addition of calcium nitrate to sediment caused the oxidation of sulphide to sulphate, hence resulting in high nitrate and sulphate concentrations in the water column, and high interstitial nitrate and sulphate concentrations in the sediment. The results also showed that only the water quality improvement had a significant effect on the interstitial nitrate and sulphate concentrations in the sediment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we investigated the effects of drought-induced drawdown on the water quality of the Zhoucun Reservoir, Shandong Province, East China, during the fall overturn. Field surveys were conducted during stratification (April-November) over three standard years 2012, 2013, and 2014, and over the El Nino event of 2015. Temporal and vertical variations of the physical and chemical indexes were investigated during monitoring. Results show that after the formation of stratification, the hypolimnion rapidly shifted to anaerobic conditions, with the accumulation of pollutants such as manganese (Mn) and total phosphorous (TP). Due to the extreme El Nino event in 2015, both the upper and lower metalimnion limits moved down along with the water level in summer, which resulted in the transfer of hypolimnion water to the metalimnion. In summer 2015, large amounts of pollutants were measured in the metalimnion: a phenomenon that did not occur at the same period of the standard years. At the beginning of the overturn in 2015, the water quality of the whole reservoir deteriorated when the metalimnion water shifted to the epilimnion. Mn and TP concentrations in the epilimnion reached 0.202 mg/L and 0.086 mg/L, respectively, which are significantly higher than those in the standard years. Although the tributary rivers entered the epilimnion of the reservoir during the overturn, Mn and TP concentrations of the inflow were only of 0.049-0.072 mg/L and 0.033-0.047 mg/L, respectively, indicating that these rivers were not the source of the high TP and high Mn concentrations in the epilimnion. Hence, we conclude that more attention should be paid to the metalimnion position and the vertical distribution of pollutants when studying lakes and reservoirs experiencing droughts.

Based on a case study of the Louros watershed in Greece, this work identifies database and modelling sources of false positives and negatives and proposes a decision making process aimed at minimizing the possibility of committing such errors. The baseline is well simulated and shows that the Louro's watershed falls behind a Good Environmental Status, at least marginally. Simulated mitigation measures show that the river's status can be upgraded to "Good", at least as concerns nitrates and ammonium. Simulated climate change does not seem to exert an important positive or negative effect. Land use changes forecasting considerably less cultivated area have a significant effect on Total Phosphorous but not on nitrates or ammonium concentrations. The non-linearity between nutrient disposition (inputs) and nutrient concentration in downstream water bodies (output) and the many factors that affect the nutrient disposition-transportation-concentration chain, highlights the importance of simulating the effects of mitigation actions and of future climate and land use changes before adopting and establishing agri-environmental measures.

Their monitoring, management, and protection requirements differ from reservoirs situated in non-urbanized areas. The objectives of this study were: (a) to determine the concentrations of select pesticides and emerging pollutants (EPs) present in an urban reservoir; (b) to describe their possible spatial distributions; and (c) to quantify the risks for aquatic life and safeguard drinking water supplies. For this purpose, the Guarapiranga reservoir was studied as an example of a multi-stressed urban reservoir in a tropical region. A total of 31 organic compounds (including pesticides, illicit drugs, pharmaceuticals, and endocrine disruptors) were analyzed twice over a period of one year, together with classical indicators of water quality. The physical and chemical data were treated using principal component analysis (PCA) to identify possible temporal or spatial patterns. Risk assessment was performed for biota and drinking water use, comparing maximum environmental concentrations (MECs) with the predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs) or drinking water quality criteria (DWC), respectively. The results demonstrated the presence of pesticides and EPs, as well as pollution by high levels of nutrients and Chlorophyll a (Chl. a), during the study period. The nutrients and Trophic State Index (TSI) showed gradients in the reservoir and regional distributions, while the pesticides and EPs only clearly showed this pattern in the dry season. The concentrations and distributions of the pesticides and EPs therefore showed seasonality. These findings suggested that the two groups of pollutants (EPs+ pesticides and nutrients) possessed different sources and behavior and were not always correlated in the reservoir studied. In the studied period, no risk was observed in raw water for drinking water use, but carbendazim, imidacloprid, and BPA showed risks for the biota in the reservoir. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A full-preference ranking analysis for the value of sustainable river basin management	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												In this paper we develop a full-preference ranking Choice Experiment (CE) designed to investigate how respondents evaluate a set of proposed improvements towards sustainable river basin management, as per the prescriptions of the European Union-Water Framework Directive (2000). The CE is applied in the Asopos River Basin (ARB) in Greece. Our interest is to test whether residency in the river basin, or otherwise, affects the preferences of the relevant agents. We first estimate a rank-ordered logistic regression based on a full set of choices in order to calculate the willingness to pay (WTP) of respondents for each one of the three attributes considered in the CE (i.e., environmental conditions, impact on the local economy and changes in the potential uses of water). The model is initially estimated for the full sample and then re-estimated twice for two sub-samples: the first one only includes the residents of Athens and the second only includes the residents of Asopos. Afterwards, we examine the effect of various demographic and socio-economic factors (such as income, gender, age, employment and education) on the estimates of our model in order to reveal any differences among respondents with different characteristics, mainly focusing on whether they reside or have personal experience of the RB under valuation. Thus, our analysis simultaneously provides a robustness check on previous findings in the literature and additional information about how various demographic and socio-economic characteristics affect the evaluation of the selected attributes.

The average of free Cl concentration in the period under analysis showed some heterogeneity per floor, varying between 0.84 and 1.25 mg/L. In addition, there was a rise in proportion of samples that exceeded WHO guidelines (free Cl >= 0.5 mg/L), particularly in the last two years of the same period. With respect to microbial analysis, 22.4% of the samples were positive for Legionella spp., 6.4% for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 15% and 30.4% for aerobic plate counts at 36 and 22 degrees C, respectively. The proportion of positive samples decreased throughout the period under analysis, in particular for Legionella spp. (41.7% in 2010 vs. non-detectable in 2013) and P. aeruginosa (10.8% in 2010 vs. 3.3% in 2013). These results are in accordance with the gradual rise in free Cl concentration (0.78 +/- 0.94 mg/L in 2010 vs. 1.16 +/- 0.51 mg/L in 2013). In conclusion, a suitable plan for drinking water quality was instituted which resulted in reducing microbiological growth in the waterwork network, improving public health protection. However, the detection of critical points associated with lower levels of free Cl were found on certain floors/points-of-use, requiring the need to improve the monitoring water treatment system and/or implementation of additional technologies.

J	Andreopoulos, D; Damigos, D				Andreopoulos, Dimitrios; Damigos, Dimitrios			To transfer or not to transfer? Evidence from validity and reliability tests for international transfers of non-market adaptation benefits in river basins	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The attempt to design cost-effective adaptation policies incorporating non-market values to inhibit climate change impacts on water resources may increase the interest in applying the Benefit Transfer method. Benefit Transfer is a practical way to consider non-market values using functions and estimates acquired through primary valuation methods from other sites. Among the primary methods, Choice Experiments appear to particularly accommodate Benefit Transfer. Nevertheless, validity and reliability of international value transfers obtained from Choice Experiments have not been adequately examined. To this end, two identical Choice Experiments were conducted in Greece and Italy in the context of river services adaptation, testing validity and reliability of Benefit Transfer. The application of validity and reliability tests for different types of transfers is supportive for the use of Benefit Transfer, at least for the value transfer types. In particular the reliability of value transfer was higher when income adjustments were taken into account. Overall, Benefit Transfer can be attentively considered to evaluate cost-effective adaptation policies across countries experiencing similar climate change trends. The latter gains more importance given that an international Benefit Transfer setting as regards the non-market benefits of adaptation to climate change for river services is absent in the relevant literature.

Metal concentrations (except Cu, Mn, Ni, and Zn) in Bangshi River water were above the drinking water quality guidelines, while in groundwater were less than the recommended limits. Concentration of metals in surface water decreased as a function of distance. Estimations of non-carcinogenic health risk for surface water revealed that mean hazard index (HI) values of As, Cr, Cu, and Pb for combined pathways (i.e., ingestion and dermal contact) were >1.0 for both age groups. The estimated risk mainly came from the ingestion pathway. However, the HI values for all the examined metals in groundwater were <1.0, indicating no possible human health hazard. Deterministically estimated total cancer risk (TCR) via Bangshi River water exceeded the acceptable limit of 1 x 10(-4) for adult and children. Although, probabilistically estimated 95th percentile values of TCR exceeded the benchmark, mean TCR values were less than 1 x 10(-4). Simulated results showed that 20.13% and 5.43% values of TCR for surface water were >1 x 10(-4) for adult and children, respectively. Deterministic and probabilistic estimations of cancer risk through exposure to groundwater were well below the safety limit. Overall, the population exposed to Bangshi River water remained at carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic health threat and the risk was higher for adults. Sensitivity analysis identified exposure duration (ED) and ingestion rate (IR) of water as the most relevant variables affecting the probabilistic risk estimation model outcome.

Effects of multiple stresses hydropower, acid deposition and climate change on water chemistry and salmon populations in the River Otra, Norway	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Many surface waters in Europe suffer from the adverse effects of multiple stresses. The Otra River, southernmost Norway, is impacted by acid deposition, hydropower development and increasingly by climate change. The river holds a unique population of land-locked salmon and anadromous salmon in the lower reaches. Both populations have been severely affected by acidification. The decrease in acid deposition since the 1980s has led to partial recovery of both populations. Climate change with higher temperatures and altered precipitation can potentially further impact fish populations. We used a linked set of process-oriented models to simulate future climate, discharge, and water chemistry at five sub-catchments in the Otra river basin. Projections to year 2100 indicate that future climate change will give a small but measureable improvement in water quality, but that additional reductions in acid deposition are needed to promote full restoration of the fish communities. These results can help guide management decisions to sustain key salmon habitats and carry out effective long-term mitigation strategies such as liming. The Otra River is typical of many rivers in Europe in that it fails to achieve the good ecological status target of the EU Water Framework Directive. The programme of measures needed in the river basin management plan necessarily must consider the multiple stressors of acid deposition, hydropower, and climate change. This is difficult, however, as the synergistic and antagonistic effects are complex and challenging to address with modelling tools currently available. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Based on the increasing international interest in the contamination of water resources by genotoxic compounds, the present study aimed to evaluate the genotoxic potential of surface water samples collected from the five (5) lakes (Amvrakia, Lysimachia, Ozeros, Trichonida, Kastraki) located in Aitoloakarnania regional unit (Western Greece). The genotoxic potential of surface water samples was evaluated by employing the Cytokinesis Block MicroNucleus (CBMN) assay in cultured human lymphocytes. In the former assay, lymphocytes were treated with 1,2 and 5% (v/v) of surface water from each lake. Statistically significant differences (1.7 to 33 fold increase in MN frequencies vs. the control) were seen at the dose of 5% (v/v) in all studied lakes. At the dose of 2% (v/v) statistically significant differences (1.7 to 2.6 fold increase in MN frequencies vs. the control) were observed in all studied lakes except Trichonida lake. Finally, at the dose of 1% (v/v) statistically significant differences (2.3 and 2.5 fold increase in MN frequencies vs. the control) were observed in the Ozeros and Lysimachia lakes. The evaluation of the potential genotoxic effects and the analysis of the physicochemical parameters of lakes' surface water samples is a first step in our effort to evaluate the water quality, in terms of the presence and environmental/human risk of genotoxicants in the studied lake ecosystems. The present study showed for the first time the presence of genotoxic substances in surface waters of the studied lakes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Kondash, AJ; Albright, E; Vengosh, A				Kondash, Andrew J.; Albright, Elizabeth; Vengosh, Avner			Quantity of flowback and produced waters from unconventional oil and gas exploration	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The management and disposal of flowback and produced waters (FP water) is one of the greatest challenges associated with unconventional oil and gas development. The development and production of unconventional natural gas and oil is projected to increase in the coming years, and a better understanding of the volume and quality of FP water is crucial for the safe management of the associated wastewater. We analyzed production data using multiple statistical methods to estimate the total FP water generated per well from six of the major unconventional oil and gas formations in the United States. The estimated median volume ranges from 1.7 to 143 million L (0.5 to 3.8 million gal) of FP per well over the first 5-10 years of production. Using temporal volume production and water quality data, we show a rapid increase of the salinity associated with a decrease of FP production rates during the first months of unconventional oil and gas production. Based on mass-balance calculations, we estimate that only 4-8% of FP water is composed of returned hydraulic fracturing fluids, while the remaining 92-96% of FP water is derived from naturally occurring formation brines that is extracted together with oil and gas. The salinity and chemical composition of the formation brines are therefore the main limiting factors for beneficial reuse of unconventional oil and gas wastewater. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Combined in situ effects of metals and nutrients on marine biofilms: Shifts in the diatom assemblage structure and biological traits	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The effects of multiple stressors on marine diatom assemblages are still poorly understood. The interactive effects of metals and nutrients were assessed in two coastal biofilms grown at a reference site and a historically contaminated site. The biofilms were exposed in situ to pulse exposures of metals (Zn and Pb) and nutrients (N and P) individually and in combination to mimic patterns of discharge in the study area. The reference community's structure (composition and abundance of taxa) was modified after metals and/or nutrients exposure, but each stressor acted in different way. Irrespective of the stressors or scenario, the abundance of the dominant species Opephora krumbeinii declined, and it is proposed as sensitive species. Nutrient supply favoured the proliferation of certain species with high nutrient tolerances (Fragilaria famelica, Tabularia ktenoeides), whereas metals promoted the colonisation of metal-tolerant species, e.g., Berkeleya fennica, Opephora marina. Simultaneous exposure induced an amplification of levels of accumulated metals, chlorophyll a and EPS contents and triggered the succession of species towards tolerant species with specific growth. Metals seemed to act as a selective factor of metal-tolerant species, and nutrients favoured the proliferation of those species forming zig-zag colonies (Neosynedra provincial's), mucous tubes (Berkeleya spp.) and motile diatoms (Navicula salinicola, Nitzschia incognita), resulting in biofilms with a more complex architecture. The diatom communities from the historically contaminated site were more resistant to pulse exposure, but metals or nutrients loads induced overproduction of mucilage. We propose that growth forms may complement taxonomic approaches and provide a quick and easy way to detect community changes related to metal and nutrient pollution. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Bradford; Kenney, Melanie; Warren, Barbara; Louisos, Jeremy			Multi-faceted monitoring of estuarine turbidity and particulate matter provenance: Case study from Salem Harbor, USA	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Turbidity is a water quality parameter that is known to adversely affect aquatic systems, however the causes of turbid water are often elusive. We present results of a study designed to constrain the source of particulate matter in a coastal embayment that has suffered from increased turbidity over past decades. Our approach utilized monitoring buoys to quantify turbidity at high temporal resolution complemented by geochemical isotope analysis of suspended sediment samples and meteorological data. Results reveal a complex system in which multiple sources are associated with particulate matter. Weight of evidence demonstrates that phytoplankton productivity in the water column, however, is the dominant source of particulate matter associated with elevated turbidity in Salem Harbor, Massachusetts. Allochthonous matter from the watershed was observed to mix into the pool of suspended particulate matter near river mouths, especially in spring and summer. Resuspension of harbor surface sediments likely provides additional particulates in the regions of boat moorings, especially during summer when recreational boats are attached to moorings. Our approach allows us to constrain the causes of turbidity events in this embayment, is helping with conservation efforts of environmental quality in the region, and can be used as a template for other locations.

Freshwater mussels in an urban watershed: Impacts of anthropogenic inputs and habitat alterations on populations	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The substantial increase in urbanization worldwide has resulted in higher emissions of wastewater to riverine systems near urban centers, which often impairs aquatic populations and communities. This study examined the effect of urbanization on freshwater mussel populations, including Species at Risk in two rivers receiving wastewater. The influence of anthropogenic activities was assessed in a watershed in the Laurentian Great Lakes basin, one that historically supported one of the most diverse mussel faunas in Canada. In the Grand River (ON), four sites along a 60 km reach spanning from an upstream reference site to an urban-impacted downstream area were examined. In the Speed River, mussel populations at six sites along a 10 km reach, selected to bracket specific anthropogenic inputs and structures were assessed. A semi-quantitative visual search method revealed that catch per unit effort in the Grand River declined by >60% from the upstream reference site to the area downstream of an urban center. The size (length) frequency distribution of the most abundant species, Lasmigona costata, was significantly (p <= 0.008) different upstream of the majority of urban inputs (45130 mm) compared to downstream of the cities (85-115 mm). In the Speed River, impoundments and wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) reduced both the diversity and catch per effort. Most striking were 84 and 95% changes in the number of mussels found on either side of two impoundments, and a 98% drop in mussels immediately downstream of a VVWTP outfall. These population level effects of decreased abundance and underrepresentation of smaller mussels downstream of the urban area correspond to previously documented impacts at the biochemical and whole organism level of biological organization in wild mussels at this location. Our results demonstrate that poor water quality and physical barriers in urban environments continue to impair susceptible populations and communities of aquatic animals.

The intensive agricultural activity in Chtouka basin requires the mobilization of 94% of fresh water resources for irrigation. This overexploitation, along with the succession of drought years, sea water intrusion and various sources of pollution, affected the quality and availability of groundwater resources. Several sampling campaigns were carried out in different sites of the study area in order to investigate the spatial variation of groundwater quality. The temporal evolution of groundwater level shows that the water table was subjected to a gradual decline during the last decade, indicating an intensive exploitation mainly in irrigated areas. In the Southern part around Belfaa and the irrigated area along Massa River, nitrate concentrations exceed 50 mg/L, which is the threshold set by the World Health Organization, while in the northern part around Biougra and Ait Amira, the nitrate concentration is mostly below 50 mg/L indicating a relative good groundwater quality. This finding can be explained by the improvement of agricultural practices, particularly the conversion of flood and sprinkler irrigation to drip irrigation (80% of the total irrigated area) in most of the developed farms in this part of the study area. Moreover, the exploitation of groundwater from the deep aquifer, due to the increasing water demand in the region, can also explain the low chemical concentrations since the deep aquifer is not affected by anthropogenic pollutants or marine intrusion. Stable isotopes (O-18 and H-2) highlight the different origins of groundwater, indicating the complexity of the aquifer system path flows, which is attributable to the intensive exploitation and irrigation water return.

Monitoring, sources, receptors, and control measures for three European Union watch list substances of emerging concern in receiving waters - A 20 year systematic review	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Pollution of European receiving waters with contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), such as with 17-beta-estradiol (a natural estrogenic hormone, E2), along with pharmaceutically -active compounds diclofenac (an anti-inflammatory drug, DCL) and 17-alpha-ethynylestradiol (a synthetic estrogenic hormone, EE2)) is a ubiquitous phenomenon. These three CECs were added to the EU watch list of emerging substances to be monitoring in 2013, which was updated in 2015 to comprise 10 substances/groups of substances in the field of water policy. A systematic literature review was conducted of 3952 potentially relevant articles over period 1995 to 2015 that produced a new EU-wide database consisting of 1268 publications on DCL, E2 and EE2. European surface water concentrations of DCL are typically reported below the proposed annual average environmental quality standard (AA EQS) of 100 ng/l, but that exceedances frequently occur. E2 and EE2 surface water concentrations are typically below 50 ng/l and 10 ng/1 respectively, but these values greatly exceed the proposed AA EQS values for these compounds (0.04 and 0.035 ng/l respectively). However, levels of these CECs are frequently reported to be disproportionately high in EU receiving waters, particularly in effluents at control points that require urgent attention. Overall it was found that DCL and EE2 enter European aquatic environment mainly following human consumption and excretion of therapeutic drugs, and by incomplete removal from influent at urban wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). E2 is a natural hormone excreted by humans which also experiences incomplete removal during WWTPs treatment. Current conventional analytical chemistry methods are sufficiently sensitive for the detection and quantification of DCL but not for E2 and EE2, thus alternative, ultra-trace, time-integrated monitoring techniques such as passive sampling are needed to inform water quality for these estrogens. DCL appears resistant to conventional wastewater treatment while E2 and EE2 have high removal efficiencies that occur through biodegradation or sorption to organic matter. There is a pressing need to determine fate and behaviour of these CECs in European receiving waters such as using GIS-modelling of river basins as this will identify pressure points for informing priority decision making and alleviation strategies for upgrade of WWTPs and for hospital effluents with advanced treatment technologies. More monitoring data for these CECs in receiving waters is urgently needed for EU legislation and effective risk management. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Effect of past peat cultivation practices on present dynamics of dissolved organic carbon	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Peatlands are a major source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) for aquatic ecosystems. Naturally high DOC concentrations in peatlands may be increased further by drainage. For agricultural purposes, peat has frequently been mixed with sand, but the effect of this measure on the release and cycling of DOC has rarely been investigated. This study examined the effects of (i) mixing peat with sand and (ii) water table depth (WTD) on DOC concentrations at three grassland sites on shallow organic soils. The soil solution was sampled bi-weekly for two years with suction plates at 15, 30 and 60 cm depth. Selected samples were analysed for dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), delta C-13(Dom) and delta N-15(DOM.) Average DOC concentrations were surprisingly high, ranging from 161 to 192 mg 1(-1). There was no significant impact of soil organic carbon (SOC) content or WTD on mean DOC concentrations. At all sites, DOC concentrations were highest at the boundary between the SOC-rich horizon and the mineral subsoil. In contrast to the mean concentrations, the temporal patterns of DOC concentrations, their drivers and the properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) differed between peat-sand mixtures and peat. DOC concentrations responded to changes in environmental conditions, but only after a lag period of a few weeks. At the sites with a peat-sand mixture, temperature and therefore probably biological activity determined the DOC concentrations. At the peat site, the contribution of vegetation derived DOM was higher. The highest concentrations occurred during long, cool periods of waterlogging, suggesting a stronger physicochemical-based DOC mobilisation. Overall, these results indicate that mixing peat with sand does not improve water quality and.may result in DOC losses of around 200 kg DOC ha(-1) a(-1). (C) 2016 The Authors.

Estimating the contribution of nitrogen and phosphorus to waterbodies by colonial nesting waterbirds	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Fecal deposition by colonial nesting waterbirds is a potential source of nutrient enrichment and pollution of nearby waterways. Excess concentrations of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) can cause water quality concerns or impairment. We estimated concentrations of N and P deposited to waterbodies by birds nesting in four colonies in east-central Texas during 2011-2013, and developed an age-structured compartment model to estimate the amount of fecal N and P material deposited by birds during the entire breeding season. There was a seasonal variation in the accumulation of N and P in waterbodies where heronries were located with a significant increase from June to July at the peak of the breeding season. Also, there was a significant positive correlation in concentrations of N (P = 0.023) in fecal material and water samples from one of the colonies (Murphy Park), suggesting a significant contribution of N from feces to water. Concentrations of N in water near the colonies were also significantly correlated (P = 0.004, R-2 = 0.22) with the average amount of precipitation recorded for each region. The simulation model results indicated that total N and P deposition increased proportionally with heronry size, and daily deposition rates varied due to the shifting daily activity budgets of the birds as the breeding season progressed. The total estimated loads from the model reached a maximum of 2170 kg N and 240 kg P for a given colony, with daily deposition estimated at 22.8 kg N, and 2.5 kg P. Based on the model, one bird can release about 1 mg of N and 0.115 mg of P on a daily basis to the soil substrate or directly over water. Results from this study could be useful to estimate the contribution of N and P from wildlife to waterbodies, and for watershed management plans. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Bereskie, T; Haider, H; Rodriguez, MJ; Sadiq, R				Bereskie, Ty; Haider, Husnain; Rodriguez, Manuel J.; Sadiq, Rehan			Framework for continuous performance improvement in small drinking water systems	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Continuous performance improvement (CPI) can be a useful approach to overcome water quality problems impacting small communities. Small drinking water systems (SDWSs) struggle to meet regulatory requirements and often lack the economic and human resource flexibility for immediate improvement. A CPI framework is developed to provide SDWS managers and operators an approach to gauge their current performance against similar systems and to track performance improvement from the implementation of the new technologies or innovations into the future. The proposed CPI framework incorporates the use of a water quality index (WQI) and functional performance benchmarking to evaluate and compare drinking water quality performance of an individual water utility against that of a representative benchmark. The results are then used to identify and prioritize the most vulnerable water quality indicators and subsequently identify and prioritize performance improvement strategies. The proposed CPI framework has been demonstrated using data collected from SDWSs in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador (NL), Canada and using the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (COME) WQI.

In this study we proposed a strategy based on water level regulation for the control of odor-producing cyanobacteria in source water. Miyun Reservoir, the main surface water source for Beijing, has been suffering from 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB) induced T&O problems caused by deep-living Planktothrix sp. since 2002. The biomass of deep-living Planktothrix in Miyun Reservoir was found to be mainly governed by the water depth above its sediment habitat. An algorithm for water level regulation aiming to minimize the risk for T&O in different types of reservoirs is proposed. The study demonstrates that risk for T&O can be minimized by increasing the water level in Miyun Reservoir. The high-risk area can be reduced by about 2.91% (0.61% to 5.76%) of surface area for each meter increase in the water level, when the water level is lower than 145 m. More specifically, the water level needs to be raised to higher than 147.7 m a.s.l. from 131.0 m in order to obtain an acceptable risk level (ARL) of 10%. This management strategy to abate T&O problems is simpler and cheaper to implement compared to traditional physical, chemical and biological techniques. Moreover, it has no apparent negative impact on water quality and aquatic organisms.

New Zealand is addressing this issue by regulating land-based nutrient losses, with debates over how to allocate limits across a heterogeneous landscape. We develop a spatially explicit economic land use model to investigate efficiency and equity issues from seven approaches to allocate nutrient discharges across two New Zealand watersheds. We find that the preferred allocation differs across land use, land characteristics, and regulation stringency; and that there is no universal 'best' allocation option. Therefore, decision-makers should focus on, at least, efficiency and equity, and on how to compensate those most affected. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Acid mine drainage (AMD) occurs when sulfides are in contact with oxygen and water, and several parameters and mechanisms influence final drainage quality. Galvanic interactions influence the reactivity of sulfide minerals, which act as semi-conductors. These galvanic interactions have been insufficiently studied in the context of AMD generation. In this study, the influence of pyrite on the reactivity of sphalerite and chalcopyrite was investigated. Five blends, comprised of free grains of quartz/pyrite, quartz/chalcopyrite, quartz/sphalerite, quartz/pyrite/chalcopyrite, and quartz/pyrite/sphalerite, were subjected to geochemical testing. Five weathering cells were monitored over a 200-day period during which they were leached twice weekly. Leachates were analyzed for pH, Eh, electrical conductivity, and sulfate and metal concentrations. The results of these analyses showed that galvanic interactions occurred between free sulfide grains. Pyrite was galvanically protected over the full testing period in the quartz/pyrite/chalcopyrite blend, and partially protected in the quartz/pyrite/sphalerite blend. Moreover, the release of Cu from chalcopyrite and Zn, Mn, and Cd from sphalerite was accelerated. in the presence of pyrite. This work provides a better understanding of the influence of pyrite on chalcopyrite and sphalerite reactivity by highlighting the galvanic effects. In the future, to improve the reliability of AMD prediction tests, galvanic interactions should be considered in both the prediction of the acid generation potential and the estimation of metal and metalloid release rates.

Results showed the biofiltration process could effectively remove turbidity.(<0.1 NTU in all effluents) and NOM (>24% of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), >57% of UV254, and >44% of SUVA(254)), where the SA biofilters showed a strong capacity for turbidity removal, while the GAC contactors played the dominant role in NOM removal. The vertical profile of water quality in the GAC contactors indicated the middle-upper portion was the critical zone for the removal of NOM, where relatively higher adsorption and enhanced biological removal were afforded. Fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) analysis of NOM showed that the GAC contactors effectively decreased the content of humic-like component, while protein-like component was refractory for the biofiltration process. Nutrients (NH4-N and PO4-P) supplementation applied upstream of one of the two-stage biofiltration trains (called engineered biofiltration) stimulated the growth of microorganisms, and showed a modest effect on promoting the biological removal of small non-aromatic compositions in NOM. Redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated influent UV254 was the most explanatory water quality parameter for GAC contactors' treatment performance, and a high load of UV254 would result in significantly reduced removals of UV254 and SUVA(254).

Variability of disinfection by-products at a full-scale treatment plant following rainfall events	CHEMOSPHERE												The quality of drinking water sources can decrease when contaminants are transported by overland and subsurface flow and discharged into surface waters following rainfall events. Increases in organic contaminants such as road salts and organic matter may occur and potentially modify disinfection by-products (DBPs) concentration and speciation. This study investigated the effects of various spring rainfall events on the quality of treated waters at a large water treatment plant through the implementation of intensive water quality monitoring of raw, filtered and treated waters during different rainfall events. DBPs (four trihalomethanes and six haloacetic acids) and their explanatory variables (pH, turbidity, water temperature, specific ultraviolet absorbance, total and dissolved organic carbon, bromide and chlorine dose) were measured during four rainfall events. The results showed that water quality degrades during and following rainfall, leading to small increases in trihalomethans (THM4) and haloacetic acids (HAA6) in treated waters. While THM4 and HAA6 levels remained low during the pre-rainfall period (<9 mu g/L) for the four sampling campaigns, small increases in THM4 and HAA6 during and after spring rainfall events were observed. During the rainfall and post-rainfall periods, concentration peaks corresponding to 3-fold and 2-fold increases (respectively 27.5 mu g/L for THM4 and 12.6 mu g/L. for HAA6) compared to pre-rainfall levels were also measured. A slight decrease in harmful brominated THM and HAA proportion was also observed following rainfall events. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
