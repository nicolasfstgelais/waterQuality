Considering the frequent use of automated water quality monitoring systems, their importance in generating data and information for the efficient management of water treatment plants, the design of such an index would allow the detection of point-pollution episodes, which otherwise would occur undetected and would have a significant impact on the water quality and its further treatment. In this study, a versatile weighted water quality index is presented. The proposed index is validated by using historical data recorded by the on-line monitoring system at the intake from Prut River during the period February - December 2012. The parameters selected for evaluation were: pH, temperature, turbidity, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, nitrates and total organic carbon. The weighted index is compared with the well-known Canadian water quality index. For the period under study, the scores for both indexes resulted in class IV of quality, corresponding to a medium water quality. The sensitivity analysis indicates a higher accuracy of the weighted index model as compared to the Canadian index model. The proposed index may be used as a communication tool for water quality towards the general public and various other water stakeholders, and as an operational control instrument for comparing water quality to diverse uses requirements (drinking water use in this study).

At European level, several directives were implemented, with the purpose of regulating the degree of pollution for water sources. Both surface and underground water resources in Romania are being affected by pollutants, such as nitrites, phosphorus, generated through irrational usage of chemical fertilizers, but also through the discharge of urban waste water directly into river courses. The spatiotemporal analysis of water quality in North-Eastern Romania, for Suceava, Ozana and Tazlau drainage basins, was based, in the current study, on the water quality index that has been applied (WQI), and also the variation rate of water quality (R). The results have pointed out the fact that there are no substantial differences concerning water quality, on a North-South direction, but a decrease in the values of these parameters can be observed from upstream, to downstream, for each basin. WQI is associated with a Good Water Quality class, for Suceava river basin (with a value of 39.78), and also for Tazlau basin (with a value of 33.31), but Ozana basin has a value of 16.09, being associated with an Excellent Water Quality class. The results generated by the calculation of the water quality variation rate have emphasized the fact that 57% of the analyzed parameters reveal a worsening tendency, in Suceava and Tazlau drainage basins, while Ozana basin has a value of only 28%.

The final results classify the water quality of the Siret River in Pascani town area as "medium" to "good" (i.e. calculated standard water quality indices-WQI, varying between 63.20 to 72.62 in 2013, and between 53.92 to 76.54 in 2014). The evaluation score (ES) for water quality corresponded to values between 6.28 to 6.57 in 2013, and 5.69 to 6.88 in 2014. The real pollution status of the Siret River is estimated by the global pollution index (I*(GP)), giving values in the range of 2.32 - 2.53 (2013), or 2.11 - 3.09 (2014), which indicate "an aquatic environment modified by domestic and urban wastewater treatment activities, generating discomfort effects for different life forms (especially, daphnia) or human health". It is recommended that continuous monitoring of the Siret River water quality to be undertaken, and the implementation of preventive control and remediation actions (periodic cleaning/sanitation services) in order to perform at least `good' water quality until 2015-2018, at all strategic control sections. Overall, the water quality of the Siret River in Pascani town area was found as improving, and the standard European quality classification target of "good" was partially attained in some control sections in winter season of 2013-2014.

It is a shallow lake with an average depth of 3m and average extent of 1.32 km(2), having a particular importance for the area in which is situated. This importance derives from its main functions in the ecosystem, namely: source of food, shelter and breeding place for almost 54 bird, balneary tourism attraction and jobs for the residents of Amara who live in the northern part of the lake. Under these conditions, the sustainable development of this area is required, and this can be attained by proposing and implementing practices which will protect and harmonize the area from economic, social and ecological point of view. In this study, a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis of Amara Lake ecosystem was performed in order to found the most adequate management solution, whose implementation would allow the sustainable development of area. The proposed management solution considers the forestation of southern shore of the lake with Acer campestre tree species. The effects of this solution on Amara Lake ecosystem were evaluated by monitoring three water quality indicators (total nitrogen, total phosphorus and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5)) during of six years (2010- 2015). These indicators are strictly related to the eutrophication process of lake water, and their variations during the monitoring period indicated that the forestation of southern shore of the lake can be considered a viable management solution.																	1582-9596	1843-3707				MAR	2017	16	3					625	631										WOS:000403508600014

The surface water and groundwater samples were collected quarterly in two time periods: January 2012 - June 2013, when the landfill was operational and July 2013 - December 2014, after the landfill was closed. The parameters analyzed in this study include: pH, biological oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (COD), NH4+ Cl-, NO2-, NO3-, SO42-, heavy metals (Cd, Pb, Hg, Cr, Cu, Ni). In the case of surface water, for both investigated periods, the only parameter that exceeds the maximum allowable limit is the chemical oxygen demand with a maximum value of 235 mg O-2/L. The high values of the COD indicator may be attributed to the contamination of the surface water with persistent organic pollutants from landfill leachate. The results recorded in the case of groundwater show that the maximum allowable limits for parameters BOD5, COD, NH4+, Cl-, NO2- are exceeded for both investigated periods. All the mean concentrations of heavy metals for the two periods investigated showed values that exceed the maximum allowable limits, except Pb (3.5-6.67 mu g/L) and Hg (n.d.) which were below the limits. Analyzing the results, it can be noticed that the landfill affected the groundwater and the surface water quality, both during the period when it was in use, and after its closure. It represents a risk to human health due to the contaminants that seep into the groundwater, given the proximity of the landfill to the inhabited area (about 200 m). Since this landfill is a source of contamination even after being closed, it is necessary to neutralize it and to monitor the surface and groundwater quality indicators periodically.

When water is loaded with various chemicals due to erosion, corrosion and human activities, the pollution phenomenon appears, causing harmfull effects over plant and animal organisms. The presence in water of substances derived from agriculture or mismanagement of manure organic obtained from various species of domestic animals affects the environmental quality and human health through the development of different types of diseases of the digestive system, circulatory etc. This made all the administrative units in the study area to be declared as vulnerable to pollution by nitrates from agricultural sources. This study was conducted in the drainage basin of Geru River in Galati County and was focused on three periods (2011, 2012, 2013) for calculation of livestock and production of waste and nutrients sewage and in three periods (July 2012, July 2013, November 2013) for the monitoring of water quality. The results revealed that the production of nutrients does not generate a high pressure over land, but point pollution affected the aquifer on an extended area. Therefore, groundwater could have poor quality and it is not recommended for drinking in the villages where nitrate levels are very high. Our study showed that organic manure production was not large enough to put high pressure on agricultural land, but causes the increase in the amount of nitrate in the groundwater, as a result of manure mismanagement.																	1582-9596	1843-3707				MAR	2017	16	3					653	668										WOS:000403508600017

Water Quality and Mangrove-Derived Tannins in Four Coastal Lagoons from the Gulf of Mexico with Variable Hydrologic Dynamics	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												This study explored the spatial variability of physico-chemical water variables e., salinity, nitrogen, phosphorus and tannins) in contrasting seasons in four coastal lagoons (Chica y Grande, La Mancha, Sontecomapan and El Ostion) along Veracruz state, Mexico. We also calculated the mangrove and central basin water areas and associated them to physico-chemical data to analyze them by means of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) due to high correlation among variables. Finally, we elaborated coded maps of each lagoon to represent the gradients of the variables with statistically significant loadings in either of the first two components accounting for 50 to 70% of total data variability.. In La Mancha, NH4, NO3 and RP but not salinity were associated with river outflows. In Grande and Chica, NH4, NO3 and RP were higher near the lagoon inlet, but the major river outflows was also in that area, confounding their actual source. Finally, NO3 were strongly associated with river outflows in Sontecomapan and El Ostion. However, the concentrations of tannins were directly associated with mangrove cover in the four lagoons. Our results indicate that the connection with the sea, the position of the inflowing rivers, and the morphology of the lagoon provides the "estuarine signature" of each lagoon.

It is important to revert this tendency and promote medium term studies that can help to foresee the unwanted effects, sometimes irreversible, of human activities on the environment. This paper includes results from hydrodynamic and water quality studies carried out in Petacalco Bay, Guerrero (Mexican Pacific) in order to present elements for future appropriate management of industrial outflows in the region. Around this bay theft are important rivers and small villages, a major port, chemical and thermoelectric plants, all discharging their (generally untreated) effluents directly into the sea. The results of this study show that the overall water quality is similar to natural concentrations found in the ocean. Nevertheless, eutrophization was found, associated with the fertilizer industry, and the hot water discharge from the thermoelectric plant generates hot plumes, which dissipate in the environment, despite the intense and variable hydrodynamic characteristics of the region.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				SPR	2017					77		39	50		10.2112/SI77-005.1								WOS:000403526200005						
J	Tokatli, C				Tokatli, Cem			Bioecological and statistical risk assessment of toxic metals in sediments of a worldwide important wetland: Gala Lake National Park (Turkey)	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION												Gala Lake National Park that has an international importance is one of the most important wetland ecosystems for Turkey. As same as many aquatic habitats, Gala Lake is under a significant anthropogenic pressure originated from agricultural activities conducted around the lake and from industrial discharges by means of Ergene River. The aim of this study was to evaluate the sediment quality of Gala Lake and Irrigation Canal by investigating some toxic element accumulations (As, B, Ni, Cr, Pb, Cd, Zn and Cu) from a statistical perspective. Pearson Correlation Index (PCI) and Factor Analysis (FA) were applied to detected data in order to determine the associated contaminants and effective factors on the system. Potential Ecological Risk Index (R-I) and Biological Risk Index based sediment quality guidelines (mERM-Q) applied to detected data in order to assess the ecological and biological risks of heavy metals in the ecosystem. Also Geographic Information System (GIS) technology was used to make visual explanations by presenting distribution maps of investigated elements. According to the results of PCI, significant positive correlations were recorded among the investigated toxic elements at 0.01 significance level. According to the results of FA, two factors, which were named as "Agricultural Factor" and "Industrial Factor", explained 86.6% of the total variance. According to the results of Potential Ecological Risk Index, cadmium was found to be the highest risk factor and according to results of Biological Risk Index, nickel and chromium were found to be the highest risk factors for Gala Lake and Irrigation Canal. As a result of the present study, it was also determined that heavy metal contents in sediments of Gala Lake National Park reached to critical levels and the system is intensively under effect of agricultural and industrial originated pollution.																	2083-4772	2083-4810				MAR	2017	43	1					34	47		10.1515/aep-2017-0007								WOS:000399253500005

This study investigated the potential efficiency of water quality improvement, as well as genotoxicity and cytotoxicity reduction along the ecological restoration project of this polluted urban river. Results showed that the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) of the reclaimed municipal effluent were reduced by more than 45 and 70%, respectively, meeting the Chinese surface water environmental quality standard level IV, while the total phosphorus and metal concentrations had no significant reduction along the restoration project, and Pb concentrations in all river water samples exceeded permissible limit in drinking water set by WHO (2006) and China (GB5749-2006). The in vitro SOS/umu assay showed 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide equivalent (4-NQOEQ) values of reclaimed municipal wastewater of 0.69 +/- 0.05 mu g/L in April and 0.68 +/- 0.06 mu g/L in December, respectively, indicating the presence of genotoxic compounds. The results of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8OHdG) and hepatic cell apoptosis in zebrafish after a chorionic long-term (21 days) in vivo exposure also demonstrated that the reclaimed municipal wastewater caused significant DNA oxidative damage and cytotoxicity. After the ecological purification of 18.5-km field-scale restoration project, the genotoxicity assessed by in vitro assay was negligible, while the DNA oxidative damage and cytotoxicity in exposed fish were still significantly elevated. The mechanisms of DNA oxidative damage and cytotoxicity caused by the reclaimed municipal wastewater need further study.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				MAR	2017	24	7					6715	6723		10.1007/s11356-016-8352-z								WOS:000399163700076	28091988

A non-parametric regression method, generalized additive models (GAM), was used to analyse the correlations among eleven physicochemical and biological parameters as well as three meteorological factors (wind speed, rainfall and solar radiation) which we collected from 2000 to 2011. The results indicate that the three meteorological factors may have positive effects on SS. Moreover, statistically significant correlations between many water quality parameters and SS or TDS were exhibited seasonally. The correlations between electrical conductivity (EC) and SS were opposite to correlations between EC and TDS. This finding reveals that TDS have a positive impact on EC, while EC negatively affects SS. The results indicated that many parameters, such as total nitrogen, total phosphorus, biological oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD), were related to SS due to the adsorption of SS. Moreover, both positive and negative correlations between COD and TDS were observed in this freshwater reservoir. The positive correlation between chlorophyll a and SS suggested that the change of SS concentration in autumn was caused by the growth of algae. Meanwhile, significant correlations between SS and meteorological factors were also observed, indicating that meteorological factors had effects on SS dynamics. This study provides useful information regarding the correlations among water quality parameters, SS and TDS with meteorological factors in a freshwater reservoir.

This is reflected in increasing public and political focus on a more sustainable use of pesticides, as well as a reduction in diffuse pollution. Climate change will likely to lead to an even more intensive use of pesticides in the future, affecting agriculture in many ways. At the same time, the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and associated EU policies called for a "good" ecological and chemical status to be achieved for water bodies by the end of 2015, currently delayed to 2021-2027 due to a lack of efficiency in policies and timescale of resilience for hydrosystems, especially groundwater systems. Water managers need appropriate and user-friendly tools to design agro-environmental policies. These tools should help them to evaluate the potential impacts of mitigation measures on water resources, more clearly define protected areas, and more efficiently distribute financial incentives to farmers who agree to implement alternative practices. At present, a number of reports point out that water managers do not use appropriate information from monitoring or models to make decisions and set environmental action plans. In this paper, we propose an integrated and collaborative approach to analyzing changes in land use, farming systems, and practices and to assess their effects on agricultural pressure and pesticide transfers to waters. The integrated modeling of agricultural scenario (IMAS) framework draws on a range of data and expert knowledge available within areas where a pesticide action plan can be defined to restore the water quality, French "Grenelle law" catchment areas, French Water Development and Management Plan areas, etc. A so-called "reference scenario" represents the actual soil occupation and pesticide-spraying practices used in both conventional and organic farming. A number of alternative scenarios are then defined in cooperation with stakeholders, including socio-economic conditions for developing alternative agricultural systems or targeting mitigation measures. Our integrated assessment of these scenarios combines the calculation of spatialized environmental indicators with integrated bio-economic modeling. The latter is achieved by a combined use of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) modeling with our own purpose-built land use generator module (Generator of Land Use version 2 (GenLU2)) and an economic model developed using General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) for cost-effectiveness assessment. This integrated approach is applied to two embedded catchment areas (total area of 360,000 ha) within the Charente river basin (SW France). Our results show that it is possible to differentiate scenarios based on their effectiveness, represented by either evolution of pressure (agro-environmental indicators) or transport into waters (pesticide concentrations). By analyzing the implementation costs borne by farmers, it is possible to identify the most cost-effective scenarios at sub-basin and other aggregated levels (WFD hydrological entities, sensitive areas). Relevant results and indicators are fed into a specifically designed database. Data warehousing is used to provide analyses and outputs at all thematic, temporal, or spatial aggregated levels, defined by the stakeholders (type of crops, herbicides, WFD areas, years), using Spatial On-Line Analytical Processing (SOLAP) tools. The aim of this approach is to allow public policy makers to make more informed and reasoned decisions when managing sensitive areas and/or implementing mitigation measures.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				MAR	2017	24	8					6923	6950		10.1007/s11356-016-7657-2								WOS:000399164600009	27726081

Nineteen different herbicides were observed in one or more water samples from the five sites; chemicals observed at more than 40% of sites were simazine (100%), MCPA (83%), diuron (63%) and atrazine (53%). Using the toxicity unit (TU) concept to assess potential risk to aquatic ecosystems, none of the detected herbicides were considered to pose an individual, group or collective short-term risk to fish or zooplankton in the waters studied. However, 13 herbicides had TU values suggesting they might have posed an individual risk to primary producers at the time of sampling. Water quality guideline levels were exceeded on many occasions for Cd, Cu, Cr, Pb and Zn. Similarly, RQ(med) and RQ(max) exceeded 1 for Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Vand Zn. Almost all the metals screened exceeded a log(10)TU of -3 for every trophic level, suggesting that there may have been some impact on aquatic organisms in the studied waterbodies. Our data indicate that Melbourne's urban aquatic environments may be being impacted by approved domestic, industrial and sporting application of herbicides and that stormwater quality needs to be carefully assessed prior to reuse. Further research is required to understand the performance of different urban stormwater wetland designs in removing pesticides and trace metals. Applying the precautionary principle to herbicide regulation is important to ensure there is more research and assessment of the long-term 'performance' standard of all herbicides and throughout their 'life cycle'. Implementing such an approach will also ensure government, regulators, decision makers, researchers, policy makers and industry have the best possible information available to improve the management of chemicals, from manufacture to use.

Investigation of heavy metal pollution in eastern Aegean Sea coastal waters by using Cystoseira barbata, Patella caerulea, and Liza aurata as biological indicators	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												In order to have an extensive contamination profile of heavy metal levels (Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn), seawater, sediment, Patella caerulea, Cystoseira barbata, and Liza aurata were investigated by using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). Samples were collected from five coastal stations along the eastern Aegean Sea coast (Turkey) on a monthly basis from July 2002 through May 2003. According to the results of this study, heavy metal levels were arranged in the following sequence: Fe > Pb > Zn > Mn > Ni > Cu > Cd for water, Fe > Cu > Mn > Ni > Zn > Pb > Cd for sediment, Fe > Zn > Mn > Pb > Ni > Cd > Cu for C. barbata, Fe > Zn > Mn > Ni > Pb > Cu > Cd for P. caerulea, and Fe > Zn > Mn > Cu > Ni > Pb > Cd for L. aurata. Moreover, positive relationships between Fe in water and Mn in water, Fe in sediment and Mn in sediment, Fe in C. barbata and Mn in C. barbata, Fe in P. caerulea and Mn in P. caerulea, and Fe in L. aurata and Mn in L. aurata may suggest that these metals could be originated from the same anthropogenic source. C. barbata represented with higher bioconcentration factor (BCF) values, especially for Fe, Mn, and Zn values. This observation may support that C. barbata can be used as an indicator species for the determinations of Fe, Mn, and Zn levels. Regarding Turkish Food Codex Regulation's residue limits, metal values in L. aurata were found to be lower than the maximum-permissible levels issued by Turkish legislation and also the recommended limits set by FAO/WHO guidelines. The results of the investigation indicated that P. caerulea, L. aurata, and especially C. barbata are quantitative water-quality bioindicators and biomonitoring subjects for biologically available metal accumulation for Aegean Sea coastal waters.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				MAR	2017	24	8					7310	7334		10.1007/s11356-016-8226-4								WOS:000399164600038	28105592

Comparative Assessment and Multivariate Optimization of Commercially Available Small Scale Reverse Osmosis Membranes	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS												Requirement of reverse osmosis (RO) process at places facing energy and water quality problem makes its assessment and optimization vital while considering recovery, rejection as well as specific energy consumption. In the present paper, three thin film composite (TFC) RO membranes (make: CSM, Dow and Vontron) in spiral wound (SW) configuration have been chosen to study their relative performance. Comparative study of RO membranes was conducted using experimental observations supported by membrane characterization. Optimization experiments were performed using central composite design (CCD) of response surface methodology (RSM). Four input variables viz. feed water pH, temperature, pressure and concentration were optimized and interaction between them was observed, while, recovery, rejection and specific energy consumption (SEC) were taken as response attributes. The experiments conducted employing the optimized input values validated the developed RSM model. Predictive model using multiple response optimization revealed the optimal efficiency of CSM RO membrane at 6.53 pH, 1500 mg/L concentration, 0.78 MPa pressure and 31.94 degrees C temperature producing 19.25% water recovery, 89.21% salt rejection and 17.60 kWh/m(3) SEC, respectively. Membrane surface characterization was carried out by FE-SEM, AFM, contact angle measurement and FTIR. The lesser contact angle and smoother surface apparently contributed to the better performance of CSM RO membrane. This paper may demonstrate a simple method for optimizing the commercially available small scale RO membranes.																	1726-2135	1684-8799				MAR	2017	29	1					39	52		10.3808/jei.201700357								WOS:000399355600004

As a paddy matures, numerous fertilizers are needed, especially in the rainy seasons; the concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus in rainfall runoff from farmland is much higher than at other times, and this poses a great threat to water bodies and is the main reason for water eutrophication, especially in high concentration drainages. To date, most studies regarding the characteristics of pollutants in rainfall runoff have mainly been concentrated on urban runoff and watershed runoff; therefore, it is particularly important to investigate the characteristics of nitrogen and phosphorus loss in rainfall runoff from paddy fields. To study the characteristics of nitrogen and phosphorus loss and whether the first flush effect exists, continuous monitoring of the rainfall runoff process of six rainfall events was conducted in 2013, of which four rainfall events during storm, high, middle, and low intensity rainfalls were analyzed, and runoff and quality parameters, such as suspended solids (SS), total nitrogen (TN), ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO3 (-)-N), total phosphorus (TP), and phosphate (PO43--P), were analyzed to determine the relationship between runoff and water quality. The paddy field is located north of Wuxi Lake Basin along the Hejia River upstream in Zhoutie town, Yixing city. An analysis of the load distribution during rainfall runoff was conducted. Event mean concentration (EMC) was used to evaluate the pollution situation of the paddy field's rainfall runoff. A curve of the dimensionless normalized cumulative load (L) vs. normalized cumulative flow (F) (L-F curve), the probability of the mass first flush (MFFn), and the pollutants carried by the initial 25% of runoff (FF25) were used to analyze the first flush effect of the paddy field runoff, and different contaminants show different results: the concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus fluctuate and follow a similar trend as runoff changes, NO3 (-)-N concentration is lower in the early part of runoff and higher in the later, and TP mainly occurs in the particle state in storm runoff and mainly in the dissolved state when the rainfall intensity is smaller. Nitrogen and phosphorus losses from paddy fields are closely related to the average rainfall intensity and the max rainfall intensity, and the runoff loss of nitrogen and phosphorus is more severe when the rainfall intensity is large. Based on an analysis of multiple methodologies, TN and NH4+-N show a certain degree of a first flush effect, whereas the first flush effect of TP is not obvious. The first flush effect of SS is obvious in larger intensity rainfall and shows a slight secondary flush effect in smaller rainfall events.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				MAR	2017	24	9					8336	8351		10.1007/s11356-017-8470-2								WOS:000399162900043	28168564

This study characterized physicochemical properties of the EOM and IOM solution extracted from different growth phases of Microcystis aeruginosa and investigated the corresponding formation potential of DBPs during chlor(am)ination process. Besides, the effects of initial concentration of xEOM, IOM, and Br- on the yields of disinfection by-product formation potential were studied. The results indicated that the specific UV absorbance (SUVA(254)) values of IOM and EOM (1.09 and 2.66 L/mg m) were considerably lower than that of natural organic matter (NOM) (4.79 L/mg m). Fluorescence dates showed the soluble microbial by-product was dominant in both EOM and IOM, and the tryptophan was the main component of AOM. From the excitation-emission matrix figure of EOM and IOM, we found that the content of the high molecular weight protein substance in IOM was higher than EOM. During chlorination of EOM and IOM, the yields of four kinds of DBPs followed the order trichloroethene (TCM) > 1,1-DCP > dichloride acetonitrile (DCAN) > trichloronitromethane (TCNM), while the order was TCM > DCAN > TCNM > 1,1-DCP during chloramination process. The bromine substitution factor (BSF) value increased with the increasing of the concentration of Br-. When the concentration of Br- was 500 mu g/L, the BSF values of chlorination EOM and IOM were 51.1 and 68.4%, respectively. As the concentration of Br- increased, the formation of Cl-DBPs was inhibited and the formation of Br-DBPs was promoted.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				MAR	2017	24	9					8469	8478		10.1007/s11356-017-8515-6								WOS:000399162900055	28188554

The aims of this study were to clarify the N wet deposition first flush effect and estimate the contribution of N wet deposition on both N export and water quality in a subtropical watershed. Results showed that total nitrogen (TN) flux was 41.72 kg N hm(-2) year(-1) and dissolved total nitrogen (DTN) was 23.18 kg N hm(-2) year(-1), respectively. Light rain events lead to the highest DTN and dissolve inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentrations of wet deposition. Rainstorm concentrations were lowest during spring rainfall-runoff events. In contrast to the baseflow, the different N forms were higher than they were under the rainfall-runoff. Rainfall event contributions on N export were greater than 93.2% in the watershed for the whole year. Finally, TN concentrations were higher than river eutrophication thresholds for the entire watershed.

A place-based approach to payments for ecosystem services	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS												Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) schemes are proliferating but are challenged by insufficient attention to spatial and temporal inter-dependencies, interactions between different ecosystems and their services, and the need for multi-level governance. To address these challenges, this paper develops a place-based approach to the development and implementation of PES schemes that incorporates multilevel governance, bundling or layering of services across multiple scales, and shared values for ecosystem services. The approach is evaluated and illustrated using case study research to develop an explicitly place-based PES scheme, the Peatland Code, owned and managed by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's UK Peatland Programme and designed to pay for restoration of peatland habitats. Buyers preferred bundled schemes with premium pricing of a primary service, contrasting with sellers' preferences for quantifying and marketing services separately in a layered scheme. There was limited awareness among key business sectors of dependencies on ecosystem services, or the risks and opportunities arising from their management. Companies with financial links to peatlands or a strong environmental sustainability focus were interested in the scheme, particularly in relation to climate regulation, water quality, biodiversity and flood risk mitigation benefits. Visitors were most interested in donating to projects that benefited wildlife and were willing to donate around (sic)2 on-site during a visit. Sellers agreed a deliberated fair price per tonne of CO2 equivalent from (sic)11.18 to (sic)15.65 across four sites in Scotland, with this range primarily driven by spatial variation in habitat degradation. In the Peak District, perceived declines in sheep and grouse productivity arising from ditch blocking led to substantially higher prices, but in other regions ditch blocking was viewed more positively. The Peatland Code was developed in close collaboration with stakeholders at catchment, landscape and national scales, enabling multi-level governance of the management and delivery of ecosystem services across these scales. Place based PES schemes can mitigate negative trade-offs between ecosystem services, more effectively include cultural ecosystem services and engage with and empower diverse stakeholders in scheme design and governance.

A Community Multi-Omics Approach towards the Assessment of Surface Water Quality in an Urban River System	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH												A multi-omics approach was applied to an urban river system (the Brisbane River (BR), Queensland, Australia) in order to investigate surface water quality and characterize the bacterial population with respect to water contaminants. To do this, bacterial metagenomic amplicon-sequencing using Illumina next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the V5-V6 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene and untargeted community metabolomics using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were utilized. The multi-omics data, in combination with fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) counts, trace metal concentrations (by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS)) and in-situ water quality measurements collected from various locations along the BR were then used to assess the health of the river ecosystem. Sites sampled represented the transition from less affected (upstream) to polluted (downstream) environments along the BR. Chemometric analysis of the combined datasets indicated a clear separation between the sampled environments. Burkholderiales and Cyanobacteria were common key factors for differentiation of pristine waters. Increased sugar alcohol and short-chain fatty acid production was observed by Actinomycetales and Rhodospirillaceae that are known to form biofilms in urban polluted and brackish waters. Results from this study indicate that a multi-omics approach enables a deep understanding of the health of an aquatic ecosystem, providing insight into the bacterial diversity present and the metabolic output of the population when exposed to environmental contaminants.

However, the size and complexity of upstream basins makes the planning and implementation of watershed-scale pollution management a challenge. In this study, we established an evaluation system based on 17 factors, representing the potential point and non-point source pollutants and the environmental carrying capacity which are likely to affect the water quality in the Dahuofang Reservoir and watershed in northeastern China. We used entropy methods to rank 118 subwatersheds by their potential pollution threat and clustered subwatersheds according to the potential pollution type. Combining ranking and clustering analyses allowed us to suggest specific areas for prioritized watershed management (in particular, two subwatersheds with the greatest pollution potential) and to recommend the conservation of current practices in other less vulnerable locations (91 small watersheds with low pollution potential). Finally, we identified the factors most likely to influence the water quality of each of the 118 subwatersheds and suggested adaptive control measures for each location. These results provide a scientific basis for improving the watershed management and sustainability of the Dahuofang reservoir and a framework for identifying threats and prioritizing the management of watersheds of large reservoirs around the world.

An Alternative Method of Spatial Autocorrelation for Chlorophyll Detection in Water Bodies Using Remote Sensing	SUSTAINABILITY												Additional measures of in situ water quality monitoring in natural environments can be obtained through remote sensing because certain elements in water modify its spectral behavior. One of the indicators of water quality is the presence of algae, and the aim of this study was to propose an alternative method for the quantification of chlorophyll in water by correlating spectral data, infrared images, and limnology data. The object of study was an artificial lake located at Unisinos University, SAo Leopoldo/RS, Brazil. The area has been mapped with a modified NGB (near infrared (N), green (G) and blue (B)) camera coupled to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). From the orthorectified and georeferenced images, a modified normalized difference vegetation index (NDVImod) image has been generated. Additionally, 20 sampling points have been established on the lake. At these points, in situ spectral analysis with a spectroradiometer has been performed, and water samples have been collected for laboratory determination of chlorophyll concentrations. The correlation resulted in two models. The first model, based on the multivariate analysis of spectral data, and the second model, based on polynomial equations from NDVI, had coefficients of determination (R-2) of 0.86 and 0.51, respectively. This study confirmed the applicability of remote sensing for water resource management using UAVs, which can be characterized as a quick and easy methodology.

Blast furnace slag (BFS; fine aggregates (agg.)), coarse aggregates, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fiber (hydrophilic fiber), and red clay (ecofriendly additive material) were applied to the construction of the porous vegetation red clay green roof blocks. A decrease in cement use is one way of reducing carbon emissions. To increase the water retentivity and the efficiency of roof vegetation blocks, blast furnace slag aggregates with excellent water absorptivity and polyvinyl alcohol fiber with a water absorption rate above 20% were added. In particular, the addition of polyvinyl alcohol fiber prevents performance reduction of the green roof vegetation blocks during freezing and melting in winter. Compressive strength, void ratio, and unit-mass tests were conducted to evaluate the performance of the roof vegetation blocks. After their application to roof vegetation, the effect of water purification was evaluated. According to the experimental results, the mix that satisfies the target performance of green roof vegetation blocks (compression strength above 8 MPa, void ratio above 20%, unit mass 2.0 kg/cm(3) or below) is: cement = 128.95 kg/m(3), BFS = 96.75 kg/m(3), red clay = 96.75 kg/m(3), water = 81.50 kg/m(3), BFS agg. = 1450 kg/m(3), PVA fiber = 1.26 kg/m(3). The green roof vegetation blocks were designed using the mix that satisfied the target performance. To find the amount of attainable water due to rainfall, a rainfall meter was installed after application of the roof vegetation to measure daily rainfall and calculate the amount of attainable water. The results show that, for 1 mm of rainfall, it is possible to attain about 0.53 L of water per 1 m(2). In addition, the water quality of effluents after application of roof vegetation was analyzed, and the results satisfied Class 4 of the River-life Environmental Standard for Availability of Agricultural Water.																	2071-1050					MAR	2017	9	3							357	10.3390/su9030357								WOS:000398714100034

This paper presents the LUCC in Portugal at the regional level (NUTS II) from 1995 to 2010 and discusses the main driving forces and implications associated with these LUCC. The main objectives of this work are: (a) to quantify the land use and land cover (LUC) types (level I of LUC cartography) by NUT II in Portugal for the years 1995, 2007 and 2010; (b) to assess the spatio-temporal LUCC; and (c) to identify and discuss the main driving forces of LUCC and corresponding implications based on correlations and Principal Components Analysis. The results revealed large regional and temporal LUCC and further highlighted the different and sometimes opposite time trends between neighboring regions. By associating driving forces to LUCC, different influences at the regional level were observed, namely LUCC into agriculture land derived from the construction of dams (Alentejo region), or the conversion of coniferous forest into eucalypt forest (Centre region) associated with increased gross value added (GVA) and employment in industry and forestry. Temporal differentiation was also observed, particularly in the settlements that expanded between 1995 and 2007 due to the construction of large infrastructures (e.g., highways, industrial complexes, or buildings), which is reflected on employment in industry and construction and respective GVA. However, certain LUCC have implications, particularly in energy consumption, for which different behavior between regions can be highlighted in this analysis, but also on land-use sustainability.

J	Sikorska, D; Sikorski, P; Hopkins, RJ				Sikorska, Daria; Sikorski, Piotr; Hopkins, Richard James			High Biodiversity of Green Infrastructure Does Not Contribute to Recreational Ecosystem Services	SUSTAINABILITY												Urban lakes, especially those of natural origin, provide ecosystem services, recreation being one of the most important and highly valued by city dwellers. Fulfilling the needs of city residents to relax and have contact with nature has become a priority in urbanized areas and has been proven to positively affect people's health and well-being. The recreational potential of water bodies was identified to be the most important aspect of ecosystem services to the residents of the neighboring areas. An assessment of recreational ecosystem services (RES) provisioning to society based on the real time spent by the citizens and housing values in the urban-rural gradient revealed that the economic benefits of lakes differ in urbanized, suburban and rural landscapes. The growth of cities has led to an increased population density in the surroundings of ecologically valuable areas, resulting in higher pressure from visitors seeking recreational areas. Along with urbanization, the impoverishment of ecosystem functions takes place, limiting their capability to provide ecosystem services. In this work, the provisioning of recreational ecosystem services of 28 floodplain lakes located along the urban-rural gradient of the Warsaw agglomeration was assessed. The relationship between the ecological value of the water bodies, measured using naturalness indices, and the recreational ecosystem services they can provide was assessed. The results showed that the floodplain lakes located along the urban-rural gradient are of great importance to the citizens due to their recreational potential. The provisioning of recreational ecosystem services is poorly connected with the ecological characteristics of the floodplain lakes. Only hemeroby was significantly correlated with provisioning, and there was no relationship with factors such as naturalness of vegetation or water quality, demonstrating that public preference was not generally influenced by high ecological quality. These data should be available to potential buyers and be integrated in spatial planning management plans in order to shape future housing policy.

Changes in runoff chemistry and soil fertility after multiple years of cattle winter bale feeding on annual cropland on the Canadian prairies	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Feeding cattle on cropland through the winter months using pre-placed fodder bales (bale grazing or infield bale feeding) has demonstrated economic benefits when compared to confined winter feeding, but very little research has been done to quantify the impacts of recurring cycles of in-field feeding on runoff water quality. In this study, two small watersheds (with and without winter bale grazing; WBG) located in the same annual cropped field in southern Manitoba, Canada were monitored from 2008 to 2016. Winter feeding in the WBG treatment occurred in the winters of 2008/09, 2010/11, 2012/13, and 2014/15. Export of N and P with the WBG treatment was also contrasted with the alternative practice of higher density confined feeding (CF). For WBG, soil fertility was improved, with higher soil test phosphorus (Olsen-P) and soil nitrate (NO3(-)-N) following WBG. Exports of N and P with surface runoff were also higher in snowmelt following WBG when compared to the control watershed, primarily due to higher concentrations of particulate N and P, NH4+-N, and dissolved organic N. Higher P loss from the WBG watershed than from the control watershed persisted in the non-grazing years following each bale grazing. In contrast, concentrations of all forms of nitrogen in runoff consistently returned to levels observed prior to bale grazing following a winter without treatment. Annual runoff export of N and P per animal unit day (AUD) following WBG was comparable to that for two CF sites. Higher annual volumes of runoff were observed from the larger area and lower density bale feeding treatment, but with lower concentrations of N and Pin comparison to feedlot sites. If WBG continues to be utilized to improve soil fertility and reduce manure transportation costs, the potential negative impacts on runoff water quality must be considered. Higher volumes of snowmelt runoff per AUD from WBG in comparison to CF sites will make runoff capture options more expensive to implement. WBG timing or siting changes that reduce runoff volume and make retention feasible or that decrease accumulation of P at the soil surface will reduce negative water quality impacts associated with WBG.

Richard; Jeong, Jaehak			Evaluating the ranch and watershed scale impacts of using traditional and adaptive multi-paddock grazing on runoff, sediment and nutrient losses in North Texas, USA	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Grazing management practices have a significant influence on ecosystem services provided by rangelands. An assessment of hydrologic and water quality impacts of traditional and alternate grazing management practices facilitates adoption of best management practices for long-term sustainability of rangelands. A study was conducted to quantify the runoff, sediment and nutrient losses under traditional continuous and adaptive multi-paddock (MP) grazing management practices in the rangeland dominated (71% rangeland) Clear Creek Watershed (CCW) in north Texas in the United States using the Agricultural Policy/Environmental Extender (APEX) model. The model was calibrated and validated using observed herbaceous plant biomass and daily soil moisture data at four study ranches in the CCW [two under MP grazing and one each under light continuous (LC) and heavy continuous (HC) grazing practices], and using monthly streamflow, sediment, total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) data measured at the watershed outlet. Both ranch- and watershed-scale results indicated a strong influence of the grazing practice on runoff and water quality. When the grazing management was changed from the baseline MP to HC at one of the study ranches, the simulated average (1980-2013) annual surface runoff, sediment, TN and TP losses increased by 148%, 142%, 144% and 158%, respectively. At the watershed-scale, changing grazing management from the baseline HC to adaptive MP reduced the average annual surface runoff, sediment, TN and TP loads at the watershed outlet by 39%, 34%, 33% and 31%, respectively. In addition, implementation of adaptive MP grazing reduced streamflow during the high flow conditions that have <10% exceedance probability, by about 20%, and hence reduced the chances of flooding downstream of the watershed. Adaptive MP grazing was therefore found to be an effective conservation practice on grazing lands for enhancing water conservation and protecting water quality. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The Western Basin of Lake Erie Collaborative Agreement commits the governments of Michigan, Ohio and Ontario to reduce phosphorus entering the Lake Erie's western basin by 40% by 2025/2026 from 2008 levels by, among other things, reducing fertilizer use in agriculture. The International Joint Commission (2014) estimates that agriculture accounts for 44% of total phosphorus loadings to Lake Erie. Our study uses a unique micro level data set of 16 farms over 6 years that allows us to examine 397 individual nutrient application choices at the field and farm level. If efforts to reduce excessive application of nutrients are to be successful at aggregate level, they need to be informed by an understanding of how farmers make nutrient application decisions within existing production systems. The study aims to enhance our understanding by determining whether farmers applying nutrients to maximize yields, to maximize net returns or to meet environmental targets, and whether over application depends on factors such as farm size, crop type, manure use, and type of nutrient. We compare actual nutrient application rates with site specific rates intended to minimize excess nutrient application and we regress nutrient application levels against potential explanatory variables including farm size, crop rotation practices, and application of livestock. The data were collected from farmers in the Gully Creek watershed in Ontario. We found that excess nutrient applications, as a percentage of the total nutrient applications, are much higher for phosphorus than for nitrogen and higher for wheat than for corn. While most of the farmers in the study are not required to comply with provincial nutrient management regulations, many of them apply fertilizer at rates close to that recommended by those regulations and some at rates significantly less. While most farms are applying fertilizer, particularly nitrogen, at rates close to the minimum crop requirements, nevertheless, a few farms apply much more phosphorous than recommended. Policy and research efforts should be directed toward targeting these individuals that appear to be the primary contributor to the nutrient loading issue. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

To conduct this study the major ion concentrations, including HCO3-, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, SO42- and Cl- and water levels in ten water wells and the dam reservoir were measured during two periods ( June 2009 and June 2011), analyzed by factor analysis and plotted in water quality charts. The results of factor analysis show that most of the dissolved ions including Mg2+, Ca2+, SO42-, Cl- and HCO3-, particularly in 2009, were mainly originated from carbonate and evaporitic formations as well as from the playa lake ( Factor 1). In 2011, elevated salinity levels were found to be mainly related to intense evaporation during irrigation that are proportional to Na+ and K+ concentrations ( Factor 2) and depend on the type of crop and irrigation method. It was also found that the surface waters from deeper origins had less of an effect on groundwater recharge compared to upstream carbonate aquifers.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				MAR	2017	76	6							238	10.1007/s12665-017-6550-8								WOS:000398451000006

Short-term forecasting of saltwater occurrence at La Comte River (French Guiana) using a kernel-based support vector machine	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Saltwater intrusion into rivers is a major concern for freshwater exploitation and management in French Guiana (South America). To detect and analyse saltwater occurrence, a permanent station was installed on La Comte River to measure the electrical conductivity C. The objective of the present study was twofold. First, the temporal link between C, sea water level SWL and river discharge Q was explored during the dry seasons from 2009 to 2012 (total measurement duration of similar to 6 months). A lag of 3 h between C and SWL was evidenced (i.e. the C peaks are delayed by 3 h with high water conditions), as well as the co-occurrence of sea water intrusion with the low Q period. Second, a data-driven approach was set up through a kernel-based support vector machine SVM technique to forecast two events: (1) the forthcoming maximum value of C (for the next 3 h) exceeds 500 mu S/cm; (2) C exceeds 500 mu S/cm during more than 2 h. One potential drawback of such a data-driven approach is to fail to predict outside the range of calibration: this issue was thoroughly explored by means of an intensive bootstrap-based test exercise. It was showed that SVM has very high degree of predictive capability with accuracy and area under receiver operator curve above 90% in average. We additionally analyse the practical implementation of the SVM model with comparison to alternative popular classification techniques (logistic regression, random forest, linear and quadratic discriminant analysis): the SVM strength is to provide the nonlinear decision boundary without making a priori restrictive assumptions on its shape (like linear or quadratic methods) and without being too sensitive to noisy observations/outliers. Yet this strength can turn to be a weakness unless a careful examination of the shape is done from a physical perspective.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				MAR	2017	76	6							246	10.1007/s12665-017-6553-5								WOS:000398451000014

Reservoir dams are local for the accumulation of sediments transported from upstream. The amount of P release from sediments to water is potentially controlled by the retention characteristics of sediments. In this regard, 100 sediment samples were taken from surface sediments to determine the P retention capacity of sediments in Ekbatan Dam, Hamadan, Iran, and 15 water samples were collected from the interface of bottom sediments with lake water to determine different types of water P, including water-soluble P (WSP), dissolved reactive P (DRP), suspended solids P (SSP), and total P (TP). Firstly, some physical and chemical properties of sediments such as pH, cation exchangeable capacity (CEC), organic carbon (OC) content, equivalent CaCO3 (TNV), aluminum (Al) and iron (Fe) content were measured, and then WSP, TP, SSP, and DRP as well as P isotherms were determined. Moreover, three isotherm equations of Freundlich, Langmuir, and Temkin were fitted to the experimental data. Finally, the map of spatial variation of degree of P saturation (DPS) was plotted. The results revealed that the amount of DRP in water was at high level (0.02 mg L-1). The maximum adsorption in the sediments ranged from 83.93 to 634.13 mg kg(-1) that was significantly correlated with the physical and chemical properties of sediments, such as clay percentage, OC, and TNV. The equilibrium concentration of P at zero point was significantly higher than DRP. This demonstrated the release of P from sediments into water. P binding energy in the sediments ranged from 0.03 to 5.48 L mg(-1). There was a significant correlation between the binding energy and oxalate-extractable Fe, representing that the poorly crystalline or amorphous Fe would play a dominate role in the P adsorption under the slightly alkaline condition. The results suggested that the sediments not only had high P adsorption capacity and binding energy but released loosely bound WSP to water as well, which can cause eutrophication in the long term.

Headwater streams in the neotropical savanna are severely threatened by large-scale landscape changes that degrade local habitat characteristics and lead to biodiversity loss. The objective of our study was to evaluate Ephemeroptera assemblages as bioindicators of catchment land use and cover, local streambed and riparian vegetation conditions, and instream water quality. To do so, we sampled mayfly nymphs in 184 stream sites across a broad disturbance gradient in four hydrologic units of the Brazilian neotropical savanna. We selected seven metrics without significant co-variation with natural variability: % catchment urban, riparian vegetation condition index (RCOND), human disturbances of the stream channel and riparian zone (Wl_HALL), substrate mean embeddedness (XEMBED), dissolved oxygen (mg L-1), pH, and total phosphorus (mg L-1). We ran threshold indicator taxa analysis (TITAN) for each disturbance metric to detect change points in mayfly genera responses (whether sensitive or tolerant) and assemblage turnover pattern. TITAN showed that 20 of the 39 genera found were robust bioindicators (based on purity and reliability values >0.95), sixteen of them being sensitive to increased disturbance. The most sensitive genera were Tricorythopsis (Leptohyphidae) and Camelobaetidius (Baetidae), showing decreased abundance to most disturbance metrics. We found a turnover pattern of mayfly genera in response to Wl_HALL in a narrow variation range. For total phosphorus, the benchmark value defined in Brazilian Federal Legislation is higher than the turnover threshold of several mayfly genera. This indicates that we will lose many sensitive genera even within the limits imposed by national environmental legislation. The indicator taxa approach, based on multiple taxa rather than univariate metrics or single indicator species, demonstrates the value of quantitative ecological information for conserving and managing freshwater ecosystems globally.

J	Nelson, WG				Nelson, Walter G.			Development of an epiphyte indicator of nutrient enrichment: Threshold values for seagrass epiphyte load	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Metrics of epiphyte load on macrophytes were evaluated for use as quantitative biological indicators for nutrient impacts in estuarine waters, based on review and analysis of the literature on epiphytes and macrophytes, primarily seagrasses, but including some brackish and freshwater rooted macrophyte species. An approach is presented that empirically derives threshold epiphyte loads which are likely to cause specified levels of decrease in macrophyte response metrics such as biomass, shoot density, percent cover, production and growth. Data from 36 studies of 10 macrophyte species were pooled to derive relationships between epiphyte load and.25 and 50% seagrass response levels, which are proposed as the primary basis for establishment of critical threshold values. Given multiple sources of variability in the response data, threshold ranges based on the range of values falling between the median and the 75th quantiles of observations at a given seagrass response level are proposed rather than single, critical point values. Four epiphyte load threshold categories low, moderate, high, very high, are proposed. Comparison of values of epiphyte loads associated with 25 and 50% reductions in light to macrophytes suggest that the threshold ranges are realistic both in terms of the principle mechanism of impact to macrophytes and in terms of the magnitude of resultant impacts expressed by the macrophytes. Some variability in response levels was observed among climate regions, and additional data collected with a standardized approach could help in the development of regionalized threshold ranges for the epiphyte load indicator.

Testing the efficacy of an estuarine eutrophic condition index: Does it account for shifts in flow conditions?	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Eutrophication of estuaries via anthropogenic nutrient enrichment is an issue being addressed extensively on a global scale, however it remains a topic that garners further attention due to its complexity. The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of a recently proposed eutrophic condition index in five permanently open estuaries, subsequent to flow variations. Further, in order to elucidate their potential role in augmenting eutrophic conditions, the influence of vegetated habitats on associated microalgal communities was investigated. The study took place in the summer of 2014 and 2015. On each sampling occasion, all of the proposed 'state' indicators (nutrients, oxygen and microalgal communities) were assessed and supplemented with a heuristic 'pressure' component (flow conditions). Overall, the proposed index was shown to be sensitive to environmental perturbations providing shifts in classification ratings illustrating the dilution (Swartkops Estuary) or augmenting (Kromme, Gamtoos, and Kariega estuaries) effect of freshwater pulse events. Additionally, the sensitivity of selected epiphyte and microphytobenthos (MPB) parameters to water quality variations was verified, thus supporting their inclusion as indicators in the proposed index. Regarding the role of microhabitats in promoting microalgal growth, it was found that MPB biomass was higher (5-290%) and benthic diatom diversity generally lower (5-50%) in vegetated compared to unvegetated habitats - an important consideration when applying the index. The habitat complexity and stabilisation provided by estuarine macrophytes (Phragmites australis and Zostera capensis) supported notable autotroph colonisation. This highlights their importance in structuring trophic pathways, whilst also potentially providing a corridor for the intensification of eutrophic symptoms in estuaries. Overall, this study provides an important step towards the verification of a proposed assessment methodology which may serve to provide a baseline from which the eutrophic status of estuaries can be monitored - particularly in countries where such assessment frameworks are lacking.

J	Wichelns, D				Wichelns, Dennis			Volumetric water footprints, applied in a global context, do not provide insight regarding water scarcity or water quality degradation	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Many authors have presented estimates of volumetric water footprints in the context of describing and comparing the water requirements of crop production and industrial activities. In recent years, water footprints have been proposed as indicators for use in assessing the sustainability, efficiency, and equity of water allocations in a global context. That perspective is notably ambitious, given that volumetric water footprints contain information pertaining to just one resource, with no consideration of scarcity values, opportunity costs, or the impacts of water use on the environment, livelihoods, or human health. The suggestion that water scarcity must be assessed from a global perspective also is misplaced. Water scarcity and water quality degradation arise in local and regional settings. The impacts and potential remedies must be evaluated at those levels, by scientists and public officials charged with determining the policies and investments needed to ensure wise use of water resources. Efforts to extend access to clean, safe, and affordable water to the millions of households lacking such access also must be designed and implemented locally. Public officials will not gain useful insight by comparing volumetric water footprints in a global context. Water scarcity and water quality degradation cannot be resolved by reorganizing production activities across river basins and continents. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

S.; Suthar, Surindra			Hydrochemistry of groundwater in North Rajasthan, India: chemical and multivariate analysis	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												This paper presents the hydrochemistry of groundwater of the northern districts of Rajasthan, India. Groundwater samples were collected from 50 sampling stations (rural and suburban areas) and analyzed for pH, EC, TDS, TH, NO3-, SO4 (2-), PO43-, Na (+), K (+), Mg2+, Ca (2+), Fe (2+), F(-)and Cl-. The pH varied from 6.54 to 9.51 in groundwater, slightly higher than WHO limit. The majority of sampling sites (80-100%) showed the high EC, TDS, TH and Na (+) contents in groundwater with an average value of 4.46 S/cm, 2856.1, 1774.4 and 426 mg/L, respectively. Na (+)/Cl(-)ratio was >1 in most of the sampling locations, which indicates the releasing of Na+ from silicate weathering. NO3- in groundwater ranged between (0.37 and 51.4 mg/L), and a few sites indicate an anthropogenic contribution of NO3- in groundwater. The F-in groundwater is a major issue in this area, and F-varied from 0.02 to 7.18 mg/L (with an average of 2.08 mg/L). Piper diagram identified Ca-Mg-HCO3 ([80%) and NaK- HCO(3)(-)as the dominant types of water of this area. The strong correlation between Na-Cl and K-Cl, Ca-Mg-SO4 suggests feldspar weathering in groundwater. Six components with a variance of 79% were extracted, which suggests cation exchange, rock-water interaction and anthropogenic activities as major factors affecting groundwater chemistry of this area. Water quality index of study area ranged between 178.58 and 944.8, and groundwater of about 58% of the study site fell under unsuitable for drinking category. The result of SAR analysis indicated the high Na+ content in groundwater (>10% sites), unsuitable for irrigation purposes. Langelier saturation index indicates that >60% sampling sites may have scaling problems due to excess CaCO3 in groundwater. Results suggest complex geological processes and anthropogenic pressure as major causes of deterioration of the overall quality of groundwater in this area.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				MAR	2017	76	5							203	10.1007/s12665-017-6496-x								WOS:000396208400016

Under various river management and conservation strategies for its protection, the assessment of water quality of its main tributary Ramganga River is lacking. This study focuses on assessment of physicochemical and heavy metal pollution of the Ramganga River by application of multivariate statistical techniques. Sampling of Ramganga River at sixteen sampling sites was carried out in three seasons (summer, monsoon and winter) of 2014. The collected water samples were analyzed for physicochemical parameters and heavy metals. Results from cluster analysis (CA) of the data divided the whole stretch of the river into three clusters as elevation from 1304 to 259 m as less polluted, from 207 to 154 m as moderately polluted and from elevation 154 to 139 m as high-polluted stretches with anthropogenic as main sources of pollution in high-polluted stretch. Principal component analysis of the seasonal dataset resulted in three significant principal components (PC) in each season explaining 72-8% of total variance with strong loadings (>0.75) of PC1 on fluoride (F-), chloride (Cl-), sodium (Na+), calcium (Ca2+), magnesium Mg2+), bicarbonate (HCO3-), total dissolved solids and electrical conductivity. Temporal variation by one-way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) showed significant seasonal variation was in the pH, chemical oxygen demand, biochemical oxygen demand, turbidity, HCO3-, F-, Zn, cadmium (Cd) and Mn (p < 0.05). Turbidity showed approximately a twofold increase in monsoon season due to rainfall in the catchment area and subsequent flow of runoff into the river. Concentration of HCO3-, F- and pH also showed similar increase in monsoon. The concentration of Zn, Cd and Mn showed an increasing trend in summers compared to monsoon and winter season due to dilution effect in the monsoon season and its lasting effect in winters.

GIS-based FRASTIC model for pollution vulnerability assessment of fractured-rock aquifer systems	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												All groundwater is vulnerable to pollution, but the level of susceptibility depends on the spatial peculiarities of a region. Among the numerous vulnerability assessment methodologies, the geographical information system-based DRASTIC model is the most sophisticated and achieves reliable results even in complex areas. Fractured-rock aquifers are not only complex, but they are also potential sources of radioactive and other types of waste and are liable to high recharge rates. Hence, they can serve as a conduit for fluid (and potentially) contaminants. Therefore, in this study, a new parameter, 'fracture media' (F), is fashioned to replace the weakest parameter (i.e. depth to water, D) in the standardized DRASTIC model to create a new model (FRASTIC) for the complex fractured aquifer system. The proposed model was tested on a case study area (Kano, Nigeria), and the FRASTIC minimum and maximum indices obtained were in the range of 63-170. The region was characterized as having very low (covering 0.16% of the total study area), low (55.52%), medium (42.53%), and high (1.79%) vulnerability based on the standardized classification system. In addition, the modified FRASTIC model was further developed using the sensitivity analysis (SA) and recorded the highest vulnerable area coverage (32.86%) within Kano. Thus, the modified FRASTIC model is appropriate for the complex nature of the study area because it contributes appreciably to defining the vulnerable zones. The single-parameter SA was employed to obtain effective weights for two modified models, which were then implemented to improve efficacy. Conventional nitrate validation indicated that there is a strong correlation between nitrate and vulnerability for the modified models. In addition, a new approach for identifying the relationship between the water quality and vulnerability indices was developed by this study and was proven to be an effective validation tool.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				MAR	2017	76	5							197	10.1007/s12665-017-6520-1								WOS:000396208400010

Under the hydrochemical condition, the solar photocycle would result in changes of the water temperature, in photosynthesis and in iron photoreduction, which leads to substantial hydrochemical fluctuations, especially for heavy metals. It is important to consider the daily variations in water quality when developing a hydrochemical monitoring plan for an area with highly developed agriculture, such as the Tatun Volcano Group watershed area in this study. The results show that the water chemistry is highly complicated by both solar photocycles and hydrochemical fluctuations in the upstream area. Using principal component analysis, the contributions from the two factors can be successfully separated. During the daytime, the photocycle results in the formation of aluminum hydroxide, which can remove heavy metals from water. Consequently, the content of heavy metals, including As, Cu, Ni, Co and Ba, increases after sunset and can reach a maximum before sunrise, while Fe behaves inversely due to the photoreduction. The variation of As during a diel cycle can reach 97%. However, the content of most of the heavy metals during diel cycle is incomparable with those in the earlier studies due to the formation of aluminum hydroxide instead of iron hydroxide. The other significant factor, hydrochemical fluctuation, can explain the variation of major components in water including Cl, SO4. Rare earth elements (REEs) were also analyzed and can be an excellent natural tracer in this study. The distribution of REEs shows a depletion of light REEs and an even normalized concentration of middle and heavy REEs. It is theorized that the REEs in the water in this study derive mainly from the reservoir rock of geothermal water. In a hydrochemical monitoring plan, REEs can be an indicator for identifying an anthropogenic source.

J	Wu, JH; Xue, CY; Tian, R; Wang, S				Wu, Jianhua; Xue, Chenyang; Tian, Rui; Wang, Siting			Lake water quality assessment: a case study of Shahu Lake in the semiarid loess area of northwest China	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												A comprehensive assessment on lake water quality was carried out in Shahu Lake, northwest China, to provide valuable information about present lake water quality for decision making. Major ions, general parameters, bacteriological parameters, organics and trace metals monitored monthly in 2014 were considered. Monitored parameters were compared with quality criteria for surface water of China, and overall water quality assessment was carried out using an entropy weighted water quality index (EWQI) based on 20 selected parameters. Lake water quality was also assessed for irrigation purpose. The results show that the lake water is of Cl center dot SO4-Na facies with high salinity and COD. The geochemistry of the lake water is regulated by intense evaporation and human activities. TP, TN and F- are major inorganic contaminants, with over 50% of the water samples polluted by them. Oil, mainly attributed by leaky motor tourist boats, is the major organic pollutants in the lake water, with 10 samples (37.04%) showing higher oil content than the permissible limit. The concentrations of other inorganic and organic contaminants as well as trace metals are well below the permissible limits. The present study indicates that inorganic contamination in the lake water is more severe than organic pollution. The overall lake water quality, assessed by EWQI, is poor and very poor with SO42-, TDS, TH and Cl-being the dominant contributing factors. The lake water is suitable for irrigation in terms of alkalinity, but is unsuitable for irrigation from the salinity point of view. Accelerating the circulation and replenishment of the lake water is an important way of reducing contaminant concentrations. This study is important in providing comprehensive information on lake water quality for decision makers and valuable reference for international lake water researchers.

A comparison of metrics to evaluate the effects of hydro-facility passage stressors on fish	ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS												Hydropower is the most common form of renewable energy, and countries worldwide are considering expanding hydropower to new areas. One of the challenges of hydropower deployment is mitigation of the environmental impacts including water quality, habitat alterations, and ecosystem connectivity. For fish species that inhabit river systems with hydropower facilities, passage through the facility to access spawning and rearing habitats can be particularly challenging. Fish moving downstream through a hydro facility can be exposed to a number of stressors (e.g., rapid decompression, cavitation, blade strike and collision, turbulence, and shear forces), which can affect fish survival in direct and indirect ways. Many studies have investigated the effects of hydroturbine passage on fish; however, the comparability among studies is limited by variation in the metrics and biological endpoints used. Future studies investigating the effects of hydroturbine passage should focus on using metrics and endpoints that are easily comparable. This review summarizes four categories of metrics that are used in fisheries research that have application to hydroturbine passage (i.e., mortality, injury, physiological markers, behavior) and evaluates them based on several criteria (i.e., resources needed, invasiveness, comparability among stressors and species, and diagnostic properties). Additionally, these comparisons are put into context of study setting (i.e., laboratory versus field). Overall, injury and physiological markers are ideal for studies in which there is a need to understand the mechanisms of effect, whereas behavior and mortality metrics provide information on the whole body response of the fish. The study setting strongly influences the comparability among studies. In laboratory-based studies, stressors can be controlled by type, intensity, and duration, allowing for easy comparisons among studies. In contrast, field studies expose fish to realistic passage environments but the comparability is limited. Based on these results, future studies, whether lab or field-based, should focus on metrics that relate to mortality for ease of comparison, while some diagnostic capability is important for furthering the science.

Christopher			ACUTE SENSITIVITY OF A BROAD RANGE OF FRESHWATER MUSSELS TO CHEMICALS WITH DIFFERENT MODES OF TOXIC ACTION	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Freshwater mussels, one of the most imperiled groups of animals in the world, are generally underrepresented in toxicity databases used for the development of ambient water quality criteria and other environmental guidance values. Acute 96-h toxicity tests were conducted to evaluate the sensitivity of 5 species of juvenile mussels from 2 families and 4 tribes to 10 chemicals (ammonia, metals, major ions, and organic compounds) and to screen 10 additional chemicals (mainly organic compounds) with a commonly tested mussel species, fatmucket (Lampsilis siliquoidea). In the multi-species study, median effect concentrations (EC50s) among the 5 species differed by a factor of <= 2 for chloride, potassium, sulfate, and zinc; a factor of <= 5 for ammonia, chromium, copper, and nickel; and factors of 6 and 12 for metolachlor and alachlor, respectively, indicating that mussels representing different families or tribes had similar sensitivity to most of the tested chemicals, regardless of modes of action. There was a strong linear relationship between EC50s for fatmucket and the other 4 mussel species across the 10 chemicals (r(2) = 0.97, slope close to 1.0), indicating that fatmucket was similar to other mussel species; thus, this commonly tested species can be a good surrogate for protecting other mussels in acute exposures. The sensitivity of juvenile fatmucket among different populations or cultured fromlarvae ofwild adults and captive-cultured adults was also similar in acute exposures to copper or chloride, indicating captive-cultured adult mussels can reliably be used to reproduce juveniles for toxicity testing. In compiled databases for all freshwater species, 1 or more mussel species were among the 4 most sensitive species for alachlor, ammonia, chloride, potassium, sulfate, copper, nickel, and zinc; therefore, the development of water quality criteria and other environmental guidance values for these chemicals should reflect the sensitivity of mussels. In contrast, the EC50s of fatmucket tested in the single-species study were in the high percentiles (> 75th) of species sensitivity distributions for 6 of 7 organic chemicals, indicating mussels might be relatively insensitive to organic chemicals in acute exposures.

ACUTE SENSITIVITY OF THE VERNAL POOL FAIRY SHRIMP, BRANCHINECTA LYNCHI (ANOSTRACA; BRANCHINECTIDAE), AND SURROGATE SPECIES TO 10 CHEMICALS	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Vernal pool fairy shrimp, Branchinecta lynchi, (Branchiopoda; Anostraca) and other fairy shrimp species have been listed as threatened or endangered under the US Endangered Species Act. Because few data exist about the sensitivity of Branchinecta spp. to toxic effects of contaminants, it is difficult to determine whether they are adequately protected by water quality criteria. A series of acute (24-h) lethality/immobilization tests was conducted with 3 species of fairy shrimp (B. lynchi, Branchinecta lindahli, and Thamnocephalus platyurus) and 10 chemicals with varying modes of toxic action: ammonia, potassium, chloride, sulfate, chromium( VI), copper, nickel, zinc, alachlor, and metolachlor. The same chemicals were tested in 48-h tests with other branchiopods ( the cladocerans Daphnia magna and Ceriodaphnia dubia) and an amphipod (Hyalella azteca), and in 96-h tests with snails (Physa gyrina and Lymnaea stagnalis). Median effect concentrations (EC50s) for B. lynchi were strongly correlated (r(2) (_) 0.975) with EC50s for the commercially available fairy shrimp species T. platyurus for most chemicals tested. Comparison of EC50s for fairy shrimp and EC50s for invertebrate taxa tested concurrently and with other published toxicity data indicated that fairy shrimp were relatively sensitive to potassium and several trace metals compared with other invertebrate taxa, although cladocerans, amphipods, and mussels had similar broad toxicant sensitivity. Interspecies correlation estimation models for predicting toxicity to fairy shrimp from surrogate species indicated that models with cladocerans and freshwater mussels as surrogates produced the best predictions of the sensitivity of fairy shrimp to contaminants. The results of these studies indicate that fairy shrimp are relatively sensitive to a range of toxicants, but Endangered Species Act-listed fairy shrimp of the genus Branchinecta were not consistently more sensitive than other fairy shrimp taxa.

However, not all cyclones produce similar impact on a coastal lagoon, some trigger algal blooms after passage while others just increase the overall turbidity. Asia's largest brackish water lagoon, Chilika Lagoon, India was hit by two anniversary-severe cyclones Phailin (12 October 2013) and Hudhud (12 October 2014) recently. Their impacts were analysed with respect to physical, biological and meteorological factors which favour or restrict a phytoplankton bloom after the passage of a storm. Moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer surface reflectance data were used to examine the spatio-temporal variability in total suspended sediment (TSS) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration pre-and post-cyclone. Comparative results revealed that Phailin was associated with higher rainfall, wind speed and surface runoff compared with Hudhud. These factors contributed to higher TSS concentration in all sectors of the lagoon post-Phailin compared with post-Hudhud. Extreme TSS, limited light, high rainfall and runoff and increased flushing rate post-Phailin restricted the likelihood of a phytoplankton bloom in the lagoon, a commonly reported phenomenon after the passage of a cyclone. In contrast, sufficient light availability due to lower TSS, low runoff and flushing and stable wind supported a phytoplankton bloom post-Hudhud. The observed differential impacts were linked to the individual cyclone's characteristics such as differences in landfall locations, wind speed, trajectory after the landfall, differences in rainfall rate and surface runoff and speed of passage.

Major changes in the distribution of diatom assemblages were determined by multivariate statistical analyses. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to ordinate environmental variables of the water, showing a clear gradient along the estuary, with higher nutrient levels (total phosphorus and total nitrogen) and lower dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations at upstream sites. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to determine the species-environmental relationship. Total phosphorus (TP) and DO (p < 0.001) as well as salinity and pH (p < 0.002) were the most significant variables related to diatom composition. The neritic planktonic species Thalassionema nitzschioides (Grunow) Mereschkowsky was the most widespread and abundant species in the data set, presumably also reflecting significant influence of oceanic water. Thalassiosira cedarkeyensis Prasad, a marine benthic species, was the second most abundant species and seems to be related to higher nutrient levels, particularly at upstream sites. High abundances of Cyclotella meneghiniana Kutzing and Cyclotella atomus Hustedt were also recorded upstream sites. Their association to high TP levels and lower DO concentrations suggests deterioration of water quality. This study shows the potential of diatoms as indicators of environmental change even in dynamic systems such as estuaries.

Impacts of Road Salting on Water Quality in Fractured Crystalline Bedrock	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Many rural communities depend on bedrock wells as a primary water source, which raises the issue as to whether increasing amounts of salt application are affecting bedrock water quality and to what degree. Through wellbore profiling, this study investigated changes in specific conductance in two crystalline bedrock wells at the University of Connecticut in Storrs, CT, from 2003 to 2016, with particular emphasis on the impacts of increased salt application with a change in deicing practices at the university after 2009. Hourly specific conductance measurements were collected in 2014 to determine how water source may affect wellbore concentrations seasonally. Chloride was found to be highly persistent in the bedrock, with concentrations consistently increasing from 2003 to 2016 despite year-to-year variations in salt application. A dramatic increase in chloride occurred in the wellbores in response to the change in deicing practices, with an immediate response in fractures having a direct connection to the overburden. In light of the long-term implications of road salting on subsurface chloride contamination, this study argues that consideration be given to deicing management strategies to reduce road salt contamination.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				MAR-APR	2017	46	2					288	294		10.2134/jeq2016.10.0411								WOS:000397864700007	28380564

Temperature and Nitrogen Effects on Phosphorus Uptake by Agricultural Stream-Bed Sediments	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Climate change will likely increase the growing season, temperatures, and ratio of nitrogen (N) to phosphorus (P) loss from land to water. However, it is unknown how these factors influence P concentrations in streams. We sought to evaluate differences in biotic and abiotic processes affecting stream sediment P dynamics under different temperature and N-enrichment regimes. Three sediments of varying P composition and sorption characteristics were placed into a fluvarium. Synthetic runoff water, with or without added N, was added to the flume's reservoir, and the solution was maintained at 19 or 26 degrees C. Water and sediment samples were taken with time since runoff was introduced. The rate and magnitude of P uptake by sediment was greater at 19 degrees C compared with 26 degrees C, and also when N was added compared with no N added. Analysis of sediment samples indicated that P uptake via abiotic processes was greater at 19 than at 26 degrees C. The addition of N stimulated P uptake by the microbial biomass at 19 degrees C, but microbial uptake was potentially inhibited at 26 degrees C. Because microbial biomass is a temporary store of P, these data suggest that more P may be available with increasing temperatures during the growing season, especially under baseflow, implying that strategies to mitigate P losses from land to water should be strengthened to prevent potential water quality impairment.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				MAR-APR	2017	46	2					295	301		10.2134/jeq2016.09.0352								WOS:000397864700008	28380551

Urea Release by Intermittently Saturated Sediments from a Coastal Agricultural Landscape	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Urea-N is linked to harmful algal blooms in lakes and estuaries, and urea-N-based fertilizers have been implicated as a source. However, the export of urea-N-based fertilizers appears unlikely, as high concentrations of urea-N are most commonly found in surface waters outside periods of fertilization. To evaluate possible autochthonous production of urea-N, we monitored urea-N released from drainage ditch sediments using mesocosms. Sediments from a cleaned (recently dredged) drainage ditch, uncleaned ditch, forested ditch, riparian wetland, and an autoclaved sand control were isolated in mesocosms and flooded for 72 h to quantify urea-N, NH4+-N, and NO3--N in the floodwater. Sediments were flooded with different N-amended solutions (distilled H2O, 1.5 mg L-1 NH4+-N, 3.0 mg L-1 NH4+-N, 2.6 mg L-1 NO3--N, or 5.1 mg L-1 NO3--N) and incubated at three water temperatures (16, 21, and 27 degrees C). Urea-N concentrations in mesocosms representing uncleaned and cleaned drainage ditches were significantly greater than nonagricultural sediments and controls. While flooding sediments with N-enriched solution had no clear effect on urea-N, warmer (27 degrees C) temperatures resulted in significantly higher urea-N. Data collected from field ditches that were flooded by a summer rainstorm showed increases in urea-N that mirrored the mesocosm experiment. We postulate that concentrations of urea-N in ditches that greatly exceed environmental thresholds are mediated by biological production in sediments and release to stagnant surface water. Storm-driven urea-N export from ditches could elevate the risk of harmful algal blooms downstream in receiving waters despite the dilution effect.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				MAR-APR	2017	46	2					302	310		10.2134/jeq2016.08.0304								WOS:000397864700009	28380555

Broiler Litter x Industrial By-Products Reduce Nutrients and Microbial Losses in Surface Runoff When Applied to Forages	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												The inability to incorporate broiler litter (BL) into permanent hayfields and pastures leads to nutrient accumulation near the soil surface and increases the potential transport of nutrients in runoff. This study was conducted on Marietta silt loam soil to determine the effect of flue gas desulfurization (FGD) gypsum and lignite on P, N, C, and microbial concentrations in runoff. Treatments were (i) control (unfertilized) and (ii) BL at 13.4 Mg ha(-1) alone or (iii) treated with either FGD gypsum or lignite applied at 20% (w/w) (2.68 Mg ha(-1)). Rainfall simulators were used to produce a 5.6 cm h(-1) storm event sufficient in duration to cause 15 min of continuous runoff. Repeated rains were applied at 3-d intervals to determine how long FGD gypsum and lignite are effective in reducing loss of litter-derived N, P, and C from soil. Application of BL increased N, P, and C concentrations in runoff as compared to the control. Addition of FGD gypsum reduced (P < 0.05) water-soluble P and dissolved organic C concentrations in runoff by 39 and 16%, respectively, as compared to BL alone. Lignite reduced runoff total N and NH4-N concentrations by 38 and 70%, respectively, as compared to BL alone. Addition of FGD gypsum or lignite failed to significantly reduce microbial loads in runoff, although both treatments reduced microbial concentration by > 20%. Thus, BL treated with FGD and lignite can be considered as cost-effective management practices in the mitigation of P, N, and C and possibly microbial concentration in runoff.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				MAR-APR	2017	46	2					339	347		10.2134/jeq2016.07.0255								WOS:000397864700013	28380557

Influence of Cattle Trails on Runoff Quantity and Quality	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Cattle trails in grazed pastures close to rivers may adversely affect surface water quality of the adjacent river by directing runoff to it. The objective of this 3-yr study (2013-2015) in southern Alberta, Canada, was to determine if cattle trails significantly increased the risk of runoff and contaminants (sediment, nutrients) compared with the adjacent grazed pasture (control). A portable rainfall simulator was used to generate artificial rainfall (140 mm h(-1)) and runoff. The runoff properties measured were time to runoff and initial abstraction (infiltration), total runoff depth and average runoff rates, as well as concentrations and mass loads of sediment, N, and P fractions. Cattle trails significantly (P <= 0.10) decreased time to runoff and initial abstraction (26-32%) in the 2 yr measured and increased total runoff depth, runoff coefficients, and average runoff rates (21-51%) in 2 of 3 yr. Concentrations of sediment, N, and P fractions in runoff were not significantly greater for cattle trails than for control areas. However, mass loads of total suspended solids (57-85% increase), NH4-N (31-90%), and dissolved reactive P (DRP) (30-92%) were significantly greater because of increased runoff volumes. Overall, runoff quantity and loads of sediment, NH4-N, and DRP were greater for cattle trails compared with the adjacent grazed pasture, and hydrologic connection with cattle-access sites on the riverbank suggests that this could adversely affect water quality in the adjacent river. Extrapolation of the study results should be tempered by the specific conditions represented by this rainfall simulation study.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				MAR-APR	2017	46	2					348	355		10.2134/jeq2016.07.0280								WOS:000397864700014	28380576

Waterbirds in protected waters have become a nuisance, however, as nutrients from fecal deposits transported by the waterbirds have served to severely deteriorate water quality. Despite the importance of clean water resources, the microecology of small agricultural reservoirs regularly colonized by transitory waterbirds are seldom reviewed. To improve our understanding of the influence of waterbirds on small bodies of water, a microcosm study was conducted using water and sediment from an agricultural reservoir inhabited by 300 to 500 great cormorants. Temporal changes in total nitrogen, total phosphorous, chemical oxygen demand, NH4+-N, PO43--P, and chlorophyll-a concentrations, in addition to the microbial community, were evaluated for microcosms containing 0, 0.5, 1.0, and 5.0 g of feces collected from a great cormorant colony. Chemical analysis of the water microcosm revealed that all microcosms showed both immediate and prolonged increases in nutrients due to the addition of feces. Additionally, a mere 0.5 g of feces doubled the concentration of chlorophyll-a from 2.1 +/- 0.99 to 5.2 mu 1.1 mg L-1 within 1 mo. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling of the microbial community structure revealed disturbances in both water and sediment microcosms. Disturbances to the microbial community in the water microcosm were significant only when 5.0 g of feces was added; however, disturbances to sediment microbial communities were induced by a smaller mass of feces. These results confirm the short-term water quality impairment and shift in microbial community structure caused by waterbird droppings and bird colony surface runoff in an agricultural reservoir.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				MAR-APR	2017	46	2					470	476		10.2134/jeq2016.11.0459								WOS:000397864700029	28380549

Model calibration is thus an essential task to obtain the optimal parameter values, which match simulations with observations as closely as possible. This study used the Zenne River Basin (Belgium) as a case study, which experiences high spatial heterogeneity in terms of geological formation, groundwater recharge, and rainfall-runoff responses. Therefore, the objectives of this paper were to calibrate the SWAT model on the basis of different calibration techniques and identify which technique is suitable for such a heterogeneous basin so that the calibrated SWAT can be used as a tool for integrated management of the Zenne River Basin. Prior to calibration, the sensitive parameters were identified on the basis of a detailed sensitivity analysis (SA) of the Latin hypercube one-factor-at-a-time (LH-OAT) technique and increased sampling intervals. Then, SWAT was calibrated by using single-site calibration (SSC) at the watershed outlet; sequential calibration (SC), calibration from upstream to downstream; and simultaneous multisite calibration (SMSC), where data of two flow gauging stations were simultaneously used in a single calibration. It was found that at least 200 sampling intervals should be considered for the LH-OAT SA method to obtain converged rankings of SWAT parameters. In addition, to well capture the spatial variability of heterogeneous catchment and achieve stable sensitivity ranking, simultaneous multisite SA technique is important. Streamflow findings suggested that the SC and the SMSC techniques provided very good results and significantly improved model performance, but the SSC results were merely satisfactory. Though the results of SC and SMSC techniques were similar, the SMSC was selected over SC because it simultaneously handles the entire catchment spatial variability by assigning different parameter values and allows data information communication among stations in a single calibration. It was thus concluded that simultaneous multisite calibration should be considered for catchments with a high spatial variability like the Zenne River Basin.

Weather whiplash in agricultural regions drives deterioration of water quality	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Excess nitrogen (N) impairs inland water quality and creates hypoxia in coastal ecosystems. Agriculture is the primary source of N; agricultural management and hydrology together control aquatic ecosystem N loading. Future N loading will be determined by how agriculture and hydrology intersect with climate change, yet the interactions between changing climate and water quality remain poorly understood. Here, we show that changing precipitation patterns, resulting from climate change, interact with agricultural land use to deteriorate water quality. We focus on the 2012-2013 Midwestern U.S. drought as a "natural experiment''. The transition from drought conditions in 2012 to a wet spring in 2013 was abrupt; the media dubbed this "weather whiplash''. We use recent (2010-2015) and historical data (1950-2015) to connect weather whiplash (drought-to-flood transitions) to increases in riverine N loads and concentrations. The drought likely created highly N-enriched soils; this excess N mobilized during heavy spring rains (2013), resulting in a 34% increase (10.5 vs. 7.8 mg N L-1) in the flow-weighted mean annual nitrate concentration compared to recent years. Furthermore, we show that climate change will likely intensify weather whiplash. Increased weather whiplash will, in part, increase the frequency of riverine N exceeding E.P.A. drinking water standards. Thus, our observations suggest increased climatic variation will amplify negative trends in water quality in a region already grappling with severe impairments.

Furthermore treated municipal wastewater quality depends on the fresh water quality and usage as well as on the wastewater treatment plant's degree and efficiency. The main recipient of all chemical compounds contained in this effluent, via irrigation, is soil. Models have been developed to predict factors involved in contaminants movement phenomenon through soil. In the reused effluent, chloride is much of a concern as a conservative pollutant. In this work the chloride breakthrough curves were determined for a clay-loam packed soil column by applying a one dimensional advection dispersion equation, to obtain estimates of the solute transport parameters. The comparisons between experimental and calculated results were satisfactory and also conclusions were derived about the flow conditions in the soil column and its uniformity. Also comparisons were made between calculated and cited in the literature values of the parameters satisfactorily.																	0007-4861	1432-0800				MAR	2017	98	3					378	384		10.1007/s00128-016-1867-7								WOS:000396136200014	27372456

Eight heavy metals including chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), arsenic (As), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and mercury (Hg) were determined using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). Among the tested heavy metals, Cd and Hg were detected in all surface water samples. The concentrations of Cr, Cd, Ni, and Pb were relatively lower than those of other metals in the four lakes. Results of Kohonen self-organizing map indicated that all the sampling sites in four lakes of the Great Rift Valley in Kenya could be classified into three different groups based on the heavy metal pollution. Lake Naivasha and Nakuru had characteristics of low concentrations of Cr, Ni, Cu, As, and Hg. Lake Bogoria was characterized by high levels of Ni, Cu, Cd, and Hg, and low levels of Pb, Cr, Zn, and As. Lake Elementaita showed characteristics of high concentrations of As and Hg and low concentrations of Pb, Ni, Cu, and Cd. Source identification using principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that anthropogenic factor played an increasingly important role in the heavy metal pollution of four lakes of the Great Rift Valley in Kenya, East Africa.

Comparing the response of a catchment-lake model chain to climate predictions	CLIMATIC CHANGE												We constructed a model chain into which regional climate-related variables (air temperature, precipitation) and a lake's main tributary hydrological indicators (river flow, dissolved inorganic carbon) were employed for predicting the evolution of planktonic blue-green algae (cyanobacteria) and zooplankton (rotifer) biomass in that lake for the mid-21st century. Simulations were based on the future climate predicted under both the Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios which, combined with three realistic policy-making and basin land-use evolution lead to six scenarios for future water quality. Model outputs revealed that mean annual river flow is expected to decline between 3 and 20%, depending on the scenario. Concentration of river dissolved inorganic carbon is predicted to follow the opposite trend and might soar up to twice the 2005-2014 average concentration. Lake planktonic primary producers will display quantitative changes in the future decades whereas zooplankters will not. A 2 to 10% increase in mean cyanobacteria biomass is accompanied by a stagnation (-3 to +2%) of rotifer biomass. Changes in cyanobacteria and rotifer phenology are expected: a surge of cyanobacteria biomass in winter and a shortening of the rotifer biomass spring peak. The expected quantitative changes on the biota were magnified in those scenarios where forested area conversions to cropland and water abstraction were the greatest.

Forty-eight surfers enrolled in the study and completed an initial health background survey and weekly health surveys online using Survey Monkey. Descriptive statistics and generalized estimating equation, a regression technique, were used to identify longitudinal and correlated results. The surfers were predominately Caucasian, male, and physically active. They surfed approximately 4 h a week. Their average age was 34 years. The data indicated that the surfers were generally "healthy,'' with a low prevalence of diabetes, high cholesterol, and hypertension. Their most common health problems were allergies and asthma. During the study, 10% of the surfers reported gastrointestinal symptoms and 29% reported upper respiratory symptoms. This study suggests surfers were significantly more likely to report upper respiratory symptoms when they had a history of allergies, housemates with upper respiratory symptoms, and/or a history of previous adverse health symptoms while surfing during a "red tide'' (an event often associated with the presence of phytoplankton toxins). Additionally, female surfers reported upper respiratory symptoms more than males.

Flow-directed PCA for monitoring networks	ENVIRONMETRICS												Measurements recorded over monitoring networks often possess spatial and temporal correlation inducing redundancies in the information provided. For river water quality monitoring in particular, flow-connected sites may likely provide similar information. This paper proposes a novel approach to principal components analysis to investigate reducing dimensionality for spatiotemporal flow-connected network data in order to identify common spatiotemporal patterns. The method is illustrated using monthly observations of total oxidized nitrogen for the Trent catchment area in England. Common patterns are revealed that are hidden when the river network structure and temporal correlation are not accounted for. Such patterns provide valuable information for the design of future sampling strategies.																	1180-4009	1099-095X				MAR	2017	28	2							e2434	10.1002/env.2434								WOS:000397270000001	28344443

However, existing LC products, derived primarily from satellite spectral imagery, each have different temporal and spatial resolutions and different LC classes. Most effort is focused on either fusing a pair of LC products over a small space-time region or on interpolating missing values in an individual LC product. Here, we review the complexities of LC identification and propose a method for fusing multiple existing LC products to produce a single LC record for a large spatial-temporal grid, referred to as spatio-temporal categorical map fusion. We first reconcile the LC classes of different LC products and then present a probabilistic weighted nearest neighbor estimator of LC class. This estimator depends on three unknown parameters that are estimated using numerical optimization to maximize an agreement criterion that we define. We illustrate the method using six LC products over the Rocky Mountains and show the improvement gained by supplying the optimization with data-driven information describing the spatial-temporal behavior of each LC class. Given the massive size of the LC products, we show how the optimal parameters for a given year are often optimal for other years, leading to shorter computing times.																	1180-4009	1099-095X				MAR	2017	28	2							e2429	10.1002/env.2429								WOS:000397270000004

Based on measurements at 46 sampling points in the study's coastal area in May, August, and October 2011, the seasonal and spatial characteristics of the chemical indicators and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) were analyzed. The chemical indicators for pH, chemical oxygen demand (COD), and reactive silicate (SiO3-Si) showed higher concentrations in the summer than in the spring and fall, whereas the nutrients of reactive phosphate (PO4-P) and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) presented complex seasonal characteristics under the combined influence of abundant nutrients from rivers and nutrient consumption by large algal bloom in August. Subsequently, two methods a fuzzy, integrated assessment and an organic pollution index were used to characterize the organic pollution. The trophic status of most coastal waters were oligotrophic and mesotrophic, and most coastal waters were clean in spring and summer, except in the vicinity of the harbor and estuaries, where the organic pollution index was generally high. Finally, Pearson correlation coefficients of various variables were analyzed, which demonstrated that, commonly, there was a significant positive correlation between COD and Chl-a. Because algal blooms in August changed the nutrients structure of the coastal waters, Chl-a, in a remarkably high concentration, had significant correlation with NO2-N, the atomic N/P ratio, and the atomic N/Si ratio. The algal bloom aggravated the current P limitation, and the atomic N/P ratio, the PO4-P concentration, and the COD can be selected as the three most-sensitive indicators of algal bloom in Qinhuangdao coastal water. These findings have provided scientific supports for local authorities who are taking measures to control pollution emissions and to prevent the recurrence of algal blooms.

THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AND FILAMENTOUS ALGAE MAT FORMATION IN TWO AGRICULTURAL INFLUENCED SOUTH AFRICAN RIVERS	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												The regulation of nutrient inputs into rivers dominated by agriculture land use activities is an important aspect of ecological resilience of aquatic systems and the management of river eutrophication. The overabundance of benthic filamentous algae mats in river systems due to nutrient enrichment can modify the habitats of macroinvertebrate and fish communities as well as clogging irrigation crop sprayers of downstream water users. The current study examined over a period of 2 years (2013-2014) the interplay between physical and chemical river characteristics and epilithic filamentous algae biomass in two South African agricultural influenced rivers. The study area consisted of the Touw and Duiwe Rivers, which run into a proclaimed Ramsar site, namely, the Wilderness Lake System. A strong positive correlation was observed between the maximum filamentous algae biomass (97 chl-a mgm(-2)) observed during the dry season and the average water column alkalinity > 30 mg l(-1). The benthic trophic status of the nine sampling sites during the dry seasons indicated the highest benthic algae biomass with mesotrophic (1.7-21 chl-a mgm(-2)) to hypertrophic (> 84 chl-a mgm(-2)) conditions. During the dry season, only three sampling sites were below the suggested guideline value (35 mu g l(-1)) for total phosphorus (TP), while four sampling sites were below the total nitrogen guideline of 252 mu g l(-1). In the wet season, two sites were below TP values with five sites below total nitrogen guideline values. From the data gathered, it was evident that water column alkalinity and hardness were the main drivers for the formation or absence of benthic filamentous algae mats in the two river systems and that nitrogen and/or phosphorus concentrations was overshadowed by the physical and chemical characteristics of the river systems at certain sites. Nutrient results for the river bottom sediments revealed that the sediment qualities were variable at the different sampling sites, but more specifically along the longitudinal paths of flow. It was apparent that the high TP concentrations in the water column and bottom sediment, which were lowest during the dry season, were associated with the highest epilithic filamentous algae mat formation. The outcome of the current study shows that a more holistic approach must be followed for the development of future eutrophication guidelines and nutrient thresholds in South African rivers influenced by agriculture land use activities.

Specifically, we develop a possible probabilistic model of sensor measurement error and the measurement error model is embedded into a simulation model of a river system. An optimization algorithm is used to find the optimal sensor locations that minimize the expected time until a spill detection in the presence of a constraint on the probability of detecting a spill. The experimental results show that the optimal sensor locations are highly sensitive to the variability of measurement error and false alarm rates are often unacceptably high. An SPC method is useful in finding thresholds that guarantee a false alarm rate no more than a pre-specified target level, and an optimization algorithm combined with the thresholds finds a robust sensor network.

Biomarkers such as oxidase enzymes are especially useful indicators because they represent a direct biological response to environmental toxicity. A luminometer was used to quantify oxidase enzyme production in watercress (Nasturtium officinale) due to toxic chemical exposure of E85 (85% ethanol and 15% gasoline blend), gasoline, and 99% pure ethanol over a 72-h period in aquatic root exposure and volatile leaf exposure experiments. Aquatic exposure to E85 caused an increase in oxidative enzyme production while gasoline and ethanol caused no significant changes in oxidase concentrations. Aquatic root exposure results were compared to volatile leaf exposures where effects of E85, gasoline, and ethanol caused increases in oxidase production. Morphometric measurements were also conducted as plant stress comparisons to oxidative enzyme analyses. Measurements of root length showed increases in root growth at some concentrations of fuels with only the highest concentration of E85 resulting in a decrease in root growth when compared to the control.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				MAR	2017	228	3							117	10.1007/s11270-017-3302-z								WOS:000397821100032

The Impact of Climate Change on Metal Transport in a Lowland Catchment	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												This study investigates the impact of future climate change on heavy metal (i.e., Cd and Zn) transport from soils to surface waters in a contaminated lowland catchment. The WALRUS hydrological model is employed in a semi-distributed manner to simulate current and future hydrological fluxes in the Dommel catchment in the Netherlands. The model is forced with climate change projections and the simulated fluxes are used as input to a metal transport model that simulates heavy metal concentrations and loads in quickflow and baseflow pathways. Metal transport is simulated under baseline climate ("2000-2010") and future climate ("2090-2099") conditions including scenarios for no climate change and climate change. The outcomes show an increase in Cd and Zn loads and the mean flux-weighted Cd and Zn concentrations in the discharged runoff, which is attributed to breakthrough of heavy metals from the soil system. Due to climate change, runoff enhances and leaching is accelerated, resulting in enhanced Cd and Zn loads. Mean flux-weighted concentrations in the discharged runoff increase during early summer and decrease during late summer and early autumn under the most extreme scenario of climate change. The results of this study provide improved understanding on the processes responsible for future changes in heavy metal contamination in lowland catchments.

Coal Mine Water Pollution and Ecological Impairment of One of Australia's Most 'Protected' High Conservation-Value Rivers	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												The environmental regulation of a coal mine in the greater Sydney area has failed to recognise the importance of and protect a high conservation-value river located in a World Heritage listed area. This study measured the water quality and ecological health (using macroinvertebrates) of the Wollangambe River and its tributaries near the point of the waste water discharge of a coal mine and assessed the longitudinal impact for 22 km downstream. The investigation revealed two important aspects. The first is the significant impact of the waste water discharge when compared to the otherwise near-pristine condition of the high conservation-value river system. The second is the spatial extent of the pollution from the mine that extends at least 22 km downstream from the outflow of coal mine wastes. The resulting water pollution is causing major impairment of the aquatic ecosystem, with reduced abundance, taxonomic richness and loss of pollution-sensitive macroin-vertebrate groups. Water pollution from the mine includes thermal pollution, increased salinity and increased concentrations of zinc and nickel. The mine's waste discharge also strongly modified the river's ionic composition. The study also highlights the failure of the regulatory and governance systems that enable the mine to operate in a manner that causes major environmental impacts.

A commonly used water quality simulation model, Qual2K, was linked to a Genetic Algorithm optimization model for exploration of relevant fuzzy objective-function formulations for addressing imprecision and conflicting goals of pollution control agencies and various dischargers. Results showed a dynamic flow dependence of optimal wastewater loading with good convergence to near global optimum. Explicit considerations of real-world technological limitations, which were developed here in a new S-O framework, led to better compromise solutions between conflicting goals than those identified within traditional S-O frameworks. The newly developed framework, in addition to being more technologically realistic, is also less complicated and converges on solutions more rapidly than traditional frameworks. This technique marks a significant step forward for development of holistic, riverscape-based approaches that balance the conflicting needs of the stakeholders.				jaafarzadeh, neemat/M-1190-2017	jaafarzadeh, neemat/0000-0003-2516-2340; Destouni, Georgia/0000-0001-9408-4425												1061-4303	1554-7531				MAR 1	2017	89	3					211	220		10.2175/106143017X14839994523866								WOS:000397300200002	28236817

The integrated WASP and WQI(5) tool was field- tested to assess pollutant loadings and their impacts on river environment. Suspended solid (SS) and electric conductivity (EC) correlation equations and the WQI(5) calculation tool were included in the water quality model and direct WQI(5) calculation. The SS concentration, which was influenced by river flows, had crucial effects on river water quality and WQI(5) values. EC value was controlled by dissolution of soil minerals, which was affected by the watershed drainage area and surface runoff.

Water quality and antifungal susceptibility of opportunistic yeast pathogens from rivers	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Yeasts from water sources have been associated with diseases ranging from superficial mucosal infections to life threatening diseases. The aim of this study was to determine the water quality as well as diversity and antifungal susceptibility of yeasts from two rivers. Yeast levels and physicochemical parameter data were analyzed by principal component analysis to determine correlations between physico-chemical data and yeast levels. Yeast morphotypes were identified by biochemical tests and 26S rRNA gene sequencing. Disk diffusion antifungal susceptibility tests were conducted. Physico-chemical parameters of the water were within target water quality range (TWQR) for livestock farming. For irrigational use, total dissolved solids and nitrates were not within the TWQR. Yeast levels ranged between 27 +/- 10 and 2,573 +/- 306 cfu/L. Only non-pigmented, ascomycetous yeasts were isolated. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida glabrata were most frequently isolated. Several other opportunistic pathogens were also isolated. A large number of isolates were resistant to azoles, especially fluconazole, but also to other antifungal classes. Candida species were resistant to almost all the antifungal classes. These water sources are used for recreation and religious as well as for watering livestock and irrigation. Of particular concern is the direct contact of individuals with opportunistic yeast, especially the immune-compromised. Resistance of these yeast species to antifungal agents is a further health concern.

Minimization of total treatment and penalty costs and minimization of biological oxygen demand violation of standards at the check point are considered as the main objectives of this study. At first, the water quality along the river was simulated using the Streeter-Phelps (S-P) equation coupled with the MOPSO model. Thereby a trade-off curve between the objectives is obtained and a set of non-dominated solutions is selected. In the next step, the best alternative is chosen using MCDM techniques and the GMCRII DSS package and non-cooperative stability definitions. The applicability and efficiency of the methodology are examined in a real-world case study of the Sefidrud River in the northern part of Iran.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				MAR	2017	75	6					1512	1522		10.2166/wst.2016.429								WOS:000397590800025	28333067

Investigation and control of seawater intrusion in the Eastern Nile Delta aquifer considering climate change	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												Seawater intrusion is considered one of the main processes that degrade water quality by raising salinity. Over-pumping and decreasing recharge are considered the main causes of saltwater intrusion. Moreover, climate change and sea-level rise accelerate saltwater intrusion. In this paper SEAWAT code was used to study groundwater flow and seawater intrusion in the Eastern Nile Delta aquifer considering four scenarios of climate change including sea-level rise, increasing abstraction, decreasing recharge and the combination of these scenarios. The results showed that decreasing recharge has a significant effect on seawater intrusion. However, the combinations of these scenarios resulted in harmful intrusion and loss of groundwater. The soil salinity increased, which decreased agricultural production. The control of seawater intrusion and protection of groundwater resources and soil is very important. Different scenarios were implemented to protect the aquifer from seawater intrusion including decreasing abstraction, increasing recharge, abstracting brackish water and the combination of these three scenarios. The abstraction of brackish water gave a higher reduction of seawater intrusion and decreased groundwater table in the aquifer near the shore line, which protected the soil from salinity and increased agricultural production. However, the combination of these three scenarios gave the highest reduction of seawater intrusion.																	1606-9749					MAR	2017	17	2					311	323		10.2166/ws.2016.129								WOS:000398000000001

Despite the substantial resources invested to provide safe water, there is a significant number of water points that are non-functional. Knowledge of the degree of sustainability and the contributing factors for rural water supply projects is limited. This study employs the fuzzy set concept to assess the degree of sustainability of water points in seven Local Government Authorities (LGAs) of Dodoma region in Tanzania. Dodoma region lies in the semi-arid area of Tanzania where boreholes are the major sources of water supply. Due to limited information, four dimensions of sustainability of water projects were used in this study. These include water quantity from the water sources, water quality, institution setting with regard to community participation in meetings, and financing of the projects for operation and maintenance. The multidimensional sustainability indices of water points were determined. The results indicate that only two LGAs, of Bahi and Kondoa, have sustainable water points with sustainability indices of 0.86 and 0.83, respectively. Kongwa has the lowest sustainability index of 0.17 due to poor water quality and inadequate quantity of water from the boreholes.																	1606-9749					MAR	2017	17	2					372	380		10.2166/ws.2016.141								WOS:000398000000006

Implementing tactical plans to improve water-energy loss management	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												Water utilities are aware of the water-energy loss relevance in supply systems. However, they still mainly focus on daily water loss control (real and apparent losses), without considering the impact on embedded energy.

The results indicate that preventive or remediation actions are necessary to improve its water quality. Water samples were collected between 2012 and 2013 at five sampling stations at the Mopanshan Reservoir, and analyzed for CODMn and total nitrogen (TN). SPSS software was used to carry out analysis of variance and correlation analysis. Spatially, CODMn and TN exhibited a rather small distinction in the horizontal direction, but there was a significant difference regarding TN in the vertical orientation. The concentration of TN also increased with the increase in sampling depth. Seasonally, the concentration of CODMn and TN showed a pronounced seasonal pattern and was divided into four periods. CODMn reached a maximum in September and was at a minimum in June. And TN reached a maximum in June and was at a minimum in November or December. The use of correlation analysis shows that the regular variations of TN were primarily affected by temperature. The main form of nitrogen in the Mopanshan Reservoir is NO3-N, and the change of TN is consistent with that of NO3-N. By Pearson correlation coefficient, the seasonal variability of CODMn correlated to changes in the reservoir's water level. The results showed that the concentration of TN exceeded the guideline values in most months and CODMn was slightly over the standard limit. Thus, it is urgent that preventive actions and remediation processes are developed to improve the water quality in this reservoir.																	1606-9749					MAR	2017	17	2					389	398		10.2166/ws.2016.118								WOS:000398000000008

Islamabad is the capital city, located at the foot of the Margallah Hills, whereas Rawalpindi lies in the Potohar Plateau. Both cities are located in the semi-arid region of Pakistan, where the residents meet their basic need of water through groundwater resources. For the lastmany years, the quantity and quality of groundwater in these cities has been deteriorating very rapidly. In this study, the foremost recharge source for these cities was identified using tritium and major ion chemistry, and different physiochemical parameters were studied to find out the facts behind the quality deterioration of the groundwater. Tritiumvalues and chemical data suggested that aquifers located in the territory of Islamabad were mainly recharged by upland areas (theMargalla Hills), which accounts for their low electrical conductivity and total dissolved solids contents. A higher sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) suggested an alteration in recharge patterns through soil compaction and cementation (from increased construction activity) that reduced the recharge inputs. The high SAR also disturbs the recharge pattern and had disturbed the natural equilibrium of the groundwater system, deteriorating the quality of the water.																	1606-9749					MAR	2017	17	2					433	451		10.2166/ws.2016.149								WOS:000398000000012

A serious shortcoming of the debate is that there are differences in the design and management of rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems. This study is based on the performance of two RWH systems that are used for drinking purposes at a kindergarten and a primary school in Cu Khe, Vietnam. Each system comprised a painted galvanized iron roof, a first-flush diverter, two stainless steel tanks connected in series, a calmed inlet, mosquito screens on open holes, PVC pipelines, filter cartridges, and a UV sterilizer. During 18 months, stored rainwater was sampled five times, and treated rainwater was sampled four times. Twenty-three water quality parameters were analyzed, including pH, total dissolved solids, turbidity, nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, hardness, arsenic, iron, cadmium, nickel, chromium, manganese, mercury, selenium, lead, zinc, Escherichia coli, and total coliform. It was found that all the physicochemical qualities of the stored rainwater, prior to treatment, satisfied the World Health Organization (WHO) drinking water guidelines. After physical filtration and UV sterilization, all parameters, including microbiological indicators, satisfied the WHO drinking water guidelines. Further management strategies to stabilize water quality were discussed.																	1606-9749					MAR	2017	17	2					452	460		10.2166/ws.2016.154								WOS:000398000000013

A case assessment in China	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												The overall purpose was to assess the feasibilities of recycling filter backwash water (FBWW) and combined filter backwash water (CFBWW) in a drinking water treatment plant in south China. The variations of regular water-quality indexes, metal indexes (Al, Mn and Cd), polyacrylamide and disinfection by-product indexes (trihalomethanes and their formation potentials) along with the treatment and the recycling processes were monitored. Results showed the recycling procedure caused increases of turbidity, total solids, ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), permanganate index (CODMn), and dissolved organic carbon, Al, Mn and Cd concentrations in a mixture of raw water and FBWW or CFBWW compared to those in raw water. However, the recycling procedure had negligible impacts on the qualities of settled water and filtered water because most of the contaminants could be effectively removed by the conventional water treatment process. Although recycling did cause slight increases of NH3-N and CODMn levels in settled water and filtered water, the quality of finished water always conformed to Chinese standards for drinking water quality according to the surveyed indexes in the present study. Thus, it is appropriate to recycle waste streams in water-stressed areas if the source water is well managed and the water treatment processes are carefully conducted.

J	Boroumand, A; Rajaee, T				Boroumand, Amir; Rajaee, Taher			Discrete entropy theory for optimal redesigning of salinity monitoring network in San Francisco bay	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												The paper presents an entropy-based method for designing an optimum bay water salinity monitoring network in San Francisco bay (S. F. bay) considering maximum-monitoring-information and minimum-data-lost criteria. Due to cost concerns, it is necessary to design the optimal salinity monitoring network with a minimal number of sampling stations to provide reliable data. The monthly data recorded from January 1995 to December 2014 were obtained over 37 active stations located in S. F. bay and is applied in the research. Transinformation entropy in discrete mode is used to calculate the stations' optimum distance. The discrete approach uses the frequency table to calculate transinformation measures. After calculating these measures, a transinformation-distance (T-D) curve is developed. Then, the optimum distance between salinity monitoring stations is elicited from the curve. The study shows that the S. F. bay salinity monitoring stations provide redundant information and the existing stations can be reduced to 21 with an approximate distance of 7.5 km. The coverage of the proposed monitoring network by using the optimum distance is complete and the system does not generate redundant data. The results of this research indicate that transinformation entropy is a promising method for the design of monitoring networks in bays such as those found in San Francisco bay.																	1606-9749					MAR	2017	17	2					606	612		10.2166/ws.2016.110								WOS:000398000000029

Designing constructed wetlands for reclamation of pretreated wastewater and stormwater	REVIEWS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND BIO-TECHNOLOGY												Wastewater reclamation is getting greater attention as an alternative to conventional approaches to wastewater treatment and water supply due to increasing water stress coupled with more stringent water quality limitation for discharge of treated wastewater. Among the few technologies adopted in the field for wastewater reclamation, constructed wetlands have been used to reclaim both primary and secondary treated wastewater in regions with arid and humid climates. This paper summarizes the widely adopted guidelines that need to be considered when designing constructed wetlands for wastewater reclamation, discusses the capacity of wetland treatment systems for water reuse while assessing the status of full-scale constructed wetlands designed for wastewater reclamation, and develops contaminant loading charts as a design tool based on the performance of existing full-scale constructed wetlands deployed for wastewater reclamation. It is evident that constructed wetland systems provide a viable means to treat wastewater to the levels required for low-quality reuses such as restricted irrigation and impoundment. It is challenging for constructed wetlands to consistently meet microbiological guidelines for high-quality reuses such as unrestricted agricultural and urban reuses. Wastewater reclaimed through constructed wetlands is used mainly for agricultural and landscape irrigation, groundwater recharge, indirect potable reuse, and environmental reuse. Surface area and hydraulic loading rate of constructed wetlands to be deployed for wastewater reclamation can be estimated with contaminant loading charts derived from monitoring data of existing full-scale operations.

J	Ding, TD; Zhang, JY; Ni, WM; Li, JY				Ding, Tengda; Zhang, Jianying; Ni, Wanmin; Li, Juying			Combined toxicity of arsenite and dimethylarsenic acid on the freshwater diatom Nitzschia palea	ECOTOXICOLOGY												The toxicity and bioavailability of single arsenic species have been widely investigated, however, the biological effects of mixed arsenic species co-existing in natural waters still remain unknown. The objective of this work was to discern the adverse effects of combined arsenite (As(III)) and dimethylarsenic acid (DMA) on diatom Nitzschia palea. The combined ecotoxicity of As(III) and DMA on N. palea was observed to be time-dependent and showed dose-effect relation. The toxicity of DMA and As(III) mixture was higher than individual DMA or As(III) when the As(III) concentration was in the range of 0.085-0.316 mg L-1. As the As(III) concentration increased from 0.487 to 0.858 mg L-1, the antagonistic effect was found, which could be due to the higher thiols contents in the thiol-containing proteins (e.g., frustulins, silaffins and other glycoproteins). The content of malondialdehyde (MDA) in the treatment of mixed arsenic species was found to be at the same level compared to the As-free control after 72 h of exposure, indicating that the co-toxicity of As(III) and DMA on diatom frustules was not significant. Furthermore, the increase of frustule formation rate in the mixture of EC50 As(III)-EC10 DMA at 72 h exposure time indicated that the damaged diatom cell walls was likely repaired gradually. The results from this study suggested that the effects of co-existed arsenic species were concentration-specific and should be considered in the risk assessment of arsenic and development of water quality criteria for the protection of aquatic ecosystems.

Mining activities and the resulting high loads of heavy metals interact with intensive acid rain, and often have great consequences for biodiversity. However, considering the frequently episodic nature of these heavy acid rains, there is little detailed evidence of direct impacts. In 2011 we observed a massive mortality of noble crayfish and stone crayfish in PadrA<yen>sko Special Area of Conservation (SAC) in the Brdy Mountain region of the Czech Republic. Based on concentrations of metals (Al, Fe, As, Cd, Pb, Cu, Zn and Hg) in various tissues (gills, hepatopancreas, muscle) of both dead and live crayfish in this locality compared to reference populations, these crayfish had experienced long-term exposure to increased levels of these metals. Here we give detailed documentation of crayfish mortality associated with high metal concentrations in the gills and other tissues of these endangered invertebrates.

J	Proia, L; Romani, A; Sabater, S				Proia, Lorenzo; Romani, Anna; Sabater, Sergi			Biofilm phosphorus uptake capacity as a tool for the assessment of pollutant effects in river ecosystems	ECOTOXICOLOGY												Biofilms are a key component in the nutrient removal from the water column. However, nutrient uptake by biofilms may be hampered by the occurrence of pollutants or other stressors. This study aimed: (i) to investigate the biofilm phosphorus (P) uptake capacity as a relevant process for the maintenance of fluvial water quality and (ii) to explore the sensitivity of this process to different chemical and environmental stressors. We conducted chamber experiments to test for the relevance of biofilm P uptake capacity (PUC) as a tool to detect effects of pollutants on river self-depuration. PUC was calculated by measuring P temporal decay after performing controlled P-spikes in chambers with biofilm-colonized tiles. Four different experiments were conducted to evaluate the response of PUC to: (a) several river waters from increasing polluted sites; (b) the effect of the bactericide triclosan (TCS); (c) the combined effect of TCS and grazers; and (d) the effect of TCS after a drought episode that affected the biofilms. These experiments showed that biofilms decreased their PUC along the pollution gradient. The biofilm PUC was significantly reduced after receiving high TCS concentrations, though lower TCS concentrations also affected the biofilm when this was submitted to grazing pressure. PUC decrease was induced by flow interruption which further enhanced the TCS negative effects. Overall, PUC was sensitive to the effects of pollutants like TCS as well as to the action of biological (grazing) and environmental (drought) factors. The study also showed that multiple stressors enhance the negative effects of pollutants on the PUC of biofilms. Our study values the use of biofilms' PUC as a sensitive ecological-based tool to assess the effects of chemicals on freshwater communities and their derived functioning in river ecosystems.

Two hundred and ninety-two drinking water samples were randomly collected in the study area. These samples were chemically analyzed for three key toxic (in excess) elements such as pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), and calcium. Geostatistical techniques such as variogram and kriging were used to investigate the spatial variations of these minerals across the city. The spatial structure for each element was found to be anisotropic, and thus, anisotropic variograms were used. The kriging predictions revealed significant concentrations of the above stated elements at some locations in the study area. While comparing with the World Health Organization, United States Environmental Protection Agency, and Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency standards, the water samples were found to be unsatisfactory for drinking. We conclude that the drinking water in this region is of poor quality and needs proper treatment to make it palatable.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				MAR	2017	189	3							119	10.1007/s10661-017-5822-9								WOS:000395000800026	28220444					
J	Roach, B; Walker, TR				Roach, Brynn; Walker, Tony R.			Aquatic monitoring programs conducted during environmental impact assessments in Canada: preliminary assessment before and after weakened environmental regulation	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Aquatic monitoring programs are imperative for the functioning of the environmental impact assessment (EIA) process and a cornerstone for industrial compliance in Canada. However, in 2012, several leading pieces of federal environmental legislation (e.g., Canadian Environmental Assessment Act c. 19, s. 52, 2012) were drastically altered, effectively weakening levels of environmental protection for aquatic ecosystems during project developments. This paper assesses the impact of CEAA 2012 on aquatic monitoring programs (and subsequent monitoring data reporting) across Canada for ten projects (five completed preCEAA 2012 and five completed post-CEAA 2012). Projects included four energy and six mining projects and were selected based on the following criteria: (i) representative of Canada's resource economy; (ii) project information was publicly available; and (iii) strong public interest. Projects pre-and post-CEAA 2012 exhibited few apparent differences before and after environmental regulatory changes. However, wide discrepancies exist in numbers and types of parameters reported, along with a lack of consistency in reporting. Projects pre-CEAA 2012 provided more follow-up monitoring commitments. Although qualitative differences remain inconclusive, this paper highlights requirements for further assessment of aquatic monitoring and follow-up programs in Canada. Recommendations for the government to consider during reviews of the federal environmental assessment processes include (i) improved transparency on the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency website (https://www.ceaa-acee.gc.ca/); (ii) creation of a legally binding standardized aquatic monitoring program framework to ensure that all Canadian aquatic ecosystems are monitored with equal rigour; and (iii) commitments and justification related to frequency of aquatic monitoring of water quality.

Hydrochemical characterization and pollution assessment of groundwater in Jammu Siwaliks, India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Physico-chemical groundwater (GW) parameters were evaluated to understand the hydrogeochemical processes in the Siwalik plains of Jammu and Kashmir, India. During the 2012-2013 post-monsoon (POM) and pre-monsoon (PRM) seasons, GW samples (n = 207) from deep bore wells and shallow open wells were chemically analysed. Cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+ and Fe2+) and anions (HCO3, Cl-, SO4 (2)-and F-) showed a wide spatio-temporal variation. Results suggest that weathering and dissolution of carbonates and silicate rocks is the main source of water mineralization. The major hydrochemical facies is characterized by CaMg- HCO3 and Ca-HCO3 during the PRM and POM seasons respectively. The presence of sulphate-bearing water in a large number of the samples indicates a significant role of gypsum dissolution and anthropogenic contamination of the GW. Factor analysis (FA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) revealed that the variability of hydrochemistry is mainly related to rockwater interaction, dissolution of carbonates and other lithological units as well as the influence of anthropogenic activities in the area. Overall, it was found that the GW quality is within the limits of human consumption. The higher concentration of a few chemicals indicates an increasing trend of industrial contamination of the GW. For sustainable development of the portableGWin Siwaliks, it is necessary to minimize the adverse impacts of the anthropogenic and industrial contamination on the GW resources through best management practices and prevent its further contamination to a level that could make GW unsuitable for human uses.

ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Long-term data from a network of intensively monitored research catchments in Finland was analysed. We studied temporal (1981-2010) and spatial variability in nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), from 1987 losses, both from agricultural and forestry land. Based on trend analysis, total nitrogen (TN) concentrations increased in two of the four agricultural sites and in most of the forested sites. In agricultural catchments, the total phosphorus (TP) trends were decreasing in two of the four catchments studied. Dissolved P (DRP) concentrations increased in two catchments and decreased in one. The increase in DRP concentration can be a result of reducing erosion by increased non-plough cultivation and direct sowing. In forested catchments, the TP trends in 1987-2011 were significantly decreasing in three of the six catchments, while DRP concentrations decreased significantly in all sites. At the same time, P fertilisation in Finnish forests has decreased significantly, thus contributing to these changes. The mean annual specific loss for agricultural land was on average 15.5 kg ha(-1) year(-1) for N and 1.1 kg ha(-1) year(-1) for P. In the national scale, total TN loading from agriculture varied between 34,000-37,000 t year(-1) and total P loading 2400-2700 t year(-1) These new load estimates are of the same order than those reported earlier, emphasising the need for more efforts with wide-ranging and carefully targeted implementation of water protection measures.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				MAR	2017	189	3							95	10.1007/s10661-017-5791-z								WOS:000395000800002	28161881

This paper summarized available data in the published literature (2008-2016) on water fluoride from the EFAs in China before and after water quality was improved. Based on these obtained data, health risk assessment of Chinese residents' exposure to fluoride in improved drinking water was performed by means of a probabilistic approach. The uncertainties in the risk estimates were quantified using Monte Carlo simulation and sensitivity analysis. Our results showed that in general, the average fluoride levels (0.10-2.24 mg/L) in the improved drinking water in the EFAs of China were lower than the pre-intervention levels (0.30-15.24 mg/L). The highest fluoride levels were detected in North and Southwest China. The mean non-carcinogenic risks associated with consumption of the improved drinking water for Chinese residents were mostly accepted (hazard quotient < 1), but the non carcinogenic risk of children in most of the EFAs at the 95th percentile exceeded the safe level of 1, indicating the potential non-cancer-causing health effects on this fluoride-exposed population. Sensitivity analyses indicated that fluoride concentration in drinking water, ingestion rate of water, and the exposure time in the shower were the most relevant variables in the model, therefore, efforts should focus mainly on the definition of their probability distributions for a more accurate risk assessment.

In this study, several online real-time sensors were utilized to monitor effluent from a wastewater fed laboratory-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) under natural and simulated failure conditions. These simulated failures included adding reactor mixed liquor to emulate a membrane breach, and spiking MS2 bacteriophage into the reactor to create a high viral load, which might be observed during an outbreak. The CANARY event detection software was used to analyze sensor data and report changes in water quality that might be indicative of poor system behavior. During simulated failure conditions, CANARY reported 20 alarms, accurately detecting each failure. During natural operating conditions, 219 alarms were produced and 189 were attributed to known events (e.g., system and sensor maintenance). The remaining alarms (23) during natural operating conditions were considered to have an unknown cause. However, 13 of those had signal deviations similar to known events, but could not be definitively linked to a source. The results of this study suggest that real-time monitoring in conjunction with CANARY analysis may be useful as an early warning system for monitoring the effluent of water reuse systems, and may help to quickly identify treatment malfunctions or other abnormal conditions.

Lessons and guidance for the management of safe drinking water during extreme weather events	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY												Extreme weather events have presented significant challenges to drinking water quality managers in Australia and elsewhere. Examples of extreme weather events include droughts, floods, cyclones, and wildfires. With global climate change, an increased frequency and severity of diverse extreme weather events is projected for many parts of the world. As such, the need to effectively prepare for and manage these types of extreme events is increasing. Previous experience with managing water supplies before, during and after extreme weather events can provide valuable lessons to aid planning for future events. By surveying Australian water utilities, detailed experiences and lessons from ten case studies of the management of extreme weather events was compiled. The weather events and their impacts to water quality management are described. The lessons learned from these events were used to establish a series of recommendations intended to be used as guidance for future management of extreme events. An important finding was the need to lead change and coordinate effort by the development of a formal whole-of-organisation strategy for building resilience to extreme events. Effective components of such a strategy include the implementation of a water quality management system and the development of specific incident response plans. The development and maintenance of inter-agency relationships was also found to be important and the use of inter-agency hypothetical scenario testing was identified as an effective way to support this. Strategies identified to assist in maintaining operations during and immediately following extreme weather events include the enactment of incident response plans, effective communication and, where possible, the implementation of short-term risk management controls. Post-event activities were also identified, including event recovery, learning from experiences and knowledge dissemination. The guidance presented in this paper will be of value to water quality managers throughout the world as they plan to enhance resilience within their organisations and services.

Water treatment process evaluation of wildfire-affected sediment leachates	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY												The recent increase in wildfire activity has raised concerns among many water utilities that rely on forested watersheds susceptible to wildfire for drinking water supplies. An understanding of post-fire treatment challenges, and guidance on how water providers can prepare is needed. In this study, dark, charred, river-bank sediment deposits were collected from the High Park fire burn area in northern Colorado, USA and leached in the laboratory to simulate the impact of post-fire runoff on source water quality. A comparison of the sediment leachates to post-fire river samples collected during flow events indicated the turbidity, phosphorus, nitrogen and dissolved organic carbon concentrations were similar, although the leachates do not reflect extreme concentrations observed in the field. The treatability of the leachates was evaluated with conventional coagulation and additional unit processes (pre-oxidation, powdered activated carbon, biofiltration), and samples were analyzed for disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation. Material leached from the sediments was enriched in haloacetonitrile (HAN) and chloropicrin precursors compared to baseline organic material of source waters, whereas total trihalomethane and haloacetic acid precursor reactivity were not statistically different from baseline source waters. Sediment leachates were amenable to conventional coagulation (25 mg L-1 aluminum sulfate), but may require additional treatment to meet DBP maximum contaminant levels. Enhanced coagulation (50 mg L-1) or pre-ozonation followed by conventional treatment are recommended as the best options for reducing carbonaceous DBP formation.

An Integrated Vegetated Ditch System Reduces Chlorpyrifos Loading in Agricultural Runoff	INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT												Agricultural runoff containing toxic concentrations of the organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos has led to impaired water body listings and total maximum daily load restrictions in California's central coast watersheds. Chlorpyrifos use is now tightly regulated by the Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board. This study evaluated treatments designed to reduce chlorpyrifos in agricultural runoff. Initial trials evaluated the efficacy of 3 different drainage ditch installations individually: compost filters, granulated activated carbon (GAC) filters, and native grasses in a vegetated ditch. Treatments were compared to bare ditch controls, and experiments were conducted with simulated runoff spiked with chlorpyrifos at a 1.9 L/s flow rate. Chlorpyrifos concentrations and toxicity to Ceriodaphnia dubia were measured at the input and output of the system. Input concentrations of chlorpyrifos ranged from 858ng/L to 2840ng/L. Carbon filters and vegetation provided the greatest load reduction of chlorpyrifos (99% and 90%, respectively). Toxicity was completely removed in only one of the carbon filter trials. A second set of trials evaluated an integrated approach combining all 3 treatments. Three trials were conducted each at 3.2 L/s and 6.3 L/s flow rates at input concentrations ranging from 282ng/L to 973ng/L. Chlorpyrifos loadings were reduced by an average of 98% at the low flow rate and 94% at the high flow rate. Final chlorpyrifos concentrations ranged from nondetect (< 50ng/L) to 82ng/L. Toxicity to C. dubia was eliminated in 3 of 6 integrated trials. Modeling of the ditch and its components informed design alterations that are intended to eventually remove up to 100% of pesticides and sediment. Future work includes investigating the adsorption capacity of GAC, costs associated with GAC disposal, and real-world field trials to further reduce model uncertainties and confirm design optimization. Trials with more water-soluble pesticides such as neonicotinoids are also recommended. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2017;13:423-430.

To date, no attempts have been made to study the effects of BC in combination with PAM on the decomposition of soil SOM and plant residues. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of BC, PAM, and their combination on the decomposition of SOM and alfalfa residues. An 80-day incubation experiment was carried out to investigate the effects of oak wood biochar (BC; 10 Mg ha(-1)), PAM (80 kg ha(-1)), and their combination (BC + PAM) on decomposition of SOM and C-14-labeled alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) residues by measuring CO2 efflux, microbial biomass, and specific respiration activity. No conditioner exerted a significant effect on SOM decomposition over the 80 days of incubation. PAM increased cumulative CO2 efflux at 55-80 days of incubation on average of 6.7 % compared to the soil with plant residue. This was confirmed by the increased MBN and (MBC)-C-14 at 80 days of incubation in PAM-treated soil with plant residue compared to the control. In contrast, BC and BC + PAM decreased plant residue decomposition compared to that in PAM-treated soil and the respective control soil during the 80 days. BC and BC + PAM decreased MBC in soil at 2 days of incubation indicated that BC suppressed soil microorganisms and, therefore, decreased the decomposition of plant residue. The addition of oak wood BC alone or in combination with PAM to soil decreased the decomposition of plant residue.

Vegetation cover and rainfall seasonality impact nutrient loss via runoff and erosion in the Colombian Andes	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE												Mountain ecosystems provide key services to a large portion of the population in the tropics. However, they are particularly vulnerable to regional environmental changes such as soil degradation, via soil erosion and associated nutrient loss, both dissolved in runoff and suspended in sediment. Current trends in land use conversion combined with projections of intensified hydrological extremes potentially amplify these threats. We analyze the interactive effects of rainfall characteristics (at three time scales) and vegetation cover on the runoff-erosion-nutrient loss progression for a group of vegetation cover types that represent different land use conversion stages. After a year of observations we found, as expected, that natural forests have the highest potential for regulating precipitationrunoff- erosion-nutrient loss. The highest amounts of runoff occurred in pasturelands, and croplands had the highest erosion losses. Croplands showed the highest concentrations of soluble nutrients in runoff and in sediment. However, due to higher runoff amounts, pasturelands had the greatest loss of dissolved nutrients. Precipitation seasonality significantly influenced both erosion and nutrient loss. This is particularly critical in managed agricultural and pasture systems where increased runoff and erosion rates, combined with unsustainable management practices, may lead to alterations in soil and water quality. Our results indicate how agricultural practices need to adapt fertilization scheduling to rainfall seasonality to minimize potential environmental impacts. Collectively, our results highlight a fundamental management need in tropical mountains where the combination of rapid land use change and altered climate threatens ecosystem integrity and ecosystem services.																	1436-3798	1436-378X				MAR	2017	17	3					827	839		10.1007/s10113-016-1071-7								WOS:000394991000017						
J	Goovaerts, P				Goovaerts, Pierre			The drinking water contamination crisis in Flint: Modeling temporal trends of lead level since returning to Detroit water system	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Since Flint returned to its pre-crisis source of drinking water close to 25,000 water samples have been collected and tested for lead and copper in >10,000 residences. This paper presents the first analysis and time trend modeling of lead data, providing new insights about the impact of this intervention. The analysis started with geocoding all water lead levels (WLL) measured during an 11-month period following the return to the Detroit water supply. Each data was allocated to the corresponding tax parcel unit and linked to secondary datasets, such as the composition of service lines, year built, or census tract poverty level. Only data collected on residential parcels within the City limits were used in the analysis. One key feature of Flint data is their collection through two different sampling initiatives: (i) voluntary or homeowner-driven sampling whereby concerned citizens decided to acquire a testing kit and conduct sampling on their own (non-sentinel sites), and (ii) State-controlled sampling where data were collected bi-weekly at selected sites after training of residents by technical teams (sentinel sites). Temporal trends modeled from these two datasets were found to be statistically different with fewer sentinel data exceeding WLL thresholds ranging from 10 to 50 mu g/L. Even after adjusting for housing characteristics the odds ratio (OR) of measuring WLL above 15 mu g/L at non-sentinel sites is significantly >1 (OR = 1.480) and it increases with the threshold (OR = 2.055 for 50 mu g/L)Joinpoint regression showed that the city-wide percdntage of WLL data above 15 mu g/L displayed four successive trends since the return to Detroit Water System. Despite the recent improvement in water quality, the culprit for differences between sampling programs needs to be identified as it impacts exposure assessment and might influence whether there is compliance or not with the Lead and Copper Rule.

Finding clean water habitats in urban landscapes: professional researcher vs citizen science approaches	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												This study investigated patterns of nutrient pollution in waterbody types across Greater London. Nitrate and phosphate data were collected by both citizen scientists and professional ecologists and their results were compared. The professional survey comprised 495 randomly selected pond, lake, river, stream and ditch sites. Citizen science survey sites were self-selected and comprised 76 ponds, lakes, rivers and streams. At each site, nutrient concentrations were assessed using field chemistry kits to measure nitrate-N and phosphate-P. The professional and the citizen science datasets both showed that standing waterbodies had significantly lower average nutrient concentrations than running waters. In the professional datasets 46% of ponds and lakes had nutrient levels below the threshold at which biological impairment is likely, whereas only 3% of running waters were unimpaired by nutrients. The citizen science dataset showed the same broad pattern, but there was a trend towards selection of higher quality waterbodies with 77% standing waters and 14% of rivers and streams unimpaired. Waterbody nutrient levels in the professional dataset were broadly correlated with landuse intensity. Rivers and streams had a significantly higher proportion of urban and suburban land cover than other waterbody types. Ponds had higher percentage of semi-natural vegetation within their much smaller catchments. Relationships with land cover and water quality were less apparent in the citizen-collected dataset probably because the areas visited by citizens were less representative of the landscape as whole. The results suggest that standing waterbodies, especially ponds, may represent an important clean water resource within urban areas. Small waterbodies, including ponds, small lakes < 50 ha and ditches, are rarely part of the statutory water quality monitoring programmes and are frequently overlooked. Citizen scientist data have the potential to partly fill this gap if they are co-ordinated to reduce bias in the type and location of the waterbodies selected.																	0048-9697	1879-1026				MAR 1	2017	581						105	116		10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.11.215								WOS:000394635300011	28069307

Effect of cyclic redox oscillations on water quality in freshwater acid sulfate soil wetlands	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Restoration of add sulfate soil (ASS) wetlands by freshwater re-flooding can lead to the reformation of various Fe(II) and reduced inorganic sulfur (RIS) species in surface soil layers. However, in many locations, wetland water levels undergo large seasonal fluctuations that drive extreme redox oscillations. Newly formed RIS species [e.g. greigite, mackinawite, nano-pyrite and S(0)1 and Fe(II) are vulnerable to rapid oxidation during dry periods and may generate substantial acidity. Rainfall following a dry period may then mobilise acidity and metal cations in surface waters prior to eventual recovery in pH by re-establishment of reducing conditions. We explore this dry-wet transition by subjecting soil samples from two freshwater re-flooded ASS Wetlands to oxidative incubation for up to 130 days followed by re-flooding simulation for 84 days. During very early stages of re-flooding (up to 7 days) there was an initial pulse-release of aridity, and trace metals/metalloids (Al, Mn, Zn and As). This was followed by a rapid reversion to anoxia, and Fe(III) and SO4 reducing conditions which generated alkalinity, ameliorated acidity and sequestered Fe, S, Zn, Mn and As. Field-observations of surface water quality in an ASS wetland at a sub-catchment scale also confirms re-establishment of SO4 reducing conditions and recovery of pH within similar to 4-8 weeks of re-flooding after dry periods. These observations suggest that retaining surface water in ASS wetlands for similar to 8 weeks after a dry-wet transition will allow sufficient time for alkalinity producing reductive processes to ameliorate most surface water acidity. Although management of freshwater re-flooded ASS wetlands in a highly dynamic climate will remain challenging over the long term and the post-remediation effectiveness of the method depends on initial soil characteristics, knowledge of the timing of redox oscillations and the associated changes in water geochemistry can be helpful for mitigating the risks to downstream estuarine water quality.

For chemical analysis, little or no sample enrichment is often sufficient, while bioanalysis often requires larger sample volumes at a certain enrichment factor for conducting comprehensive bioassays on different endpoints or furthereffect-directed analysis (EDA). To avoid logistic and technical issues related to the storage and transport of large volumes of water, sampling would benefit greatly from onsite extraction. This study presents a novel onsite large volume solid phase extraction (LVSPE) device tailored to fulfill the requirements for the successful effect-based and chemical screening of water resources and complies with available international standards for automated sampling devices. Laboratory recovery experiments using 251 organic compounds in the log D range from -3.6 to 9.4 (at pH 7.0) spiked into pristine water resulted in acceptable recoveries and from 60 to 123% for 159 out of 251 substances. Within a European-wide demonstration program, the LVSPE was able to enrich compounds in concentration ranges over three orders of magnitude (1 ng L-1 to 2400 ng L-1). It was possible to discriminate responsive samples from samples with no or only low effects in a set of six different bioassays "( i.e. acetylcholinesterase and algal growth inhibition, androgenicity, estrogenicity, fish embryo toxicity, glucocorticoid activity). The LVSPE thus proved applicable for onsite extraction of sufficient amounts of water to investigate water quality thoroughly by means of chemical analysis and effect-based tools without the common limitations due to small sample volumes.

Characterizing nutrient distributions and fluxes in a eutrophic reservoir, Midwestern United States	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Harmful algal blooms are increasingly common in aquatic ecosystems and have been linked to runoff from agricultural land. This study investigated the internal nutrient (i.e., phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N)) dynamics of a eutrophic reservoir in the Midwestern United States to constrain the potential for sedimentary nutrients to stimulate harmful algal blooms. The spatial distribution of nutrients in the water column (soluble reactive P (SRP), nitrate/nitrite-N (NOx-N), and ammonium -N (NH4+-N)) and sediments (total P, total carbon (C), total N, and organic matter (OM)) were quantified and mapped. Water column nutrients varied spatially and teniporally, with generally higher concentrations near the dam Wall during normal lake levels. The upper portion of the lake, near the inlet, was sampled during a flood event and had overall higher nutrient ccincentrations and lower chlorophyll levels compared to normal lake level samples. Mean sedimentary total P (936 mg/kg) was similar to 30% higher in the reservoir than the surrounding upland soils, with the highest concentrations near the dam wall (1661 mg/kg) and a significant positive correlation found between sedimentary total P, total C, and OM. Additionally, 15 intact sediment cores were manipulated ex situ to examine mechanisms of nutrient flux across the sediment-Water interface (SWI) that may trigger algal blooms. Core treatment conditions included advection (i.e., simulating potential nutrient fluxes during wind events through sediment resuspension) and diffusion. Core experiments indicated both advective and diffusive conditions at the SWI may trigger the flux of nutrients important for algal growth from lake sediments, with diffusion contributing both N and P to the water column, while intense advection increased water column N, but decreased P. Release of P to the water column may be more diffusion-driven than advection-driven, whereas N release to the water column appears to be both diffusion-and advection-driven. (C) 2017 ElseVier B.V.

Quantifying loading, toxic concentrations, and systemic persistence of chloride in a contemporary mixed-land-use watershed using an experimental watershed approach	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												A nested-scale experimental watershed study was implemented to quantify loading and persistence of chloride in an urbanizing, mixed-land-use watershed. A Midwest USA (Missouri) watershed Was partitioned into five sub basins with contrasting dominant land use. Streamwater was tested for chloride concentration four days per week from October 2009 through May 2014 at each site. Monitoring sites included co-located gauging and climate stations recording variables at 30-minute intervals. Results indicate significant (p < 0.01) differences in chloride concentrations and loading between sites. Loading consistently increased from the forested headwaters (average = 507 kg day(-1)) to primarily Urban watershed terminus (average = 7501 kg day (-1)). Chloride concentrations were highest( average = 83.9 mg L-1) with the greatest frequency of acutely toxic conditions (i.e. 860 mg L-1) mid-watershed. This finding is in-part attributable to the ratio of chloride application to streamflow volume (i.e. increasing flow volume with stream distance resulted in chloride dilution, offsetting increased percent urban land use with stream distance). Results highlight the important, yet often confounding, interactions between pollutant loading and flow dynamics. Chloride peaks occurred during late winter/early spring melting periods, implicating road salt application as the primary contributor to the chloride regime. Floodplain ground water analysis indicated seasonal sink/source relationships between the stream and floodplain, which could con-important implications for resource managers wishing to mitigate water quality and aquatic habitat degradation, and suggest important water quality limitations to stream restoration success in complex urban aquatic ecosystems.

A long-term field experiment, implementing nanotechnology in the form of UltraFiltration (UF) and Reverse Osmosis (RO) for salt removal from treated wastewater, was conducted with secondary effluents, aiming to prove the sustainability of agricultural production using irrigation with treated wastewater. Six outdoor field treatments, each under four replications, were conducted for examining the salt accumulation effects on the soil and the crops. The field experiments proved that crop development is correlated with the water quality as achieved from the wastewater filtration capability of the hybrid nanotechnology system. The key goal was to maintain sustainable food production, despite the low quality of the waters. Of the six treatment methods tested, irrigation with RO-treated effluent produced the best results in terms of its effect on soil salinity and crop yield. Nevertheless, it must be kept in mind that this process is not only costly, but it also removes all organic matter content from the irrigation water, requiring the addition of fertilizers to the effluent.

Samuel; von Gunten, Urs			Formation and reactivity of inorganic and organic chloramines and bromamines during oxidative water treatment	WATER RESEARCH												The formation and further reactions of halamines during oxidative water treatment can be relevant for water quality. In this study, we investigated the formation and reactivity of several inorganic and organic halamines (monochloramine, N-chloromethylamine, N-chlorodimethylamine, monobromamine, dibromamine, N-bromomethylamine, N,N-dibromomethylamine, and N-bromodimethylamine) by kinetic experiments, transformation product analysis, and quantum chemical computations. Kinetic model simulations were conducted to evaluate the relevance of halamines for various water treatment scenarios. Halamines were quickly formed from the reaction of chlorine and bromine with ammonia or organic amines. Species-specific second-order rate constants for the reaction of chlorine and bromine with ammonia, methyl- and dimethylamine were in the order of 10(6)-10(8) M(-1)s(-1). The formed halamines were found to be reactive towards phenolic compounds, forming halogenated phenols via electrophilic aromatic substitution (phenol and resorcinol) or quinones via electron transfer (catechol and hydroquinone). At near neutral pH, apparent second-order rate constants for these reactions were in the order of 10(-4)-10(-1) M(-1)s(-1) for chloramines and 10(1)-10(2) M(-1)s(-1) for bromamines. Quantum chemical computations were used to determine previously unknown aqueous pK(a) values, gas phase bond dissociation energies (BDE) and partial atomic charges of the halamines, allowing a better understanding of their reactivities. Kinetic model simulations, based on the results of this study, showed that during zhlorination inorganic and organic chloramines are the main halamines formed. However, their further reactions with organic matter are outcompeted kinetically by chlorine. During ozonation, mainly inorganic bromamines are formed, since ozone quickly oxidizes organic amines. The further reactions of bromamine are typically outcompeted by ozone and thus generally of minor importance. The use of peracetic acid for saline ballast water treatment can result in the formation of substantial amounts of bromamines, which can react with dissolved organic matter and contribute to the formation of brominated products.

J	Housh, M; Ohar, Z				Housh, Mashor; Ohar, Ziv			Integrating physically based simulators with Event Detection Systems: Multi-site detection approach	WATER RESEARCH												The Fault Detection (FD) Problem in control theory concerns of monitoring a system to identify when a fault has occurred. Two approaches can be distinguished for the FD: Signal processing based FD and Model-based FD. The former concerns of developing algorithms to directly infer faults from sensors' readings, while the latter uses a simulation model of the real-system to analyze the discrepancy between sensors' readings and expected values from the simulation model. Most contamination Event Detection Systems (EDSs) for water distribution systems have followed the signal processing based FD, which relies on analyzing the signals from monitoring stations independently of each other, rather than evaluating all stations simultaneously within an integrated network. In this study, we show that a model-based EDS which utilizes a physically based water quality and hydraulics simulation models, can outperform the signal processing based EDS. We also show that the model-based EDS can facilitate the development of a Multi-Site EDS (MSEDS), which analyzes the data from all the monitoring stations simultaneously within an integrated network. The advantage of the joint analysis in the MSEDS is expressed by increased detection accuracy (higher true positive alarms and fewer false alarms) and shorter detection time. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Challenges with secondary use of multi-source water-quality data in the United States	WATER RESEARCH												Combining water-quality data from multiple sources can help counterbalance diminishing resources for stream monitoring in the United States and lead to important regional and national insights that would not otherwise be possible. Individual monitoring organizations understand their own data very well, but issues can arise when their data are combined with data from other organizations that have used different methods for reporting the same common metadata elements. Such use of multi-source data is termed "secondary use"-the use of data beyond the original intent determined by the organization that collected the data. In this study, we surveyed more than 25 million nutrient records collected by 488 organizations in the United States since 1899 to identify major inconsistencies in metadata elements that limit the secondary use of multi-source data. Nearly 14.5 million of these records had missing or ambiguous information for one or more key metadata elements, including (in decreasing order of records affected) sample fraction, chemical form, parameter name, units of measurement, precise numerical value, and remark codes. As a result, metadata harmonization to make secondary use of these multi source data will be time consuming, expensive, and inexact. Different data users may make different assumptions about the same ambiguous data, potentially resulting in different conclusions about important environmental issues. The value of these ambiguous data is estimated at $US12 billion, a substantial collective investment by water-resource organizations in the United States. By comparison, the value of unambiguous data is estimated at $US8.2 billion. The ambiguous data could be preserved for uses beyond the original intent by developing and implementing standardized metadata practices for future and legacy water-quality data throughout the United States.

Effects of nitrate addition on water column methylmercury in Occoquan Reservoir, Virginia, USA	WATER RESEARCH												Mercury bioaccumulation in aquatic biota poses a widespread threat to human and environmental health. Methylmercury (MeHg), the toxic form of mercury, tends to build up under anaerobic conditions in the profundal zones of lakes. In this study we performed a two-year assessment of spatial and temporal patterns of dissolved oxygen, nitrate, MeHg, manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe) in Occoquan Reservoir, a large run-of-the-river drinking water reservoir in Virginia, USA. A tributary to the reservoir receives input of nitrate-rich tertiary-treated wastewater that enhances the oxidant capacity of bottom water. Multiple lines of evidence supported the hypothesis that the presences of nitrate and/or oxygen in bottom water correlated with low MeHg in bottom water. Bottom water MeHg was significantly lower in a nitrate-rich tributary (annual mean of 0.05 ng/L in both 2012 and 2013) compared to a nitrate-poor tributary (annual mean of 0.58 ng/L in 2012 and 0.21 ng/L in 2013). The presence of nitrate and oxygen in bottom water corresponded with significantly lower bottom water MeHg at an upstream station in the main reservoir (0.05 versus 0.11 ng/L in 2013). In 2012 the reservoir exhibited a longitudinal gradient with nitrate and oxygen decreasing and MeHg and Mn increasing downstream. In both study years, there was a clear threshold of oxygen equivalent (3-5 mg/L), a metric that combines the oxidant capacity of nitrate and oxygen, above which MeHg (<0.05 ng/L), Mn (<0.3 mg/L) and Fe (<0.5 mg/L) were low. Results indicated that the addition of nitrate-rich tertiary-treated wastewater to the bottom of anaerobic reservoirs can reduce MeHg concentrations, and potentially decrease mercury bioaccumulation, while increasing the safe water yield for potable use.

Significant water quality challenges are related to nutrients, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, pathogens, sediments and habitat alteration. To facilitate the challenges posed, there is a need for predictive, spatially distributed models to be developed that encompass the key aspects of agriculture and water management in order to inform future policy and organizations with an interest in land management. Additionally, there needs to be recognition from policy makers that different solutions are needed in different agri-water systems and that it often takes many years or decades for policies to have a sustained water quality impact. Long-term support for research infrastructure and the scientific skills base is required to enable measurement and data analysis necessary to inform decision making. Farmers need clearly articulated information on the issues and potential solutions on which to make informed management decisions regarding water. There are existing solutions to some problems and this knowledge needs to be effectively disseminated with appropriate incentives for implementation to have maximum impact. Greater collaboration between researchers, industry, and policy makers, with the necessary framework to deliver effective joint working, is urgently needed. There is also a need for a wider societal understanding of the land-water system and the various ways in which society pays (and might pay in the future) for the real value of water.

With this increase, there has been a proliferation of studies that assess the physical and ecological responses of rivers to these removals. As more dams are considered for removal, scientific information from these dam-removal studies will increasingly be called upon to inform decisions about whether, and how best, to bring down dams. This raises a critical question: what is the current state of dam-removal science in the United States? To explore the status, trends, and characteristics of dam-removal research in the U.S., we searched the scientific literature and extracted basic information from studies on dam removal. Our literature review illustrates that although over 1200 dams have been removed in the U.S., fewer than 10% have been scientifically evaluated, and most of these studies were short in duration (<4 years) and had limited ( 1-2 years) or no pre-removal monitoring. The majority of studies focused on hydrologic and geomorphic responses to removal rather than biological and water-quality responses, and few studies were published on linkages between physical and ecological components. Our review illustrates the need for long-term, multidisciplinary case studies, with robust study designs, in order to anticipate the effects of dam removal and inform future decision making.

In this work, a remote sensing algorithm was developed to estimate the concentrations of the total suspended sediments (TSS) in large lakes and reservoirs over the MLY basin and was based on a band ratio between 555 nm and 645 nm of the atmospherically corrected surface reflectance of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). In situ samples used to calibrate the algorithm were collected from 58 lakes and reservoirs with a TSS range of 1 to 300 mg L-1, and the uncertainty of this algorithm was 30-40%. The algorithm was subsequently applied to a total of 102 lakes and reservoirs located in the MLY basin to derive TSS maps from 2000 to 2014 at a 250 m spatial resolution, and the first comprehensive document of the TSS distributions and dynamics of large inland waters of the MLY basin was created. The seasonal patterns among the selected water bodies were similar, with the largest TSS concentrations occurring in the first and fourth quarters in a year and the lowest values occurring in the third quarter. In contrast, spatial heterogeneities were revealed by the 15-year long-term mean TSS climatology information. Although most lakes downstream of Poyang Lake were turbid with 15-year TSS climatology values of 45-100 mg L-1, waters between Poyang and Doting Lake were relatively clearer with TSS climatology values of 15-45 mg L-1, and the clearest waters (<15 mg L-1) were found in reservoirs. The turbidity of 64.5% (e.g., 49/76) for lakes in Class II exhibited a decreasing trend over the 15-year period, and the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) and Dongting Lake in Class I also showed significant TSS declines. Analysis with meteorological data shows that the intra-annual variations appear to be significantly correlated with local precipitation, with a time lag of two months for TSS. The prominent TSS decreasing trend of the lakes in Class,II was probably linked to the significant NDVI increase in the MLY basin, whereas the TSS decrease in the TGR and Dongting Lake is likely to be attributed to the impoundment of the Three Gorges Dam. The TSS environmental data record (EDR) of large inland waters presented in this study serves as an important reference for future water quality monitoring and evaluation in the MLY and in China.

The unique physicochemical properties of PFAS results in environmental persistency, threatening water quality and making remediation of such sites a necessity. This work investigated the role of sorbent amendment to PFAS contaminated soils in order to immobilise PFAS and reduce mobility and leaching to groundwater. Soil was sampled from a firefighting training facility at a Norwegian airport and total and leachable PFAS concentrations were quantified. Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) was the most dominant PFAS present in all soil samples (between 9 and 2600 mu g/kg). Leaching was quantified using a one-step batch test with water (L/S 10). PFOS concentrations measured in leachate water ranged between 1.2 mu g/L and 212 mu g/L. Sorbent amendment (3%) was tested by adding activated carbon (AC), compost soil and montmorillonite to selected soils. The extent of immobilisation was quantified by measuring PFAS concentrations in leachate before and after amendment. Leaching was reduced between 94 and 99.9% for AC, between 29 and 34% for compost soil and between 28 and 40% for the montmorillonite amended samples. Sorbent + soil/water partitioning coefficients (K-D) were estimated following amendment and were around 8 L/kg for compost soil and montmorillonite amended soil and ranged from 1960 to 16,940 L/kg for AC amended soil. The remediation of AFFF impacted soil via immobilisation of PFAS following sorbent amendment with AC is promising as part of an overall remediation strategy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Jalali, M; Jalali, M				Jalali, Mohsen; Jalali, Mahdi			Assessment risk of phosphorus leaching from calcareous soils using soil test phosphorus	CHEMOSPHERE												Accurate estimation of phosphorus (P) leaching is important because excess P may reduce surface and ground water quality. Little attention has been paid to estimate P leaching from soil tests in calcareous soils. The relation between different soil tests P (STP), P sorption index (PSI) and degree of P saturation (DPS) and leaching of P were examined for assessing the risk of P loss from calcareous soils. Columns leaching repacked with native soils were leached with either distilled water or 10 mM CaCl2 solutions, separately. Four leaching events were performed at four days, and 28.7 mm of distilled water or 10 mM CaCl2 solutions was applied at each leaching events. Compared with distilled water, CaCl2 had a small ability to solubilize P from soils. Concentration of P in leachate in both leaching solutions was exceeding 0.1 mg 1(-1) associated with eutrophication. Cumulative P leached P was ranged from 0.17 to 18.59 mg P kg (-1) and 0.21-8.16 mg P kg -1, when distilled water and 10 mM CaCl2 solutions were applied, respectively and it was higher in sandy clay loam soils compared with clay soils. Among evaluated environmental soil P tests, PcaC12-3h (P extracted by 10 mM CaCl2 for 3 h), P(ca)c12-1h (P extracted by 10 mM CaCl2 for 1 h) were more accurate than other soil P tests for predicting P concentration in the leachates in both leaching solutions and accounting for 83% and 72% of variation of P concentration, respectively. The water extractable P (WEP) (r = 0.771) and Olsen-P (Pois)(r = 0.739) were significantly related to the leached P concentration using distilled water solution in a split line model, with a change point of 27.4 mg P kg -1 and 61.5 mg P kg -1, respectively. Various DPS were calculated and related to the leached P concentration. Based on P extracted by Mehlich-3 (PM3) and HCI (No) and PSI, the change point of the relationship between leached P concentration and DFSm3-3 (Tdrpgly x 100) and DPSHG-2 ( ",?-01mi:Ppsu x 100) for both leaching solutions was approximately the same, thus a mean value of 49% for DPSm3_3 and 73% for DPSH0_2 was obtained. Soils were grouped into four categories of increasing P leaching potential based on WEP, P-Ols, and DPSM3_3. The results indicated that 8.00%-25.50% of the soil grouped in no risk category whereas 8.00%-13.70% of the soils fell into the high risk category. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Zhang, SX; Wang, L; Wang, Z; Fan, DL; Shi, LL; Liu, JN				Zhang, Shengxin; Wang, Lei; Wang, Zhen; Fan, Deling; Shi, Lili; Liu, Jining			Derivation of freshwater water quality criteria for dibutyltin dilaurate from measured data and data predicted using interspecies correlation estimate models	CHEMOSPHERE												Dibutyltin dilaurate (DBTL) is an organotin compound that has been widely detected in aquatic environments. However, the ecological risk assessment for DBTL is hard to perform due to the absence of water quality criteria (WQC) and lack of toxicity data. In this study, toxicity data were obtained from acute and chronic toxicity tests using aquatic species resident in China. Based on the species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) constructed from these test data, the acute water quality criterion (AWQC) and chronic water quality criterion (CWQC) were then derived to be 132 p.g/L and 31.mu g/L for DBTL. In order to valid the predicted data in the application to the protective criteria development and hazard assessment, the web -based interspecies correlation estimation (Web-ICE) system was used to estimate acute toxicities. Here two acute toxicity data groups for surrogate species were chosen from experimental data and QSAR Toolbox-predicted data separately, giving estimated data for prediction species using Web-ICE software. According to Kolmogorov Smirnov test results, Web-ICE -based SSDs and measurement-based SSD were not significantly different. The results showed that the differences between measurement-based (132 mu g/L) and Web-ICE -based AWQCs (39.7 mu g/L and 58.5 mu G/L) were statistically acceptable. Under certain conditions, it is therefore worth considering using the QSAR Toolbox plus Web-ICE method here to provide a beneficial supplement for developing preliminarily screen level toxicities in WQC when little or no relevant information are available. Besides, the geographic distribution of species was demonstrated not to be a significant factor in SSD establishment and WQC derivation.(C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This study is the first to report the spatiotemporal variability of organotins (OTs) in surface water under dynamic water level conditions in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region (TGRR). TGRR surface water was collected during three monitoring campaigns to analyze butyltins (BTs) and phenyltins (PTs) using a gas chromatography mass spectrometry system. Our results showed that TGRR surface water was polluted by BTs and PTs, with mono-OTs being the dominant species. A wide range of BTs and PTs concentrations was observed across the study area, but tributyltin (TBT) displayed extensive spatial distribution, and the highest concentrations consistently occurred in the downstream region of the TGRR study area, with a maximum of 393.35 ng Sn/L in Zigui (S27). The total OTs contamination level decreased over time. The diphenyltin concentration exhibited significant seasonal variation, while other OTs showed seasonal changes only during two monitoring campaigns, with the exception of dibutyltin. An ecological risk assessment indicated that both TBT and triphenyltin posed risks to aquatic organisms in TGRR surface water. We urgently recommend continuous monitoring and further measures to prevent and control OTs pollution in the TGRR. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In the present work four rivers affected by effluents from such mines were selected to evaluate the application of aquatic mosses for the bio-indication of 56 elements. Naturally growing F. antipyretica and P. riparioides were compared with transplanted samples of the same species. The results demonstrate serious pollution of the examined rivers, especially with As, Ba, Fe, Mn, Pb, Ti, U and Zn, reaching extremely high concentrations in native moss samples. In the most polluted rivers native F antipyretica and P. riparioides samples showed significantly higher concentrations of As, Ba, Cu, Fe, La, Nd, Ni, Pb, U and Zn than corresponding transplanted samples, whereas at less polluted sites a reverse situation was sometimes observed. Transplanted moss moved from clean to extremely polluted rivers probably protects itself against the accumulation of toxic elements by reducing their uptake. Selection of native or transplanted F antipyretica and P. riparioides depended on the pollution load. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Al-Isawi, R; Ray, S; Scholz, M				Al-Isawi, Rawaa; Ray, Sanak; Scholz, Miklis			Comparative study of domestic wastewater treatment by mature vertical-flow constructed wetlands and artificial ponds	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												This study compares the performance, design and operation variables of two wetland technologies treating domestic wastewater: an experimental artificial pond system and a mature experimental vertical-flow constructed wetland system. The wetland system planted with Phragmites australis (Cay.) Trin. ex Steud. (common reeds) was operated between June 2011 and October 2015, while the pond system was only operated between July 2015 and October 2015. Three different types of ponds were compared: ponds with wastewater; ponds with wastewater and reeds; and ponds with wastewater, reeds and aeration. Findings regarding the performances of mature wetlands showed that the wetland systems improved the water quality except for ortho-phosphate-phosphorus (PO4-P), where the treatment performance reduced slightly over time. In general, the aerated pond systems showed better treatment performances in terms of ammonia-nitrogen (NH4-N) and PO4-P. Both systems were linked with medium to high levels of five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) removal. The highest COD and SS removals were observed for wetlands in comparison to ponds. Moreover, mature wetlands were better in removing NH4-N and PO4-P than ponds unless the ponds were aerated. The nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) concentration increased in the aerated ponds reflecting the high oxygen availability. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Our goal is to make a forecast of this parameter in Central Europe's most important river with the use of other, easily measurable water quality parameters (pH, temperature, electrical conductivity and runoff) with the use of linear and nonlinear models. We adapt four models for forecasting dissolved oxygen concentration, namely a Multivariate Linear Regression model, a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network, a Radial Basis Function Neural Network and a General Regression Neural Network model. Data is available for Hungarian sampling locations on River Danube (Mohacs, Fajsz and Gyorzamoly) for the period of 1998-2003. The analysis was performed with four alternative combinations, the models were formulated using data from the period 1998-2002 and a dissolved oxygen forecast was made for 2003. Evaluating model performance with various statistical measures (root mean square error, mean absolute error, coefficient of determination, and Willmott's index of agreement), we found that nonlinear models gave better results than linear models. In two cases the General Regression Neural Network provided the best performance, in two other cases the Radial Basis Function Neural Network gave the best results. A further goal was to conduct a sensitivity analysis in order to identify the parameter with the highest influence on the performance of the created models. Sensitivity analysis was performed for the combination of all three sampling locations (4th combination) and it was found that for all three neural network models sensitivity analyses showed that pH has the most important role in estimating dissolved oxygen content.

J	Richards, PJ; Williams, NSG; Fletcher, TD; Farrell, C				Richards, Paul J.; Williams, Nicholas S. G.; Fletcher, Tim D.; Farrell, Claire			Can raingardens produce food and retain stormwater? Effects of substrates and stormwater application method on plant water use, stormwater retention and yield	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Raingardens capture and filter urban stormwater using sandy soils and drought-tolerant plants. An emerging question is whether raingardens can also be used as vegetable gardens, potentially increasing their popularity and implementation. A successful vegetable raingarden Will need to both retain stormwater and produce vegetables, despite potential water deficits between rainfall events. To determine whether raingardens can provide this dual functionality, we undertook a greenhouse pot experiment using two different substrates (loamy sand raingarden substrate and potting mix typical of containerised vegetable growing) and two methods of stormwater application ('sub-surface' and 'surface' watering) with the water quantity at each application determined by average Melbourne summer rainfall. Overall, potting mix produced bigger plants (biomass and leaf area) and greater yield than did the loamy sand. Yield effects were variable: tomato yield was unaffected by treatment, bean yield was greatest in potting mix, beetroot yield was greatest with sub-surface watering and parsley yield was greatest with surface watering. Bigger plants also had greater transpiration, which meant that stormwater retention was greatest for parsley and tomato plants growing in potting mix with surface watering. Although, a raingarden with potting mix and surface application of stormwater was optimal for producing food and retaining stormwater under our rainfall regime, potting mix could be problematic due to higher nutrient leaching and breakdown over time. Therefore, we recommend using a mix of loamy sand and potting mix. However, the choice of substrate and watering treatment require trade-offs between yield, stormwater retention and potential implications for water quality and long-term stability of hydraulic properties.

The experiment was performed for 73 days and two treatments were evaluated: plants and control (without plants), with four replicates. Each experimental unit consisted of an 800 L tank, a 40 L conical bottom settling chamber, and a hydroponic bench with 0.4 m(2) of planting area and a capacity for 40 plants. The water from the shrimp tank was pumped continuously to the settling chamber and the overflow was distributed to the channels to irrigate the plants, then returned to the tank by gravity. Tanks were stocked with 250 shrimp m(-3) (1.4 +/- 0.0 g). Shrimp were fed a commercial diet containing 35% crude protein, four times per day. At the end of the experiment, total nitrogen was determined in the shrimp, the plants and the ration, as well as antioxidant activity and total phenolic compounds in Sarcocornia. The water quality remained within the acceptable limits for the culture of marine shrimp. No significant differences were observed in the performance of L. vannamei. The final biomass of shrimp was 2.1 +/- 0.1 kg m(-3), with a survival rate of 73.5 +/- 1.9%, a final average weight of 11.7 +/- 0.4 g, and a feed conversion ratio of 1.7 +/- 0.1. The production of plants was 8.2 +/- 0.3 kg m(-2). The antioxidant activity in S. ambigua was 38.3 +/- 1.3 mu mol TEAC 100 g(-1) FM, which characterizes this species as a functional food. The recovery of nitrogen supplied to the system through the ration was higher in the plants treatment (39.3%) than in the control (31.4%). In the proposed aquaponic system it was possible to produce 2 kg of plants for each kilogram of shrimp, integrating the production of L. vannamei and S. ambigua, and thus improve the use of nutrients in the culture.

However, the variations in land-use may alter the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), which were ignored in our previous design. In this paper, the carbon sequestration benefits of ecological engineering were evaluated after dynamically monitoring the GHG emissions from different land-use sites during the growing (April-September) and submerged (October-March) seasons. The results showed that CH4 fluxes in the dike-ponds (3.76 CH4-mg m(-2) h(-1)) and rice paddies (6.09 +/- 1.60 mg-CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) were significantly higher than those in the natural littoral zone (0.77 +/- 0.27 mg-CH4 m(-2) mg-CH(4)m(-2) h(-1)) and forest project (0.57 +/- 0.31 mg-CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) during the growing season. There were no significant differences in the CO2 fluxes from different land-use sites. The emission of N2O from different land-use sites was low and ranged from -0.02 to 0.07 mg-N2O m(-2) h(-1). The growing season contributed to more than 76% of the cumulative annual GHG emissions. Direct GHG emissions and the carbon sequestration ability of species determined the net carbon sinks in the littoral zone. Net carbon sinks in the forest projects with different understory plant communities showed a small variation, with a range of -2.58 to 3.40 t-CO2 ha(-1) year(-1), but the design of the dike-pond projects should favor species that are positive net carbon sinks, e.g., Sagittaria (19.76 t-CO2 ha(-1) y(-1)) and Canna generalis (16.79 t-CO2 ha(-1) y(-1)), rather than those that are negative net carbon sinks, e.g., Trapa natans (-11.79 t-CO2 ha(-1) y(-1)).

One-year Surveillance of Human Enteric Viruses in Raw and Treated Wastewaters, Downstream River Waters, and Drinking Waters	FOOD AND ENVIRONMENTAL VIROLOGY												Human enteric viruses are a major cause of waterborne diseases, and can be transmitted by contaminated water of all kinds, including drinking and recreational water. The objectives of the present study were to assess the occurrence of enteric viruses (enterovirus, norovirus, adenovirus, hepatitis A and E virus) in raw and treated wastewaters, in rivers receiving wastewater discharges, and in drinking waters. Wastewater treatment plants' (WWTP) pathogen removal efficiencies by adenovirus quantitative real-time PCR and the presence of infectious enterovirus, by cell culture assays, in treated wastewaters and in surface waters were also evaluated. A total of 90 water samples were collected: raw and treated wastewaters (treated effluents and ultrafiltered water reused for industrial purposes), water from two rivers receiving treated discharges, and drinking water. Nested PCR assays were used for the identification of viral DNA/RNA, followed by direct amplicon sequencing. All raw sewage samples (21/21), 61.9 % of treated wastewater samples (13/21), and 25 % of ultrafiltered water samples (3/12) were contaminated with at least one viral family. Multiple virus families and genera were frequently detected. Mean positive PCRs per sample decreased significantly from raw to treated sewage and to ultrafiltered waters. Moreover, quantitative adenovirus data showed a reduction in excess of 99 % in viral genome copies following wastewater treatment. In surface waters, 78.6 % (22/28) of samples tested positive for one or more viruses by molecular methods, but enterovirus-specific infectivity assays did not reveal infectious particles in these samples. All drinking water samples tested negative for all viruses, demonstrating the effectiveness of treatment in removing viral pathogens from drinking water. Integrated strategies to manage water from all sources are crucial to ensure water quality.

However, little information is available on the in situ transport and spread of viruses in surface water. In this study, an original in situ experimental approach using the residence time of the river water mass was developed to accurately follow the propagation of F-specific RNA bacteriophages (FRNAPHs) along a 3-km studied river. Surface water and sediment of 9 sampling campaigns were collected and analyzed using both infectivity and RT-qPCR assays. In parallel, some physico-chemical variables such as flow rate, water temperature, conductivity and total suspended solids were measured to investigate the impact of environmental conditions on phage propagation. For campaigns with low flow rate and high temperature, the results highlight a decrease of infectious phage concentration along the river, which was successfully modelled according to a first-order negative exponential decay. The monitoring of infectious FRNAPHs belonging mainly to the genogroup II was confirmed with direct phage genotyping and total phage particle quantification. Reported k decay coefficients according to exponential models allowed for the determination of the actual in situ distance and time necessary for removing 90 % of infectious phage particles. This present work provides a new way to assess the true in situ viral propagation along a small river. These findings can be highly useful in water quality and risk assessment studies to determine the viral contamination spread from a point contamination source to the nearest recreational areas.

J	Migheli, M				Migheli, Matteo			Land ownership and use of pesticides. Evidence from the Mekong Delta	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Massive use of pesticides is one of the major environmental problems in developing countries. I analyse the correlation between land ownership and use of pesticides in the Mekong Delta. Landowners may either use more or less pesticides than renters do. Indeed, pesticides increase land productivity in the short run, while decrease it in the long run. Therefore landowners trade-off immediate and future profits, which include also the value of the land that depends on its productivity. Differently from the extant literature this paper does not consider simply land ownership, but the share of the total land cultivated by the household that the household itself owns. Using data from the World Bank covering 603 farmer households in the Mekong Delta, this paper shows that as the share of cultivated land owned increases, so does the quantity of pesticides used. Policy recommendations may be derived: the governments of developing countries should strengthen their efforts to sensitise and to educate the owners of small farms to use agrochemicals correctly.

We used spatially explicit biophysical models to create scenarios with targeted places where the greatest water quality and supply benefits could be realized. We quantified how these scenarios would impact the sediment load, nitrogen load, phosphorous load, and annual water yield with hydrologic models. The scenarios included a "Business as usual" based on existing conservation plans (2015-2020) and four additional model generated scenarios: a "Targeted" scenario using the "Business as usual" budget, two targeted "Increased budget" scenarios, and a "Targeted-climate smart" scenario adjusted based on climate change. We expected the model-generated scenarios to have a greater impact on biophysical factors than "Business as Usual," and that the "Increased budget" scenarios would reach water quality regulatory goals. The "Targeted" scenario produced a small improvement in water quality over "Business as usual," but did not meet regulatory goals. The "Increased budget" scenarios could meet water quality goals in one additional subwatershed if the budget is allocated to the most cost-effective activities to reduce sediment. Incorporating climate change caused the targeted locations of activities to shift in space, but the overall impact on biophysical factors was similar. This study demonstrates how science-based planning with stakeholder input can inform conservation investments across existing boundaries and lead to greater water quality improvements. By identifying where to implement different types of conservation activities and how much to invest, as well as revealing shortcomings in current assumptions about which activities to implement, this study can enable smarter and more effective land management investments.

The acute toxicity of K2Cr2O7 to D. magna was comparatively examined in one very hard (M4 medium for D. magna assay), four hard, one moderately hard and one soft dilution water samples. The 48-h EC50 (50% effective concentration) of K2Cr2O7 to D. magna was reproducible (coefficient of variation [CV]: 13%) in tests using the same dilution water sample, but reproducibility was poor (CV: 62%) in tests using seven different dilution water samples. The observed 48-h EC50 value increased with increasing water hardness (28-250 mg CaCO3/L) and Na+ concentration (4.3-19.7 mg Na/L). The effect of Ca2+ and Mg2+ on K2Cr2O7 toxicity was equivalent in terms of molar concentration. The 48-h EC50 for K2Cr2O7 was determined according to OECD TG 202 by six contract laboratories using M4 medium and were shown to be reproducible (CV: 15%), indicating that the toxicity level can be determined with high accuracy if holding and dilution water samples are standardized. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the 48-h EC50 was strongly correlated (r(2) = 0.927) with the Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+ concentration, and alkalinity of the dilution water samples. Detailed monitoring of water quality characteristics thus facilitates intra- and inter-laboratory comparisons of toxicity data and enables predictions of changes in the susceptibility of test animals.

In many developing communities, shortages often force households to depend on water tankers amongst other potential sources for the delivery of water for domestic and/or potable use. While water tankers have become an integral part of the water supply system in many countries, the sector is often unregulated and operates with little governmental supervision. Users are invariably unaware of the origin or the quality of purchased water. In an effort to better assess this sector, a field survey of water vending wells and tankers coupled with a water quality sampling and analysis program was implemented in a pilot semi -arid urban area (Beirut, Lebanon) to shed light on the environmental and socio-economic impacts of the water tanker sector. Total dissolved solids (TDS), chloride (Cr), and microbial loads exceeded drinking water quality standards. While TDS and levels were mostly due to saltwater intrusion in coastal wells, tankers were found to be a significant source of total coliforms. Delivered water costs varied depending on the tanker size, the quality of the distributed water, and pre-treatment used, with a markup of nearly 8-24 folds of the public water supply and an equivalent economic burden of 16% of the average household income excluding environmental externalities of water quality. The study concludes with a management framework towards consumer protection under integrated supply and demand side measures. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Dvarskas, A				Dvarskas, Anthony			Dynamically linking economic models to ecological condition for coastal zone management: Application to sustainable tourism planning	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												While the development of the tourism industry can bring economic benefits to an area, it is important to consider the long-run impact of the industry on a given location. Particularly when the tourism industry relies upon a certain ecological state, those weighing different development options need to consider the long-run impacts of increased tourist numbers upon measures of ecological condition. This paper presents one approach for linking a model of recreational visitor behavior with an ecological model that estimates the impact of the increased visitors upon the environment. Two simulations were run for the model using initial parameters available from survey data and water quality data for beach locations in Croatia. Results suggest that the resilience of a given tourist location to the changes brought by increasing tourism numbers is important in determining its long-run sustainability. Further work should investigate additional model components, including the tourism industry, refinement of the relationships assumed by the model, and application of the proposed model in additional areas.

J	Schiffer, S; Liber, K				Schiffer, Stephanie; Liber, Karsten			Toxicity of aqueous vanadium to zooplankton and phytoplankton species of relevance to the athabasca oil sands region	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												Vanadium (V) is an abundant trace metal present in bitumen from the Athabasca Oil Sands (AOS) region in Alberta, Canada. The upgrading of bitumen can result in the production of large volumes of a carbonaceous material referred to as petroleum coke that contains V at elevated levels compared to the native bitumen. Previous studies have shown that coke has the capacity to leach ecotoxicologically relevant levels of V into water it contacts, yet limited data are available on the toxicity of aqueous V to planktonic organisms. Therefore, this study set out to evaluate the acute and chronic toxicity of V (as vanadate oxyanions) to freshwater zooplankton and phytoplankton species that are either commonly-used laboratory species, or species more regionally representative of northern Alberta. Four cladoceran (2-d and 21-d tests) and two algal (3-d tests) species were exposed to V to obtain both acute and chronic toxicity estimates. Acute V toxicity (LC50s) ranged from 0.60 mg V/L for Ceriodaphnia quadrangula to 2.17 mg V/L for Daphnia pulex. Chronic toxicity estimates (EC50s) for cladoceran survival and reproduction were nearly identical within species and ranged from a low of 0.13 to a high of 0.46 mg V/L for Daphnia dentifera and D. pulex, respectively. The lack of sublethal V toxicity in daphnia suggests a direct mechanism of toxicity through ion imbalance. Growth inhibition (EC50) of green algae occurred at concentrations of 3.24 and 4.12 mg V/L for Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and Scenedesmus quadricauda, respectively. Overall, cladocerans were more sensitive to V than green algae, with survival of the field-collected D. dentifera being approximately 2.5 to 3.5 times more sensitive to acute and chronic V exposure than the standard test species D. pulex. However, there were no significant differences in V toxicity between the field-collected cladocerans Simocephalus serrulatus and C. quadrangula, compared to the respective standard species D. pulex and Ceriodaphnia dubia. Similarly, there were no significant differences in sensitivity to V in the two algal species evaluated. Based on V concentrations reported in laboratory-generated coke leachates, zooplankton survival could be adversely impacted under conditions of chronic leachate exposure if V concentrations in the environment exceed 0.1 mg/L. Furthermore, toxicity thresholds from commonly-used planktonic test species would likely have sufficed for derivation of a V water quality guideline (WQG) for protection of local aquatic communities near oil sands operations, but the new data presented here on V toxicity to more regionally-representative species will strengthen the database for WQG derivation.																	0147-6513	1090-2414				MAR	2017	137						1	11		10.1016/j.ecoenv.2016.10.040								WOS:000392786400001	27871041

Cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) are metal contaminants often found in AMD. In our mine outwash water samples, Cd and Pb concentrations were 300 and 40 times greater than EPA Aquatic Life Use water quality standards, respectively. We tested the phytoremediation characteristics, accumulation and tolerance of Cd and Pb contamination, for annual aboveground biomass harvest of three montane willows native to the Rocky Mountains: Salts drummondiana S. monticola, and S. planifolia. We found S. monticola best suited for Pb remediation based on greater growth and tolerance in response to the low Pb treatment compared to the high Pb treatment. Salix monticolo stems also contained higher Pb concentrations in control treatment compared to S. planifolia. We found S. planifolia and S. drummondiana best suited for Cd remediation. Salix drummondiana accumulated higher concentrations of Cd in stems than both S. monticola and S. planifolia. Salix planifolia accumulated nearly 2.5 times greater concentrations of Cd in stems in control treatment than did S. drummondiana. Salts planifolia also contained more total Cd in stems than did S. monticola in Cd treatments. Based on our results, S. drummondiana and S. planifolia could aid in reduction of Cd in watersheds, and S. monticola is better suited than is S. planifolia for aboveground accumulation and tolerance of Pb pollution.																	0147-6513	1090-2414				MAR	2017	137						225	232		10.1016/j.ecoenv.2016.12.001								WOS:000392786400029	27951422

Assessment of thiamethoxam toxicity to Chironomus riparius	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												The insecticide thiamethoxarn (TMX) is a systemic neonicotinoid widely used for pest control in several agricultural crops. MIX mimics the action of acetylcholine causing uncontrolled muscular contraction eventually leading to insect death. TMX is being found in freshwater ecosystems at concentrations of up to 225 mu g/L. Still, chronic toxicity data for freshwater invertebrates is limited. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the acute and chronic effects (at organismal and biochemical levels) of TMX on the freshwater insect Chironomus riparius. C. riparius life history responses were significantly affected by TMX exposure, namely with a decrease in growth and delay in emergence. Concerning the biochemical responses, after a short exposure (48 h) to TMX, our results showed that low concentrations of TMX significantly reduced CAT activity and LPO levels of C. riparius. No effects were observed in AChE, GST and ETS activities. Effects in terms of survival, development rates and biochemical responses of C. riparius exposed to low concentrations of TMX observed in this study suggest potential deleterious effects of this neonicotinoid on aquatic insects inhabiting freshwaters environments near agricultural areas.

New Insights on the Nitrogen Footprint of a Coastal Megalopolis from Coral-Hosted Symbiodinium delta N-15	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The development of megalopolises in coastal areas is often linked with severe eutrophication, requiring mitigation of anthropogenic dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) pollution. Yet, identifying the DIN-sources responsible for eutrophication is challenging, hampering mitigation efforts. Here, we utilize the stable nitrogen isotope ratio of endosymbiotic dinoflagellate Symbiodinium spp. (delta N-15(sym)) associated with the hard coral Porites to trace DIN sources in one of the most urbanized areas of the planet: the Pearl River Delta (PRD). The mean delta N-15(sym) value found in the coastal waters of Hong Kong (HK), located on the eastern edge of the PRD, (7.4 parts per thousand +/- 1.2 parts per thousand) was +2.7 parts per thousand higher than at Dongsha Atoll, a reference site unaffected by anthropogenic-DIN (4.7 parts per thousand +/- 0.4 parts per thousand). The isotopic enrichment suggested a consistent dominance of DIN deriving from local and regional sewage discharges on the eastern edge of HK. Furthermore, the strong depletion of the summer delta N-15(sym) value (-1.6 parts per thousand) observed in southern HK revealed that the Pearl River plume strongly modulates the coastal DIN pool. Our results revealed the value of benthic marine organisms' delta N-15 for deciphering the complex dynamics of coastal eutrophication and highlighted the pivotal role of transboundary coordination in DIN-pollution mitigation.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				FEB 21	2017	51	4					1981	1987		10.1021/acs.est.6b03407								WOS:000394724300010	28085273

Newly isolated Enterococci faecalis bacterial strains AIM06 (DSM100702) and SR14 (DSM100701) demonstrated 100% specificity and 90% sensitivity to human sewage without detecting 68 animal manure pooled samples of cats, chickens, cows, dogs, ducks, pigs, and pigeons. AIM06 and SR14 bacteriophages were present in human sewage at 2-4 orders of magnitude. A principal component analysis confirmed the importance of both phages as main water quality parameters. The phages presented only in the polluted water, as classified by a cluster analysis, and at median concentrations of 1.71 X 10(2) and 4.27 X 10(2) PFU/100 mL, respectively, higher than nonhost specific RYC2056 phages and sewage-specific KS148 phages (p < 0.05). Interestingly, AIM06 and SR14 phages exhibited significant correlations with each other and with total coliforms, E. coli, enterococci, biochemical oxygen demand (Kendall's tau = 0.348 to 0.605, p < 0.05), a result supporting their roles as water quality indicators. This research demonstrates the multiregional applicability of enterococci hosts in MST application and highlights the significance of multivariate analysis with nondetects in evaluating the performance of new MST host strains.

Soil phosphorus loss in tile drainage water from long-term conventional and non-tillage soils of Ontario with and without compost addition	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Recent ascertainment of tile drainage a predominant pathway of soil phosphorus (P) loss, along with the rise in concentration of soluble Pin the Lake Erie, has led to a need to re-examine the impacts of agricultural practices. A three-year on-farm study was conducted to assess P loss in tile drainage water under long-term conventional (CT) and non-tillage (NT) as influenced by yard waste leaf compost (LC) application in a Brookston clay loam soil. The effects of LC addition on soil P loss in tile drainage water varied depending on P forms and tillage systems. Under CT, dissolved reactive P (DRP) loss with LC addition over the study period was 765 g P ha (-1), 2.9 times higher than CT without LC application, due to both a 50% increase in tile drainage flow volume and a 165% increase in DRP concentration. Under NT, DRP loss in tile drainage water with LC addition was 1447 g P ha-1, 53 times greater than that for NT without LC application; this was solely caused by a 564% increase in DRP concentration. However, particulate P loads in tile drainage water with LC application remained unchanged, relative to non-LC application, regardless of tillage systems. Consequently, LC addition led to an increase in total P loads in tile drainage water by 57 and 69% under CT and NT, respectively. The results indicate that LC application may become an environmental concern due to increased DRP loss, particularly under NT. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Factors controlling groundwater salinization and hydrogeochemical processes in coastal aquifers from southern Spain	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												In detrital coastal aquifers, seawater and surface water may interact with groundwater in multiple ways. Understanding the interference of water fluxes in this type of environment is essential to effectively manage the groundwater resources in water-stressed regions, such as the Mediterranean coastal fringe. In this research, the characterization of the main hydrogeochemical processes and the interaction between surface water and groundwater in the Marbella-Estepona coastal aquifers (southern Spain) have been carried out by means of the combined use of different hydrogeochemical indicators along with isotope data. The results show that the diversity of source lithologies (peridotite, carbonate and/or metapelitic) substantially conditions the groundwater geochemistry. The analysis of ionic deltas made it possible a preliminary screening of the geochemical reactions that occur in the Marbella-Estepona aquifers, while the Discriminant Analysis allowed for a consistent classification of sampled groundwater types. The dissolution of calcite and dolomite determines the chemical composition of the groundwater from the eastern sector that are more conditioned by the rainwater infiltration. The dissolution of magnesium-bearing minerals (predominantly forming peridotite rocks) is observed in grodndwater samples from the western and central sectors, whose chemical composition showed a greater influence of surface water. The spatial analysis of rC1(-)/Br- in groundwater has permitted to corroborate that saline intrusion is negligible, hardly affecting to its original water quality. The irregularly distributed recharge by precipitation (seasonal effect) and the atmospheric circulation of cloud fronts (coastal/continental effect) explains why most of groundwater sampled is isotopically impoverished with respect to the rainfall signature. The isotope approach also suggests the hydraulic relationship between surface water and groundwater in the study site. A deeper knowledge of spatial hydrogeochemical variations in coastal groundwater and the influence of water sources over them are crucial for a sustainable groundwater management and global change adaptation in equivalent Mediterranean water -stressed regions.

In NYC, a citizen science campaign is monitoring waterways impacted by inputs of storm water and untreated sewage during periods of rainfall. However, the spatial and temporal scales over which the monitoring program can sample are constrained by cost and time, thus hindering the construction of databases that benefit both scientists and citizens. In this study, we first illustrate the scientific value of a citizen scientist monitoring campaign by using the data collected through the Campaign to characterize the seasonal variability of sampled bacterial concentration as well as its response to antecedent rainfall. Second, we examine the efficacy of the HyServe Compact Dry ETC method, a lower cost and time-efficient alternative to the EPA-approved IDEXX Enterolert method for fecal indicator monitoring, through a paired sample comparison of IDEXX and HyServe (total of 424 paired samples). The HyServe and IDEXX methods return the same result for over 80% of the samples with regard to whether a water sample is above or below the EPA's recreational water quality criteria for a single sample of 110 enterococci per 100 m.L. The HyServe method classified as unsafe 90% of the 119 water samples that were classified as having unsafe enterococci concentrations by the more established IDEXX method. This study seeks to encourage other scientists to engage with citizen scientist communities and to also pursue the development of cost-and time-efficient methodologies to sample environmental variables that are not easily collected or analyzed in an automated manner.

Public health implications of environmental noise associated with unconventional oil and gas development	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Modern oil and gas development frequently occurs in close proximity to human populations and increased levels of ambient noise have been documented throughout some phases of development. Numerous studies have evaluated air and water quality degradation and human exposure pathways, but few have evaluated potential health risks and impacts from environmental noise exposure. We reviewed the scientific literature on environmental noise exposure to determine the potential concerns, if any, that noise from oil and gas development activities present to public health. Data on noise levels associated with oil and gas development are limited, but measurements can be evaluated amidst the large body of epidemiology assessing the non-auditory effects of environmental noise exposure and established public health guidelines for community noise. There are a large number of noise dependent and subjective factors that make the determination of a dose response relationship between noise and health outcomes difficult. However, the literature Indicates that oil and gas activities produce noise at levels that may increase the risk of adverse health outcomes, including annoyance, sleep disturbance, and cardiovascular disease. More studies that investigate the relationships between noise exposure and human health risks from unconventional oil and gas development are warranted. Finally, policies and mitigation techniques that limit human exposure to noise from oil and gas operations should be considered to reduce health risks. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Off-site transport of nitrogen fertilizer with runoff from golf course fairway turf: A comparison of creeping bentgrass with a fine fescue mixture	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Maintaining quality golf course turf often requires irrigation and application of fertilizer. The transport of excess nutrients with runoff water from highly managed and fertilized biological systems to surrounding surface waters has been shown to result in enhanced algal blooms and promotion of eutrophication. Environmental stewardship includes looking for new approaches to reduce adverse environfmental impacts of current practices. One strategy is to replace traditional turfgrass with low-maintenance turfgrass species. Fescue grasses have been shown to provide characteristics desirable for golf course fairways. Thus side-by-side studies comparing runoff from plots planted in creeping bentgrass (CGB) or fine fescue mixture (FFM), similarly managed as a golf course fairway, were conducted to measure runoff volumes and the amount of ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N) and nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) transported off-site with runoff. Greater runoff volumes and mass of applied nutrients were measured in the runoff from the FFM, representing a 38% and 56% median increase in the off-site mass transport of NH4-N and NO3-N with surface flow. Shoot density, thatch depth and soil moisture were the most important factors related to runoff volume. Results of this research will be useful to grounds superintendents and researchers for selecting and developing management strategies to improve environmental stewardship of managed turf while providing desired turf quality.

Analysis of the contaminants released from municipal solid waste landfill site: A case study	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Release and transport of leachate from municipal solid waste landfills pose a potential hazard to both surrounding ecosystems and human populations. In the present study, soil, groundwater, and surface water samples were collected from the periphery of a municipal solid waste landfill (located at Ranital of Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, India) for laboratory analysis to understand the release of contaminants. The landfill does not receive any solid wastes for dumping now as the same is under a landfill closure plan. Groundwater and soil samples were collected from the bore holes of 15 m deep drilled along the periphery of the landfill and the surface water samples were collected from the existing surface water courses near the landfill. The landfill had neither any bottom liner nor any leachate collection and treatment system. Thus the leachate generated from the landfills finds paths into the groundwater and surrounding surface water courses. Concentrations of various physico-chemical parameters including some toxic metals (in collected groundwater, soil, and surface water samples) and microbiological parameters (in surface water samples) were determined. The analyzed data were integrated into ArcGIS environment and the spatial distribution of the metals and other physic-chemical parameter across the landfill was extrapolated to observe the distribution. The statistical analysis and spatial variations indicated the leaching of metals from the landfill to the groundwater aquifer system. The study will help the readers and the municipal engineers to understand the release of contaminants from landfills for better management of municipal solid wastes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Han, DM; Currell, MJ				Han, Dongmei; Currell, Matthew J.			Persistent organic pollutants in China's surface water systems	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Following recent rapid industrialization, China is now one of the largest producers and consumers of organic chemicals in the world. This is compounded by variable regulatory oversight with respect to storage, use and waste management of these chemicals and their byproducts. This review synthesizes the data on the distribution of selected persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in waters in China. Surface water heavily polluted with POPs is distributed in the Yangtze River Estuary, Pearl River Delta, Minjiang River Estuary, Jiulongjiang Estuary, Daya Bay, Taihu Lake, and the waterways of Zhejiang Province, where concentrations of Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) frequently exceed both international and Chinese guideline values. These areas are mainly distributed along the southeast coast of China, within or downstream of major manufacturing districts, intensive agricultural basins, and other industrial centers. A comparison of the levels of OCPs in the aquatic environment of China with other indicative regions worldwide shows comparable levels of pollution (overall range from below detection limit (BDL) to 5104.8 ng/L and regional means from 2.9-929.6 ng/L). PAHs and PCBs pollution appear to be particularly serious in China (PAHs overall ranging from BDL to 474,000 ng/L with regional means from 15.1-72,400 ng/L; PCBs from BDL to 3161 ng/L with regional means ranging from 0.2-985.2 ng/L). There is as yet limited evidence of serious perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) pollution. We discuss major sources and processes responsible for high POP occurrence using a range of measures (including diagnostic ratios of different compounds), regulatory oversight and policy gaps in the control of POPs in China, and potential long-term health and ecological effects. We argue that water quality guidelines, pollution control measures and cleanup strategies for POPs in China should be urgently improved. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Starting upstream of Fort McMurray and proceeding downstream ca. 100 km, waters were collected in duplicate at 13 locations on the main stem of the river, as well as 5 tributary streams, using ultraclean sampling protocols developed for polar snow and ice. To estimate potential bioaccessibility, trace elements of concern (Ag, Cd, Pb, Sb, TI) were determined in the dissolved fraction (<0.45 mu m) along with metals known for their enrichments in bitumen (V, Ni, Mo, Re) and those found mainly in ionic (Li, Sr) or colloidal forms (Al, Co, Cr, Fe, Ga, Mn, Th, Y). Analyses were performed in the metal-free, ultraclean SWAMP lab using quadrupole and sector-field ICP-MS. Concentrations of Ag, Cd, Pb, Sb and TI were extremely low, not significantly more abundant downstream of industry and probably reflect "background" values. In contrast, V, Ni, Mo and Re concentrations were all significantly (p < 0.05) greater downstream of industry. However, chloride also increased downstream, due to natural inputs of saline groundwaters and it is undear whether the increases in V, Ni, Mo and Re are due to natural or anthropbgenic inputs to the river. Although it had been claimed that the industrial development of the Athabasca Bituminous Sands (ABS) is a significant source of Ag, Cd, Pb, Sb and TI to the river, our study failed to find any evidence to support this. Here we provide a first, robust (accurate and precise) description of baseline values for these trace elements in the AR, and suggest that V, Ni, Mo and Re are more valuable tracers for environmental monitoring and source assessment.

The high variability of water quality requires rapid assays, but the conventional cultivation-based analysis of fecal indicator bacteria, such as Escherichict coil (E. coli), is very timeconsuming. In this respect, the measurement of the enzymatic activity of E. coil could prove to be a valuable tool for water quality monitoring. A mobile automated prototype device was used for the investigation ofp-Dglucuronidase (GLUC) activity at a remote karst spring, connected to a sinking surface stream, in Northern Vietnam. To assess the relationship between GLUC activity, discharge dynamics and contamination patterns, multiple hydrological, hydrochemical, physicochemical and microbiological parameters, including discharge, turbidity, particle-size distributions, and E. coli, were measured with high temporal resolution during ten days of on-site monitoring. A complex contamination pattern due to anthropogenic and agricultural activities led to high E. coil concentrations (270 to >24,200 MPN/100 ml) and a GLUC activity between 3.1 and 102.2 mMFU/100 ml. A strong daily fluctuation pattern of GLUC activity and particle concentrations within small size classes (<10 pm) could be observed, as demonstrated by autocorrelations. A Spearman's rank correlation analysis resulted in correlation coefficients of rs = 0.56 for E. coil and GLUC activity and rs = 0.54 for GLUC activity and the concentration of 2-3 mu m particles. On an event scale, correlations were found to be higher (rs = 0.69 and 0.87, respectively). GLUC activity and E. coli displayed a general contamination pattern, but with significant differences in detail, which may be explained by interferences of e.g. viable but non-culturable cells. Although further evaluations are recommended, GLUC activity is a promising, complementary parameter for on-site and near real-time water quality monitoring. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Licensing plays a crucial role in the regulation of municipal wastewater effluents by setting standards or limits designed to protect the economic, environmental and societal values of waterbodies. Traditionally these standards have focused on physical and chemical water quality parameters within the discharge itself, however these approaches do not adequately account for emerging contaminants, potential effects of chemical mixtures, or variations in the sensitivity and resilience of receiving environments. In this review we focus on a number of industrialised countries and their approach to licensing. We consider how we can ensure licensing is effective, particularly when considering the rapid changes in our understanding of the impacts of discharges, the technical advances in our ability to detect chemicals at low concentrations and the progress in wastewater treatment technology. In order to meet the challenges required to protect the values of our waterways, licensing of effluents will need to ensure that there is no disconnect between the core values to be protected and the monitoring system designed to scrutinise performance of the WWTP. In many cases this may mean an expansion in the monitoring approaches used for both the effluent itself and the receiving waterbody. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study established a manipulative experiment using different biomass fragments of Potamogeton crispus. This approach was adapted to study the reproductive capacity, nutrient removal efficiency, and algae inhibitory effect of fragments. Results showed that fragments could grow throughout a 49 day experiment by maintaining the stable photosynthesis efficiency of leaves and lengthening the stems. These floating fragments could regenerate by producing turions for the maintenance of their species. Moreover, the increasing removal efficiency of TP, TN, Nat-N, and NO3-N in water with the increase of fragment biomass indicates that the fragments could effectively purify water quality. Floating fragments competed with algae for nutrients, occupied a favorable ecological niche, and reduced algae biomass. They altered the structure of algae community and shifted the dominated green algae to cyanobacteria, the green algae of phytoplankton, and benthic algae. Findings imply that the postponable regulation of fragments is necessary for the ecological restoration of eutrophic lakes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Elledge, A; Thornton, C				Elledge, Amanda; Thornton, Craig			Effect of changing land use from virgin brigalow (Acacia harpophylla) woodland to a crop or pasture system on sediment, nitrogen and phosphorus in runoff over 25 years in subtropical Australia	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Native vegetation has been extensively cleared for agricultural systems worldwide, resulting in increased pollutant loads that often have adverse impacts downstream. This study uses 25 years of flow data and 10 years of sediment, nitrogen and phosphorus (total and dissolved) event mean concentrations from paired catchments to quantify the effect of changing land use from virgin brigalow (Acacia harpophylla) woodland in a semi-arid subtropical region of Australia into an unfertilised crop or conservatively grazed pasture system. Both the cropped and grazed catchments exported higher loads of sediment and phosphorus than the virgin brigalow catchment; however, the grazed catchment exported less total, oxidised and dissolved nitrogen than the virgin brigalow catchment. The cropped catchment exported higher loads of all water quality parameters compared to the grazed catchment. The simple hydrology and water quality model presented was effective for measuring the effect of land use change on runoff water quality. Variations in water quality between the three catchments are likely due to the presence of native legumes, ground cover, tillage practices and pasture rundown.

Sequential fractionation was used to investigate accumulation and distribution of phosphorus in the soil profile to 100 cm (0-7.5, 7.5-15,1525, 25-50, 50-75, 75-100 cm) under fertilized and grazed pasture. The trial site had received annual superphosphate fertilizer inputs at different rates (0, 188 and 376 kg superphosphate ha(-1) year control, 188PA and 376PA, respectively) for 57 years. While there was significant accumulation of total phosphorus in the topsoil (0-7.5 cm), no corresponding differences were observed in organic or residual (non-extracted) phosphorus between treatments. However, fractionation data showed that inorganic forms of phosphorus were significantly higher in the 376PA treatment for all soil depths to 50 cm compared with the other treatments. Furthermore, the relative magnitude and significance of differences between the 376PA and other treatments in soil to 50 cm were greater for readily-soluble inorganic phosphorus (NaHCO3 and NaOH I extractable) compared with more recalcitrant inorganic phosphorus (HCl and NaOH II extractable). As such, phosphorus applied in excess of agronomic requirements and soil retention capacity was transferred below the topsoil and root zone by leacing, and most of the transfer of phosphorus was in readily-soluble inorganic forms. This presents an enhanced risk of elevated phosphorus transfer to groundwater with associated adverse impacts on water quality under fertilized and irrigated pastures. Our findings highlight the need to carefully assess and manage fertilizer phosphorus inputs in accordance with agronomic demand and soil retention capacity to minimize downward phosphorus movement and phosphorus transfer to water bodies.

Integrated assessment of agricultural nutrient pressures and legacies in karst landscapes	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Landscapes typically deemed at risk from leached losses of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are those with short subsurface hydrologic time lags. Due to the short time it takes nutrients to move from a source to an area of concern, such sites are deemed perfect to test the efficacy of programmes of measures as management changes. However, a small subset of these sites can retain nutrients in soil/subsoil layers, which in turn are leached and can be either attenuated (e.g. nitrate converted to gaseous forms or immobilised in soil and P can be mineralised) or mobilised over time. This biogeochemical time lag can have long lasting effects on water quality. In an intensive agricultural karst oxidised aquifer setting, the aim of this study was to improve understanding of P and N inputs, retention, attenuation and subsurface pathway distribution and to inform how similar sites can be managed in the future. This was undertaken for the present site by integrating existing secondary and new primary datasets for both N and P. Results showed that in the years pre-2000 slurry from an on-site integrated pig production unit had been applied at rates of 33 t ha(-1) annually, which supplied approximately 136 kg ha(-1) total N and approximately 26 kg ha(-1) total P annually. This practice contributed to large quantities of N (Total N and NH4-N) and elevated soil test P (Morgan extractable P), present to a depth of 1 m. This store was augmented by recent surpluses of 263 kg N ha(-1), with leached N to groundwater of 82.5 kg N ha(-1) with only 2.5 kg N ha(-1) denitrified in the aquifer thereafter. High resolution spring data showed greatest percentage loss in terms of N load from small (54-88%) and medium fissure pathways (7-21%) with longer hydrologic time lags, with smallest loads from either large fissure (1-13%) or conduit (1-10%) pathways with short hydrologic time lags (reaction time at the spring from onset of a rainfall event is within hours). Although soils were saturated in P and in mobile forms to 0.5 m, dissolved reactive P concentrations in groundwater remained low due to Ca and Mg limestone chemistry. Depletion of the legacy store with no further inputs (taking 25% of available mass of soil organic N as available in 1 m of soil/subsoil to be 75 kg N ha(-1)) would take approximately 50 years, with NO3-N concentrations in the source area dropping to levels that could sustain groundwater NO3-N concentrations below admissible levels within 9 years. Biogeochemical time lags (decades) are longer than hydrologic time lags on this site (months to years). Future management should target farm surpluses that maintain a legacy store at or below a soil organic N mass of 20 kg N ha(-1). Incorporation of biogeochemical and hydrologic time lag principles into future water quality regulations will provide regulators with realistic expectations when implementing policies.

J	Balci, M; Balkis, N				Balci, Muharrem; Balkis, Neslihan			Assessment of phytoplankton and environmental variables for water quality and trophic state classification in the Gemlik Gulf, Marmara Sea (Turkey)	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Phytoplankton assemblages related to environmental factors and ecological status of the Gemlik Gulf were investigated between June 2010 and May 2011. A total 155 phytoplankton species were detected and 6 taxa (Amphisolenia laticincta, Archaeperidinium minutum, Cochlodinium sp., Gynogonadinium aequatoriale, Heterocapsa rotundata and Metaphalacroma sp.) were new records for the Turkish Seas. The lowest and highest total phytoplankton abundance among the sampling units (depths) was recorded in April 2011 (7.4 x 10(3) cells L-1) and July 2010 (251.8 x 10(3) cells L-1). Local small patches of visible red tide events were detected especially in the gulf, although a phytoplankton bloom was not observed. The water column was well stratified in the early autumn and well mixed in the early spring according to stratification index values. Surface nutrient concentrations increased especially at stations located inside of the gulf. The limiting effect of silicate was observed in early, midsummer and early winter periods while the nitrogen was the limiting nutrient in the gulf during the whole sampling period. In the Gulf, low water quality-high mesotrophic and bad water quality-eutrophic status, high quality and low trophic level were generally detected according to Chl a, dissolved oxygen and trophic index. However, indices developed to determine the trophic level and water quality of the Mediterranean Sea can give unexpected results about the current environmental quality status when it is applied to the Marmara Sea which has limited photic zone by the halocline-pycnocline and thermocline.

MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Occurrence of algal blooms in coastal waters is predicted to be more prevalent in future. To minimize their occurrence, manipulating the grazing pressure by suspension feeders is a potential management strategy, but its effectiveness may depend on their feeding preference. Therefore, we assessed the clearance rate of a widespread serpulid polychaete Hydroides elegans in larval and adult stages on various coastal phytoplankton. Additionally, the growth and development of H. elegans after consuming these phytoplankton were determined to reflect its sustainability to counter algal blooms. Results showed that H. elegans can consume and utilize different phytoplankton, except diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana, for growth and development in both life stages. Given the fast-colonizing ability which allows easy manipulation of abundance, H. elegans is considered practically and biologically ideal for tackling algal blooms. Other suspension feeders with different feeding niches could be used in combination to maximize the versatility of the top-down control. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Differences in the structure of copepod assemblages in four tropical estuaries: Importance of pollution and the estuary hydrodynamics	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												We examined the relationship between pollution and structure of copepod assemblages in estuaries, using sampling standardization of salinity range to reduce the effects of "Estuarine Quality Paradox". Copepod assemblages were analyzed in four Southeast Brazilian estuaries with different water quality levels and different hydrodynamic characteristics. The pollution negatively impacted the descriptors of the assemblage structure. The distribution of structure of copepod assemblages also showed a main separation trend between the most polluted estuaries and those less polluted. Temperature was the main factor affecting the assemblage structuring in the four estuaries. This factor acted in synergism with the effects of pollution impact and physical characteristics of the estuaries on the structure of copepod assemblages, supporting the potential vulnerability of coastal environments due to nutrient enrichment associated with climate change. Our study demonstrated the importance of sampling standardization of the salinity range in estuaries for reliable analysis of pollution effects on biota. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Narale, DD; Anil, AC				Narale, Dhiraj Dhondiram; Anil, Arga Chandrashekar			Spatial distribution of dinoflagellates from the tropical coastal waters of the South Andaman, India: Implications for coastal pollution monitoring	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Dinoflagellate community structure from two semi-enclosed areas along the South Andaman region, India, was investigated to assess the anthropogenic impact on coastal water quality. At the densely inhabited Port Blair Bay, the dominance of mixotrophs in water and Protoperidinoids in sediments was attributed to anthropogenic nutrient enrichment and prey availability. A significant decrease in dinoflagellate abundance from inner to outer bay emphasize the variation in nutrient availability. The dominance of autotrophs and Gonyaulacoid cysts at the North Bay highlight low nutrient conditions with less anthropogenic pressure. The occurrence of oceanic Omithocercus steinii and Diplopsalis sp. could evince the oceanic water intrusion into the North Bay. Nine potentially harmful and red-tide-forming species including Alexandrium tamarense complex, A. minutum were identified in this study. Although there are no harmful algal bloom (HABs) incidences in this region so far, increasing coastal pollution could support their candidature towards the future HABs initiation and development.

Three ponds replenished with RW in three cities in China were chosen to investigate 22 indexes of water quality in five categories. This was achieved by comparing three pairs of ponds in the three different cities, where one pond in each pair was replenished with RW and the other with surface water (SW). The nutrients condition, heavy metal concentration and ecotoxicity did not differ significantly between RW- and SW-replenished ponds. By contrast, significant differences were observed in algal growth and pathogen risk. RW ponds presented a Cyanophyta-Chlorophyta-Bacillariophyta type with high algal diversity while SW ponds presented a Cyanophyta type with low diversity. Regrowth of bacterial pathogens and especially survival of viral pathogens in RW, was the main driver behind the higher risk for RW ponds compared with SW ones. The duration of RW replenishment was proved to have a marked impact on the algal growth and pathogen risk. With continued RW replenishment, non dominant algal species subjected to decrease while dominant species were enhanced resulting in the biomass increasing but diversity declining, and the risk posed by viral pathogens might become greater.

As of now, there is no globally consistent information available on concentrations of dissolved POPs in water bodies. The advance of passive sampling techniques has made it possible to establish a global monitoring program for these compounds in the waters of the world, which we call the Aquatic Global Passive Sampling (AQUA-GAPS) network. A recent expert meeting discussed the background, motivations, and strategic approaches of AQUA-GAPS, and its implementation as a network of networks for monitoring organic contaminants (e.g., POPs and others contaminants of concern). Initially, AQUA-GAPS will demonstrate its operating principle via two proof-of-concept studies focused on the detection of legacy and emerging POPs in freshwater and coastal marine sites using both polyethylene and silicone passive samplers. AQUA-GAPS is set up as a decentralized network, which is open to other participants from around the world to participate in deployments and to initiate new studies. In particular, participants are sought to initiate deployments and studies investigating the presence of legacy and emerging POPs in Africa, Central, and South America.

Source Apportionment of Atmospheric Polychlorinated Biphenyls in New Jersey 1997-2011	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the Delaware River currently exceed the Water Quality Criteria of 16 pg/L for the sum of PCBs due in part to atmospheric deposition. The purpose of this work was to use a source apportionment tool called Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) to identify the sources of PCBs to the atmosphere in this area and determine whether their concentrations are declining over time. The data set was compiled by the Delaware Atmospheric Deposition Network (DADN) from samples taken in Camden, NJ from 1999 to 2011 and New Brunswick, NJ from 1997 to 2011. The PMF analysis revealed four resolved factors at each site. The factors that dominate the PCB burden in the atmosphere at both Camden and New Brunswick resemble Aroclor 1242. These factors declined in concentration during some portions of the monitoring period, but this decline slowed or stopped during 2003-2011. None of the factors displayed consistent declines in concentration throughout the monitoring periods, and some factors actually increased in concentration during some periods. This suggests natural attenuation alone will not control atmospheric PCB concentrations, and additional efforts are needed to control PCB atmospheric emissions as well as the numerous other sources of PCBs to the estuary.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				FEB 7	2017	51	3					1195	1202		10.1021/acs.est.6b04572								WOS:000393738700024	28051297

Spatial Models of Sewer Pipe Leakage Predict the Occurrence of Wastewater Indicators in Shallow Urban Groundwater	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Twentieth century municipal wastewater infrastructure greatly improved U.S. urban public health and water quality. However, sewer pipes deteriorate, and their accumulated structural defects may release untreated wastewater to the environment via acute breaks or insidious exfiltration. Exfiltrated wastewater constitutes a loss of potentially reusable water and delivers a complex and variable mix of contaminants to urban shallow groundwater. Yet, predicting where deteriorated sewers impinge on shallow groundwater has been challenging. Here we develop and test a spatially explicit model of exfiltration probability based on pipe attributes and groundwater elevation without prior knowledge of exfiltrating defect locations. We find that models of exfiltration probability can predict the probable occurrence in underlying shallow groundwater of established wastewater indicators including the artificial sweetener acesulfame, tryptophan-like fluorescent dissolved organic matter, nitrate, and a stable isotope of water (delta O-18). The strength of the association between exfiltration probability and indicators of wastewater increased when multiple pipe attributes, distance weighting, and groundwater flow direction were considered in the model. The results prove that available sanitary sewer databases and groundwater digital elevation data can be analyzed to predict where pipes are likely leaking and contaminating groundwater. Such understanding could direct sewer infrastructure reinvestment toward water resource protection.

ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Systemic neonicotinoid insecticides are increasingly used as a crop protection measure to suppress insect pests on trees. However, senescent foliage falling from treated trees represents a rarely studied pathway through which neonicotinoids may enter nontarget environments, e.g., surface waters. To estimate risk posed by this pathway, neonicotinoid residues were analyzed in foliage from black alder trees treated with one of three neonicotinoid insecticides (imidacloprid, thiacloprid, or acetamiprid) at five concentrations, each ranging from 0.0375-9.6 g active ingredient/cm trunk diameter at breast height (n = 3). Foliar residues measured at the time of leaf fall were used as input parameters for a model predicting imidacloprid water concentrations over a 100-m-long stream stretch as a consequence of remobilization from introduced foliage (input: 600 g foliage/m(2) containing 80 mu g imidacloprid/g). The water concentration (up to,similar to 250 mu g/L) predicted by the model exceeded the recently proposed Maximum Permissible Concentration of 8.3 mu g/L for 15.5 days. Moreover, dietary uptake was identified as an additional exposure route for aquatic organisms. The alternative pathway (i.e., introduction via leaf fall) and exposure route (i.e., dietary uptake) associated with the systemic nature of neonicotinoids should be accounted for during their registration process in order to safeguard ecosystem integrity.

Evidence of Sulfate-Dependent Anaerobic Methane Oxidation within an Area Impacted by Coalbed Methane-Related Gas Migration	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												We evaluated water quality characteristics in the northern Raton Basin of Colorado and documented the response of the Poison Canyon aquifer system several years after upward migration of methane gas occurred from the deeper Vermejo Formation coalbed production zone. Results show persistent secondary water quality impacts related to the biodegradation of methane. We identify four distinct characteristics of groundwater- methane attenuation in the Poison Canyon aquifer: (i) consumption of methane and sulfate and production of sulfide and bicarbonate, (ii) methane loss coupled to production of higher molecular weight (C2+) gaseous hydrocarbons, (iii) patterns of C-13 enrichment and depletion in methane an\d dissolved inorganic carbon, and (iv) a systematic shift in sulfur and oxygen isotope ratios of sulfate, indicative of microbial sulfate reduction. We also show that the biogeochemical response of the aquifer system has not mobilized naturally occurring trace metals, including arsenic, chromium, cobalt, nickel, and lead, likely due to the microbial production of hydrogen sulfide which favors stabilization of metals in aquifer solids.

Occurrence of UV filters, fragrances and organophosphate flame retardants in municipal WWTP effluents and their removal during membrane post-treatment	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS					14th International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology (CEST)	SEP 03-05, 2015	Rhodes, GREECE					Membrane filtration using ultrafiltration (UF), nanofiltration (NF) or reverse osmosis (RO) membranes was evaluated as an efficient effluent polishing step at municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) for the removal of selected contaminants of emerging concern and for improvement of water quality according to water reuse requirements. In samples collected at two largest WWTPs in Norway, 12 out of 14 selected personal care products and organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) were found above analytical detection limit. The highest concentrations were observed for BP3, OC (UV filters), HHCB, AHTN (fragrances), TCPP and TBP (OPFRs), exceeding the predicted no-effect concentration for BP3 in one sample and AHTN in five samples. Independently of the membrane type used, membrane filtration effectively (>60%) removed BP3, UV-329, OC, HHCB, AHTN and DBPP. However, UF was insufficient (<20%) for removal of DEET, TCPP and TCEP. UF was sufficient to remove 30-50% of COD, 80-95% of TP, up to 30% of TN and NH4, and a min of 2 log reduction of E. coli. Water quality improved further with application of NF and RO. The results indicate that membrane filtration can be effective post-treatment to improve overall water quality and a measure to reduce potential risk in the receiving aquatic environment.

Novel pre-treatments to control bromate formation during ozonation	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS					14th International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology (CEST)	SEP 03-05, 2015	Rhodes, GREECE					Worldwide water shortage increase and water quality depletion from microbial and chemical compounds, pose significant challenges for today's water treatment industry. Both the development of new advanced oxidation technologies, but also the enhancement of existing conventional technologies is of high interest. This study tested improvements to conventional ozonation that reduce the formation of the oxidation-by-product bromate, while maintaining the effectiveness for removal emerging contaminants (atrazine). MnO4-, ClO2-, ClO2, ClO-, CH3COOO-, HSO5- or S2O5-2 with NH4+ were tested as pre-treatments to ozonation of ground water. Each oxidant and NH4+ were added in a single stage or separately prior to zonation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that has tested all the above-mentioned oxidants for the same water matrix. Based on our results, the most promising pre-treatments were MnO4- NH4+, ClO2- NH4+ and ClO2 NH4+. MnO4- NH4+ was the only pretreatment that did not inhibit atrazine removal. When compared with the previously proposed Cl-2/NH4+ pre-treatment, MnO4- + NH4+ was found as effective for preventing BrO3- formation, while atrazine removal was higher. In addition, MnO4- +NH4+ can be added in a single stage (compared to the 2 stage addition of Cl-2/NH4+) without causing the formation of potentially harmful chlorination-by-products.

During the bloom, some species produce toxic secondary metabolites (cyanotoxins) that are dangerous for humans and animals. Here, a multidisciplinary strategy for an early detection and constant monitoring is proposed. This strategy combines remote/proximal sensing technology with analytical/biotechnological analyses. To demonstrate the applicability of this strategy, four anthropogenically-impacted sites were selected along the Campania coast of southwestern Italy, in the so called 'Land of Fires'. The sites were observed using satellite and aircraft images during summer, 2015. Algal community composition was determined using spectrophotometric analysis for the detection of the cyanobacterial pigment phycocyanin (PC). Complementary metagenomic analysis revealed the taxonomic presence of cyanobacteria belonging to genera associated with strong eutrophic conditions. Key elements of this strategy are the combination and integration of applying different methodological approaches such as the parallel and combined use of satellite, aerial and in-situ data, the simplified multispectral image indexing and classification for a truly efficient method in detecting early blooms of cyanobacteria. The effectiveness of the strategy has been validated also by the specific taxa of cyanobacteria found in the examined areas that confirm the assumption that cyanobacterial blooms may serve as useful bioindicators of degraded water quality in coastal ecosystems. To our knowledge this is the first time that the presence of cyanobacteria has been observed in water bodies along the Campania coast.

The system consisted of a vertical subsurface flow (VSF) CW, a free water surface (FWS) CW, and a horizontal subsurface flow (HSF) CW in series. Results from six-year operation showed that the system resulted in average removal efficiencies of 70%, 70%, 34%, 52%, 45%, 74%, 21%, 43%, and 98% for COD, NH4-N, NO3-N, TN, TP, TSS, F-, Ni, and E. coli, respectively. Especially, NH4-N was effectively removed by the VSF CW. With relatively high hydraulic loading rates (18.0-43.6 cm d(-1)) and short hydraulic retention times (1.04-2.51 d), the removal efficiencies of the system were quite stable for most of the water quality parameters, while the removal efficiency of TN increased from 49% to 60% during the six years. The removal efficiencies of the system were generally stable with the change of seasons. This study demonstrates that the VSF + FWS + HSF CW system can be a valuable approach for advanced wastewater treatment to meet the more stringent discharge requirement. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Comparison of three solid phase extraction sorbents for the isolation of THM precursors from manitoban surface waters	CHEMOSPHERE												Three prepackaged solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridges: two modified styrene divinylbenzene, Bond Elut ENV and Bond Elut PPL (Varian), and one N-vinylpyrrolidone (Strata-X, Phenomenex), were assessed for isolation of THM precursors from three surface waters in Manitoba, Canada. The dissolved organic matter (DOM) from the La Salle River (LR), Lake Winnipegosis (LW) and the Waterhen River (WR) were fractionated into hydrophobic (HPO) and hydrophilic (HPI) parts. ENV isolated less DOM (LR = 46.6 +/- 1.5%; LW = 36.2 +/- 1.4%; WR = 28.6 +/- 2.2%) compared to PPL (LR = 50.2 +/- 4.4%; LW = 47.9 +/- 2.2%; WR = 37.3 +/- 2.8%) and Strata (LR = 46.4% +/- 1.0; LW = 51.6 +/- 03%; WR = 31.9 +/- 3.9%). The HPO fraction isolated by each SPE was characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared (FUR) spectrochemical imaging. The FTIR spectra confirmed the HPO fractions were typical of humic-material and largely resembled fulvic acids; however, the PPL and Strata HPO isolates contained slightly more polysaccharides. The THM formation potential (THMFP) confirmed that the HPO fraction formed more THMs than the HP!. The HPO fraction isolated using ENV was found to have the lowest THMFP of all three SPEs in each waterbody; however, the specific THMFP (mu gTHM/mgDOM) results indicated that ENV isolated THM precursors more effectively, as the Strata and PPL isolated a greater amount of non THM forming material. All three SPE showed significant potential for implementation at water treatment plants as a simple tool to monitor THM precursors in source waters, enabling operators to adapt processes to improve drinking water quality.

Wastewater from SWF and DWF canals is used for pisciculture at the East Calcutta Wetland (ECW) for nearly a century. A wastewater fed pisciculture pond was selected to study the efficiency of the pond in treatment of wastewater. Monthly changes of hydraulic variables viz. inflow and outflow rates, depth, hydraulic loading rates, detention time of water at the pond were estimated. The monthly and seasonal changes of removal efficiency (RE) of TDS, TSS, alkalinity, hardness, phosphate, nitrate, BOD, COD, Cr, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn and Pb and dependence of the RE values upon hydraulic variables, physicochemical and biological factors were also explored. The hydraulic variables (water depth, inflow volumes, hydraulic loading rate and detention time) revealed a definite seasonal fluctuation pattern influenced primarily by rainfall. Efficient reduction of BOD, COD and the elements from the fishpond was recorded. Most of the factors showed higher mean seasonal removal efficiencies during monsoon and post-monsoon. The ameliorative efficiency of the wastewater-fed fish pond proved to be quite good when compared to natural and constructed wetlands. The average detention time of wastewater at the pond was calculated to be about 34 days and the period would be essential for the pond to ameliorate the pollutant load of the raw composite wastewater at the ECW.																	1582-9596	1843-3707				FEB	2017	16	2					361	371										WOS:000400161900011

From that moment, the Kolubara River flowed through the Pestan's riverbed (its right tributary), and the bank erosion became stronger, resulting in the lateral migration of the river course on one hand and land loss, land use changes, and economic consequences on the other hand. The economic effects caused by bank erosion were analysed both via the loss of land and the reduction in the volume of agricultural production. In the period 1967-2010, bank erosion caused a land loss of 67.3 ha, including 39.6 ha of arable land. The total value of the land loss by 2010 was 80,560 USD, and the total loss in agricultural production was 634,240 USD (1982=100). The second aim of this study was to investigate the costs and benefits of bank protection using the method of bank revetment construction at the moment bank erosion became more intense and during the latest phases. The results of this research suggest that any delay in the investment in Kolubara River bank protection could be adverse. If the bank revetment along the endangered river banks was built in 1967, all investments would have been recovered through income from agricultural production and selling the lost land by 2010. The results should provide information for river engineering, environmental planners and policy makers who must deal with decisions regarding planning and the protection of bank erosion.

Indicator macroinvertebrate species in a temporary Mediterranean river: Recognition of patterns in binary assemblage data with a Kohonen artificial neural network	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Current classifications used in bioassessment programs, as defined by the Water Framework Directive (WFD), do not sufficiently capture the variability present in temporary Mediterranean streams. This may result in inaccurate evaluation of the water quality biological metrics and difficulties in setting reference conditions. The aim of the study was to examine if aquatic invertebrate data of increased taxonomical resolution but expressed on a binary abundance (frequent/rare) scale and referring to good bioindicator species only suffice to indicate clear gradients in water courses with high natural variability such as intermittent Mediterranean streams. Invertebrate samples were collected from 74 sites in the Quarteira River basin, located in southern Portugal. Their classification with the use of a Kohonen artificial neural network (i.e., self-organising map, SOM) resulted in five categories. The variables that drove this categorization were primarily altitude, temperature and conductivity, but also type of substrate, riparian cover and percentage of riffles present. According to the indicator species analysis (ISA), almost all the studied taxa were significantly associated with certain SOM categories except for the category that included sites with disrupted flow regime. The SOM and ISA allowed us to effectively recognize biotic and abiotic patterns. Combined application of both methods may thus greatly enhance the effectiveness and precision of biological surveillance and establish reference sites for specific channel units in streams with high natural variability such as intermittent Mediterranean streams.

Modeling the impact of highland settlements on ecological disturbance of streams in Choke Mountain Catchment: Macroinvertebrate assemblages and water quality	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Human disturbances of waterways in Ethiopian highlands have increased throughout the last century due to population growth and increased land use. Despite this, there is a lack of knowledge on macroinvertebrate responses to human disturbances and the application of biological monitoring in tropical highland waterways in general. In this study, we have evaluated the human impact on the ecological integrity of the Chemoga River catchment in the Choke mountain watershed in the northwestern region of the Ethiopian Blue Nile highlands. During wet and dry seasons the water quality and macroinvertebrate assemblages were assessed. Multivariate statistics and Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) were used to identify factors influencing macroinvertebrate community structures in highland streams in the northwest regions of Ethiopia. A total of 66 taxa of benthic macroinvertebrates were recorded, among which Diptera (38%) and Coleoptera (21%) were the most dominant. The results revealed a severe decrease in the ecological integrity of the Chemoga River in terms of macroinvertebrate composition at higher altitude. The ordination and cluster analysis clearly indicates extremely low macroinvertebrate diversity at sites where human impact is severe and a strong effect of altitude. These results highlight the need to protect the highland waterways of the Blue Nile area and that of similarly degraded watersheds in the Ethiopian highlands. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

M.; Melo, Adriano S.; Moreira, Marcelo P.; Hamada, Neusa			Effects of urbanization on stream benthic invertebrate communities in Central Amazon	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Urbanization and its physical and chemical effects on aquatic environments influence invertebrate communities negatively. Yet, it is not clear how urbanization affects inter-annual variation of invertebrate assemblages in streams. We 1) evaluated urbanization effects on the ecological conditions (biotic and abiotic) of streams in Manaus and 2) analyzed invertebrate community variation over time (between 2003 and 2010). Data on abiotic variables and invertebrates from 2003 were obtained from a previous study. In 2010 we sampled abiotic variables and invertebrate communities in the same low-order urban streams sampled in 2003 (n = 40). We recorded high values of total nitrogen, total phosphorous, deforestation, total impervious area (TIA), water temperature, pH, and electrical conductivity in the most urbanized streams, as compared to the least-impacted ones. In contrast, the least-impacted streams had high dissolved oxygen concentrations. Water quality was poorer in 2010 than in 2003: oxygen concentration was lower and total nitrogen, total phosphorous, deforestation, and TIA significantly higher in 2010. We recorded higher inter-annual variation of abiotic variables in the most-impacted streams as compared to the least-impacted streams. EPT (%, Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera) and richness metrics decreased with urbanization. On the other hand, % OP (percent of Oligochaeta and Psychodidae) increased with urbanization. Observed and EPT richness and% OP increased between 2003 and 2010. On the other hand, rarefied richness decreased between years. Increases of observed and EPT richness between 2003 and 2010 were related to low inter-annual variability in streams conditions; however, differences of% OP and rarefied richness were not related to inter-annual variability in environmental conditions. The degree of urbanization did not explain the magnitude of the within-stream difference of invertebrate communities between 2003 and 2010. The increased effects of urbanization represented by the abiotic variables sampled and the reduction of invertebrate richness and increased dominance of tolerant taxa indicate that public policy is not enough to protect or mitigate human impacts on the urban water systems under study.

They are usually underpinned by an Ecosystem Health Index (EHI) that combines various individual indicators to produce an overall ecosystem health "score". As a result of public water quality concerns, an integrated means of monitoring and reporting on aquatic ecosystem health was needed for the Fitzroy Basin in central Queensland, Australia. The Fitzroy Partnership for River Health was formed to address this need, and developed an EHI and report card for the Basin using existing monitoring data collected from various third parties including regulated companies operations and government. At 142,000 square kilometres, the Fitzroy Basin is the largest catchment draining to the World Heritage Listed Great Barrier Reef. The Fitzroy Basin provides an example of how to deliver an effective aquatic ecosystem health reporting system in a large and complex river basin. We describe the methodology used to develop an adaptive EHI for the Fitzroy Basin that addresses variability, complexity and scale issues associated with reporting across large areas. As well, we report how to manage the design and reporting stages given limitations in data collection and scientific understanding. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Torn, K; Herkul, K; Martin, G; Oganjan, K				Torn, Kaire; Herkuel, Kristjan; Martin, Georg; Oganjan, Katarina			Assessment of quality of three marine benthic habitat types in northern Baltic Sea	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The European Union Habitats Directive (HD) obliges member states to assess the conservation status of marine habitat types but no explicit methodologies for assessing the quality of habitats have been stated in the directive or accompanying documents. In this study, a system was developed to assess the structure and functioning of three important marine habitat types in the Estonian sea area: sandbanks (HD code 1110), mudflats (1140), and reefs (1170). The assessment system includes a list of ecological criteria and favourable reference values together with procedural rules and field sampling locations. The habitat types listed in the HD are broadly defined and may encompass different communities depending upon distinct environmental gradients. By considering these environmental gradients the habitat types reefs and sandbanks were zoned and the assessment criteria and corresponding favourable reference values were defined separately for each zone. A set of several metrics like benthos indices, community variables, presence of sensitive or typical species, proportions of functional or taxonomic groups were tested as potential criteria for determining habitat quality. The most appropriate criteria were selected for incorporation into the assessment system based on ecological eligibility, suitability to local conditions, occurrence rates of benthic species, responses to disturbances, statistical properties of distribution of measured values, and practical considerations. Extensive benthos database (records from the whole Estonian sea area, 1995-2014) was used to calculate values of criteria to support the selection of criteria and to derive reference values. In order to fully take into account their crucial role in maintaining the structure and functioning of habitats, the criteria on habitat-forming species were assigned higher hierarchical order in the assessment scheme compared to other criteria. Special field works were carried out to assess the status of the three habitat types in 2015. The quality of all three monitored habitats was assessed to be in a favourable status. Additionally, the distributions of the three habitat types were mapped. To date, this is the first study in the Baltic Sea region that formulates HD compliant explicit criteria, reference values, and assessment procedures for several marine habitat types. The main challenges of the study were to derive assessment criteria and favourable reference values that are ecologically relevant and practically feasible. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Environmental characterization of a Mediterranean protected shallow brackish coastal aquatic system, Klisova Lagoon, Western Greece: a case study	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												The Klisova lagoon aquatic system belongs to the wetland of Messolonghi - Aetoliko - Klisova Lagoon Complex, located in the western Greece and represents one of the most important Mediterranean lagoon systems, as it is protected by international conventions and is listed in the Natura 2000 European Network. Water physicochemical parameters such as pH, temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, nutrients definition, TOC, TN and bacteriological indicators (E.coli and Enterococcus spp.) were analyzed in a time period of 1 year monthly monitoring in five sampling sites along the lagoon. The geographical distribution of these parameters show a clear zonation and partition of the lagoon as the result of: (a) the discharging of poorly treated wastes into the lagoon of Mesolonghi city waste water treatment plant and (b) the interplay between sea water influence via the lagoon inlet and the fresh water inflow via lagoon's perimeter channels. The lagoon is characterized by seasonal hypoxic conditions, which are responsible for several ecological socks in the past including fish mortalities. The system is threatened by human interference and sedimentological processes such as the longshore drifting and siltation of the lagoon inlet. Measurements should immediately be taken in order to prevent further downgrading of the water quality.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				FEB	2017	21	1					115	125		10.1007/s11852-016-0476-2								WOS:000399030200010

Elemental properties, hydrology, and biology interact to shape concentration-discharge curves for carbon, nutrients, sediment, and major ions	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												To investigate the prevalence and cause of concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships for carbon, nutrients, major ions, and particulates, we analyzed 40 years of water quality data from 293 monitoring stations in France. Catchments drained diverse landscapes and ranged from 50 to 110,000 km2, together covering nearly half of France. To test for differences during low and high flows, we calculated independent C-Q slopes above and below the median discharge. We found that 84% of all catchment-element combinations were chemodynamic for at least half of the hydrograph and 60% of combinations showed nonlinear C-Q curves. Only two or three of the nine possible C-Q modalities were manifest for each parameter, and these modalities were stable through time, suggesting that intrinsic and extrinsic elemental properties (e. g., solubility, reactivity, and source dynamics) set basic C-Q templates for each parameter, which are secondarily influenced by biological activity during low flows, and the interaction between hydrology and catchment characteristics at high flows. Several patterns challenged current C-Q views, including low-flow chemostasis for TSS in 66% of catchments, low-flow biological mediation of NO23 in 71% of catchments, and positive C-Q for dissolved organic carbon independent of catchment size in 80% of catchments. Efforts to reduce nutrient loading decreased phosphorus concentration and altered C-Q curves, but NO23 continued to increase. While C-Q segmentation requires more data than a single analysis, the prevalence of nonlinear C-Q slopes demonstrates the potential information loss associated with linear or monotonic analysis of C-Q relationships, and conversely, the value of long-term monitoring.

Water quality data for national-scale aquatic research: The Water Quality Portal	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Aquatic systems are critical to food, security, and society. But, water data are collected by hundreds of research groups and organizations, many of which use nonstandard or inconsistent data descriptions and dissemination, and disparities across different types of water observation systems represent a major challenge for freshwater research. To address this issue, the Water Quality Portal (WQP) was developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the National Water Quality Monitoring Council to be a single point of access for water quality data dating back more than a century. The WQP is the largest standardized water quality data set available at the time of this writing, with more than 290 million records from more than 2.7 million sites in groundwater, inland, and coastal waters. The number of data contributors, data consumers, and third-party application developers making use of the WQP is growing rapidly. Here we introduce the WQP, including an overview of data, the standardized data model, and data access and services; and we describe challenges and opportunities associated with using WQP data. We also demonstrate through an example the value of the WQP data by characterizing seasonal variation in lake water clarity for regions of the continental U.S. The code used to access, download, analyze, and display these WQP data as shown in the figures is included as supporting information. Plain Language Summary The Water Quality Portal (http://www.waterqualitydata.us/) makes available more than 297,000,000 water quality records from all 50 states. Users can search for records at, upstream or downstream of their favorite river or lake location.

Data are obtained by monthly sampling of water contaminants, in order to monitor discharges from the land to the sea. We are interested in the multivariate time series of ammonia, nitrate, and phosphorus. The time series may present issues that make their analysis complex: non-linearity, non-normality, weak dependency, seasonality, and missing values. The goals of this work are the classification of the observations into a small set of homogeneous groups representing ordered categories of pollution, the detection of change-points, and the modeling of data heterogeneity. These aims are pursued by developing a novel spatio-temporal hidden Markov model, whose hierarchical structure was motivated by the data set to study: the observations are displayed on a cylindrical lattice and driven by an anisotropic and inhomogeneous hidden Markov random field. As a result, four hidden states were selected, showing that catchments could be grouped spatially, with a strong relationship with the dominating land use. This method represents a useful tool for water managers to have a nationwide picture in combination of temporal dynamics.

Evidence from Kisii, Kenya	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH												Information about the quality of rural drinking water sources can be used to manage their safety and mitigate risks to health. Sanitary surveys, which are observational checklists to assess hazards present at water sources, are simpler to conduct than microbial tests. We assessed whether sanitary survey results were associated with measured indicator bacteria levels in rural drinking water sources in Kisii Central, Kenya. Overall, thermotolerant coliform (TTC) levels were high: all of the samples from the 20 tested dug wells, almost all (95%) of the samples from the 25 tested springs, and 61% of the samples from the 16 tested rainwater harvesting systems were contaminated with TTC. There were no significant associations between TTC levels and overall sanitary survey scores or their individual components. Contamination by TTC was associated with source type (dug wells and springs were more contaminated than rainwater systems). While sanitary surveys cannot be substituted for microbial water quality results in this context, they could be used to identify potential hazards and contribute to a comprehensive risk management approach.

The effluents of the Montpellier wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) represented the main nutrient input. To improve the water quality of these lagoons, this WWTP was renovated and upgraded and, since the end of 2005, its effluents have been discharged 11km offshore into the Mediterranean (total investment Euro150M). Possibilities of ecosystem restoration as part of a conservation programme were explored by a focus group of experts. Their tasks were: (i) to evaluate the impact of the reduction of the nutrient input; (ii) if necessary, to design additional measures for an active restoration programme; and (iii) to predict ecosystem trajectories for the different cases. Extension of Magnoliophyta meadows can be taken as a proxy for ecosystem restoration as they favour the increase of several fish (seahorse) and bird (ducks, swans, herons) species, albeit they represent a trade-off for greater flamingos. Additional measures for active ecosystem restoration were only recommended for the most impaired lagoon Mejean, while the least impaired lagoon Ingril is already on a trajectory of spontaneous recovery. A multiple contingent valuation considering four different management options for the Mejean lagoon was used in a pilot study based on face-to-face interviews with 159 respondents. Three levels of ecosystem restoration were expressed in terms of recovery of Magnoliophyta meadows, including their impact on emblematic fish and avifauna. These were combined with different options for access (status quo, increasing access, increasing access with measures to reduce disturbance). The results show a willingness of local populations to pay per year about Euro25 for the highest level of ecological restoration, while they were only willing to allocate about Euro5 for additional footpaths and hides.

The present study provides a deeper understanding of the impact of seasonal change on the co-occurrence of As and F-, as both contaminants vary with climatic patterns. Groundwater samples were collected in pre- and post-monsoon seasons (n = 40 in each season) from the Brahmaputra flood plains (BFP) in northeast India to study the effect of season on As and F- levels. Weathering is a key hydrogeochemical process in the BFP and both silicate and carbonate weathering are enhanced in the post-monsoon season. The increase in carbonate weathering is linked to an elevation in pH during the post-monsoon season. A Piper diagram revealed that bicarbonate-type water, with Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ cations, is common in both seasons. Correlation between Cl- and NO3- (r = 0.74, p = 0.01) in the post-monsoon indicates mobilization of anthropogenic deposits during the rainy season. As was within the 10 mu g L-1 WHO limit for drinking water and F- was under the 1.5 mu g L-1 limit. A negative correlation between oxidation reduction potential and groundwater As in both seasons (r = -0.26 and -0.49, respectively, for pre-monsoon and post-monsoon, p = 0.05) indicates enhanced As levels due to prevailing reducing conditions. Reductive hydrolysis of Fe (hydr) oxides appears to be the predominant process of As release, consistent with a positive correlation between As and Fe in both seasons (r = 0.75 and 0.73 for pre- and post-monsoon seasons, respectively, at p = 0.01). Principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis revealed grouping of Fe and As in both seasons. F- and sulfate were also clustered during the pre-monsoon season, which could be due to their similar interactions with Fe (hydr) oxides. Higher As levels in the post-monsoon appears driven by the influx of water into the aquifer, which drives out oxygen and creates a more reducing condition suitable for reductive dissolution of Fe (hydr) oxides. An increase in pH promotes desorption of As oxyanions AsO43- (arsenate) and AsO33- (arsenite) from Fe (hydr) oxide surfaces. Fluoride appears mainly released from F--bearing minerals, but Fe (hydr) oxides can be a secondary source of F-, as suggested by the positive correlation between As and F- in the pre-monsoon season.

Hydrogeochemical studies were carried out in this area with the objective of identifying the geochemical processes influencing water quality and suitability of surface and groundwater for agricultural and domestic uses. Sixty-one groundwater and four surface water samples were collected from boreholes, dams and rivers and analysed for Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, HCO3-, Cl-, and SO42-, Fe-tot, PO43-, Mn-tot, NH4+, NO3-, NO2-. In addition, pH, total dissolved solids, electrical conductivity, total hardness, turbidity, colour, salinity and dissolved oxygen were analysed. Chloro-alkaline indices 1 and 2, and characterization of weathering processes suggest that the chemistry of groundwater is dominated by the interaction between water and rocks. Cation exchange and silicate weathering are the dominant processes controlling the chemical composition of the groundwater in the area studied. Mineral saturation indices indicate the presence of at least three groups of groundwater in the Vea catchment with respect to residence time. The meteoric genesis index suggests that 86% of the water samples belong to the shallow meteoric water percolation type. The findings further suggest that the groundwater and surface water in the basin studied are mainly Ca-Mg-HCO3 water type, regardless of the geology. Compared to the water quality guidelines of WHO, the study results on sodium absorption ratio, sodium percentage, magnesium hazard, permeability index and residual sodium carbonate indicate that groundwater and surface water in the Vea catchment are generally suitable for drinking and irrigation purposes.

The temporal trends from 1993 to 2012 in the concentrations of NO3-N and Cl from more than 3900 wells were estimated using the Mann-Kendall trend test and Sen's slope analysis and compared with the land use change trend for the period 1995-2009. The results indicate that the upward trends in NO3-N were associated with the expansion of agricultural lands, whereas Cl trends were considered to be affected by other factors in addition to the land use changes. In the mid-mountainous region, the deterioration in the groundwater quality by the both NO3-N and Cl was expected due to the continuous expansion of agricultural lands. In the lowland area, the NO3-N and Cl components showed different trends depending on the regions. In the eastern area, increasing trends in NO3-N were observed due to the development of new agricultural areas, while the Cl concentration was observed to decrease as a result of the regulation on groundwater extraction to reduce seawater intrusion. Our study highlights that a comprehensive interpretation of trends in NO3-N and Cl and land use changes for long-term periods can provide useful insights to prepare for suitable groundwater management plans in the whole island perspective.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				FEB	2017	76	4							176	10.1007/s12665-017-6466-3								WOS:000394965100038

Distribution of rare earth elements, thorium and uranium in streams and aquatic mosses of Central Portugal	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The distribution of 14 rare earth elements, Th and U was studied in streams of the study area at 21 sites. Aquatic mosses are known to accumulate even metabolically nonessential or toxic metals in concentrations much higher than their aqueous environment due to their unique morphology and physiology. Thus, the capacity of metal amplification in four aquatic mosses (Fontinalis squamosa, Brachythecium rivulare, Platyhypnidium riparioides and Thamnobryum alopecurum) was also evaluated as a potential bioindicator/biomonitoring tool. Thirteen REEs (0.001-2.81 mu g L-1) and U were detected in the stream water. Mean content of lighter rare earth elements (LREEs) was higher than that of heavier rare earth elements (HREEs). Fourteen REEs and two actinides were detected in moss samples, including Yb and Th which were below detection level in water samples. LREE uptake (0.17-12.2 mg kg(-1)) was greater than HREE uptake (0.02-0.78 mg kg(-1)) in all mosses. Uptake of LREEs was observed in the order: B. rivulare > T. alopecurum > F. squamosa > P. riparioides and that of HREEs in the order: T. alopecurum > B. rivulare > F. squamosa > P. riparioides. Mean U content (0.68-1.62 mg kg(-1)) in the mosses was found in the order: B. rivulare > F. squamosa > T. alopecurum > P. riparioides. Th content ranged from 0.4 to 2.36 mg kg(-1) in the order: B. rivulare > T. alopecurum > P. riparioides > F. squamosa. One-way ANOVA indicated a statistically significant difference (P <= 0.01) in mean concentrations of all elements (individually) in moss samples except for U. Highest bioconcentration factors of six REEs each were observed in B. rivulare (La, Ce, Sm, Eu, Tb and Dy) and T. alopecurum (Nd, Gd, Ho, Er, Tm and Lu). The highest BCFs for Pr and U were obtained in F. squamosa and P. riparioides, respectively. These species hold promise for biomonitoring studies in the future.

Germany does not face a significant water shortage problem, but it has three main challenges: protection of water quality, ensuring public water supply and public wastewater disposal, and protecting the public and infrastructure from floods. Capacity development is a key issue to overcome the challenges of water resources in any country including Germany. Engineers, technicians, and mechanics need to upgrade their knowledge on a regular basis to deal with the complex management and rapid technological developments. In order to create efficient training schemes, the Vocational Training Working Group of Global Water Partnership (GWP), part of the GWP Capacity Development Task Force, has worked on the definition of fundamental job profiles for the Water and Sanitation Sector (WASS). To cover all technical functions of the industrial water cycle, it was necessary to identify around thirty occupations. Then, a competence-based training approach was adopted. Additionally, an assessment approach was also developed based on comparing the level of competence of the workers to a standard level of competence for each job. The RWTH Aachen University with its partners have developed another game based approach (SeCom2.0) based on serious gaming technology to enable water professionals dealing with flood risk management to be trained on different flood situations in a virtual environment. SeCom2.0 has three main components that are connected by a database layer. In addition to the serious games component, there is a collaboration component and a learning management system. For nearly 100 members from the flood competence centre (HochwasserKompetenzCentrum) in Cologne, Germany gave input to simulate the real flooding scenarios, and the learners will have to deal with a flood scenario by protecting the city in a given time and using a given resources and tools. This work concluded that both competence-based and game-based approaches could be significantly improved by blending both approaches. This will improve the process of training; for example, the competence-based approach can be enriched by using game- based simulation by introducing the trainees to a simulation of different technologies in water utilities. This can save resources and money and enrich the training. More importantly is modifying the game-based approach using the approach of competence-based to focus on specific competencies and to make use of the competence standards in its assessment component. The first section of this introduces and categorizes water challenges in Germany. In the second and third section, the two approaches are introduced in details. The competence-based approach is introduced to the WASS while the games-based to the flood risk management. Finally, a conclusion and recommendations are illustrated.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				FEB	2017	76	3							131	10.1007/s12665-017-6416-0								WOS:000394967300011

Four distinct DOM components were identified: two main components regarding terrestrial humic-like materials (C1 and C2), one about terrestrial fulvic/humic-like materials (C3), and one related to autochthonous tryptophanlike materials (C4). The dominance of terrestrial fluorescence materials in DOM indicated that terrestrial inputs have critical effects on the surveyed lakes. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Canonical Corresponding Analysis (CCA) were applied to analyze DOM components and their relationship with the environmental variables. PCA graphs showed that there were spatial differences in DOM fluorophores among lakes with various environments. Components C1, C2, and C4 were correlated positively with PC1 axis (factor 1), while C3 was opposite. Component C1 and C3 showed positive correlations with PC2 axis (factor 2). The CCA and Pearson correlation analysis showed that sediment DOC was correlated significantly with sediment variables (TN, OM, and conductivity), water quality variables (TN, PO43-, and Chl a), and DOM components C1 and C3. All DOM components were related significantly to different environment variables, including water quality variables especially nutrient elements (NO3-, TN, Chl a, and DOC) and sediment variables (OM, NH4+, and HCl-P). The relationship between DOC and the lake comprehensive nutritive index TLI was marginally significant.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				FEB	2017	76	4							142	10.1007/s12665-017-6427-x								WOS:000394965100004						
J	Peng, RC; Yu, P; Luo, YB				Peng, Ruichao; Yu, Ping; Luo, Yunbai			Coke Plant Wastewater Posttreatment by Fenton and Electro-Fenton Processes	ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE												After conventional biological treatment processes, effluents of the coking industry contain high concentration of nonbiodegradable and refractory organic matters, which should be treated to satisfy the discharge water quality standards (chemical oxygen demand [COD] < 150 mg/L, NH3-N< 25 mg/L). In this study, post-treatment of coke plant wastewater was treated by the direct Fenton and anodic electro-Fenton (EF-Feox) methods. COD and total organic carbon (TOC) values were selected as the target parameters. COD and TOC removal efficiency was investigated through changing some operating parameters such as initial pH, initial H2O2 concentration, and current density. Under the optimum operating conditions of each progress, COD and TOC were removed more efficiently in the EF-Feox system (90% and 84.4%) compared with that in the Fenton method (61.96% and 48.12%). Influence of H2O2 feeding on removal efficiency was also investigated in this study. Results indicated that gradual addition of H2O2 instead of initial addition was a simple and convenient means of removing COD and TOC effectively. Furthermore, settling characteristics of waste sludge under different operating conditions was studied. In general, the EF-Feox process can be a promising and reasonable method in the post-treatment of coking wastewater.																	1092-8758	1557-9018				FEB	2017	34	2					89	95		10.1089/ees.2015.0520								WOS:000394186600004

Monetized as cost, attributable disease burden estimates can be useful for environmental management decisions. OBJECTIVES: We characterize the disease burden attributable to water recreation using data from two cohort studies using a cost of illness (COI) approach and estimate the largest drivers of the disease burden of water recreation. METHODS: Data from the NEEAR study, which evaluated swimming and wading in marine and freshwater beaches in six U. S. states, and CHEERS, which evaluated illness after incidental- contact recreation (boating, canoeing, fishing, kayaking, and rowing) on waterways in the Chicago area, were used to estimate the cost per case of gastrointestinal illness and costs attributable to water recreation. Data on health care and medication utilization and missed days of work or leisure were collected and combined with cost data to construct measures of COI. RESULTS: Depending on different assumptions, the cost of gastrointestinal symptoms attributable to water recreation are estimated to be $1,220 for incidental-contact recreation (range $338-$ 1,681) and $ 1,676 for swimming/wading (range $ 425-2,743) per 1,000 recreators. Lost productivity is a major driver of the estimated COI, accounting for up to 90% of total costs. CONCLUSIONS: Our estimates suggest gastrointestinal illness attributed to surface water recreation at urban waterways, lakes, and coastal marine beaches is responsible for costs that should be accounted for when considering the monetary impact of efforts to improve water quality. The COI provides more information than the frequency of illness, as it takes into account disease incidence, health care utilization, and lost productivity. Use of monetized disease severity information should be included in future studies of water quality and health.

Modernizing Water Quality Criteria in the United States: A Need to Expand the Definition of Acceptable Data	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												The development of water quality criteria (WQC) for the protection of aquatic life is a fundamental component of the Clean Water Actthe primary US legislation responsible for protecting aquatic ecosystems from pollution. Water quality criteria define acceptable levels of contamination in the environment and thus play an important role in society. Rules for how science is used to develop WQC were created in 1985. Most rely on only data and knowledge obtained through a single methodology, the single-species laboratory toxicity test. Since 1985, understanding of the fate and effects of environmental contaminants has advanced markedly from multiple perspectives and disciplines. However, many of these advances are routinely discarded in WQC development because they do not adhere to data limits imposed by the 1985 guidelines. The present Focus article outlines how multiple lines of inquiry have played important roles in improving understanding of the ecological implications of environmental contaminants. The authors focus on gains in understanding that would not have been possible through traditional toxicity bioassays alone and argue that more robust scientific understanding can be used to modernize WQC development. In particular, the present article highlights ways to increase the relevance of toxicity testing (at different spatiotemporal scales) and incorporate all relevant lines of evidence into WQC modernization.

The authors examined the toxicity of recently deposited sediments on juveniles of the freshwater mussel Epioblasma brevidens by collecting time-integrated sediment samples from the water column with sediment traps from 11 sites in the Clinch River basin, including 6 sites within an 88-km reach deemed a mussel zone of decline. Mussels were exposed to the riverine sediments and to 3 control sediments for 28 d; survival, shell length, and biomass were then assessed. Sediment treatment (i.e., river location) had a significant effect on mussel survival (p<0.01) and biomass (p=0.02) but did not affect length (p=0.37), and sediments from 2 of the tributaries were the most toxic. Inorganic and organic analyses of sediments indicated the presence of metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons at all sites. Manganese was negatively correlated with mussel survival and biomass, as was ammonia with survival and total organic carbon with biomass. Current land uses in the watershed indicate that fossil fuel mining and agriculture may be associated with elevated manganese and ammonia, respectively. The authors found that sediments collected with sediment traps over relatively short deployment durations can help elucidate recent contaminant influx and its potential for inducing toxicity in benthic organisms.

Diagnosis of potential stressors adversely affecting benthic invertebrate communities in Greenwich Bay, Rhode Island, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Greenwich Bay is an urbanized embayment of Narragansett Bay potentially impacted by multiple stressors. The present study identified the important stressors affecting Greenwich Bay benthic fauna. First, existing data and information were used to confirm that the waterbody was impaired. Second, the presence of source, stressor, and effect were established. Then linkages between source, stressor, and effect were developed. This allows identification of probable stressors adversely affecting the waterbody. Three pollutant categories were assessed: chemicals, nutrients, and suspended sediments. This weight of evidence approach indicated that Greenwich Bay was primarily impacted by eutrophication-related stressors. The sediments of Greenwich Bay were carbon enriched and low dissolved oxygen concentrations were commonly seen, especially in the western portions of Greenwich Bay. The benthic community was depauperate, as would be expected under oxygen stress. Although our analysis indicated that contaminant loads in Greenwich Bay were at concentrations where adverse effects might be expected, no toxicity was observed, as a result of high levels of organic carbon in these sediments reducing contaminant bioavailability. Our analysis also indicated that suspended sediment impacts were likely nonexistent for much of the Bay. This analysis demonstrates that the diagnostic procedure was useful to organize and assess the potential stressors impacting the ecological well-being of Greenwich Bay. This diagnostic procedure is useful for management of waterbodies impacted by multiple stressors. Environ Toxicol Chem 2017;36:449-462.

A formal Bayesian approach is adopted for the calibration and the uncertainty analysis of a commonly used wash-off model under (1) the unverified assumption of homoscedastic, independent, and normally distributed residuals; and (2) using a more correct heteroscedastic and autoregressive error model. The results obtained for each of these approaches are compared, and the uncertainty associated with water quality modeling is later propagated through a conceptual best management practices (BMP) model for various stormwater management scenarios so as to assess the effect of this uncertainty for BMP modeling and clarify the benefits of a robust description of error structure. This study indicates that the violation of the statistical assumptions about the residuals may result in unreliable estimation of model parameters and total predictive uncertainty. However, the effect of the uncertainty in the intraevent variability of concentrations in runoff is found to have only a limited effect on the outputs of the BMP model, regardless of the error model adopted for calibration.

Using a High-Capacity Chemically Activated Cow Bone to Remove Fluoride: Field-Scale Column Tests and Laboratory Regeneration Studies	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												In this study, a novel material, chemically activated cow bone (CAB), was further evaluated for fluoride removal via laboratory batch and field column studies using fluoride-impacted groundwaters in the Rift Valley of Ethiopia. Regeneration of the exhausted CAB was evaluated using 0.05 M NaOH and 0.01 M Ca(OH)(2) solutions. Water-quality parameters were analyzed to ensure that the CAB-treated water is safe for human consumption. The study indicated that the CAB produced in the laboratory and field showed fourfold improvement in fluoride removal capacity as compared to thermally activated cow bone (commonly known as bone char). The study also showed that more than 92% adsorption capacity of the exhausted CAB media can be regained using 0.05 M NaOH and 0.01 M Ca(OH)(2) solutions. The water-quality analysis conducted on the highly fluoride-impacted drinking waters treated using CAB media were found to be safe for public consumption. Therefore, these results further reinforce that CAB media can be used to provide access to safe drinking water for communities living in highly fluoride-impacted areas in developing countries and beyond.

Vanishing Springs in Nepalese Mountains Assessment of Water Sources, Farmers' Perceptions, and Climate Change Adaptation	MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT												The Thulokhola watershed of the Nuwakot district in the midhills region of Nepal can be considered typical of climate change-related stresses in the region. To assess the status of water resources and document farmers' perceptions of and adaptation to climate change impacts in this watershed, we invited community groups to monitor water quality and conducted 6 focus group meetings, 3 participatory rural appraisals, and spring and household surveys in 2011 and 2012. Historical precipitation data from a nearby weather station and discharge data for the Tadi Khola, the nearest major river, were also analyzed. The spring survey results confirmed farmers' perceptions and showed that 73.2% of the springs used as water sources had a decreased flow and 12.2% had dried up over the past 10 or more years, as recognized by local residents. In response to the severe decline of precipitation and the drying up of springs, local communities have implemented some climate change adaptation measures, such as constructing water tanks at water sources, using pipes to transport drinking water, diverting water from other springs, digging deeper wells, and traveling farther to wash clothes and fetch drinking water. To enhance drinking water supplies and ensure the agricultural, ecological, and environmental integrity of the watershed, initiatives such as comprehensive research on springs and groundwater hydrology, a spring rejuvenation program, and community capacity building for water sustainability and climate change adaptation are suggested.																	0276-4741	1994-7151				FEB	2017	37	1					35	46		10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-16-00039.1								WOS:000395382000005

Multi-Year Microbial Source Tracking Study Characterizing Fecal Contamination in an Urban Watershed	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												Microbiological and hydrological data were used to rank tributary stream contributions of bacteria to the Little Blue River in Independence, Missouri. Concentrations, loadings and yields of E. coli and microbial source tracking (MST) markers, were characterized during base flow and storm events in five subbasins within Independence, as well as sources entering and leaving the city through the river. The E. coli water quality threshold was exceeded in 29% of base-flow and 89% of storm-event samples. The total contribution of E. coli and MST markers from tributaries within Independence to the Little Blue River, regardless of streamflow, did not significantly increase the median concentrations leaving the city. Daily loads and yields of E. coli and MST markers were used to rank the subbasins according to their contribution of each constituent to the river. The ranking methodology used in this study may prove useful in prioritizing remediation in the different subbasins.

Chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC), and fluorescence spectroscopy are also capable of quantifying organic content, although the mechanisms of quantification and the organic fractions targeted differ for each test. This study explores correlations between BOD5 and these alternate test procedures using facility influent, primary effluent, and facility effluent samples from a full-scale water resource recovery facility. Relative reductions of the water quality parameters proved to be strong indicators of their suitability as surrogates for BOD5. Suitable correlations were generally limited to the combined datasets for the three sampling locations or the facility effluent alone. COD exhibited relatively strong linear correlations with BOD5 when considering the three sample points (r = 0.985) and the facility effluent alone (r = 0.914), while TOC exhibited a suitable linear correlation with BOD5 in the facility effluent (r = 0.902). Exponential regressions proved to be useful for estimating BOD5 based on TOC or fluorescence (r > 0.95).																	1061-4303	1554-7531				FEB 1	2017	89	2					168	177		10.2175/106143016X14504669768976								WOS:000397280800007	27074790					
J	Shi, W; Xia, J				Shi, Wei; Xia, Jun			Combined risk assessment of nonstationary monthly water quality based on Markov chain and time-varying copula	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Water quality risk management is a global hot research linkage with the sustainable water resource development. Ammonium nitrogen (NH3-N) and permanganate index (CODMn) as the focus indicators in Huai River Basin, are selected to reveal their joint transition laws based on Markov theory. The time-varying moments model with either time or land cover index as explanatory variables is applied to build the time-varying marginal distributions of water quality time series. Time-varying copula model, which takes the non-stationarity in the marginal distribution and/or the time variation in dependence structure between water quality series into consideration, is constructed to describe a bivariate frequency analysis for NH3-N and CODMn series at the same monitoring gauge. The larger first-order Markov joint transition probability indicates water quality state Class V-w, Class IV and Class III will occur easily in the water body of Bengbu Sluice. Both marginal distribution and copula models are nonstationary, and the explanatory variable time yields better performance than land cover index in describing the non-stationarities in the marginal distributions. In modelling the dependence structure changes, time-varying copula has a better fitting performance than the copula with the constant or the time-trend dependence parameter. The largest synchronous encounter risk probability of NH3-N and CODMn simultaneously reaching Class V is 50.61%, while the asynchronous encounter risk probability is largest when NH3-N and CODMn is inferior to class V and class IV water quality standards, respectively.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				FEB	2017	75	3					693	704		10.2166/wst.2016.553								WOS:000394350100021	28192363

Therefore, a combination of principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of a data set and artificial neural networks (ANNs) for forecasting purposes was used. The results obtained were compared with those obtained by using discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The proposed methodology was applied to four absorbance time series data sets composed by a total number of 5705 UV-Vis spectra. Absolute percentage errors obtained by applying the proposed PCA/ANN methodology vary between 10% and 13% for all four study sites. In general terms, the results obtained were hardly generalizable, as they appeared to be highly dependent on specific dynamics of the water system; however, some trends can be outlined. PCA/ANN methodology gives better results than PCA/DFT forecasting procedure by using a specific spectra range for the following conditions: (i) for Salitre wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) (first hour) and Graz West R05 (first 18 min), from the last part of UV range to all visible range; (ii) for Gibraltar pumping station (first 6 min) for all UV-Vis absorbance spectra; and (iii) for San Fernando WWTP (first 24 min) for all of UV range to middle part of visible range.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				FEB	2017	75	4					765	774		10.2166/wst.2016.524								WOS:000395820000002	28234277

Performance evaluation of 388 full-scale waste stabilization pond systems with seven different configurations	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Waste stabilization ponds (WSPs) and their variants are one the most widely used wastewater treatment systems in the world. However, the scarcity of systematic performance data from fullscale plants has led to challenges associated with their design. The objective of this research was to assess the performance of 388 full-scale WSP systems located in Brazil, Ecuador, Bolivia and the United States through the statistical analysis of available monitoring data. Descriptive statistics were calculated of the influent and effluent concentrations and the removal efficiencies for 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), total suspended solids (TSS), ammonia nitrogen (N-Ammonia), and either thermotolerant coliforms (TTC) or Escherichia coli for each WSP system, leading to a broad characterization of actual treatment performance. Compliance with different water quality and system performance goals was also evaluated. The treatment plants were subdivided into seven different categories, according to their units and flowsheet. The median influent concentrations of BOD5 and TSS were 431 mg/L and 397 mg/L and the effluent concentrations varied from technology to technology, but median values were 50 mg/L and 47 mg/L, respectively. The median removal efficiencies were 85% for BOD5 and 75% for TSS. The overall removals of TTC and E. coli were 1.74 and 1.63 log10 units, respectively. Future research is needed to better understand the influence of design, operational and environmental factors on WSP system performance.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				FEB	2017	75	4					916	927		10.2166/wst.2016.532								WOS:000395820000017	28234292

This study investigated the use of information on ionic composition as a fingerprint to identify the source land-use of stormwater runoff. We used 12 ionic species in stormwater runoff monitored for a total of 20 storm events at five sites with different land-use compositions during the 2012-2014 wet seasons. A stepwise forward discriminant function analysis (DFA) with the jack-knifed cross validation approach was used to select ionic species that better discriminate the land-use of its source. Of the 12 ionic species, 9 species (K+, Mg2+, Na+, NH4+, Br-, Cl-, F-, NO2-, and SO42-) were selected for better performance of the DFA. The DFA successfully differentiated stormwater samples from urban, rural, and construction sites using concentrations of the ionic species (70%, 95%, and 91% of correct classification, respectively). Over 80% of the new data cases were correctly classified by the trained DFA model. When applied to data cases from a mixed land-use catchment and downstream, the DFA model showed the greater impact of urban areas and rural areas respectively in the earlier and later parts of a storm event.

Evaluation of leached metals in recovered aluminum coagulants from water treatment slurry	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The water treatment industry consumes large quantities of coagulant and produces huge amounts of slurry. The cost of alum used in water treatment, stringent regulations and negative impacts of sludge disposal are the motive to do integrated research studies on the technical feasibility of aluminum coagulant recovery from sludge using acidification. This work studied the leaching of iron, manganese, and chromium as the most extracted metals with aluminum during sludge acidification; furthermore, these metals have a great impact on the recovered coagulants' efficiency and treated water quality. The sludge used was collected from El-Sheikh Zayd water treatment plant in Egypt, then dried and ground; afterward, the effect of acid concentration, sludge mass, temperature, mixing speed and mixing time was studied. In addition, it was noticeable that the efficiency of sulfuric acid in leaching iron, manganese and chromium is higher than that of hydrochloric acid. Also, higher leaching for the three metals was obtained in all the experiments using higher acid concentration, elevated temperature, and rotational speed. Finally, the leached metals in recovered aluminum coagulants will not limit its application to water and wastewater treatment, as their concentrations are still very low if compared with aluminum, even with the highest leaching efficiency.

J	Chaikaew, P; Hodges, AW; Grunwald, S				Chaikaew, Pasicha; Hodges, Alan W.; Grunwald, Sabine			Estimating the value of ecosystem services in a mixed-use watershed: A choice experiment approach	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES												The protection of water, land, and air resources has profound implications for the sustainability of ecosystem services provided to societies that are embedded within economies, global systems, and socio-cultural and political contexts. This study assessed preferences for provisioning, regulating, and supporting ecosystem services, specifically, climate regulation (carbon sequestration), nutrient control (water quality), and agricultural and forest productivity, and the willingness to pay for protection of these ecosystem services by residents in the Suwannee River Basin of Florida, as assessed through a household mail survey and choice experiment. A conditional logit model was used to evaluate preferences and marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) under different scenarios. Survey respondents identified nutrient control (water quality) as the most important service, while agricultural and forestry production was somewhat important, and climate regulation/carbon sequestration was the least important. Respondents expressed the highest level of trust in local government agencies to implement ecosystem service protection programs, and welcomed the implementation of such programs anywhere in the basin, but not close to their home. The average MWTP was extremely low ( < $2/household/year) when compared to other studies, and suggests that respondents have many competing interests for their discretionary spending in relation to environmental amenities.																	2212-0416					FEB	2017	23						228	237		10.1016/j.ecoser.2016.12.015								WOS:000396986200022

The increased economic, industrial, and domestic developments may affect the environmental quality of water and halicutic resources. In this study, we evaluated the seasonal (dry and wet seasons) biogeochemical state of the Saigon River during two snapshot campaigns conducted along the river basin upstream from HCMC; the Saigon River was characterized by slightly acidic (pH 5.7-7.7) and oxygen-depleted water (dissolved oxygen (DO), 0.36-5.18 mg l(-1)). Nutrients (N-NH4 = 0.01-2.41, N-NO3 = 0.14-2.72, and P-PO4 = similar to 0-0.42 mg l(-1)), DOC (2.2-8.0 mg l(-1)), POC, and trace metal(oid) (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Zn, and Hg) concentrations were low showing a good quality of the upstream river. In the urban center area, DO dropped to 0.03 mg l(-1) accompanied with a rise of nutrient concentrations (e.g., N-NH4, up to 17.7 mg l(-1)) likely originating from wastewater discharges. Trace metal concentrations also rose sharply (e.g., Cr and Hg rose up to 10-fold higher) in both water and sediments but remained under the World Health Organization (WHO) and Vietnamese concentration guidelines. In the downstream estuarine area, the intrusion of marine waters diluted water flowing from HCMC, leading water quality to return close to the state observed upstream from HCMC. In general, levels of nutrient and metal contaminations along the Saigon River during both seasons appear moderate regarding to Vietnamese and WHO guidelines although the urban area is highlighted as the major contributor for metal(oid) emissions. Finally, we showed that apart from wastewater and industrial discharges that affect the river quality, metal(oid) partitioning between solid and solution is controlled by the change in water geochemistry along the continuum during both seasons, such as DO (e.g., for As and Cr) and pH (e.g., for Pb) which drives their sorption/dissolution dynamics.

In the tidal Garonne River, its main tributary, episodes of low (< 5 mg L-1) to hypoxic (< 2 mg L-1) dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations have been occasionally recorded close to Bordeaux, about 100 km from the mouth. Projected long-term environmental changes (increase in temperature and population, decrease in river discharge) suggest the establishment of summer chronic oxygen deficiency in the tidal Garonne River in the next decades. Assessing and managing the risk of hypoxia on such a large, hyper-turbid fluvio-estuarine system is complex, due to the different forcing factors (temperature, river discharge, turbidity, urban wastes) acting over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales. In this context, we show the interest of a real-time, high-frequency monitoring of the water quality, the MAGEST network, which continuously records since 2005 temperature, salinity, turbidity, and dissolved oxygen in surface waters in Bordeaux. Through the analysis of the 10-year DO records, we demonstrate the interest of a high-frequency, long-term database to better document DO variability and to define the controlling factors of DO concentrations. This real-time monitoring is also of great interest for the development of manager's oriented tools and the follow-up of DO objectives in the tidal Garonne River.

Low C/N ratio raw textile wastewater reduced labile C and enhanced organic-inorganic N and enzymatic activities in a semiarid alkaline soil	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Application of raw and treated wastewater for irrigation is an extensive practice for agricultural production in arid and semiarid regions. Raw textile wastewater has been used for cultivation in urban and peri-urban areas in Pakistan without any systematic consideration to soil quality. We conducted a laboratory incubation study to investigate the effects of low C/N ratio raw textile wastewater on soil nitrogen (N) contents, labile carbon (C) as water-soluble C (WSC) contents, and activities of urease and dehydrogenase enzymes. The 60-day incubation study used an alkaline clay loam aridisol that received 0 ( distilled water), 25, 50, and 100% wastewater concentrations, and microcosms were incubated aerobically under room temperature at 70% water holding capacity. Results revealed that raw wastewater significantly ( p < 0.05) changed soil N pools and processes, WSC contents, and enzymatic activities. The organic and inorganic N species increased with increasing wastewater concentrations, whereas WSC contents followed an opposite trend. The highest NH4 (+)- N and NO3 (-) -N contents were observed in soil treated with 100% wastewater. The extractable organic N (EON) contents always represented > 50% of the soil total Kjeldahl N (TKN) contents and served as the major N pool. However, nitrification index ( NO3- -N/NH4+-N ratio) decreased at high wastewater concentrations. A significant negative correlation was observed between EON and WSC ( p < 0.05) and between net nitrification and WSC/EON ratio ( p < 0.01). In contrast, nitrification index and WSC contents were correlated, positively suggesting WSC potentially controlling N turnover in nutrient-poor aridisol. We found significant ( p < 0.0001) positive correlations of soil urease and dehydrogenase enzymatic activities with soil-extractable mineral N contents indicating coupled N cycling and soil biological activity. Higher production and accumulation of soil NO3 (-)- N and EON contents in concentrated wastewater-treated soil could pose an ecological concern for soil fertility, biological health, and water quality. However, the EON could lead to mineral N pool but only if sufficient labile C source was present. The effects of wastewater irrigation on soil N cycling need to be assessed before it is recommended for crop production.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				FEB	2017	24	4					3456	3469		10.1007/s11356-016-8102-2								WOS:000397004600021	27873113

Use of major ions to evaluate the hydrogeochemistry of groundwater influenced by reclamation and seawater intrusion, West Nile Delta, Egypt	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												The aim of this research is to evaluate the groundwater geochemistry in western Nile Delta area as an example of an aquifer influenced by reclamation and seawater intrusion. To conduct this study, 63 groundwater samples and one surface water sample from El Nubaria Canal were collected. To estimate the origin of dissolved ions and the geochemical processes influencing this groundwater, integration between land use change, pedological, hydrogeological, hydrogeochemical, and statistical approaches was considered. Results suggest that the groundwater flow regime changed from northeast and southwest directions around El Nubaria canal before 1966 to northern and northeastern directions due to newly constructed channel network. Soil salinity and mineral contents, seepage from irrigation canal, and seawater intrusion are the main factors controlling the groundwater chemistry. Statistically, the groundwater samples were classified into eight groups, one to four for the deep groundwater and five to eight for the shallow groundwater. The deep groundwater is characterized by two groups of chemicals (SO4-HCO3-Mg-Ca-K and Cl-Na), while the shallow groundwater groups of chemicals are Na-Cl-SO4 and K-HCO3-Ca-Mg. Both shallow groundwater and deep groundwater are mostly saturated with respect to carbonate minerals and undersaturated with respect to chloride minerals. Sulfate minerals are above the saturation limit in the shallow groundwater, but in the deep samples, these minerals are under the saturation limit. Ion exchange, carbonate production, mineral precipitation, and seawater intrusion are the geochemical processes governing the groundwater chemistry in the study area.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				FEB	2017	24	4					3675	3704		10.1007/s11356-016-8056-4								WOS:000397004600040	27888479

Thirteen atmospheric PM sampling sites were established around this reservoir to analyze the mineral composition, morphological characteristics, element concentration, and sources of atmospheric PM pollution, using transmission electron microscope, X-ray diffraction, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analyses. The average monthly dry deposition flux of aerosols was 15.18 g/m(2), with a range of 5.78-47.56 g/m(2). The maximum flux season was winter, followed by summer, autumn, and spring. Zn and Pb pollution in this area was serious, and some of the sample sites had Cr, Co, Ni, and Cu pollution. Deposition fluxes of Zn/Pb in winter and summer reached 99.77/143.63 and 17.04/33.23 g/(hm(2) month), respectively. Principal component analysis showed two main components in the dry deposition; the first was Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn, and the other was Pb and Cd. Principal sources of the trace elements were iron mining and other anthropogenic activities in the surrounding areas and mountainous area north of the reservoir. Mineralogy analysis and microscopic conformation results showed many iron minerals and some unweathered minerals in dry deposition and atmospheric particulate matter, which came from an iron ore yard in the northern mountainous area of Miyun County. There was possible iron-rich dry deposition into Miyun Reservoir, affecting its water quality and harming the health of people living in areas around the reservoir and Beijing.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				FEB	2017	24	4					3829	3842		10.1007/s11356-016-8043-9								WOS:000397004600053	27900624

PSWM operation reduced the temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) differences between upper and lower water levels. Concentrations of NH4+-N, NO2--N, TN, TP, COD and TSS increased rapidly and reached maximums at 12 h. The density and biomass of phytoplankton and levels of chlorophyll a reached maximums after 40 h of PSWM operation. In a 165-day study, the mean concentrations of NH4+-N, NO2--N and the available phosphorous (AP) in the PSWM ponds were significantly lower than in the control ponds, but the TP was significantly greater than the control ponds. Compared with the test began, the thickness of the sediment in PSWM ponds declined by 12.4 +/- 4.3 cm, the control ponds increased by 5.0 +/- 2.3 cm and the TN and AP levels in sediment significantly declined. PSWM treatment increased the production of bream and silver carp by 30 and 25%, respectively, and the feed coefficient was reduced by 24.2%. Use of PSWM in bream aquaculture ponds improved water quality, reduced sediment, reduced aquaculture pollution emissions and increased production.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				FEB	2017	24	4					4040	4047		10.1007/s11356-016-8144-5								WOS:000397004600073	27928749

Throughout recorded history, the Lower Yellow River (LYR) experienced many catastrophic flood and drought events. To regulate the LYR, a reservoir was constructed at Xiaolangdi that became operational in the early 2000s. An annual water-sediment regulation scheme (WSRS) was then implemented, aimed at flood control, sediment reduction, regulated water supply, and power generation. This study examines the eco-environmental and socioenvironmental impacts of Xiaolangdi Reservoir. In retrospect, it is found that the reservoir construction phase incurred huge financial cost and required large-scale human resettlement. Subsequent reservoir operations affected the local geological environment, downstream riverbed erosion, evolution of the Yellow River delta, water quality, and aquatic biodiversity. Lessons from the impact assessment of the Xiaolangdi Reservoir are summarized as follows: (1) The construction of large reservoirs is not merely an engineering challenge but must also be viewed in terms of resource exploitation, environmental protection, and social development; (2) long-term systems for monitoring large reservoirs should be established, and decision makers involved at national policy and planning levels must be prepared to react quickly to the changing impact of large reservoirs; and (3) the key to solving sedimentation in the LYR is not Xiaolangdi Reservoir but instead soil conservation in the middle reaches of the Yellow River basin. Proper assessment of the impacts of large reservoirs will help promote development strategies that enhance the long-term sustainability of dam projects.

The publications referencing NPS pollution were analyzed including the following aspects: document type, publication language, publication output and characteristics, subject category, source journal, distribution of country and institution, author keywords, etc. The results indicate that the study of NPS pollution demonstrated a sharply increasing trend since 1991. Article and English were the most commonly used document type and language. Environmental sciences and ecology, water resources, and engineering were the top three subject categories. Water science and technology ranked first in distribution of journal, followed by Science of the total environment and Environmental Monitoring and Assessment. The USA took a leading position in both quantity and quality, playing an important role in the research field of NPS pollution, followed by the UK and China. The most productive institution was the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Chinese Acad Sci), followed by Beijing Normal University and US Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service (USDA ARS). The analysis of author keywords indicates that the major hotspots of NPS pollution from 1991 to 2015 contained "water,"Bmodel," "agriculture," "nitrogen," "phosphorus," etc. The results provide a comprehensive understanding of NPS pollution research and help readers to establish the future research directions.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				FEB	2017	24	5					4352	4366		10.1007/s11356-016-8130-y								WOS:000397007200012	27928755

The severe AMD pollution and the incipient state of remediation strategies implemented in this region, coupled with the proximity of the deadline for compliance with the European Water Framework Directive (WFD), urge to develop a restoration and water resources management strategy. Furthermore, despite the presence of some reservoirs with acid waters in the Odiel basin, the construction of the Alcolea water reservoir has already started. On the basis of the positive results obtained after more than 10 years of developing a specific passive remediation technology (dispersed alkaline substrate (DAS)) for the highly polluted AMD of this region, a restoration strategy is proposed. The implementation of 13 DAS treatment plants in selected acid discharges along the Odiel and Oraque sub-basins and other restoration measurements of two acidic creeks is proposed as essential to obtain a good water quality in the future Alcolea reservoir. This restoration strategy is also suggested as an economically and environmentally sustainable approach to the extreme metal pollution affecting the waters of the region and could be considered the starting point for the future compliance with the WFD in the Odiel River Basin.

This study investigated the stream health in the context of the presence or absence of sensitive species, their diversity, and their taxa richness. The water and macroinvertebrate samples were collected from 17 different locations from upstream and downstream of the river by using random sampling method. Macroinvertebrate samples were obtained using kick net (500-mu m mesh size) and hand-picking method (NYSDEC). A total of 710 counts including 41 families of macroinvertebrates were recorded comprising of 7 orders including: Ephemeroptera (46%) being the most dominant group, Plecoptera (33%), Trichoptera (5%), Chironomidae (Diptera) (14%), Heteroptera (1%), and Coleoptera (1%). Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera, and Plecoptera (EPT) were found in abundance at the main source, Qarchanai, Dhee, and Tourqeen Nullah, as compared to the other locations of the stream. The most dominant macroinvertebrate was Ephemeroptera whose relative abundance is Pi = 0.49 by using the Shannon index. However, different statistical tools, including principal component analysis (PCA), cluster analysis (CA), ANOVA, and linear regression model, show a strong correlation between water quality and macroinvertebrates. The overall results of the biological indicators showed better ecological health at downstream compared to upstream.

The Madrid region, covered by the population-based multicasecontrol (MCC-Spain) study, includes two drinking water supply areas. The different sources of the water, coupled together with the possible differences in water management, mean that there may be differences in drinking water quality. In the context of the MCC study, our aims were to describe contaminant concentrations in tap water drawn from various sampling points distributed around the region, assess these concentrations by reference to guideline values and study possible differences between the two supply areas. Tap water samples were collected from 34 sampling points in 7 towns in the Madrid region (19-29 April 2010), and 23 contaminants (metals, nitrates, disinfection by-product and Mutagen X levels) were quantified. We undertook a descriptive analysis of the contaminant concentrations in the water and compared them between the two water supply areas (Wilcoxon test). We created maps representing the distribution of the concentrations observed at water sampling points and assessed the correlations (Spearman's coefficient) between the different parameters measured. The concentrations of the contaminants were below guideline values. There were differences between the two supply areas in concentration of nitrates (p value = 0.0051) and certain disinfection by-products. While there were positive correlations (rho > 0.70) among some disinfection by-products, no correlations were found in metals or nitrates. The differences in nitrate levels could be linked to differences in farming/industrial activities in the catchment areas and in disinfection by-products might be related to the existence of different treatment systems or bromine content in source waters.

Nitrogen losses through surface runoff were measured for five treatments, including CK without N application, C200, C300 simulating the conventional practices, CO200, and CO300. Optimum N rate was applied for C200 and CO200, and 30% of chemical fertilizer was substituted with organic fertilizer for CO200 and CO300 with respect to C200 and C300, respectively. Rice season had higher runoff coefficients than wheat season. Approximately 52% of total N was lost as NH4+-N in rice season, ranging from 21 to 83%, and in wheat season, the proportion of NO3--N in total N averaged 53% with a variation from 38 to 67%. The N treatments lost less total N in rice season (1.67-10.7 kg N ha-1) than inwheat season (1.72-17.1 kg N ha(-1)). These suggested that a key to controlling N runoff losses from rice-wheat rotation was to limit NO3--N accumulation in wheat season. In both seasons, N runoff losses for C200 and CO300 were lower than those for C300. CO200 better cut N losses than C200 and CO300, with 64 and 57% less N in rice and wheat seasons than C300, respectively. Compared with the conventional practices, optimum N inputs integrated with co-application of organic and chemical fertilizers could reduce N runoff losses with a better N balance under rice-wheat rotation.

Characteristics of the overflow pollution of storm drains with inappropriate sewage entry	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												To probe the overflow pollution of separate storm drains with inappropriate sewage entries, in terms of the relationship between sewage entries and the corresponding dry-weather and wet-weather overflow, the monitoring activities were conducted in a storm drainage system in the Shanghai downtown area (374 ha). In this study site, samples from inappropriately entered dry-weather sewage and the overflow due to storm pumps operation on dry-weather and wet-weather days were collected and then monitored for six water quality constituents. It was found that overflow concentrations of dry-weather period could be higher than those of wet-weather period; under wetweather period, the overflow concentrations of stormdrains were close to or even higher than that of combined sewers. Relatively strong first flush mostly occurred under heavy rain that satisfied critical rainfall amount, maximum rainfall intensity, and maximum pumping discharge, while almost no first flush effect or only weak first flush effect was found for the other rainfall events. Such phenomenon was attributed to lower in-line pipe storage as compared to that of the combined sewers, and serious sediment accumulation within the storm pipes due to sewage entry. For this kind of system, treating a continuous overflow rate is a better strategy than treating the maximum amount of early part of the overflow. Correcting the key inappropriate sewage entries into storm drains should also be focused.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				FEB	2017	24	5					4902	4915		10.1007/s11356-016-8145-4								WOS:000397007200058	27988901					
J	Wang, JQ; Song, YZ; Wang, GX				Wang, Jinqi; Song, Yuzhi; Wang, Guoxiang			Causes of large Potamogeton crispus L. population increase in Xuanwu Lake	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												In July 2005, the first outbreak of cyanobacterial blooms, dominated by Microcystis, occurred in Xuanwu Lake, Nanjing, upon which clay flocculation was adopted to control algal blooms. The cyanobacterial blooms were restrained, after which Potamogeton crispus appeared in November 2005 and spread rapidly in the whole lake. Since then, large populations of P. crispus have occurred in Xuanwu Lake annually in winter for the last 10 years. To determine the reasons for the occurrence of P. crispus populations in Xuanwu Lake during 2005-2006, water quality indices were monitored regularly. The data collected included dissolved oxygen, transparency, pH, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus content. Data analysis indicated that the transparency was improved by 179.5 % after clay flocculation, dissolved oxygen content increased by 24.1 %; total nitrogen and total phosphorus content decreased by 54.1 and 74.5 %, respectively, and pH fell from 9.1 to 8.7, all of which can be attributed to the emergency control measures for the cyanobacterial bloom. Data analysis also indicated that the improved water transparency after clay flocculation was the key factor in turion sprouting and seedling propagation of P. crispus. The ameliorative light intensity and favorable nutrient level all promoted the growth of seedlings of P. crispus and later quick colonization. It is suggested that ecological restoration of macrophytic and algal lakes be conducted by some physical or chemical means to improve transparency, reduce nutrient concentration, and adjust water pH, with the purpose of improving water quality for germination and growth of aquatic plants.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				FEB	2017	24	6					5144	5151		10.1007/s11356-016-6514-7								WOS:000397013000007	27023812

A water crisis is marked by a severe shortage of water resources and deteriorating water quality. As an important component of water resources, lake water quality has deteriorated rapidly in the context of fast urbanization and climate change. This deterioration has altered the water ecosystem structure and influenced lake functionality. To curb these trends, various strategies and procedures have been used in many urban lakes. Among these procedures, accurate and responsive water environment monitoring is the basis of the forecasting and prevention of large-scale cyanobacteria outbreaks and improvement of water quality. To dynamically monitor and predict the outbreak of cyanobacteria in Dianchi Lake, in this study, wireless sensors networks (WSNs) and the geographic information system(GIS) are used tomonitor water quality at the macro-scale and meso-scale. Historical, real-time water quality and weather condition data were collected, and a combination prediction model (adaptive grey model (AGM) and back propagation artificial neural network (BPANN)) was proposed. The correlation coefficient (R) of the simulation experiment reached 0.995. Moreover, we conducted an empirical experiment in Dianchi Lake, Yunnan, China using the proposed method. R was 0.93, and the predicting error was 4.77. The results of the experiment suggest that our model has good performance for water quality prediction and can forecast cyanobacteria outbreaks. This system provides responsive forewarning and data support for lake protection and pollution control.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				FEB	2017	24	6					5335	5348		10.1007/s11356-016-8155-2								WOS:000397013000025	28013462					
J	Burgin, S				Burgin, Shelley			Indirect Consequences of Recreational Fishing in Freshwater Ecosystems: An Exploration from an Australian Perspective	SUSTAINABILITY												Recreational fishing in freshwater ecosystems is a popular pastime in Australia. Although most native fish are endemic, the fauna is depauperate compared to any landmass of similar size. With commercial fishing no longer a major industry in the country's freshwaters, the future sustainability of these ecosystems will depend heavily on the actions of recreational fishers. However, there has been limited focus on the consequences of recreational fishing in freshwaters. There is particularly a dearth of information on the indirect consequences of fishers on the waterbodies they depend on for their sport. After outlining the respective trends in commercial and recreational fishing in Australia as a basis for placing the sport in context, the indirect impacts of fishers on water quality, movement (walking, off-road vehicles), the introduction/translocation of fauna (particularly fish), the dispersal of flora and the transmission of fish disease and pathogens are reviewed. It is concluded that with the decline of commercial fishing, the competition between commercial fin-fishing and recreational fishing is negligible, at least throughout most of the country. It is also concluded that each of the issues addressed has the potential to be detrimental to the long-term sustainability of the freshwater ecosystems that the fishers depend on for their recreation. However, information on these issues is scant. This is despite the current and predicted popularity of freshwater recreational fishing continuing to increase in Australia. Indeed, there has been insufficient quantitative assessment of the impacts to even determine what is required to ensure a comprehensive, adequate and representative protection of these freshwater ecosystems. To underpin the sustainability of inland recreational fishing in the country, it was concluded that research is required to underpin the development and implementation of appropriate policies. The alternative is that the integrity and biodiversity loss of these ecosystems will ultimately result in their collapse before the indirect consequences of recreational fishing have been directly assessed and appropriately protected. However, the lack of protection of wetlands is not restricted to Australia; there is a deficit of freshwater protected areas worldwide.																	2071-1050					FEB	2017	9	2							280	10.3390/su9020280								WOS:000395590500122

A Framework for Building Efficient Environmental Permitting Processes	SUSTAINABILITY												Despite its importance as a tool for protecting air and water quality, and for mitigating impacts to protected species and ecosystems, the environmental permitting process is widely recognized to be inefficient and marked by delays. This article draws on a literature review and interviews with permitting practitioners to identify factors that contribute to delayed permit decisions. The sociopolitical context, projects that are complex or use novel technology, a fragmented and bureaucratic regulatory regime, serial permit applications and reviews, and applicant and permitting agency knowledge and resources each contribute to permitting inefficiency when they foster uncertainty, increase transaction costs, and allow divergent interests to multiply, yet remain unresolved. We then use the interviews to consider the potential of a collaborative dialogue between permitting agencies and applicants to mitigate these challenges, and argue that collaboration is well positioned to lessen permitting inefficiency.

In this study, a new total emission control (TEC) method was proposed with an emphasis on the concept of water environmentally sensitive areas (WESAs). This method was verified in Wujiang District and the techniques can be concluded in three steps: (1) a 1-D mathematical model for the study area was established and the model was calibrated using field measurement data; (2) based on an analysis of administrative planning and regulations, WESAs were identified as the main controlling objectives for emission control calculations. The weighting coefficient of local pollution sources was investigated to discuss the effectiveness of TEC on water quality improvement at WESAs; and (3) applying the river network mathematical model, water quality along the river segments was simulated under different pollution control plans. The results proved the effectiveness of TEC in the study area and indicated that a 14.6% reduction in the total amount of ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N), as well as a 31.1% reduction in the total amount of chemical oxygen demand (CODcr), was essential in order to meet the water quality standard in the WESAs.																	2071-1050					FEB	2017	9	2							301	10.3390/su9020301								WOS:000395590500143

This article presents results of studies on three granular mixtures were used for remediation of lead (Pb2+) contaminated groundwater using PRBs. The mixtures were composed of pumice, perlite and lime in different proportions. Several column experiments were conducted for evaluation of performance of the mixtures for lead removal. The experiments were carried out for over 50 days to evaluate the long-term performance of the PRBs. It was found out that pumice-perlite mixture with a weight proportion of 1 : 1 and pumice-lime perlite mixture with a weight proportion of 2 : 2 : 1 can be used as effective reactive media for lead removal. The removal efficiency of the proposed mixtures was 99.9%. The permeability of the reactive media was relatively constant over 53 days continuous experiments and the results demonstrated that the mentioned mixtures have acceptable performance to maintain hydraulic conductivity of PRBs.

Use of Viability-Based Methods for Improved Detection of Recent Fecal Contamination in a Microbial Source Tracking Study Near Tijuana, Mexico	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Current microbial source tracking methods heavily rely on the use of quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays to differentiate human and non-human sources of fecal contamination. However, traditional qPCR measures DNA from viable, viable but not culturable (VBNC), and dead cells, which may confound the use of this technique for detecting recent fecal contamination from waters receiving treated sewage effluent. In this study, fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), six host-associated markers, and two viability-based methods for rapid detection and assessment of fecal contamination were used in a microbial source tracking study to identify sources impairing water quality and sediments within the San Antonio de los Buenos watershed in Tijuana, Mexico. Horse- and gull-associated markers were detected in 4 and 8% of samples tested, respectively. The human-and dog-associated markers were positive in 74 and 63% of watershed samples and 92 and 75% of storm drain samples, respectively. Propidium monoazide (PMA) successfully inhibited amplification of DNA from dead cells in environmental creek waters that receive large volumes of treated waste-water effluent. Accordingly, PMA-qPCR measurements were more comparable to measurements made by culture-based methods (IDEXX). The covalently linked immunomagnetic separation/adenosine triphosphate (Cov-IMS/ATP) method showed a strong linear relationship to culture methods when compared to measurements made by the qPCR Entero1a assay. Both the PMA-qPCR and the Cov-IMS/ATP methods show promise for improved assessment of water quality and recent fecal contamination in sewage impacted waters, including areas receiving discharge from wastewater treatment plants, where measurement by qPCR does not effectively differentiate between DNA from live and dead cells. This study serves as an important positive control for non-point source pollution studies.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				FEB	2017	228	2							63	10.1007/s11270-016-3204-5								WOS:000394351400011

Baseline Monitoring of Mercury Levels in Environmental Matrices in the Limpopo Province	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Mercury (Hg) speciation and bioavailability were studied in surface water, surface sediment and freshwater fish samples collected upstream and downstream of the Medupi (currently under construction) and Matimba power stations in the Waterberg area, Limpopo Province. The initial survey was conducted in May 2010 and continued periodically/seasonally until October 2014. This study was designed to provide an overall description of the levels of Hg in areas potentially impacted by emissions from the coal-fired power station and provide the necessary information to enhance the understanding of the factors regulating the fate and transport of Hg in the environment. Percent loss on ignition (LOI) and ancillary water quality measurements were also carried out. In this study, the total mercury (TotHg) concentrations ranged between 0.92 and 29.13 ng/L, and 0.13 and 8.00 ng/L for methylmercury (MeHg) in water. Total Hg concentrations ranged between 0.50 and 28.60 ng/g, while the MeHg concentration ranged between 0.08 and 2.22 ng/g in sediments. Mercury concentrations in fish ranged between 40 and 1200 ng/g for TotHg, and 13.42 and 600 ng/g for MeHg. Methylmercury concentrations in freshwater fish sampled exceeded the United States Environmental Protection Agency criteria (300 ng/g) in 10% of the total fish sampled and 5% exceeded the WHO guideline (500 ng/g).																	0049-6979	1573-2932				FEB	2017	228	2							57	10.1007/s11270-016-3230-3								WOS:000394351400005

In this study, decomposition of emergent aquatic plant (cattail) litter was investigated under different conditions to determine the influencing level of the decomposition process on the water quality. Different litter addition rates (0.1, 0.5, 1.0 g L-1), temperature changes, sediment additions, and kinestates (static and dynamic conditions) were selected as the influencing factors for the decomposition process. The results suggested that the decomposition process could be all accelerated when conducted at a higher litter addition rate, under a cold condition, with sediment addition or on dynamic condition, respectively. Additionally, the maximum ratio of releasing carbon to nitrogen (C/N) was increased when the decomposition process was conducted with a higher litter addition rate, under a cold condition (31.0), with sediment addition (24.6) and on a dynamic condition (28.0), respectively, and the C/N ratios were all higher than that with only 0.5 g L-1 litter addition (24.5), suggesting that lowering of water temperature, sediment addition, and increasing of oxygen might also enhance the C/N. The high C/N released during the decomposition process implied that the cattail litter might be utilized as the potential organic carbon source for nitrogen removal in the CW system.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				FEB	2017	228	2							70	10.1007/s11270-017-3257-0								WOS:000394351400018

The incineration process can concentrate metals in the incineration slags deposited in landfills. Emitted leachates contain a myriad of salts and metals; some of them in (nano) particulate form. In this study we collected the leachate from a Swiss landfill for municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) residues along with the slags deposited at this site (waste incineration bottom ashes and fly ash, sewage sludge incineration bottom ash) from which simulated leachates were prepared. Basic water quality analysis (pH, DOC, TSS, major ions) and natural, incidental or engineered particles suspended in the leachate were characterized by NanoSight (for general size range), serial filtration with ICP-MS analysis for element specific particle size quantification and TEM/EDX to visualize particle morphology and composition. Special priority was given to those elements that have engineered nanoparticulate counterparts (Ti, Zn, Ag, Cu, Fe and Ce) to give an indication of 1) the current concentration and form of these particles emitted from the landfill, 2) the potential presence of engineered nanoparticles already in the samples, and 3) trends in particle size (change) in the leachate from different slags to provide an indication on particle mobility. Zn, Ag, and Cu had appreciable concentrations associated with small particulate matter (nano and 0.1-0.45 mu m size fractions) in natural and laboratory prepared leachates, while Ti (nano) particles were most abundant in the landfill leachate. Multiple sampling dates suggested relatively steady particulate matter in the leachate for most elements, but analysis of differently aged bottom ash slags from municipal waste revealed differences with age, indicating the influence of slag weathering in metal mobilization. MSWI residues are inherently a complex mixture of stable and unstable materials that are subject to continuous and dynamic changes over time. Therefore, in this manuscript we placed an emphasis on understanding the geochemical processes that are associated with MSWI residue weathering and how this may dictate the likelihood of particulate metals leaching into groundwater.

J	He, BN; He, JT; Wang, J; Li, J; Wang, F				He, Bao-nan; He, Jiang-tao; Wang, Jian; Li, Jie; Wang, Fei			Abnormal pH elevation in the Chaobai River, a reclaimed water intake area	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS												The pH is a primary index reflecting water quality in rivers. The Jian River and Chaobai River are two reclaimed water intake areas which have elevated pH. This elevated pH has a marked effect on both the phytoplankton, species in water and vegetation on the shore. Understanding the main reasons causing pH elevation in river water has important implications for river ecosystem management and the improvement of water quality and can provide a theoretical basis for the direction of water quality improvement. For this reason, each biogeochemical and physical process influencing pH changes in water was quantified along the flow direction in the Wenyu to Chaobai reclaimed water diversion project, in which proton consumption and production by such processes were monitored and calculated at five monitoring sections. The calculations indicated that photosynthesis and denitrification were the primary reasons for the increase of pH in the Jian River and Chaobai River. Oppositely, carbonate precipitation and sediment decomposition restricted the increase of pH in both rivers. In addition, CO2 emission to the air also promoted a increase of pH in the Jian River, while CO2 absorption from the air restricted the increase of pH in the Chaobai River. NO3- nitrogen in reclaimed water was not efficiently removed and the reclaimed water flow condition in the intake area created favorable conditions for photosynthesis of algae breeding and denitrification by microorganisms. Therefore, biogeochemical and physical processes that promoted the increase of pH were greater than inhibiting processes and the pH gradually increased along the flow direction. The contribution rates of photosynthesis and denitrification for the increase of pH were 55.48 and 27.09%, respectively, in the Jian River and 78.08 and 21.92%, respectively, in the Chaobai River. In addition, CO2 emission contributed 17.43% of the increase in pH in the Jian River.

The proposed model was applied to 60 sites located in three reservoirs in the Paraiba river basin, Brazilian semi-arid region. Collections were made in December 2011. In each site, we collected one sample of benthic macroinvertebrates and one water sample for the determination of physical and chemical parameters. Characterization of the landscape was made through application of 10 physical habitat protocols on each site for the collected information on disturbance and subsequent calculation of disturbance metrics. The results showed the formation of two groups: group 1, consisting of 16 minimally altered sites, and group 2, with 44 severely altered sites. The proposed statistical model was sensitive enough to detect changes. In the minimally altered group, the Chironomids Aedokritus and Fissimentum were dominant, indicating a higher environmental quality, while Coelotanypus and Chironomus were abundant in severely altered sites with lower environmental quality.

Concentrations of select dissolved trace elements and anthropogenic organic compounds in the Mississippi River and major tributaries during the summer of 2012 and 2013	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The Mississippi River drainage basin includes the Illinois, Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee, and Arkansas rivers. These rivers drain areas with different physiography, population centers, and land use, with each contributing a different suites of metals and wastewater contaminants that can affect water quality. In July 2012, we determined 18 elements (Be, Rb, Sr, Cd, Cs, Ba, Tl, Pb, Mg, Al, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in the five major tributaries and in the Upper Mississippi River. The following summer, we determined both trace elements and 25 trace organic compounds at 10 sites in a longitudinal study of the main stem of the Mississippi River from Grafton, Illinois to Natchez, Mississippi. We detected wastewater contaminants, including pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting compounds, throughout the river system, with the highest concentrations occurring near urban centers (St. Louis and Memphis). Concentrations were highest for atrazine (673 ng L-1), DEET (540 ng L-1), TCPP (231 ng L-1), and caffeine (202 ng L-1). The Illinois, Missouri, and Yazoo rivers, which drain areas with intense agriculture, had relatively high concentrations of Chl-a and atrazine. However, the Ohio River delivered higher loads of contaminants to the Mississippi River, including an estimated 177 kg day(-1) of atrazine, due to higher flow volumes. Concentrations of heavy metals (Ni, V, Co, Cu, Cd, and Zn) were relatively high in the Illinois River and low in the Ohio River, although dissolved metal concentrations were below US EPA maximum contaminant levels for surface water. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the rivers can be distinguished based on elemental and contaminant profiles.

When such sediments are subjected to preload, a technique employed by geotechnical engineers to improve the load-bearing capacity of highly compressible formation, transient flow of pore water, accompanied by acidity transfer, would occur as a response. Despite the concomitant environmental and socio-economic significance, to date, there has been limited interdisciplinary research on the underpinning geotechnical engineering and geo-environmental science issues for pyrite-rich sediments under preload. In this study, we investigate the effect of pyrite-rich sediment pore water transfer under preload surcharge on the receiving environment and the impact on the groundwater speciation and quality. Sediment samples were obtained at close depth intervals from boreholes established within pristine areas and those subjected to the preload application. Soil and pore water samples were subjected to solid/solution speciation, moisture contents, soil pH and the Atterberg Limits' analyses using standard analytical techniques and methods. Standpipes were also installed in the boreholes for groundwater sampling and in situ monitoring of water quality parameters. It is shown that the imposition of preload surcharge over pyritic sediment created a reducing environment rich in SO42-, iron oxide minerals and organic matter. This reducing environment fostered organic carbon catabolism to generate excess pyrite and bicarbonate alkalinity, which would invariably impact adversely on soil quality and plant growth. These were accompanied by increase in pH, dissolved Al, Ca, Mg and K species beneath the surcharge.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				FEB	2017	189	2							58	10.1007/s10661-017-5771-3								WOS:000393645800013	28091885

Assessment of environmental loads of Cu and Zn from intensive inland shrimp aquaculture	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												An experiment was developed to simulate inland shrimp farming using diluted seawater (1.9 g L-1) containing 75 shrimps (Litopenaeus vannamei) per square meter during a growth cycle of 120 days. In this study, the environmental loads of copper and zinc were estimated and compared to anthropogenic sources and shrimp aquacultures in other locations. Both metals resulted primarily from feeding, which accounted for 91.8% of Cu and 97.0% of Zn. Concentrations of Cu (110.8 +/- 11.8 mu g g(-1)) and Zn (69.0 +/- 0.7 mu g g(-1)) measured in the harvested shrimp had higher Cu and lower Zn concentrations compared to those reported for farmed shrimp from Brazil and Mexico. Clearly, organic sludge was the main route of removal for both metals (Cu 46.2%; Zn 92.6%). The annual environmental loads estimated for inland shrimp aquaculture were 598 +/- 74 g Cu ha(-1) and 5080 +/- 328 g Zn ha(-1).																	0167-6369	1573-2959				FEB	2017	189	2							69	10.1007/s10661-017-5783-z								WOS:000393645800024	28116601

However, emerging evidence points toward hyporheic exchange between sediment pore water and the overlying water column during baseflow periods as a source of FIOs is surface waters. The objective of this work was to (a) propose a mass balance-based technique for estimating changes of FIO concentrations in the same volume of water (or "slug") from the inlet to outlet of stream reaches in baseflow conditions and (b) to use such enumeration to estimate rate of the FIO release to stream water column. Concentrations of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and enterococci were measured in the slug while simultaneously monitoring the movement of a conservative tracer, Br that labeled the slug. Concentrations of E. coli in the slug were significantly larger (P = 0.035, P = 0.001, and P = 0.001, respectively) at the outlet reach in all three replications, while enterococci concentrations were significantly larger in two of three replications (P = 0.001, P < 0.001, and P = 0.602). When estimated without accounting for die-off in water column, FIO net release rates across replications ranged from 36 to 57 cells m(-2) s(-1) and 43 to 87 cells m(-2) s(-1) for E. coli and enterococci, respectively. These release rates were 5 to 20% higher when the die-off in water column was taken into account. No diurnal trends were observed in indicator concentrations. No FIO sources other than bottom sediment have been observed during the baseflow period. FIOs are released into stream water column through hyporheic exchange during baseflow periods.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				FEB	2017	189	2							51	10.1007/s10661-016-5763-8								WOS:000393645800006	28063117

Use of macroinvertebrate assemblages for assessing performance of stabilization ponds treating effluents from sugarcane and molasses processing	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Wastewater discharge from sugarcane processing is a significant pollutant of tropical aquatic ecosystems. For most developing countries, monitoring of the level of pollutants is done mostly through chemical analysis, but this does not reflect potential impacts on aquatic assemblages. In addition, laboratory facilities for accurate concentration measurements are often not available for regular monitoring programs. In this study, we investigated the use of benthic macroinvertebrates for biological monitoring in western Kenya. Benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled in stabilization ponds treating wastewater from sugarcane- and molassesbased processing plants to assess their composition and abundance in relation to different concentrations of chemical variables. Optimum concentrations and tolerance values were identified for various taxa, and a biotic index was developed that combined tolerance values (ranked between 0 and 10) for the various macroinvertebrate taxa. A succession in composition and distribution of macroinvertebrate taxa was observed from the inlet to the outlet of the pond systems. Diptera dominated in the first ponds that had high concentrations of chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD5), and nutrients, while intolerant Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) appeared as the concentrations dropped in subsequent ponds. The effluent quality was classified as "good","fair," and "poor," corresponding with biotic index value ranges 0-3.50, 3.51-6.50, and 6.51-10, respectively. During validation, the index grouped sites with respect to levels of measured environmental variables. The study revealed that the developed biotic index would help in monitoring the quality of sugarcane processing and molasses effluents before release into recipient aquatic ecosystems, replacing the need for costly chemical analyses.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				FEB	2017	189	2							79	10.1007/s10661-017-5786-9								WOS:000393645800034	28120206

The spatial distribution, sources and ecological risk assessment for Arsenic (As), Cadmium (Cd), Chromium (Cr), Copper (Cu), Nickel (Ni), Lead (Pb) and Zinc (Zn) were analyzed in this study. The results showed all tested metals had similar distribution patterns except Ni and Cr, with areas of high concentrations distributed in the southwest (WLFZ and watershed outlet) of the study area. Ni and Cr, which were highly positively correlated and present in high concentrations, were primarily distributed in the south and middle zones of the study area. Lower concentration areas of all metals were uniformly distributed west of the high-elevation zones and forest land. Factor analysis (FA) and factor analysis-multiple linear regression (FA-MLR) showed that the major sources of Cd were fertilizer and traffic sources, which together accounted for 87% of Cd. As, Zn and Cu levels were primarily supplied by industrial and domestic sources, accounting for 76% of As, 75% of Cu and 67% of Zn. Surface soils/sediments of the study watershed contaminated by Cd represent a high ecological risk, whereas other metals represent low ecological risks. The potential ecological risk index (PERI) analysis indicated that it had a low (wide-range) ecological risk and a moderate (small-range) ecological risk primarily distributed in the outlet of the study watershed. Fertilizers and traffic are the primary sources of Cd pollution, which should be more closely controlled for the purposes of water quality and ecological conservation.																	1672-6316	1993-0321				FEB	2017	14	2					325	335		10.1007/s11629-016-3838-1								WOS:000394156900008

Identification of Artificial Recharge Sites for Noyyal River Basin Using GIS and Remote Sensing	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												The water is a nature's valuable gift to all life forms. Water quality and quantity plays a major role for the growth and development of community. Both natural and human factors influence the quality and quantity of water source. Depending upon the quality and quantity of groundwater it can be used for various purposes, such as drinking, agricultural and industrial. Due to revolution in industries and various anthropogenic sources in the past decades, groundwater has been polluted and depleted. Remote sensing and Geographical Information System (GIS) has become one of the leading tools in the field of hydrogeological science, which helps in assessing, monitoring and conserving groundwater resources. GIS technology provides suitable alternatives for efficient management of large and complex databases. In recent years, the increasing use of satellite remote sensing data has made it easier to define the spatial distribution of different groundwater prospect classes on the basis of geomorphology and other associated parameters. Analysis of remotely sensed data along with Survey of India(SOI) topographical sheets and collateral information with necessary field checks helps in generating the base line information for artificial recharge. The artificial recharge sites were identified by integrating thematic maps of geology, geomorphology, slope, drainage density and lineament density of the study area. The study focuses on the development of remote sensing and GIS based analysis and methodology for identifying artificial recharge studies in Noyyal river basin.					arumaikkani, geetha selvarani/0000-0001-5779-6765												0255-660X	0974-3006				FEB	2017	45	1					67	77		10.1007/s12524-015-0542-5								WOS:000394243200007						
J	Sener, S; Sener, E; Davraz, A				Sener, Sehnaz; Sener, Erhan; Davraz, Aysen			Assessment of groundwater quality and health risk in drinking water basin using GIS	JOURNAL OF WATER AND HEALTH												Egirdir Lake basin was selected as the study area because the lake is the second largest freshwater lake in Turkey and groundwater in the basin is used as drinking water. In the present study, 29 groundwater samples were collected and analyzed for physico-chemical parameters to determine the hydrochemical characteristics, groundwater quality, and human health risk in the study area. The dominant ions are Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO32-, and SO42. According to Gibbs plot, the predominant samples fall in the rock-water interaction field. A groundwater quality index (WQI) reveals that the majority of the samples falls under good to excellent category of water, suggesting that the groundwater is suitable for drinking and other domestic uses. The Ca-Mg-HCO3, Ca-HCO3, Ca-SO4-HCO3, and Ca-Mg-HCO3-SO4 water types are the dominant water types depending on the water-rock interaction in the investigation area. Risk of metals to human health was then evaluated using hazard quotients (HQ) by ingestion and dermal pathways for adults and children. It was indicated that As with HQ ingestion > 1 was the most important pollutant leading to non-carcinogenic concerns. It can be concluded that the highest contributors to chronic risks were As and Cr for both adults and children.																	1477-8920					FEB	2017	15	1					112	132		10.2166/wh.2016.148								WOS:000394230100011	28151445

Application of quantitative real-time PCR compared to filtration methods for the enumeration of Escherichia coli in surface waters within Vietnam	JOURNAL OF WATER AND HEALTH												Surface water samples in Vietnam were collected from the Saigon River, rural and suburban canals, and urban run off canals in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, and were processed to enumerate Escherichia coli. Quantification was done through membrane filtration and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Mean log colony-forming unit (CFU)/100 ml E. coli counts in the dry season for river/suburban canals and urban canals were log 2.8 and 3.7, respectively, using a membrane filtration method, while using Taqman quantitative real-time PCR they were log 2.4 and 2.8 for river/suburban canals and urban canals, respectively. For the wet season, data determined by the membrane filtration method in river/suburban canals and urban canals samples had mean counts of log 3.7 and 4.1, respectively. While mean log CFU/100 ml counts in the wet season using quantitative PCR were log 3 and 2, respectively. Additionally, the urban canal samples were significantly lower than those determined by conventional culture methods for the wet season. These results show that while quantitative real-time PCR can be used to determine levels of fecal indicator bacteria in surface waters, there are some limitations to its application and it may be impacted by sources of runoff based on surveyed samples.																	1477-8920					FEB	2017	15	1					155	162		10.2166/wh.2016.173								WOS:000394230100014	28151448

Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Denitrification within Depressional Wetlands of the Southeastern US Coastal Plain in an Agricultural Landscape	WETLANDS												Carolina Bays are depressional wetlands on the Coastal Plain of the southeastern United States. These wetlands are often the recipient of nutrient runoff from adjacent agricultural lands and there is potential for production of greenhouse gases during nitrification and denitrification processes occurring in the wetland sediments. Because of their saturated conditions, Carolina Bays may improve regional water quality through denitrification of soil nitrate. Three small bays in South Carolina were selected for denitrification and greenhouse gas analysis. A transect of four points was sampled within each Carolina Bay in May, July, September, and November over a two year period. Gas emissions were measured in-situ using a photoacoustic gas analyzer and soil samples were brought back to the lab for denitrification enzyme activity and microbial analysis. Emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) averaged 1.8 mg m(-2) d(-1), with a median of 0.47 (with a range of below detectable limits to 9.414 mg m(-2) d(-1)). Many measurement events of N2O were below detection and did not vary within the bays. The carbon dioxide emissions from Carolina Bays averaged 15.8 g m(-2) d(-1) and were largely controlled by temperature. Denitrification enzyme activity had a larger response to nitrate additions further into the bays. Gram + bacteria were also greater deeper into the bays, while Gram- and fungal populations were greater at the field/wetland interface. Manure application had some minor effects on DEA within the bays, but did not appear to increase gas emissions over the period measured.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				FEB	2017	37	1					33	43		10.1007/s13157-016-0837-5								WOS:000394134600003

Using Land-Use Change, Soil Characteristics, and a Semi-Automated On-Line GIS Database to Inventory Carolina Bays	WETLANDS												Carolina Bay wetlands are common in the southeastern US Coastal Plain and important to water quality, carbon sequestration, and habitat. Only South Carolina and Georgia have statewide inventories. We developed and evaluated a novel way to identify and delineate Bays using Bay-dense Bladen County, NC as a testbed. We posited that Bay land use had changed in the past 40 years and that Bays comprise a small subset of their surrounding soils. We classified decadal Landsat images as forest, agriculture, urban, and water. We used 812 previously delineated Bays to identify common Bay soils. From areas with common Bay soils and land-use change, we identified 548 new Bays and delineated them using a semi-automated on-line digitization tool. We saved new Bays to a Google Fusion Table for download and integration within a GIS. To gauge accuracy, Bays were scored on soils, land-use change, wetland delineation, and landscape position. Potential errors included omission of some small Bays (3.3-14.6 % of total Bay area) and commission of misclassified Bays (11 % of 1360 Bays), an estimated overall accuracy of 74 to 86 %. With 1360 delineated Bays, we estimated that as many as 478 have not yet been identified. These are most likely < 5.76 ha.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				FEB	2017	37	1					89	98		10.1007/s13157-016-0842-8								WOS:000394134600008

The toxicity evaluation is typically based on determining the EC50 at specific time points which may lead to overlooking the dynamic nature of luminescence response and limits information regarding the possible mechanisms of action of target compounds. This study investigated various approaches (standard, integral, and luminescence rate inhibition) to evaluate the chronic toxicity of three target compounds (atrazine, trimethoprim, and acetamiprid) using a 96-well plate based method. The chronic toxicity assay and the methods used for EC50 calculation provided in this work resulted in a high-throughput method of chronic toxicity testing and indicated lower EC50 than the values provided by the standard short term methods, indicating higher toxicity. This study emphasizes the need for additional chronic toxicity testing to further evaluate the toxicity of compounds or unknown samples.																	0007-4861	1432-0800				FEB	2017	98	2					196	203		10.1007/s00128-016-2008-z								WOS:000394130000010	28028550

In California, where a major drought currently demonstrates some of the hardships that could be regularly encountered under a changing climate, we present results from a survey of drinking water utilities about the perceived threat, analytic capacity, and adaptation actions related to maintaining water quality in the face of climate change. Among surveyed utilities (n = 259), awareness is high in regard to climate change occurring and its potential impacts on water quality globally, but perceived risk is lower with regard to climate impacts on local drinking water quality. Just over half of surveyed utilities report at least some adaptation activity to date. The top three variables that most strongly correlated with reported adaptation action were (1) perceived risk on global and local water quality, (2) surface water reliance, and (3) provision of other services beyond drinking water. Other tested variables significantly correlated with reported adaptation action were (4) degree of impact from the current drought and (5) communication with climate change experts. Findings highlight that smaller groundwater-reliant utilities may need the most assistance to initiate climate adaptation processes. Trusted information sources most frequently used across respondents were state government agencies, followed by colleagues in the same utilities. The finding that frequently used sources of information are similar across utilities presents a promising opportunity for training and disseminating climate information to assist those systems needing the most support.

In this study, surface water from different sources (e.g. pond, canal, lake and river) treated with combined Moringa seed powder, and scallop powder (MOSP) at a ratio of 2:1 for 10 minutes showed a clear water layer at the top and a sediment layer at the bottom. The clear water was then passed through an eight-fold sari cloth and/or natural bio-sand filtration and the resulting water was found drinkable. The microbiological and physico-chemical quality of this water showed non-significant differences compared to the US EPA drinking water quality parameters. Moreover, no cytotoxic effect of MOSP with BHK-21 and HeLa cells, nor any bacterial endotoxins were observed, indicating use of MOSP does not pose any adverse health effect. Furthermore, the quality of 6 months stored water at room temperature was found acceptable, indicating the usefulness of this technology for drinking water purposes. On the other hand, the sediment or sludge produced in this process could be used in agricultural fields after proper composting. Therefore, this simple, inexpensive and ecofriendly method could be used in drinking water scarcity areas of the world.																	1606-9749					FEB	2017	17	1					125	137		10.2166/ws.2016.111								WOS:000394582100013

Routine culture-based methods of identifying bacterial pathogens in water sources are laborious and time-consuming. Recently, the use of molecular techniques such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has provided rapid and highly promising detection methods. In this study, we developed two multiplex PCR assays for simultaneous detection of six water-borne bacteria. Two triplex PCR protocols were developed to detect six target genes. The first protocol targets uidA (Escherichia coli), int (Shigella spp.), and gyrB (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) genes, while invA (Salmonella spp.), ompW (Vibrio cholera), and lacZ (coliforms) were amplified by the second protocol. Specificity testing was carried out for 12 reference strains. Furthermore, the applicability of the multiplex PCR assays for detection of these bacteria was investigated for 52 surface water samples. The results indicated that all primer pairs showed specificities only for their corresponding target organisms. The detection sensitivity of both multiplex PCR assays was 3 x 10(2) 3 x 10(3) colony forming units. The developed assays represent simple and efficient diagnostic procedures for co-detection of water-borne bacteria and have the potential to provide earlier warnings of possible public health threats and more accurate surveillance of these organisms.

Yet the comprehensive performance in response to complex environmental conditions remains unclear. We investigated biofilm formation and distributed water quality under various nutrients, including chlorine concentrations and hydrodynamic conditions. Results showed that environmental fluctuations collectively induced changes in microbial propagation, which were mostly associated with turbidity variations, concentrations of total organic carbon, NH4+-N and soluble phosphorus compared to the other parameters. Fuzzy pattern recognition analysis integrating multiple water quality indicators revealed that low nutrient availability and addition of mild chlorine at 0.50 mg/L at 0.50 m/s flow velocity were the most favorable conditions screened for optimized comprehensive performance, while nutrient supplements yielded significant performance deterioration. These quantitative estimations offer new insights into advanced understanding of the system performance responding to often complex environmental fluctuations, essential for optimized design and practical functioning of DWDSs.																	1606-9749					FEB	2017	17	1					267	278		10.2166/ws.2016.134								WOS:000394582100028

Water contamination with heavy metals and trace elements from Kilembe copper mine and tailing sites in Western Uganda; implications for domestic water quality	CHEMOSPHERE												The mining and processing of copper in Kilembe, Western Uganda, from 1956 to 1982 left over 15 Mt of cupriferous and cobaltiferous pyrite dumped within a mountain river valley, in addition to mine water which is pumped to the land surface. This study was conducted to assess the sources and concentrations of heavy metals and trace elements in Kilembe mine catchment water. Multi-element analysis of trace elements from point sources and sinks was conducted which included mine tailings, mine water, mine leachate, Nyamwamba River water, public water sources and domestic water samples using ICP-MS. The study found that mean concentrations (mg kg(-1)) of Co (112), Cu (3320), Ni (131), As (8.6) in mine tailings were significantly higher than world average crust and were being eroded and discharged into water bodies within the catchment. Underground mine water and leachate contained higher mean concentrations (mu g L-1) of Cu (9470), Co (3430) and Ni (590) compared with background concentrations (mu g L-1) in un contaminated water of 1.9, 0.21 and 0.67 for Cu, Co and Ni respectively. Over 25% of household water samples exceeded UK drinking water thresholds for Al of 200 mu g L-1, Co exceeded Winsconsin (USA drinking) water thresholds of 40 mu g L-1 in 40% of samples while Fe in 42% of samples exceeded UK thresholds of 200 mu g L-1. The study however found that besides mining activities, natural processes of geological weathering also contributed to Al, Fe, and Mn water contamination in a number of public water sources.

Thus far, only a handful of studies have examined its impact on plant systems. Present research is limited to the potential uptake of these chemicals by plants and the general phytotoxic effects it can elicit. The aim of this study was to determine what effect an EDC has on developing plant and cell organelles and how it affects it. In this study, cos lettuce plants were exposed to different concentrations of nonylphenol (NP), an EDC, in a static hydroponic system. Changes in plant morphology, mass and length, chlorophyll content, as well as electrolyte leakage were examined. Furthermore an in-depth investigation of the plant cell ultrastructure was carried out with transmission electron microscopy. Results indicated that cos lettuce growth was severely restricted, chlorophyll content was reduced, leakage of electrolytes increased and roots were stunted especially after >= 3200 41 NP exposures. The structure of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, vacuole and chloroplast were also changed. This study emphasizes the importance of water quality management, since the presence of an EDC, like NP, can negatively impact the yield and internal structure of one of the world's most significant salad crops, namely lettuce.

Factors influencing the occurrence and distribution of neonicotinoid insecticides in surface waters of southern Ontario, Canada	CHEMOSPHERE												The widespread use of neonicotinoid insecticides and recent increased regulatory scrutiny requires the generation of monitoring data with sufficient scope and resolution to provide decision makers with a better understanding of occurrence and distribution in the environment. This study presents a wide scale investigation of neonicotinoid insecticides used across the range of agricultural activities from fifteen surface water sites in southern Ontario. Using statistical analysis, the correlation of individual compounds with land use was investigated, and the relationship between neonicotinoid occurrence and hydrologic parameters in calibrated water courses was also assessed. Of the five neonicotinoids studied, imidacloprid, clothianidin and thiamethoxam exhibited detection rates above 90% at over half the sites sampled over a three year period (2012-2014). At two sites in southwestern Ontario, the Canadian Federal freshwater guideline value for imidacloprid (230 ng/L) was exceeded in roughly 75% of the samples collected. For some watersheds, there were correlations between the occurrence of neonicotinoids and precipitation and/or stream discharge. Some watersheds exhibited seasonal maxima in concentrations of neonicotinoids in spring and fall, particularly for those areas where row crop agriculture is predominant; these seasonal patterns were absent in some areas characterized by a broad range of agricultural activities.

Researcher disciplines and the assessment techniques used to evaluate Laurentian Great Lakes coastal ecosystems	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The Laurentian Great Lakes of North America have been a focus of environmental and ecosystem research since the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement in 1972. This study provides a review of scientific literature directed at the assessment of Laurentian Great Lakes coastal ecosystems. Our aim was to understand the methods employed to quantify disturbance and ecosystem quality within Laurentian Great Lakes coastal ecosystems within the last 20 years. We focused specifically on evidence of multidisciplinary articles, in authorship or types of assessment parameters used. We sought to uncover: 1) where Laurentian Great Lakes coastal ecosystems are investigated, 2) how patterns in the disciplines of researchers have shifted over time, 3) how measured parameters differed among disciplines, and 4) which parameters were used most often. Results indicate research was conducted almost evenly across the five Laurentian Great Lakes and that publication of coastal ecosystems studies increased dramatically ten years after the first State of the Great Lakes Ecosystem Conference in 1994. Research authored by environmental scientists and by multiple disciplines (multidisciplinary) have become more prevalent since 2003. This study supports the likelihood that communication and knowledge-sharing is happening between disciplines on some level. Multidisciplinary or environmental science articles were the most inclusive of parameters from different disciplines, but every discipline seemed to include chemical parameters less often than biota, physical, and spatial parameters. There is a need for an increased understanding of minor nutrient, toxin, and heavy metal impacts and use of spatial metrics in Laurentian Great Lakes coastal ecosystems.

Here we apply a climate change "test" to a framework for estimating the amount of agricultural conservation practices needed to achieve desired fish conservation outcomes for four watersheds in the Saginaw Bay region of Michigan, USA. We developed three climate scenarios from global climate model outputs (high emissions scenario, "2080s" timeframe) to provide insight on potential impacts of a climate driver that represents a key uncertainty for this management system, the amount and timing of spring and summer precipitation. These scenarios were used as inputs to agricultural watershed models, which produced water quality outputs that we compared to thresholds in fish biodiversity metrics at the subwatershed scale. Our results suggest that impacts of climate change on evaporation rates and other aspects of hydrology will shift the relative importance of key stressors for fish (i.e., sediment loadings vs. nutrient concentrations) across these different watersheds, highlighting the need to design resilient implementation plans and policies. Overall, we found that changes in climate are likely to increase the need for agricultural conservation practices, but that increasing the implementation rate above current levels will likely remain a good investment under current and future climate conditions.

Mussel-derived stimulation of benthic filamentous algae: The importance of nutrients and spatial scale	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The reoccurrence of benthic filamentous algal (FA) blooms in the Great Lakes, without associated increases in phosphorus loading, has stimulated renewed interest in determining the causes of Great Lakes benthic algal blooms. We investigated the potential roles of invasive mussels and nutrient limitation with experimental substrata within inner Saginaw Bay. FA abundance on live mussel substrata was typically significantly greater than that on inert (empty shell or rock) substrata. Nutrient addition (from an artificial source) significantly increased FA abundance on inert substrata. These results suggest that: 1) mussel nutrient excretion could be a primary stimulatory mechanism; 2) mussel-mediated stimulation may be even stronger in other, more oligotrophic, Great Lakes nearshore zones; and 3) increased nutrient loading to inner Saginaw Bay may exacerbate existing FA blooms. FA abundance on inert substrata was not affected, even in close proximity to mussels, indicating that the observed stimulatory effect of mussel-derived P on live mussels attenuated at very small spatial scales, on the order of centimeters or less.

A depth-adjusted ambient distribution approach for setting numeric removal targets for a Great Lakes Area of Concern beneficial use impairment: Degraded benthos	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We compiled macroinvertebrate data collected from 1995 to 2014 from the St. Louis River Area of Concern (AOC) of Lake Superior. Our objective was to define depth-adjusted cutoff values for benthos condition classes to provide an analytical tool for quantifying progress toward achieving removal targets for the degraded benthos beneficial use impairment. We used quantile regression to model the limiting effect of depth on selected benthos metrics, including taxa richness, percent non-oligochaete individuals, combined percent Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera, and Odonata individuals, and density of ephemerid mayfly nymphs (Hexagenia). We created a scaled trimetric index from the first three metrics. Metric values above the 75th percentile quantile regression model prediction were defined as being in relatively excellent condition in the context of the degraded beneficial use impairment for that depth. We set the cutoff between good and fair condition as the 50th percentile model prediction, and we set the cutoff between fair and poor condition as the 25th percentile model prediction. We examined sampler type, geographic zone, and substrate type for confounding effects. Based on these analyses we combined data across sampler types and created separate models for each of three geographic zones. We used the resulting condition-class cutoff values to determine the relative benthic condition for three adjacent habitat restoration project areas. The depth-limited pattern of ephemerid abundance we observed in the St. Louis River AOC also occurred elsewhere in the Great Lakes. We provide tabulated model predictions for application of our depth-adjusted condition class cutoff values to new sample data.

REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Chlorophyll-a (Chl a) is a key parameter for the assessment of water quality in coastal and shelf environments. The availability of satellite ocean colour offers the potential of monitoring these regions at unprecedented spatial and temporal scales, as long as a high level of accuracy can be achieved. To use satellite derived Chl a to monitor these environments, it is imperative that rigorous accuracy assessments are undertaken to select the most accurate ocean colour algorithm(s). To this end, the accuracy of a range of ocean colour Chl a algorithms for use with Medium Imaging Resolution Spectrometer (MERIS) Level 2 (L2) Remote Sensing Reflectance (R-rs), using two different atmospheric correction (AC) processors (COASTCOLOUR and MERIS Ground Segment processor version 8.0 - MEGS8.0), were assessed in North West European waters. A total of 594 measurements of R-rs(lambda) and/or Chl a were made in the North Sea, Mediterranean Sea, along the Portuguese Coast English Channel and Celtic Sea between June 2001 and March 2012, where Chl a varied from 0.2 to 35 mg m(-3). The following algorithms were compared: MERIS Case 1 water Chl a algorithm OC4Me, the MERIS Case 2 algorithm Algal Pigment 2 (AP2), the MODIS-Aqua Case 1 Chl a algorithm OC3 adapted for MERIS (OC3Me), the MODIS-Aqua Garver-Siegel-Maritorena algorithm (GSM) adapted for MERIS and the Gohin et al. (2002) algorithm for MERIS (005Me). For both COASTCOLOUR and MEGS8.0 processors, OC5Me was the most accurate Chl a algorithm, which was within similar to 25% of in situ values in these coastal and shelf waters. The uncertainty in MEGS8.0 R(rs)4442) (similar to 17%) was slightly higher compared to COASTCOLOUR (similar to 12%) from 0.3 to 7 mg m(-3) Chl a, but for R-rs(560)the uncertainty was lower for MEGS8.0 (similar to 10%) compared to COASTCOLOUR (similar to 13%), which meant that MEGS8.0 Chl a was more accurate than COASTCOLOUR for all of the Chl a algorithms tested. Compared to 005Me, OC4Me tended to over-estimate Chl a, which was caused by non-algal SPM especially at values >14 g M-3. GSM also over-estimated Chl a, which was caused by variations in absorption coefficient of coloured dissolved organic matter at 442 nm (a(CDOM)(442)). AP2 consistently under-estimated Chl a, especially when non-algal SPM was >4 g m(-3). (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Sousa, VS; Corniciuc, C; Teixeira, MR				Sousa, Vania Serrao; Corniciuc, Claudia; Teixeira, Margarida Ribau			The effect of TiO2 nanoparticles removal on drinking water quality produced by conventional treatment C/F/S	WATER RESEARCH												Nanoparticles, namely titanium dioxide (TiO2), are emerging contaminants widely used to commercial and industrial applications, are a potential hazard and can cause damage to environment and human health due to their toxicity. Therefore, their removal from the water is urgent to minimize or eliminate the adverse environmental and human effects. This work, investigates the efficiency of conventional coagulation/flocculation/sedimentation (C/F/S) from drinking water treatment to remove TiO2 nano particles (NPs) from surface waters, and pretends to understand if the removal of TiO2 NPs affects the ability of C/F/S to remove natural organic matter (NOM) and turbidity, and consequently affects the quality of the treated water. Results show that TiO2 NPs removal is high (>90%) for all the waters studied (hydrophobic and hydrophilic waters) and the treated water quality is not compromised (turbidity, Ti and Al concentrations, pH and conductivity are below the national and international guidelines). In addition, TiO2 initial concentrations, ranging between 0.2 and 10 mg/L, have not a significant impact on NPs removal by C/F/S. Therefore, the widely used polyaluminium based coagulants are effective in the removal of TiO2 NPs by conventional C/F/S treatment, but removal is strongly influenced by the water characteristics. Hydrophobic waters need a higher coagulant dose than hydrophilic waters to achieve the same TiO2 NPs removals, as well as water with higher UV254nm values. The principal mechanism involved in TiO2 NPs removal is charge neutralisation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Iron and manganese removal: Recent advances in modelling treatment efficiency by rapid sand filtration	WATER RESEARCH												A model has been developed that takes into account the main characteristics of (submerged) rapid filtration: the water quality parameters of the influent water, notably pH, iron(II) and manganese(II) concentrations, homogeneous oxidation in the supernatant layer, surface sorption and heterogeneous oxidation kinetics in the filter, and filter media adsorption characteristics. Simplifying assumptions are made to enable validation in practice, while maintaining the main mechanisms involved in iron(II) and manganese(II) removal. Adsorption isotherm data collected from different Dutch treatment sites show that Fe(II)/Mn(II) adsorption may vary substantially between them, but generally increases with higher pH. The model is sensitive to (experimentally) determined adsorption parameters and the heterogeneous oxidation rate. Model results coincide with experimental values when the heterogeneous rate constants are calibrated. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Photocatalytic reduction of nitrate to molecular nitrogen presents a promising approach to remove nitrate from drinking water sources. However, harmful intermediates like NO2-, NO, NO2 and N2O are usually formed, and metal loading or hole scavengers are generally needed to reduce the recombination of photo generated electrons and holes, which will cause secondary pollution to drinking water. In this work, an efficient, selective and sustainable bioelectro-photocatalytic nitrate-reducing system by utilizing commercial TiO2 nanoparticles P25 as the photocatalyst and bio-electrons from microbial metabolism as the hole scavenger is reported. In this system, bio-electrons extracted from organic substrates in bio-anode are transferred to the photocathode through an external circuit for hole quenching. With the utilization of the residual photogenerated electrons, nitrate is completely reduced to nitrogen without accumulation of harmful nitrite or ammonium. The experimental results and the mechanistic analysis using the first-principles density functional theory calculations demonstrate that toxic by-products like nitrite or ammonium will not be accumulated in this system. Thus, this approach has a great potential for sustainable remediation of nitrate-contaminated drinking water sources. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methylmercury production and accumulation in urban stormwater ponds and habitat wetlands	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Stormwater management ponds and created habitat wetlands effectively manage erosion, flooding, and pollutant loadings while providing biodiversity and aesthetic benefits, but these structures are also potential sources of methylmercury (MeHg), a bioaccumulative neurotoxin. While MeHg accumulation has been confirmed in habitat wetlands, the extent of MeHg production and accumulation in stormwater ponds is unknown. Additionally, the fine-scale spatial variation in MeHg in these wetlands has never been explored despite the possibility that cycles of wetting and drying, and the presence of aquatic plants may stimulate methylation at their margins. To address these knowledge gaps, we compared MeHg and inorganic mercury concentrations, the percent of total mercury present as MeHg (%MeHg), and potential mercury methylation rate constants (K-meth) in the sediments of terrestrial-aquatic transects through several stormwater and habitat wetlands. We present novel evidence confirming the in situ production of MeHg in both stormwater ponds and habitat wetlands, but observe no systematic differences across the terrestrial-aquatic gradient, suggesting that routine variations in water level do not alter MeHg production and accumulation. Stormwater ponds effectively trap mercury while converting relatively little to MeHg, as evidenced by lower MeHg concentrations, %-MeHg, and K-meth values than habitat wetlands, but often greater inorganic Hg concentrations. The relationship of aquatic vegetation to MeHg accumulation is weak and ambiguous, suggesting plants are not strong drivers of MeHg biogeochemistry in these systems. Although the MeHg hazard associated with individual artificial wetlands is low, they may be important sources of MeHg at the landscape level. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

They could often occur at certain concentrations to cause adverse effects on aquatic life and human health. Generally, parametric models are mostly used to construct species sensitivity distributions (SSDs), which result in comparison for water quality criteria (WQC) of elements in the same period or group of the periodic table might be inaccurate and the results could be biased. To address this inadequacy, the non-parametric kernel density estimation (NPKDE) with its optimal bandwidth's and testing methods were developed for establishing SSDs. The NPKDE was better fit, more robustness and better predicted than conventional normal and logistic parametric density estimations for constructing SSDs and deriving acute HC5 and WQC for transition metals in the fourth period of the periodic table. The decreasing sequence of HC5 values for the transition metals in the fourth period was Ti > Mn > V > Ni > Zn > Cu > Fe > Co > Cr(VI), which were not proportional to atomic number in the periodic table, and for different metals the relatively sensitive species were also different. The results indicated that except for physical and chemical properties there are other factors affecting toxicity mechanisms of transition metals. The proposed method enriched the methodological foundation for WQC. Meanwhile, it also provided a relatively innovative, accurate approach for the WQC derivation and risk assessment of the same group and period metals in aquatic environments to support protection of aquatic organisms.

The river supplies inhabitants of the city of Besancon in drinking water, raising the question of a potential risk through both water consumption and use. We developed a real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) to quantify S. parasitica in the Loue River as well as in the drinking water. A weak spatial trend is suggested with greater quantities of S. parasitica observed at the sampling station close to the main pumping station. No S. parasitica DNA was detected in the tap water connected to pumping stations. The use of qPCR, which combines specificity, practicality, speed and reliability, appears to be an effective tool to monitor the spatial and temporal dynamics of this oomycete and identify the risk period for wild salmonid populations in the field, for fishery management or in aquaculture.

Overall, harvested rainwater is of good quality, falling within the Malaysian recreational water quality Class BB standards with exceptions for pH (18/92), ammonia (1/92), phosphates (3/92), and total coliforms (8/92). A large number of samples tested positive for Escherichia coli (22/92), total coliforms (64/92) and Chromobacterium violaceum (7/92), showing that disinfection of harvested rainwater is mandatory prior to reuse. 2/37 harvested rainwater samples exceeded lead limits in Malaysian drinking water standards, showing that consuming rainwater without additional treatment may pose a health risk. Mixing harvested rainwater with groundwater resulted in higher phosphates and total coliforms. Rainwater collected during the wet seasons have higher concentrations of suspended solids, turbidity, and Escherichia coli than dry seasons due to the antecedent dry period. Last but not least, both principal component analysis and positive matrix factorisation were conducted on 37 samples to apportion pollutant sources in harvested rainwater. 7 principal components were identified, namely: industrial dust, steel, roadside dust, faeces, organic decay, fertilisers, and plumbing. The results from principal component analysis and positive matrix factorisation were in agreement, although the latter identified mains water top-up as an additional factor responsible for dissolved solids. Both techniques are effective at apportioning pollutant sources in harvested rainwater, and show that a rainwater harvesting system should be designed carefully to reduce contributions from steel, plumbing, organic decay, bird faeces, industrial dust and roadside dust.

The results of characteristic analyses and a mobile factor calculation show that the bonding patterns of heavy metals in DS were stable and had low bioavailability and mobility. DS can effectively adsorb ammonia and phosphate according to the pseudo second-order kinetics model. The adsorption isotherm for ammonia can be described by the Langmuir model. Both the Langmuir and Freundlich models can be used for phosphate adsorption isotherm evaluation. Ammonia adsorption involved physical adsorption, and the mechanisms for phosphate removal included adsorption and chemical precipitation. The adsorption of ammonia by DS was a non-spontaneous endothermic process, and the adsorption of phosphate was a spontaneous exothermic process. The results from excitation emission fluorescence matrix analysis show that the organic substances in the fish pond with DS addition included a soluble microbial product, protein-like substance, and humic acid-like substance. This indicates that algal growth and biomass accumulation could be enhanced by DS addition because the released trace elements and hydroxide ions from DS are beneficial to algal growth. Using DS as an amendment and construction material for the fish pond would increase the water alkalinity and prevent acidification of pond water. The results indicate that DS can be used in the aquacultural industry as construction material as well as for pH control and algal growth enhancement. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Lanz, B; Provins, A				Lanz, Bruno; Provins, Allan			Using averting expenditures to estimate the demand for public goods: Combining objective and perceived quality	RESOURCE AND ENERGY ECONOMICS												In response to the perceived quality of a public good, households may choose to incur averting expenditures as a substitute to its aggregate provision, thereby revealing an (inverse) demand function. When unobserved heterogeneity affects both perceived quality and averting behavior, identification of the demand function is plagued by a problem of endogeneity. In this paper, we propose the use of an auxiliary (first stage) model of perceived quality as a function of objective quality to recover unbiased and microconsistent estimates of marginal willingness to pay for the provision of the public good. The approach can be applied when people have well-formed perceptions of the quality of the good, a prerequisite for the averting expenditures method, and when objective quality of provision is plausibly exogenous. We illustrate the approach with data on averting expenditures for two qualitative aspects of household tap water networks: water hardness and aesthetic quality in terms of taste and odor.

In the eye of the beholder: Assessing the water quality of shoreline parks around the Island of Montreal through citizen science	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												As a part of the FreshWater Watch project aiming to promote volunteers' water monitoring in 25 cities around the world, St. Lawrence River water quality was characterized at 28 public shoreline parks around Montreal Island, Quebec, Canada. This involved training of 69 citizen scientists by researchers of the Universite de Montreal in five one-day sessions. Shoreline sampling yielded 174 data points over three summers (May 2013 to November 2015). Water turbidity, nitrate and phosphate concentrations were measured in situ, together with the thickness and type of beach-cast vegetation, and the relative abundance of different types of beach litter. Data generated by citizen scientists provided 1) an overview of the water quality of the St. Lawrence and Des Prairies rivers around the Island of Montreal, 2) an estimation of the quantity and types of beach-cast aquatic plants and filamentous algae, and 3) novel insights into the distribution of the nuisance cyanobacterium Lyngbya wollei. Overall, half of the sites were classified as "good" being characterized by low turbidity, nitrate and phosphate concentrations, and little deposition of beach-cast vegetation. Lyngbya wollei was found at 57% of the sites, revealing a more frequent occurrence than initially anticipated. The amount of litter recorded along the shoreline was generally small, comprising items related to picnicking (cans/bottles), smoking, and fishing activities inmost parks. Wind exposure and rain events explained a significant fraction of the variability in nutrient concentration and turbidity among sites and dates. Shoreline condition assessed from water quality and vegetation data from this study was not correlated, however, with the most serious problem of faecal coliform counts gathered by the City of Montreal. This assessment of the quality and utilization of shoreline parks provides additional information to support planning and management activities of municipalities.

Further on, they will affect them indirectly through adaptation in land use which ultimately influences diffuse nutrient emissions to rivers and therefore potentially the compliance with good ecological status according to the EU Water Framework Directive(WFD). We present an integrated impact modelling framework (IIMF) to track and quantify direct and indirect pollution impacts along policy-economy-climate-agriculture-water interfaces. The IIMF is applied to assess impacts of climatic and socio-economic drivers on agricultural land use (crop choices, farming practices and fertilization levels), river flows and the risk for exceedance of environmental quality standards for determination of the ecological water quality status in Austria. This article also presents model interfaces as well as validation procedures and results of single models and the IIMF with respect to observed state variables such as land use, river flow and nutrient river loads. The performance of the IIMF for calculations of river nutrient loads (120 monitoring stations) shows a Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency of 0.73 for nitrogen and 0.51 for phosphorus. Most problematic is the modelling of phosphorus loads in the alpine catchments dominated by forests and mountainous landscape. About 63% of these catchments show a deviation between modelled and observed loads of 30% and more. In catchments dominated by agricultural production, the performance of the IIMF is much better as only 30% of cropland and 23% of permanent grassland dominated areas have a deviation of >30% between modelled and observed loads. As risk of exceedance of environmental quality standards is mainly recognized in catchments dominated by cropland, the IIMF is well suited for assessing the nutrient component of the WFD ecological status.

The frequency and magnitude of harmful algal blooms (primarily in the western basin) and the extent of hypoxic bottom waters in the central basin have increased. The decline in ecosystem health, despite meeting goals for external P loads, has sparked a renewed effort to understand P cycling in the lake. We use pore-water P concentration profiles and sediment cores incubation experiments to quantify the P flux from Lake Erie central basin sediments. In addition, the oxygen isotopes of phosphate were investigated to assess the isotopic signature of sedimentary phosphate inputs relative to the isotopic signature of phosphate in lake water. Extrapolating the total P sediment flux based on the pore-water profiles to the whole area of the central basin ranged from 300 to 1250 metric tons per year and using the flux based on core incubation experiments an annual flux of roughly 2400 metric tons of P is calculated. These estimates amount to 8-20% of the total external input of P to Lake Erie. The isotopic signature of phosphate in the extractable fraction of the sediments (similar to 18%) can explain the non-equilibrium isotope values of dissolved phosphate in the deep water of the central basin of Lake Erie, and this is consistent with sediments as an important internal source of P in the Lake.

Seasonal induced changes in spinach rhizosphere microbial community structure with varying salinity and drought	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Salinity is a common problem under irrigated agriculture, especially in low rainfall and high evaporative demand areas of southwestern United States and other semi-arid regions around the world. However, studies on salinity effects on soil microbial communities are relatively few while the effects of irrigation-induced salinity on soil chemical and physical properties and plant growth are well documented. In this study, we examined the effects of salinity, temperature, and temporal variability on soil and rhizosphere microbial communities in sand tanks irrigated with prepared solutions designed to simulate saline wastewater. Three sets of experiments with spinach (Spinacia oleracea L., cv. Racoon) were conducted under saline water during different time periods (early winter, late spring, and early summer). Bacterial 16S V4 rDNA region was amplified utilizing fusion primers designed against the surrounding conserved regions using MiSeq (R) Illumina sequencing platform. Across the two sample types, bacteria were relatively dominant among three phyla-the Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, and Bacteroidetes-accounted for 77.1% of taxa detected in the rhizosphere, while Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria accounted for 55.1% of taxa detected in soil. The results were analyzed using UniFrac coupled with principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) to compare diversity, abundance, community structure, and specific bacterial groups in soil and rhizosphere samples. Permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) analysis showed that soil temperature (P = 0.001), rhizosphere temperature (P = 0.001), rhizosphere salinity (P = 0.032), and evapotranspiration (P = 0.002) significantly affected beta diversity of soil and rhizosphere microbial communities. Furthermore, salinity had marginal effects (P = 0.078) on soil beta diversity. However, temporal variability differentially affected rhizosphere microbial communities irrigated with saline wastewater. Therefore, microbial communities in soils impacted by saline irrigation water respond differently to irrigation water quality and season of application due to temporal effects associated with temperature.

J	Soberg, LC; Viklander, M; Blecken, GT				Soberg, Laila C.; Viklander, Maria; Blecken, Godecke-Tobias			Do salt and low temperature impair metal treatmentin stormwater bioretention cells with or without a submerged zone?	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Although seasonal temperature changes and (road) salt in winter and/or coastal stormwater runoff might interfere with the metal treatment performance of stormwater bioretention cells, no previous study has evaluated the effect of these factors and their interactions under controlled conditions. In this 18 week long study 24 well established pilot-scale bioretention columns were employed to evaluate the individual and combined effect(s) of low/high temperature, salt and presence of a submerged zone with an embedded carbon source on metal removal using a three factor, two-level full factorial experimental design. In most instances, the three factors significantly influenced the metal outflow concentrations and thus the treatment performance; the effect of temperature depended on the metal in question, salt had an overall negative effect and the submerged zone with carbon source had an overall positive effect. Despite these statistically significant effects, the discharge water quality was generally markedly improved. However, leaching of dissolved Cu and Pb did occur, mainly from bioretention cells dosed with salt-containing stormwater. The highest concentrations of metals were captured in the top layer of the filter material and were not significantly affected by the three factors studied. Overall, the results confirmed that bioretention provides a functioning stormwater treatment option in areas experiencing winter conditions (road salt, low temperatures) or coastal regions (salt-laden stormwater). However, validation of these results in the field is recommended, especially focusing on dissolved metal removal, which may be critically affected under certain conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Comparison of in vitro estrogenic activity and estrogen concentrations in source and treated waters from 25 US drinking water treatment plants	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												In vitro bioassays have been successfully used to screen for estrogenic activity in wastewater and surface water, however, few have been applied to treated drinking water. Here, extracts of source and treated water samples were assayed for estrogenic activity using T47D-KBluc cells and analyzed by liquid chromatography-Fourier transform mass spectrometry (LC-FTMS) for natural and synthetic estrogens (including estrone, 17 beta-estradiol, estriol, and ethinyl estradiol). None of the estrogens were detected above the LC-FTMS quantification limits in treated samples and only 5 source waters had quantifiable concentrations of estrone, whereas 3 treated samples and 16 source samples displayed in vitro estrogenicity. Estrone accounted for the majority of estrogenic activity in respective samples, however the remaining samples that displayed estrogenic activity had no quantitative detections of known estrogenic compounds by chemical analyses. Source water estrogenicity (max, 0.47 ng 17 beta-estradiol equivalents (E2Eq)L-1) was below levels that have been linked to adverse effects in fish and other aquatic organisms. Treated water estrogenicity (max, 0.078 ng E2Eq L-1) was considerably below levels that are expected to be biologically relevant to human consumers. Overall, the advantage of using in vitro techniques in addition to analytical chemical determinations was displayed by the sensitivity of the T47D-KBluc bioassay, coupled with the ability to measure cumulative effects of mixtures, specifically when unknown chemicals may be present.

Atmospheric deposition of particles at a sensitive alpine lake: Size-segregated daily and annual fluxes from passive sampling techniques	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Lake Tahoe, a North American alpine lake long appreciated for its clear water and geographic setting, has experienced a trend of declining water clarity due to increasing nutrient and particle inputs. Contributions from atmospheric deposition of particulate matter (PM) could be important, yet they are inadequately quantified. This study established a yearlong deposition monitoring network in the northern Lake Tahoe Basin. Dry deposition was quantified on surrogate surfaces while wet deposition was based on particles suspended in precipitation at 24-hour resolution. The particle size ranges by these passive techniques were 1-64 mu mand 0.5-20 mu min diameter for dry and wet deposition, respectively. Dry deposition of submicrometer (0.5-1 mu m) particles was also estimated by extrapolation of a lognormal size distribution. Higher daily number deposition fluxes (NDFdry and NDFwet) were found at a near-shore site, confirming substantial impacts of commercial and tourist activities. The two more isolated sites indicated a uniform regional background. On average, daily NDFdry is about one order of magnitude lower than daily NDFwet. Dry deposition velocities increased rapidlywith particle size, as evidenced by collocatedmeasurements of NDFdry and ambient particle number concentrations, though it seemsless so for wet deposition due to different scavenging mechanisms. Despite fewer "wet" days than "dry" days during the monitoring period, wet processes dominated seasonal particle deposition, particularly in winter and spring when most precipitation occurred. Adopting sediment (insoluble, inorganic) particle fraction estimates from the literature, this study reports an annual particle flux of 2.9-5.2 x 10(10) # m(-2) yr(-1) for sediment particles with 1-20 mu m diameter and 6.1-11 x 10(10) # m(-2) yr(-1) for those with 0.5-20 mu m diameter. Implications of these findings to the current knowledge of atmospheric deposition in the Lake Tahoe Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

Indicators of improved water access in the context of schistosomiasis transmission in rural Eastern Region, Ghana	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Populations with poor access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure are disproportionately affected by the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). As a result, WASH has gained increasing prominence in integrated control and elimination of NTDs, including schistosomiasis. In order to identify underserved populations, relevant measures of access to WASH infrastructure at sub-national or local levels are needed. We conducted a field survey of all public water sources in 74 rural communities in the Eastern Region of Ghana and computed indicators of water access using two methods: one based on the design capacity and another on the spatial distribution of water sources. The spatial method was applied to improved and surface water sources. According to the spatial method, improved water sources in the study area were well-distributed within communities with 95% (CI95%: 91, 98) of the population having access within 500 m when all, and 87% (CI95%: 81, 93) when only functional water sources were considered. According to the design capacity-based method, indicator values were lower: 63% (CI95%: 57, 69) for all and 49% (CI95%: 43, 55) for only functional sources. Surfacewater access was sub-stantial with 62% (CI95%: 54, 71) of the population located within 500 m of a perennial surface water source. A negative relationship was observed between functional improved water access and surface water access within 300 m. In this context, perceived water quality of the improved sources was also important, with a 17% increase in surface water access in towns with one reported water quality problem as compared to towns with no problems. Our study offers a potential methodology to use water point mapping data to identify communities in need of improved water access to achieve schistosomiasis risk reduction. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The land-use legacy effect: Towards a mechanistic understanding of time-lagged water quality responses to land use/cover	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Numerous studies have linked land use/land cover (LULC) to aquatic ecosystem responses, however only a few have included the dynamics of changing LULC in their analysis. In this study, we explicitly recognize changing LULC by linking mechanistic groundwater flow and travel time models to a historical time series of LULC, creating a land-use legacy map. We then illustrate the utility of legacy maps to explore relationships between dynamic LULC and lake water chemistry. We tested two main concepts about mechanisms linking LULC and lake water chemistry: groundwater pathways are an important mechanism driving legacy effects; and, LULC over multiple spatial scales is more closely related to lake chemistry than LULC over a single spatial scale. We applied statistical models to twelve water chemistry variables, ranging from nutrients to relatively conservative ions, to better understand the roles of biogeochemical reactivity and solubility on connections between LULC and aquatic ecosystem response. Our study illustrates how different areas can have long groundwater pathways that represent different LULC than what can be seen on the landscape today. These groundwater pathways delay the arrival of nutrients and other water quality constituents, thus creating a legacy of historic land uses that eventually reaches surface water. We find that: 1) several water chemistry variables are best fit by legacy LULC while others have a stronger link to current LULC, and 2) single spatial scales of LULC analysis performed worse for most variables. Our novel combination of temporal and spatial scales was the best overall model fit for most variables, including SRP where this model explained 54% of the variation. We show that it is important to explicitly account for temporal and spatial context when linking LULC to ecosystem response. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Although nutrients, such as phosphorus fertilizers, can promote crop growth while improving soil fertility, excessive nutrient inputs can produce diffuse pollution, which may results in water quality degradation. The objective of this paper is to employ the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) to estimate diffuse P effects on temporal and spatial distributions for a typical agricultural watershed and to identify the conjunct and independent influences of long-term land use and soil properties variation on diffuse P. With the validated model, the four-period simulation results (from 1979 to 2009) indicate that land use changes from agricultural development increased diffuse P yields. However, regarding updated soil properties, no significant differences of P yield were found between 1979 and 2009, demonstrating that impact of the cropland expansion were naturalized with soil property variations. An F-test was employed to assess the essentiality of all of the variables examined during the simulation period, and the test results indicated that diffuse P loading was more sensitive to soil properties than to land use. Before the P pollution control project about the land use optimization planning, it is more effective to distinguish the impacts of land use and soil properties. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Jarsjo, J; Tornqvist, R; Su, Y				Jarsjo, Jerker; Tornqvist, Rebecka; Su, Ye			Climate-driven change of nitrogen retention-attenuation near irrigated fields: multi-model projections for Central Asia	Environmental Earth Sciences												Agricultural intensification in semiarid regions comes at a cost of relatively high water losses through evapotranspiration and can contribute to releases of nutrients and pesticides that affect downstream water quality. In addition, highly managed river basins may be particularly sensitive to future climate change. However, effects on retention-attenuation of nutrients are difficult to quantify due to the complexity and variability of relevant processes. We here use the example case of the large (covering 1.3% of the earth's land surface) and extensively irrigated Aral Sea Drainage Basin (ASDB) in Central Asia, together with 73 general circulation model (GCM) projection results and field-data driven nitrogen retention-attenuation modeling, to investigate to which extent projected future climate change (for years 2025, 2050 and 2100) can influence nitrogen loads and concentrations in the water systems of the basin. Results for the principal Amu Darya River of the ASDB suggest that riverine concentrations of nitrogen will decrease considerably throughout the coming century. This is due to projected climate-related decreases in runoff and river discharge, which increases internal nitrogen recirculation ratios, average transport distances and nitrogen retention-attenuation. However, in groundwater near the agricultural fields, there is in contrast a risk of considerable nitrogen accumulation. More generally, the sensitivity of nitrogen concentrations in the ADRB to climate-driven changes in runoff and discharge is likely to be shared with many highly managed basins in arid and semiarid regions of Central Asia, and the world.

J	Sethy, SN; Syed, TH; Kumar, A				Sethy, Satya Narayan; Syed, Tajdarul H.; Kumar, Alok			Evaluation of groundwater quality in parts of the Southern Gangetic Plain using water quality indices	Environmental Earth Sciences												In India, persistent dependence on groundwater for intensively irrigated agriculture, industrial use and domestic activities imposes substantial threat to the quality and quantity of groundwater. This study assesses the suitability of groundwater for drinking purposes in parts of the Southern Gangetic Plain based on samples collected from 33 dug wells. In this scope, two robust indices are utilized, namely Groundwater Quality Index (GQI) and the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME) Water Quality Index (CCME_WQI), to assess the overall quality of groundwater by integrating observed water quality determinants like pH, TDS and major ion concentration. The concentration of major anions and cations is observed to be in the order of HCO3- > Cl- > SO42- > NO3- and Na+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > K+, respectively. The pH values of the analyzed samples vary between 6.2 and 7.37 during the post-monsoon (POM) period and between 6.6 and 7.9 during the pre-monsoon (PRM) period. Similarly, TDS concentrations are observed to vary between 6.7 and 1535 mg/l (POM) and 1.43 and 1327 mg/l (PRM). The values of GQI in the study area range between 10.41-108.56 and 16.03-130.06 for the PRM and POM periods, respectively. Among the groundwater samples collected during the PRM period, about 21, 73 and 6% are found to be excellent, good and poor quality, respectively. While the percentage of poor quality water for POM period is exactly the same as that of PRM, about 42 (52%) of the samples are found to be of excellent (good) quality for drinking purposes. The analysis of CCME_WQI for groundwater samples reveals that 3 (21%), 42 (36%), 33 (18%), 21 (24%) of the samples collected during PRM (POM) are classified to be of excellent, good, fair and marginal category, respectively. The spatial distribution of GQI and CCME_WQI illustrates that excellent quality water occurs primarily in the northeast part of the study area during the POM period. However, some localized patches with excellent quality are also observed in both the seasons. Results from this study will be crucial for proper utilization and management of already depleted groundwater resources of the study area.

In order to assess the effects of PES in the conservation soil area, the chemical and isotopic compositions of water from springs were characterized and the water baseline chemistry was established to provide a useful standard to monitor the water resources and to support the decision-making under current water management policies. A total of 32 water samples taken in four field surveys, during the dry and rainy season, and background chemical data from different information sources, were studied. The water salinity increases from southwest to northeast towards the urbanized area. The chemical composition of water is due to the occurrence of natural chemical interactions between water and rocks in aquifers and to the presence of effluents generated by human activities. In the forest area, water chemistry has not changed significantly over the past three decades and there are no major discernible trends in the compiled water chemistry data, suggesting that PES has contributed in part to maintain the initial condition in the aquifer recharge area. The natural reference levels proposed have allowed the current chemical conditions in the system to be understood and can be implemented to monitor water resources in the area of conservation soil in the Sierra de Las Cruces with an acceptable degree of reliability.

Fuzzy modelling to identify key drivers of ecological water quality to support decision and policy making	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY												Water quality modelling is an effective tool to investigate, describe and predict the ecological state of an aquatic ecosystem. Various environmental variables may simultaneously affect water quality. Appropriate selection of a limited number of key-variables facilitates cost-effective management of water resources. This paper aims to determine (and analyse the effect of) the major environmental variables predicting ecological water quality through the application of fuzzy models. In this study, a fuzzy logic methodology, previously applied to predict species distributions, was extended to model environmental effects on a whole community. In a second step, the developed models were applied in a more general water management context to support decision and policy making. A hill-climbing optimisation algorithm was applied to relate ecological water quality and environmental variables to the community indicator. The optimal model was selected based on the predictive performance (Cohen's Kappa), ecological relevance and model's interpretability. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis was performed as an extra element to analyse and evaluate the optimal model. The optimal model included the variables land use, chlorophyll and flow velocity. The variable selection method and sensitivity analysis indicated that land use influences ecological water quality the most and that it affects the effect of other variables on water quality to a high extent. The model outcome can support spatial planning related to land use in river basins and policy making related to flows and water quality standards. Fuzzy models are transparent to a wide range of users and therefore may stimulate communication between modellers, river managers, policy makers and stakeholders. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Variations in 11 water quality parameters from 15 sampling sites in Poyang Lake were investigated from 2009 to 2012. An integrative fuzzy variable evaluation (IFVE) model based on fuzzy theory and variable weights was developed to measure variations in water quality. Results showed that: 1) only chlorophyll-a concentration and Secchi depth differed significantly among the 15 sampling sites (P < 0.01), whereas the 11 water quality parameters under investigation differed significantly throughout the seasons (P < 0.01). The annual variations of all water quality variables except for temperature, electrical conductivity, suspended solids and total phosphorus were considerable (P < 0.05). 2) The IFVE model was reasonable and flexible in evaluating water quality status and any possible 'bucket effect'. The model fully considered the influences of extremely poor indices on overall water quality. 3) A spatial analysis indicated that anthropogenic activities (particularly industrial sewage and dredging) and lake bed topography might directly affect water quality in Poyang Lake. Meanwhile, hydrological status and sewage discharged into the lake might be responsible for seasonal water quality variations.																	1002-0063	1993-064X				FEB	2017	27	1					39	51		10.1007/s11769-017-0845-2								WOS:000392313900005						
J	Jones, TG; Willis, N; Gough, R; Freeman, C				Jones, Timothy G.; Willis, Naomi; Gough, Rachel; Freeman, Chris			An experimental use of floating treatment wetlands (FTWs) to reduce phytoplankton growth in freshwaters	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Eutrophication and the formation of phytoplankton blooms in freshwaters can be detrimental to water quality and biological health and produce organic matter that can be difficult to remove during water treatment processes. With the frequency of phytoplankton blooms increasing, remediation solutions are becoming increasingly popular. This study investigated the use of a peat-based floating treatment wetland (FTW) for reducing phytoplankton growth in eutrophic waters. Over a four-week period, the FTWs were able to reduce chlorophyll a concentrations by 80%, through sequestration of nitrate and phosphate and possibly due to the direct inhibitory properties of phenolic compounds. Although there are concerns about the leaching of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from the FTWs, this may be more than offset by the beneficial suppression of phytoplankton growth and the resulting reduced input of `untreatable' low molecular weight DOC.

Ryan			Nitrogen and phosphorus mass balance, retention and uptake in six plant species grown in stormwater bioretention microcosms	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Stormwater runoff contains high levels of nutrients, and is regulated by the Federal National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) to protect surface water quality. Stormwater bioretention (BR) systems are increasingly used to address these regulations. Planted BR systems remove significantly more pollutants than unplanted systems, but most studies do not attempt to verify a pollutant mass balance and seldom evaluate differences in nutrient uptake among species. This greenhouse experiment proved that an overall 98% recovery of Total Phosphorus (TP) mass over the study period was feasible for six plant species, ensuring accuracy of measurements and analyses. Additionally, it was found that Phragmites australis, Carex praegracilis, and Carex microptera uptake significantly more TP and Total Nitrogen (TN) mass into harvestable tissue than Typha latifolia, Scirpus validus, and Scirpus acutus. These results confirm that species selection can optimize nutrient retention and recovery from stormwater and decrease pollutant discharge to surface waters. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Plateau lake ecosystem in China is very vulnerable and especially sensitive to environmental change and human disturbance, due to its strong closeness, species simplification, oligotrophy and simple food chain. This research focuses on evaluating the quantitative and spatial relationships of land use pattern and water quality of rivers inflowing to Fuxian Lake, Chinas largest deep freshwater lake in plateau. To investigate the influence of spatial variation in land-use structures and topography on rivers water quality, the distributions of land-use types in the lakes drainage basin were obtained from satellite images, and the correlations between land-use types and inflow water quality indicators were examined by applying statistical analysis and spatial analytical function of Geographic Information System. Subarea-level analysis reveals that a land-use type could exert different effects on water quality in plains and mountains, and the effects had a connection with topographic and hydrologic factors, its mixture with other land-use types, weather conditions during field measurements, as well as its scale. In addition, a comparison of correlation coefficient data for buffer regions of different scales indicated that the effect of land-use type on inflow water quality peaked in buffer regions with a radius between 100 and 200 m. On the whole, the regions within 200 m of river banks were the key regions that affected river water quality, and thus the construction and preservation of a riparian buffer zone in these regions can provide considerable protection from the inputs of non-point source pollutants and nutrients, and important function such as water and soil conservation. Based on these, a pollution control zoning was constructed from two key pollution control zones in the north and south, a phosphate rock pollution control zone in the northeast, a water loss and soil erosion control zone in the east, and a tourism pollution control zone in the west. This research also offers valuable insights into how to carry out subarea-level prevention and control of water pollution and regional development, according to natural environment, land use pattern and characteristics of pollution sources in different pollution control zones.

From this perspective, the sustainability of a water system and its supply to end users may be classified according to the products, services, and energy necessary for its operation, which are incorporated from the corresponding socioeconomic system and form an important aspect of its evaluation. In the present study, the development of a geoinformatics tool with an emergy accounting approach and its corresponding methodology are described, focusing on a spatial-temporal analysis of water resources and their allocation to domestic, industrial, and agricultural uses. In addition, different water provision scenarios that involve several levels of infrastructure in the basin of the Upper Course of the Lerma River (UCLR) are evaluated, and existing water deficits are considered in order to assess their economic impact and offer a perspective on regional environmental sustainability. To achieve this, the water supply processes with the greatest relevance for the UCLR basin are evaluated, which include the extraction of groundwater and the treatment of surface and wastewater for subsequent use. The evaluation of the proposed scenarios indicates that the water supply system where treated water is recycled for agricultural, industrial, and urban uses (with restrictions) has the highest value according to the environmental sustainability index. Beyond this, it is possible to establish a series of strategies to transition from the current scenario where the water supply largely comes from an overexploited aquifer, to one where wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) are capable of implementing additional units in their processes to achieve drinking water quality. Finally, the proposed methodology and the geoinformatics tool developed in this study showed their effectiveness as instruments for achieving an integrated management of water resources, which would facilitate a more objective decision making process based on current and projected scenarios.

Impacts of the long-term presence of buried crude oil on salt marsh soil denitrification in Barataria Bay, Louisiana	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Denitrification is typically the dominant process of nitrate removal in coastal wetlands, converting bioavailable N in surface waters into gases released to the atmosphere through microbial respiration. This critical function and valuable ecosystem service performed by soil microbes in coastal wetlands improves water quality and benefits the surrounding ecosystem. Five years after the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, a layer of crude oil was found similar to 5 cm beneath the wetland soil surface in Bay Jimmy, LA. While previous research found potential denitrification in coastal wetland soils was significantly reduced immediately following oil exposure, this study sought to investigate the effects of the long-term presence of spilled crude oil on nitrate removal. Intact soil cores were collected from a salt marsh heavily oiled by the DWH spill, and a nearby, non-oiled site in Barataria Bay, LA. The presence of a layer of buried oil increased nitrate removal from the overlying water column, a proxy measure of denitrification, by 31.8% in intact cores compared to non-oiled cores. However, when the oil was thoroughly mixed through the surface soil intervals, there was an 1853% decrease in the rate of denitrification. This seemingly contradictory result demonstrates that oil buried 5 cm below the surface, and not in contact with the newly accreted soil, did not negatively affect areal denitrification rates. However, when oil was in direct contact and well mixed in the soil, denitrifiers in that part of the soil profile are still negatively affected. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This is particularly true in Mediterranean climate regions where long dry periods are interrupted by strong rainfalls. Storm events remobilize particles from soils and sediments and, as a consequence, the load of particulate matter in rivers can be quite considerable, severely affecting water quality. Nevertheless, an absence of fieldwork studies exists concerning the simultaneous dynamics of mixtures of pollutants in river waters, particularly during strong rainfalls and floods. Our study assessed the concentrations of six families of pollutants, including pesticides, at these events, and compared them to those observed at drought sampling periods. We have used as model a typical Mediterranean coastal river from Southeast France, the Tet River, whose hydrodynamics and major elements fluxes have been fairly investigated. As expected, our results show that chemical mixtures due to human activities occur and that they are particularly relevant during storm events. But the results of our study argue that exceptional multicontamination phenomena actually happen more often than expected because they are linked to recurrent sudden intense rainfall events in the Mediterranean. In particular, combined sewer overflows are responsible for this major issue in urbanized areas, whereas runoff and leaching will be the most important sources of pollutant mixtures occurring at flood flow peak, After an overview of the sources responsible for chronic multiple stressors events in regions under a Mediterranean climate regime worldwide, we revisit best management measures to reduce risks from the presence of chemical mixtures in the environment.

J	Wang, L; Burke, SP				Wang, Lei; Burke, Sean P.			A catchment-scale method to simulating, the impact of historical nitrate loading from agricultural land on the nitrate-concentration trends in the sandstone aquifers in the Eden Valley, UK	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Nitrate water pollution, which is mainly causedby agricultural activities, remains an international problem. It can cause serious long-term environmental and human health issues due to nitrate time-lag in the groundwater system. However, the nitrate subsurface legacy issue has rarely been considered in environmental water management. We have developed a simple catchment-scale approach to investigate the impact of historical nitrate loading from agricultural land on the nitrate-concentration"trends in sandstones, which represent major aquifers in the Eden Valley, UK The model developed considers the spatio-temporal nitrate loading, low permeability superficial deposits, dual-porosity unsaturated zones, and nitrate dilution in aquifers. Monte Carlo simulations were undertaken to analyse parameter sensitivity and calibrate the model using observed datasets. Time series of annual average nitrate concentrations from 1925 to 2150 were generated for four aquifer zones in the study area. The results show that the nitrate concentrations in 'St Bees Sandstones', 'silicified Penrith Sandstones', and 'non-silicified Penrith Sandstones' keep rising or stay high before declining to stable levels, whilst that in 'inter-bedded Brockram Penrith Sandstones' will level off after a slight decrease. This study can help policymakers better understand local nitrate-legacy issues. It also provides a framework for informing the long-term impact and timescale of different scenarios introduced to deliver water-quality compliance. This model requires relatively modest parameterisation and is readily transferable to other areas. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

A microcosm experiment to determine the consequences of magnetic microparticles application on water quality and sediment phosphorus pools	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												This study used microcosms to evaluate the effects of adding iron (Fe) magnetic microparticles (MPs) on water quality, focusing on P concentrations in the water column and sediment. Two treatments were considered for a constant 85:1 MP:P-Moblie molar ratio: T-W, applying MPs on the surface water layer; and T-S, applying MPs on the sediment. MP addition reduced P concentrations in lake water and sediment, with both treatments producing a mean reduction of 68 +/- 6% in dissolved inorganic P concentration (DIP) over a 70-day oxic period and reductions of 80 +/- 8% (T-W) and 80 +/- 4% (T-S) over a 5-day anoxic period. MPs also decreased reactive silicate (Si) concentrations by around 50% in both periods, but dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was reduced-by only 15% at 24 h after MP addition. Despite the marked decrease in DIP concentration due to MP addition, there was no-reduction in chlorophyll a (Chla), because post-treatment total P concentrations (>200 mu g L-1 vs. >700 mu g L-1 before treatments) remained higher than required for changes in the biological community (0.05-0.1. mg L-1). With T-S treatment, there was a reduction of 15% in P bound to Al oxides, clay minerals, and humic substances (P--> NaOH) and of 12% in labile organic P (Org-P-Labile) versus controls. P bound to humic substances (P--> NaOH,P- (Humic)) was reduced by 11-22% in both treatments. Finally, T-W rather than T-S treatments are recommended for future whole-lake applications to achieve more effective P removal from water and sediment and a higher percentage MP recovery.

Hydrological and depositional processes associated with recent glacier recession in Yanamarey catchment, Cordillera Blanca (Peru)	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												In this study, we investigate changes in the glaciated surface and the formation of lakes in the headwater of the Querococha watershed in Cordillera Blanca (Peru) using 24 Landsat images from 1975 to 2014. Information of glacier retreat was integrated with available climate data, the first survey of recent depositional dynamics in proglacial Yanamarey Lake (4600 m a.s.l.), and a relatively short hydrological record (2002-2014) at the outlet of Yanamarey Lake. A statistically significant temperature warming (0.21 degrees C decade(-1) for mean annual temperature) has been detected in the region, and it caused a reduction of the glacierized area since 1975 from 3.5 to 1.4 km(-2). New small lakes formed in the deglaciated areas, increasing the flooded area from 1.8 ha in 1976 to 2.8 ha in 2014. A positive correlation between annual rates of glacier recession and runoff was found. Sediment cores revealed a high sedimentation rate (>1 cm yr(-1)) and two contrasted facies, suggesting a shift toward a reduction of meltwater inputs and higher hydrological variability likely due to an increasing role of precipitation on runoff during the last decades. Despite the age control uncertainties, the main transition likely occurred around 19982000, correlating with the end of the phase with maximum warming rates and glacier retreat during the 1980s and 1990s, and the slowing down of expansion of surface lake-covered surface. With this hydrological - paleolimnological approach we have documented the association between recent climate variability and glacier recession and the rapid transfer of hydroclimate signal to depositional and geochemical processes in high elevation Andean environments. This, study also alerts about water quality risks as proglacial lakes act as secondary reservoirs that trap trace and minor elements in high altitude basins. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We collected a total of 276 heterogeneous datasets with 8 water quality parameters and 25 fish species from 10 sampling sites. The self-organizing feature map (SOM) was used to cluster, analyze and visualize the heterogeneous datasets. Furthermore, the structuring index (SI) was adopted to determine the relative importance of each input variable of the SOM and identify the indicator factors. The clustering results showed that the SOM.could suitably reflect the spatial characteristics of fishery sampling sites. Besides, the patterns of water quality parameters and fish species could be distinguishably (visually) classified into three eco-water quality groupS: 1) typical upstream freshwater fishes that depended the most on dissolved oxygen (DO); 2) typical middle-lower reach riverine freshwater fishes that depended the most on total phosphorus (TP) and ammonia nitrogen; and 3) low lands or pond (reservoirs) freshwater fishes that depended the most on water temperature, suspended solids and chemical oxygen demand. According to the results of the SI, the representative indicators of water quality parameters and fish species consisted of DO, TP and Onychostoma barbatulum. This grouping result suggested that the methodology can be used as a guiding reference to comprehensively relate ecology to water quality. Our methods offer a cost-effective alternative to more traditional methods for identifying key water quality factors relating to fish species. In addition, visualizing the constructed topological maps of the SOM could produce detailed interrelation between water quality and the fish species of stream habitat units. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This likely lead to poor decisions regarding climate adaptation. Climate warming and farmland responses have synergistic consequences for diffuse nitrogen pollution, which are hypothesized to present different spatio-temporal patterns. In this study, we propose a modeling framework to simulate the synergistic impacts of climate warming and warming-induced farmland shifts on diffuse pollution. Active accumulated temperature response for latitudinal and altitudinal directions was predicted based" on a simple agro-climate model under different temperature increments (Delta(0) is from 0.8 degrees C to 1.4 degrees C at an interval of 0.2 degrees C). Spatial distributions of dryland shift to paddy land were determined by considering accumulated temperature. Different temperature increments and crop distributions were inserted into Soil and Water Assessment Tool model, Which quantified the spatio-temporal changes of nitrogen. Warming led to a decrease of the annual total nitrogen loading (2.6%-142%) in the low latitudes compared with baseline, which was larger than the decrease (0.8%-6.2%) in the high latitudes. The synergistic impacts amplified the decrease of the loading in the low and high latitudes at the sub-basin scale. Warming led to a decrease of the loading at a rate of 035 kg/ha/degrees C, which was lower than the synergistic impacts (3.67 kg/ha/degrees C) at the watershed level. However, warming led to the slight increase of the annual averaged NO3 (LAT) (0.16 kg/ha/degrees C), which was amplified by the synergistic impacts (0.22 kg/ha/degrees C). Expansion of paddy fields led to a decrease in the monthly total nitrogen loading throughout the year, but amplified an increase in the loading in August and September. The decreased response in spatio-temporal nitrogen patterns is substantially amplified by farmland-atmosphere feedbacks associated with farmland shifts in response to warming. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Biogeochemical and hydrological drivers of the dynamics of Vibrio species in two Patagonian estuaries	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The ecology of the most relevant Vibrio species for human health and their relation to water quality and biogeochemistry were studied in two estuaries in Argentinian Patagonia. Vibrio cholerae and Vibrio parahaemolyticus were reported in > 29% of cases at the Rio Colorado and Rio Negro estuaries. Neither the pandemic serogroups of Vibrio cholerae O1, Vibrio cholerae O139 nor the cholera toxin gene were detected in this study. However, several strains of V. cholerae (not O1 or O139) are able to cause human disease or acquire pathogenic genes by horizontal transfer. Vibrio vulnificus was detected only in three instances in the microplankton fraction of the Rio Negro estuary. The higher salinity in the Rio Colorado estuary and in marine stations at both estuaries favours an abundance of culturable Vibrio. The extreme peaks for ammonium, heterotrophic bacteria and faecal coliforms in the Rio Negro estuary supported a marked impact on sewage discharge. Generally, the more pathogenic strains of Vibrio have a faecal origin. Salinity, pH, ammonium, chlorophyll a, silicate and carbon/nitrogen ratio of suspended organic particulates were the primary factors explaining the distribution of culturable bacteria after distance-based linear models. Several effects of dissolved organic carbon on bacterial distribution are inferred. Global change is expected to increase the trophic state and the salinisation of Patagonian estuaries. Consequently, the distribution and abundance of Vibrio species is projected to increase under future changing baselines. Adaptation strategies should contribute to sustaining good water quality to buffer climate- and anthropogenic- driven impacts. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Understanding the links between nitrate concentration and groundwater resource is a prerequisite for assessing the sustainability of irrigated systems. The Berambadi catchment (ORE-BVET/Kabini Critical Zone Observatory) in Southern India is a typical example of intensive irrigated agriculture and then an ideal site to study the relative influences of land use, management practices and aquifer properties on NO3 spatial distribution in groundwater. The monitoring of >200 tube wells revealed nitrate concentrations from I to 360 mg/L. Three configurations of groundwater level and elevation gradient were identified: i) NO3 hot spots associated to deep groundwater levels (30-60.m) and low groundwater elevation gradient suggest small groundwater reserve with absence of lateral flow, then degradation of groundwater quality due to recycling through pumping and return flow; ii) high groundwater elevation gradient, moderate NO3 concentrations suggest that significant lateral flow prevented NO3 enrichment; iii) low NO3 concentrations, low groundwater elevation gradient and shallow groundwater indicate a large reserve. We propose that mapping groundwater level and gradient could be used to delineate zones vulnerable to agriculture intensification in catchments where groundwater from low-yielding aquifers is the only source of irrigation. Then, wells located in low groundwater elevation gradient zones are likely to be suitable for assessing the impacts of local agricultural systems, while wells located in zones with high elevation gradient would reflect the average groundwater quality of the catchment, and hence should be used for regional mapping of groundwater quality. Irrigatiori with NO3 concentrated groundwater induces a "hidden" input of nitrogen to the crop which can reach 200 kgN/ha/yr in hotspot areas, enhancing groundwater contamination. Such fluxes, once taken into account in fertilizer management, would allow optimizing fertilizer consumption and mitigate high nitrate concentrations in groundwater. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

These correspond with the large average concentration of total phosphorus (TP), total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) and soluble reactive (SRP) as well as high phytoplankton density in the water column. The consistency among P concentrations, phytoplankton density and APA, together with the positive impact of phytoplankton density on total APA revealed by the structural equation modelling, (SEM), indicates that facilitated APA levels in water is an essential strategy for phytoplankton to enhance the available P. Furthermore, a positive interaction between phytoplankton APA and bacteria APA was detected, suggesting a potential collaboration between phytoplankton and bacteria to boost available P content in the water column. Both macrophyte species had a prominent performance on regulating phytoplankton proliferation. The phytoplankton density and quantum yield in C. demersum systems were all significantly lower (33.8% and 24.0%) than those in V. spiralis systems. Additionally, a greater decoupling effect of C. demersum on the relationship between P, APA, phytoplankton density, bacteria dynamic and quantum yield Was revealed by SEM. These results imply that the preferred tactic of different species could lead to the performance gap. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The present study was dedicated to assessing the spatial distribution of three heavy metals (copper, lead, zinc) in the surface soil of ten small-scale infiltration facilities, along with several physical parameters (soil moisture, volatile matter, variable thickness of the upper horizon). High-resolution samplings and in-situ measurements were undertaken, followed by X-ray fluorescence analyses and spatial interpolation. Highest metal accumulation was found in a relatively narrow area near the water inflow zone, from which concentrations markedly decreased with increasing distance. Maximum enrichment ratios amounted to >20 in the most contaminated sites. Heavy metal patterns give a time-integrated vision of the non-uniform infiltration fluxes, sedimentation processes and surface flow pathways within the devices. This element indicates that the lateral extent of contamination is mainly controlled by hydraulics. The evidenced spatial structure of soil concentrations restricts the area where remediation measures would be necessary in these systems, and suggests possible optimization of their hydraulic functioning towards an easier maintenance. Heterogeneous upper boundary conditions should be taken into account when studying the fate of micropollutants in infiltration facilities with either mathematical modeling or soil coring field surveys.

However, PPS are not very efficient in removing heavy metals from stormwater. A pilot scale study using zeolite or basalt as bed material in PPS removed 41-72%, 67 -74%, 38-43%, 61-72%, 63-73% of Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn, respectively, from synthetic stormwater (pH 6.5; Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn concentrations of 0.04, 0.6, 0.06,1.0, and 2.0 mg L-1, respectively) over a period of 80 h. The total volume of stormwater that passed through the PPS was equivalent to runoff in 10 years of rainfall in Sydney, Australia. The concentrations of metals in the PPS effluent failed fresh and marine water quality trigger values recommended in the Australian and New Zealand guidelines. An addition of a post-treatment of a horizontal filter column containing a titanate nano-fibrous (TNF) material with a weight < 1% of zeolite weight and mixed in with granular activated carbon (GAC) at a GAC:TNF weight ratio of 25:1 removed 77% of Ni and 99-100% of all the other metals. The effluent easily met the required standards of marine waters and just met those concerning fresh waters. Batch adsorption data from solutions of metals mixtures fitted the Langmuir model with adsorption capacities in the following order, TNF >> zeolite > basalt; Pb > Cu > Cd, Ni, Zn.

JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												National scale initiatives are being attempted in New Zealand (NZ) to meet important environmental goals following land-use intensification over recent decades. Riparian restoration to filter agricultural spillover effects is currently the most widely practised mitigation measure but few studies have investigated the cumulative value of these practices at a national level. We use an applied economic land use model the benefits (GHG emissions, N leaching, P loss, sedimentation and biodiversity gain) and relevant costs (fencing, alternative stock water supplies, restoration planting and opportunity costs) of restoring riparian margins (5-50 m) on all streams in NZ flowing through current primary sector land. Extensive sensitivity analysis reveals that depending on margin width and cost assumptions, riparian margin restoration generates net benefits of between NZ$1.7 billion - $5.2 billion/yr and benefit-cost ratios ranging between 1.4 and 22.4. This suggests that even when not monetising the increase in biodiversity or components of stream ecosystem health and other benefits from planting riparian strips, the benefits to climate and freshwater are significantly greater than the implementation costs of riparian restoration.

For this reason, the US FDA has promulgated the Produce Rule, mandating the testing of irrigation water sources for many farms. The rule requires the collection and analysis of at least 20 water samples over two to four years to adequately evaluate the quality of water intended for produce irrigation. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of interannual weather variability on surface water microbial quality. We used the Soil and Water Assessment Tool model to simulate E. coli concentrations in the Little Cove Creek; this is a perennial creek located in an agricultural watershed in south-eastern Pennsylvania. The model performance was evaluated using the US FDA regulatory microbial water quality metrics of geometric mean (GM) and the Statistical threshold value (STV). Using the 90-year time series of weather observations, we simulated and randomly sampled the time series of E. coli concentrations. We found that weather conditions of a specific year may strongly affect the evaluation of microbial quality and that the long-term assessment of microbial water quality may be quite different from the evaluation based on short-term observations. The variations in microbial concentrations and water quality metrics were affected by location, wetness of the hydrological years, and seasonality, with 15.7-70.1% of samples exceeding the regulatory threshold. The results of this work demonstrate the value of using modeling to design and evaluate monitoring protocols to assess the microbial quality of water used for produce irrigation.

J	Yen, FC; You, SJ; Chang, TC				Yen, Feng-Chi; You, Sheng-Jie; Chang, Tien-Chin			Performance of electrodialysis reversal and reverse osmosis for reclaiming wastewater from high-tech industrial parks in Taiwan: A pilot-scale study	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Wastewater reclamation is considered an absolute necessity in Taiwan, as numerous industrial parks experience water shortage. However, the water quality of secondary treated effluents from sewage treatment plants generally does not meet the requirements of industrial water use because of the high inorganic constituents. This paper reports experimental data from a pilot-plant study of two treatment processes-(i) fiber filtration (FF)-ultrafiltration (UF)-reverse osmosis (RO) and (ii) sand filtration (SF)-electrodialysis reversal (EDR)-for treating industrial high conductivity effluents from the Xianxi wastewater treatment plant in Taiwan. The results demonstrated that FF-UF was excellent for turbidity removal and it was a suitable pretreatment process for RO. The influence of two membrane materials on the operating characteristics and process stability of the UF process was determined. The treatment performance of FF-UF-RU was higher than that of SF-EDR with an average desalination rate of 97%, a permeate conductivity of 272.7 +/- 32.0, turbidity of 0.183 +/- 0.02 NTU and a chemical oxigen demand of <4.5 mg/L. The cost analysis for both processes in a water reclamation plant of 4000 m(3)/d capacity revealed that using FF-UF-RU had a lower treatment cost than using SF-EDR, which required activated carbon filtration as a post treatment process. On the basis of the results in this study, the FF-UF-RU system is recommended as a potential process for additional applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Simulating the environmental performance of post-harvest management measures to comply with the EU Nitrates Directive	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Nitrate (NO3-) leaching from farmland remains the predominant source of nitrogen (N) loads to European ground- and surface water. As soil mineral N content at harvest is often high and may increase by mineralisation from crop residues and soil organic matter, it is critical to understand which post-harvest management measures can be taken to restrict the average NO3- concentration in ground- and surface waters below the norm of 50 mg l(-1.) Nitrate leaching was simulated with the EU-rotate_N model on a silty and a sandy soil following the five main arable crops cultivated in Flanders: cut grassland, silage maize, potatoes, sugar beets and winter wheat, in scenarios of optimum fertilisation with and without post-harvest measures. We compared the average NO3- concentration in the leaching water at a depth of 90 cm in these scenarios after dividing it by a factor of 2.1 to include natural attenuation processes occurring during transport towards ground- and surface water. For cut grassland, the average attenuated No concentration remained below the norm on both soils. In order to comply with the Nitrates Directive, post-harvest measures seemed to be necessary on sandy soils for the four other crops and on silty soils for silage maize and for potatoes. Successful measures appeared to be the early sowing of winter crops after harvesting winter wheat, the undersowing of grass in silage maize and the removal of sugar beet leaves. Potatoes remained a problematic crop as N uptake by winter crops was insufficient to prevent excessive Nor leaching. For each crop, maximum levels of soil mineral N content at harvest were proposed, both with and without additional measures, which could be used in future nutrient legislation. The approach taken here could be upscaled from the field level to the subcatchment level to see how different crops could be arranged within a subcatchment to permit the cultivation of problem crops without adversely affecting the water quality in such a subcatchment.

The 11th hydro-morphological indicators that describe the deviation from the natural conditions of the hydrological regime, river continuity and morphological conditions have been calculated for five atypical lowland water bodies, based on the data sets generated by the Romanian National Hydrological and Hydrogeological Database. Subsequently, the values (scores) of uni-criteria indicators were used to calculate multi-criteria indicators in order to establish the final status of some elements (e.g. hydrological regime element). Most of the hydro-morphological indicators classify the analyzed water bodies mainly in quality classes I and II except some indicators in class III and IV (moderate and poor status) for example the riparian zone indicator. We used the "one out, all out" principle (the worst status of the elements used in the assessment) to classify the final hydro morphological status (in case of four out of five waterbodies the riparian zone indicator gave the final hydro-morphological status). The correct classification is important for taking measures to improve water quality. The results stress the necessity for an in-depth analysis of the link between hydro-morphological, physico-chemical and biological status as well as to further refine the hydro-morphological classification schemes at least for some river types. The final classification should be consistent across all 3 assessments required by Water Framework Directive (using hydro-morphological, physico-chemical and biological elements).																	1842-4090	1844-489X				FEB	2017	12	1					161	169										WOS:000390973500017

Characterizing pharmaceutical, personal care product, and hormone contamination in a karst aquifer of southwestern Illinois, USA, using water quality and stream flow parameters	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Karst aquifers are drinking water sources for 25% of the global population. However, the unique geology of karst areas facilitates rapid transfer of surficial chemicals to groundwater, potentially contaminating drinking water. Contamination of karst aquifers by nitrate, chloride, and bacteria have been previously observed, but little knowledge is available on the presence of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), such as pharmaceuticals. Over a 17-month period, 58 water samples were collected from 13 sites in the Salem Plateau, a karst region in southwestern Illinois, United States. Water was analyzed for 12 pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), 7 natural and synthetic hormones, and 49 typical water quality parameters (e.g., nutrients and bacteria). Hormones were detected in only 23% of samples, with concentrations of 2.2-9.1 ng/L. In contrast, PPCPs were quantified in 89% of groundwater samples. The two most commonly detected PPCPs were the antimicrobial triclocarban, in 81% of samples, and the cardiovascular drug gemfibrozil, in 57%. Analytical results were combined with data of local stream flow, weather, and land use to 1) characterize the extent of aquifer contamination by CECs, 2) cluster sites with similar PPCP contamination profiles, and 3) develop models to describe PPCP contamination. Median detection in karst groundwater was 3 PPCPs at a summed concentration of 4.6 ng/L. Sites clustered into 3 subsets with unique contamination models. PPCP contamination in Cluster I sites was related to stream height, manganese, boron, and heterotrophic bacteria. Cluster II sites were characterized by groundwater temperature, specific conductivity, sodium, and calcium. Cluster III sites were characterized by dissolved oxygen and barium. Across all sites, no single or small set of water quality factors was significantly predictive of PPCP contamination, although gemfibrozil concentrations were strongly related to the sum of PPCPs in karst groundwater.

Monitoring bacterial indicators of water quality in a tidally influenced delta: A Sisyphean pursuit	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary (Delta) is the confluence of two major watersheds draining the Western Sierra Nevada mountains into the Central Valley of California, ultimately terminating into San Francisco Bay. We sampled 88 sites once a month for two years (2006-2008) over 87 separate sampling events for a total of 1740 samples. Water samples were analyzed for fecal indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli, enterococci and fecal coliforms), and 53 other physiochemical, land use, and environmental characteristics. The purpose of the study was to create a baseline of microbial water quality in the Delta and to identify various factors (climatic, land use, tidal, etc.) that were associated with elevated concentrations of indicator bacteria. Fecal indicator bacteria generally had weak to modest relationships to environmental conditions; the strength and direction of which varied for each microbial indicator, drainage region, and across seasons. Measured and unmeasured, site-specific effects accounted for large portions of variance in model predictions (p = 0.086 to 0.255), indicating that spatial auto correlation was a major component of water quality outcomes. The effects of tidal cycling and lack of connectivity between waterways and surrounding landscapes likely contributed to the lack of association between local land uses and microbial outcomes, though weak associations may also be indicative of mismatched spatiotemporal scales. The complex nature of this system necessitates continued monitoring and regular updates to statistical models designed to predict microbial water quality. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The increase is due to drawdown of As-polluted groundwater (As <= 5144 mu g/L) from overlying aquifers at depths 65 to 150 m deep in response to large-scale abstraction for public supply. The increase in As threatens drinking water quality locally, and by inference does so across the entire Po Plain, where natural As-pollution of groundwater (As >10 mu g/L) is a basin-wide problem. Using new and legacy data for Cl/Br, delta O-18/delta H-2 and other hydrochemical parameters with groundwater from 32 wells, 9 surface waters, a sewage outfall and rainwater, we show that the deep aquifer (160-260 m below ground level), which is tapped widely for public water-supply, is partly recharged by seepage from overlying aquifers (65-150 m below ground level). Groundwater quality in deep aquifers appears free of anthropogenic influences and typically <10 mu g/L of As. In contrast, shallow groundwater and surface water in some, not all, areas are affected by anthropogenic contamination and natural As-pollution (As >10 mu g/L). Outfalls from sewage-treatment plants and black water from septic tanks firstly affect surface waters, which then locally infiltrate shallow aquifers under high channel-stages. Wastewater permeating shallow aquifers carries with it NO3 and SO4 which suppress reduction of iron oxyhydroxides in the aquifer sediments and so suppress the natural release of As to groundwater.

J	Niu, BB; Wang, HH; Loaiciga, HA; Hong, S; Shao, W				Niu, Beibei; Wang, Huanhuan; Loaiciga, Hugo A.; Hong, Song; Shao, Wei			Temporal variations of groundwater quality in the Western Jianghan Plain, China	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The Western Jianghan Plain (WJHP) lies in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. It has been impacted by anthropogenic activities during the past decades. The long-term variations of the WJHP's regional aquifer's hydrochemistry and groundwater quality have not been previously assessed. Sixteen physiochemical parameters at 29 monitoring wells within the Western Jianghan Plain were monitored during 1992-2010 and analyzed with multiple approaches. The confined groundwater is predominantly of the HCO3Ca-Mg type with Cl-, So(4)(2-), NH4-N, and NO3-N showing remarkable spatial variations. Correlation analysis was used to identify the origins and contamination sources of groundwater. The seasonal Mann-Kendall test revealed that pH, NO3-N, and Cl- concentrations at 27, 26 and 15 wells, respectively, exhibited significant increasing trends during 1992-2010. The increase of pH may be attributed to CO2 degassing caused by extensive groundwater extraction. Regional average NO3-N concentrations of groundwater increased coincidently with the increased use of fertilizer, which suggests that nitrate pollution is caused by agricultural activities. Abnormally high values of and SO4- at some wells were induced by industrial chemicals. In addition, the similarity of the temporal variations of the regional average of pH, NH4-N, and NO3-N concentrations in groundwater with those in the Yangtze River at the outlet of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) suggests that the variations of these parameters in the WJHP is partly due to water storage by the TGR. This study presents an analysis of temporal variations of groundwater quality in the WJHP that reveals a relation between the creation of the TGR and downstream groundwater quality. This paper's findings provide clues for measures that could be taken to protect the groundwater quality of the WJHP's aquifer.

J	Chen, Z; Wu, QY; Wu, GX; Hu, HY				Chen, Zhuo; Wu, Qianyuan; Wu, Guangxue; Hu, Hong-Ying			Centralized water reuse system with multiple applications in urban areas: Lessons from China's experience	RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING												In the context of rapid urbanization and water shortage, many cities of the world, especially megacities in rapidly developing zones, have urgent needs in improving their sustainable water management without compromising the local socioeconomic development. Water reuse has been increasingly recognized as a sustainable water management strategy. The results of this paper have shown that the development of water reuse in China is found to have positive correlations to local water resource availability and GDP levels, and the water reuse rate in some megacities has already reached 35-60%. Centralized water reuse systems have widely gained favor. Thus, a centralized water reuse framework with three utilization patterns is proposed. Particularly, a multiple-utilization model that applies a hierarchical use structure is found to be viable for meeting multiple water quality requirements. Other patterns address environmental and cascading ways in maximizing the value of reclaimed water use. A case study in a Chinese megacity, Tianjin, is demonstrated where a large-scale centralized water reuse project with a multiple barrier treatment approach and a hierarchical distribution and use structure has contributed to water reuse development in a safe, reliable and economical manner. This paper can be beneficial to water authorities and practitioners for long-term urban water management in other rapidly developing cities and regions that have encountered similar water-related problems.

There are very few studies about lake nutrient criteria and water body classification system, which may cause difficulties in nutrient level assessment and management. This paper reviewed WQS system in the US, EU, and Japan, and then presented the development procedures for revising surface WQS in different periods in China. The amendment includes indicators, standard values, and framework of the standard system. However, current WQS set in light of the criteria and standards of the US and Europe couldn't adapt to the natural conditions of lakes in China. Therefore, by learning from the water quality criteria setting method of USA and taking the regional differences into consideration, a methodology of combining structure equation model and expert elicitation was recommended for setting WQS. Furthermore, it considered to investigate the differences (climate, elevation and geographical condition, etc.) in each region, and set lake nutrient criteria and standards on regional scale. Consequently, the proposed methodology for setting standards could be applied to each region in China. Yungui ecoregion was taken as an example for setting up the lake nutrient standards with considering TP, Chl-a, TN and CODMn, four influence factors for designated use attainment, and a suitable TP standard 0.02 mg/L was recommended by using the proposed methods.

Preventable fine sediment export from the Burdekin River catchment reduces coastal seagrass abundance and increases dugong mortality within the Townsville region of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												The coastal seagrass meadows in the Townsville region of the Great Barrier Reef are crucial seagrass foraging habitat for endangered dugong populations. Deteriorating coastal water quality and in situ light levels reduce the extent of these meadows, particularly in years with significant terrestrial runoff from the nearby Burdekin River catchment. However, uncertainty surrounds the impact of variable seagrass abundance on dugong carrying capacity. Here, I demonstrate that a power-law relationship with exponent value of -1 (R-2 similar to 0.87) links mortality data with predicted changes in annual above ground seagrass biomass. This relationship indicates that the dugong carrying capacity of the region is tightly coupled to the biomass of seagrass available for metabolism. Thus, mortality rates increase precipitously following large flood events with a response lag of <12-months. The management implications of this result are discussed in terms of climate scenarios that indicate an increased future likelihood of extreme flood events. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Spatial and temporal microbial pollution patterns in a tropical estuary during high and low river flow conditions	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Spatial and temporal patterns of coastal microbial pollution are not well documented. Our study examined these patterns through measurements of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), nutrients, and physiochemical parameters in Hilo Bay, Hawai'i, during high and low river flow. >40% of samples tested positive for the human-associated Bacteroides marker, with highest percentages near rivers. Other FIB were also higher near rivers, but only Clostridium perfringens concentrations were related to discharge. During storms, FIB concentrations were three times to an order of magnitude higher, and increased with decreasing salinity and water temperature, and increasing turbidity. These relationships and high spatial resolution data for these parameters were used to create Enterococcus spp. and C. perfringens maps that predicted exceedances with 64% and 95% accuracy, respectively. Mapping microbial pollution patterns and predicting exceedances is a valuable tool that can improve water quality monitoring and aid in visualizing FIB hotspots for management actions.

The biogeochemical module accounts for nitrogen and phosphorus and includes the water column and upper sediment layer. The simulations showed that water circulation and the seasonal patterns of nutrients, phytoplankton and dissolved oxygen were satisfactorily reproduced. Model results indicate that water circulation in the lagoon is driven mainly by tide and wind. Plankton primary production is co-limited by phosphorus and nitrogen, and is highest in the inner part of the lagoon, due to the combined effects of high water residence time and high nutrient inputs from the boundary. However, a sensitivity analysis highlights the importance of exchanges with the Mediterranean Sea in maintaining a high level of productivity. Intensive use of fertilizers in the catchment area has a significant effect on phytoplankton biomass increase. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Characterizing light attenuation within Northwest Florida Estuaries: Implications for RESTORE Act water quality monitoring	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Water Quality (WQ) condition is based on ecosystem stressor indicators (e.g. water clarity) which are biogeochemically important and critical when considering the Deepwater Horizon oil spill restoration efforts under the 2012 RESTORE Act. Nearly all of the proposed RESTORE projects list restoring WC as a goal, but 90% neglect water clarity. Here, dynamics of optical constituents impacting clarity are presented from a 2009-2011 study within Pensacola, Choctawhatchee, St. Andrew and St Joseph estuaries (targeted RESTORE sites) in Northwest Florida. Phytoplankton were the smallest contribution to total absorption (a(t-w)PAR) at 412 nm (5-11%), whereas colored dissolved organic matter was the largest (61-79%). Estuarine a(t-w)PAR was significantly related to light attenuation (K(d)PAR), where individual contributors to clarity and the influence of climatic events were discerned. Provided are conversion equations demonstrating interoperability of clarity indicators between traditional State-measured WQ measures (e.g. secchi disc), optical constituents, and even satellite remote sensing for obtaining baseline assessments.

Evidence from major Japanese cities	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												This study investigates whether income inequality affects environmental degradation. We use city-level data in Japan, where local governments have limited authority and often use voluntary agreements with private firms. We test the hypothesis that inequality weakens residents' bargaining power over polluters and has a negative effect on environmental quality. Our results show that inequality negatively affected air quality in residential and commercial areas during the 1990s but not in industrial areas. This evidence suggests that the inequality-pollution relationship is not just a correlation but reflects a causal effect of residents' bargaining power on environmental quality. This implies that equal communities can pressure firms into accepting pollution prevention agreements. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The case of the Cleaner Production Center at the University of Cienfuegos in Cuba, a country in transition	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Universities are key stakeholders in teaching, researching and supporting the implementation of cleaner production activities. This case study discusses the experience of establishing and operating the Cleaner Production Center at the University of Cienfuegos (Cuba). Establishing, starting-up and running the center during its first four years of activity was supported by two projects targeted to inter-university cooperation. The collaboration allowed to establish a master program on cleaner production which acts as a bridge between the university, and the production industry and the services sector in the province of Cienfuegos. Currently 32 students from the first two promotions graduated and the program of two other promotions is ongoing. The master thesis research works are defined improving the environmental performance of the companies or organizations the student originate from. This results in a measurable improvement of the air and surface water quality in Cienfuegos city. An estimated yearly reduction of the emission of 60,000 ton of carbon dioxide equivalents and of 400 MWh at a cement plant have been realized. Research activities currently target the pollution inventory of Cienfuegos, energy production from local biomass, and establishing indicators for sustainable development for Cienfuegos. The inter-university collaboration resulted in several publications in international peer reviewed journals. The successful inter-university North South collaboration between Cuba and Belgium, targeted at capacity building, transfer of experience and expertise, proved to be most crucial during these first years the center was active. It allowed generating the necessary funds which are often difficult to raise in developing countries. Therefore this is a unique case of building academic experience on cleaner production.

J	Chrispim, MC; Nolasco, MA				Chrispim, Mariana Cardoso; Nolasco, Marcelo Antunes			Greywater treatment using a moving bed biofilm reactor at a university campus in Brazil	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Water reuse can contribute as an important approach and practice to the reduction of the pressures on water resources lowering the demand for potable water for purposes that do not require water's high quality. However the greywater reuse has been rarely applied in Brazil. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to evaluate a greywater collection and treatment system from lavatories, showers and washing machine aiming the non-potable reuse. The objectives were to characterize the quality and quantity of greywater from different sources, to monitor a pilot system for synthetic greywater treatment and to analyze the quality of the effluent after treatment. The pilot system implemented in a building at University of Sao Paulo allowed to segregate greywater collection and characterization. To evaluate the greywater production water flow meters were installed in the water inlet of each greywater source. The treatment system included a moving bed biofilm reactor and a settling tank at pilot scale. The evaluation of greywater treatment was conducted based on the monitoring of physicochemical and microbiological water quality parameters during the operation of the experimental system. Based on the results, amongst the three greywater sources, the water from showers had the highest E. coli concentration while the lavatories water had the highest total coliforms concentration. The removal efficiencies of BOD and COD were 59% e 70% respectively. The phosphorus removal during the experimental period was low. Nevertheless the water quality produced is viable to be applied for outdoor purposes- landscape and garden irrigation in household, commercial and institutional buildings and the results were satisfactory according to Brazilian standard. The treatment showed stability and reliability ensuring the potential for a safe reuse if appropriate operation and monitoring of the treatment system is performed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Pedersen, LF; Henriksen, NH				Pedersen, Lars-Flemming; Henriksen, Niels Henrik			Semi-continuously addition of peracetic acid to a flow-through fish farm	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Seasonal occurrence of skin and gill parasites in fish ponds can substantially affect fish performance by reduced growth and increased mortality and hence the economic returns of aquaculture systems. To minimize loss of fish, preventive and curative water treatments are typically applied by adding sodium chloride and/or formalin into the ponds. This note from the field describes a simple alternative method to improve water quality in a Danish flow through fish farm. Instead of periodic formalin baths/flushes in all ponds, peracetic acid (PAA) was continuously added from a mixing tank to the common water inlet during daytime throughout the spring and summer season. The method was tested on a commercial organic flow through trout farm, and included verification of PAA residuals and distribution in the makeup water, within ponds and in the effluent from the fish farm. PAA was found to be evenly distributed to the ponds, achieved and maintained at concentrations around 0.10-0.15 mg PAA/1 corresponding to aimed values. PAA degraded within the fish ponds and negligible amounts of PAA were measured in the discharge. The economic and environmental feasibility of the applied low practical methods was demonstrated as white spot disease outbreak was absent throughout the season without using any formalin.

Molecular and Spectroscopic Characterization of Water Extractable Organic Matter from Thermally Altered Soils Reveal Insight into Disinfection Byproduct Precursors	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												To characterize the effects of thermal-alteration on water extractable organic matter (WEOM),-Soil samples were heated in a laboratory at 225, 350, and 500 degrees C. Next, heated and unheated soils were leached, filtered, and analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, optical properties, molecular size distribution, molecular composition, and disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation following the addition of chlorine. The soils heated to 225 degrees C leached the greatest DOC and had the highest C- andi N-DBP precursor reactivity per unit carbon compared to the unheated material or soils heated to 350 or 500 degrees C. The molecular weight of the soluble compounds decreased with increasing heating temperature. Compared to the unheated soil leachates, all DBP yields were higher for the leachates of soils heated to 225 degrees C. However, only haloacetonitrile yields (mu g/mg(C)) were higher for leachates of the soils heated to 350 degrees C, whereas trihalomethane, haloacetic acid and chloropicrin yields were lower compared to Unheated soil leachates.: Soluble N-containing compounds comprised a high number of molecular formulas for leachates of heated soils, which may explain the higher yield of haloacetonitriles for heated soil leachates. Overall, heating soils altered the quantity, quality, and reactivity, of the WEOM pool. These results May be useful for inferring how thermal alteration of soil by wildfire can affect water quality.

Membranes that have the ability to self-heal would recover their original rejection levels autonomously, bypassing the need for costly integrity monitoring and membrane replacement practices. Herein, we fabricated hydrogel pore-filled membranes via in situ graft polymerization of 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid (AMPS) onto microporous poly(ether sulfone) (PES) substrates and successfully demonstrated their self-healing ability. Covalent attachment of the hydrogel to the substrate was essential for stable membrane performance. The membranes autonomously restore their particle rejection up to 99% from rejection levels as low as 30% after being physically damaged. We attribute the observed self-healing property to swelling of the pore-filling hydrogel into the damage site, strong hydrogen bonding, and molecular interdiffusion. The results of this study show that hydrogel pore-filled membranes are a promising new class of materials for fabricating self-healing membranes.

J	Lobo, GP; Bonilla, CA				Lobo, Gabriel P.; Bonilla, Carlos A.			A modeling approach to determining the relationship between vegetative filter strip design and sediment composition	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Vegetative filter strips (VFS) are areas of either planted or indigenous established vegetation designed to improve the quality of surface runoff. They can be incorporated into pastures, grassed waterways, terraces, or cropland to remove sediment, nitrogen, or phosphorus from runoff. However, their trapping efficiencies depend mainly on the sediment characteristics. The finer soil particles pass through the filter more easily and have more surface area, accounting for most of the transported sediment-bound pollutants. Therefore, the objective of this study was to use a modeling approach to develop a Sediment Composition Vegetative Filter Strip (SCVFS) model to predict the clay, silt and sand trapping efficiencies of VFS based on a wide range of soil loss data from Central Chile. The physically based Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model was implemented using actual soil and climate data from Central Chile to generate a soil loss database for many VFS designs. More than 22,000 erosibn events were generated with data from 28 sites. Three nonlinear relationships were developed between clay, silt and sand delivery and VFS length. The clay and silt models provided accurate estimates compared to WEPP for the calibration (R-2 = 0.80-0.87) and validation (R-2 = 0.73-0.80) sites. However, the sand estimates were not correlated to WEPP (R-2 = 0.00-0.18), as the model computes sand using the difference between the total predicted sediments (R-2 = 0.77-0.89) and the clay and silt estimates. Nevertheless, because most of the sediment-bound pollutants move with the finer sediments, this is not a modeling limitation. Compared to other physically based VFS models, the SCVFS model is remarkably easy to use because it only requires the characteristics of the sediment delivery when there is no filter, the rainfall erosivity and the hillslope and filter lengths. Additionally, it can be easily combined with many existing erosion models that provide daily soil loss estimates, making it a flexible VFS design tool. This study provides the detailed methodology to construct this model and discusses its advantages and limitations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Water quality modeling can contribute to the necessary scientific grounding of coastal management. In this paper, some of the dynamic functions and parameters of nitrogen were calibrated based on coastal field experiments covering the dynamic nitrogen processes in Jiaozhou Bay (JZB), including phytoplankton growth, respiration, and mortality; particulate nitrogen degradation; and dissolved organic nitrogen remineralization. The results of the field experiments and box model simulations showed good agreement (RSD = 20% +/- 2% and SI = 0.77 +/- 0.04). A three-dimensional water quality model of nitrogen (3DWQMN) in JZB was improved and the dynamic parameters were updated according to field experiments.

By quantifying the delta N-15 of the common sea fan Gorgonia ventalina sampled from 30 sites throughout Bermuda we show that sewage-derived nitrogen is detectable on nearshore coral reefs and declines across the lagoon to the outer rim. We also sampled gorgonians from two museum collections representing a 50y time-series (1958-2008). These samples revealed an increase in delta N-15 of >4.0%. until the mid-1970s, after which delta N-15 values slowly declined by similar to 2.05 parts per thousand. A delta N-15 chronology from a gorgonian skeleton exhibited a similar decline over the last 30-40 years of approximately 0.6 parts per thousand. We conclude that policies have been effective in reducing sewage impacts to Bermudian reefs. However, significant sources of sewage pollution persist and are likely have a strong impact on harbor and nearshore coral communities and human health. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The relatively high 813Crom values suggested the input of C-13-depleted terrigenous organic matter was low in Daya Bay. There were significant correlations between delta C-13(POM) values and chlorophyll a concentrations both during summer and winter, suggesting the delta C-13(POM) values were mainly controlled by the phytoplankton biomass in the surface water. The distribution of delta N-15(POM) values was more complicated than that of delta C-13(POM) and displayed low values in the outer bay and the Dan'ao River estuary.

Application to the Spanish coast	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												An atlas of susceptibility to pollution of 320 Spanish marinas is provided. Susceptibility is assessed through a simple, fast and low cost empirical method estimating the flushing capacity of marinas. The Complexity Tidal Range Index (CTRI) was selected among eleven empirical methods. The CTRI method was selected by means of statistical analyses because: it contributes to explain the system's variance; it is highly correlated to numerical model results; and, it is sensitive to marinas' location and typology. The process of implementation to the Spanish coast confirmed its usefulness, versatility and adaptability as a tool for the environmental management of marinas worldwide. The atlas of susceptibility, assessed through CTRI values, is an appropriate instrument to prioritize environmental and planning strategies at a regional scale. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The optimization calculation may become very time consuming when the number of water quality constraint equations is great. A Trial and Error Method (TEM) to remove the redundant points was first introduced through iterative calculations under structure and non-structure model grids. The TEM was applied for the TPLA in the Bohai Sea in China. The calculation time was reduced to about 2 min under the condition that 103,433 model grids met the water quality standards. In the best case, the optimization efficiency was improved by 98.9%. The allocation results showed that approximately 90% of total nitrogen (TN) load should be reduced in the 56 pollution sources around the Bohai Sea; of these values, roughly 85% of the reduction could come from 10 pollution sources.

A regional-scale predictive model for the Great Barrier Reef, Australia	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												A spatial risk assessment model is developed for the Great Barrier Reef (GBR, Australia) that helps identify reef locations at higher or lower risk of coral bleaching in summer heat-wave conditions. The model confirms the considerable benefit of discriminating nutrient-enriched areas that contain corals with enlarged (suboptimal) symbiont densities for the purpose of identifying bleaching-sensitive reef locations. The benefit of the new system level understanding is showcased in terms of: (i) improving early-warning forecasts of summer bleaching risk, (ii) explaining historical bleaching patterns, (iii) testing the bleaching-resistant quality of the current marine protected area (MPA) network (iv) identifying routinely monitored coral health attributes, such as the tissue energy reserves and skeletal growth characteristics (viz. density and extension rates) that correlate with bleaching resistant reef locations, and (v) targeting region-specific water quality improvement strategies that may increase reef-scale coral health and bleaching resistance.

Association of groundwater constituents with topography and distance to unconventional gas wells in NE Pennsylvania	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Recently we reported an association of certain diseases with unconventional gas development (UGD). The purpose of this study is to examine UGD's possible impacts on groundwater quality in northeastern Pennsylvania. In this study, we compared our groundwater data (Columbia 58 samples) with those published data from Cabot (1701 samples) and Duke University (150 samples). For each dataset, proportions of samples with elevated levels of dissolved constituents were compared among four groups, identified as upland far (i.e. >= 1 km to the nearest UGD gas well), upland near (<1 km), valley far (>= 1 km), and valley near (<1 km) groups. The Columbia data do not show statistically significant differences among the 4 groups, probably due to the limited number of samples. In Duke samples, Ca and CI levels are significantly higher in the valley near group than in the valley far group. In the Cabot dataset, methane, Na, and Mn levels are significantly higher in valley far samples than in upland far samples. In valley samples, Ca, CI, SO4, and Fe are significantly higher in the near group (i.e. <1 km) than in the far group. The association of these constituents in valley groundwater with distance is observed for the first time using a large industry dataset. The increase may be caused by enhanced mixing of shallow and deep groundwater in valley, possibly triggered by UGD process. If persistent, these changes indicate, potential for further impact on groundwater quality. Therefore, there is an urgent need to conduct more studies to investigate effects of UGD on water quality and possible health outcomes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Models were developed using Random Forest and 26 predictor variables (19 predictors to model macroinvertebrate indices and 22 predictors to model the fish index). Predictor variables were related with different environmental characteristics (water quality, physical habitat characteristics, hydrology, topography, geology and human pressures). The importance and effect of predictors on the 4 biotic indices was evaluated with the IncNodePurity index and partial dependence plots, respectively. Results indicated that the spatial variability of macroinvertebrate and fish indices were mostly dependent on the same environmental variables. They decreased in river reaches affected by high mean annual nitrate concentration (>4 mg/l) and temperature (>12 degrees C), with low flow water velocity (<0.4 m/s) and aquatic plant communities being dominated by macrophytes. These indices were higher in the Atlantic region than in the Mediterranean. This study provides a continuous image of river biological communities used as indicators, which turns very useful to identify the main sources of change in the ecological status of water bodies and assist both, the integrated catchment management and the identification of river reaches for recovery.

J	Morling, K; Herzsprung, P; Kamjunke, N				Morling, Karoline; Herzsprung, Peter; Kamjunke, Norbert			Discharge determines production of, decomposition of and quality changes in dissolved organic carbon in pre-dams of drinking water reservoirs	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Pre-dams are small reservoirs constructed upstream of the main drinking water reservoirs and are used for nutrient removal and sediment trapping. Little is known about the role of pre-dams regarding the production and decomposition of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in relation to discharge and how this affects the quality of DOC in the water. We combined quantitative and qualitative investigations under different hydrological conditions at three pre-dams exhibiting a gradient from oligotrophic/high-DOC to eutrophic/low-DOC. All pre-dams were mainly autotrophic in their upper water layers. The ratio of OC production to total gained OC (i.e. OC import + OC production) decreased with increasing discharge. On average, 0-30% of the total gained OC was produced within the pre-dams. The amount of microbially decomposed DOC increased with the average water residence time (WRT) and with the trophic status of the pre-dams. Radiocarbon analyses of respired CO2 revealed that heterotrophic bacteria preferentially utilized old DOC components (195-395 years before present) under base flow conditions, whereas younger components (modern, i.e. OC produced after 1950) were utilized at high discharge. DOC quality changed significantly over the year within the pre-dams: High proportions of algae-derived DOC were observed during base flow in summer, and the freshness index (beta/alpha ratio) decreased significantly with higher discharges. DOC production and quality changes in response to hydrological conditions should be considered for future water quality management in reservoirs, as climate scenarios for temperate regions predict decreased runoffs leading to longer WRT and increased eutrophication and production of algae derived OC.

DOM is a mixture of diverse components, so a range of organic molecules potentially participates in the occurrence of dissolved trace metals. In this study, we investigated water quality variables that influence dissolved trace metal concentrations in natural and effluent water systems with a particular attention given to the relationship between DOM optical properties and dissolved copper and iron concentrations. We found that specific UV absorbance (SUVA(254): an indicator of DOM aromaticity) has a significant correlation with dissolved trace metal to dissolved organic carbon concentration ratios ([Me](T)/[DOC]) for copper and iron in natural freshwaters and treated municipal wastewater in the Sagami River basin, Japan. This trend was also prevalent for other freshwaters in temperate climates except for Fe-rich waters. Our findings indicate that the concentrations of dissolved copper and iron in natural and effluent waters are significantly influenced not only by DOM concentration, but also by aromaticity of DOM, and that this DOM property can be inferred from spectrophotometric measurements.

Three-dimensional model to capture the fate and transport of combined sewer overflow discharges: A case study in the Chicago Area Waterway System	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												We used a numerical model to analyze the impact of combined sewer overflows (CSOs) in the hydrodynamics and water quality of the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS). We coupled the Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC) with the Water Quality Analysis Simulation Program (WASP) to perform threedimensional simulations of the hydrodynamics and water quality in CAWS. The analysis was performed for two different storms: (i) May 6, 2009 representing a 6-hour duration 4-month return period, and (ii) September 12, 2008 representing a 48-hour duration 100-year return period. Results from the simulations show distinct differences between the two storms. During the May 2009 storm there was only one major CSO pumping event with negligible impact on the water quality of CAWS. During the September 2008 storm there were several CSOs that impacted the hydrodynamics and water quality of CAWS. In particular, CSOs during the September 2008 event induced a reversal flow in CAWS, with a plume of constituents that traveled in the opposite direction as water does under normal conditions. However, the simulation results show that CSOs events in CAWS take place during periods of high rainfall, thus the discharge of CSOs is significantly diluted along the CAWS. As a result, the concentrations of organic matter and inorganic nutrients observed at the downstream boundary in CAWS were significantly lower than those recorded at the CSOs outfalls and are within the limits established in the regulation for regular effluents. These results suggest that even during storms events with significant CSOs into the CAWS there is a significant dilution that reduce the impact in the water quality at the system boundaries.

Eurasian beaver activity increases water storage, attenuates flow and mitigates diffuse pollution from intensively-managed grasslands	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Beavers are the archetypal keystone species, which can profoundly alter ecosystem structure and function through their ecosystem engineering activity, most notably the building of dams. This can have a major impact upon water resource management, flow regimes and water quality. Previous research has predominantly focused on the activities of North American beaver (Castor canadensis) located in very different environments, to the intensive lowland agricultural landscapes of the United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe. Two Eurasian beavers (Castor fiber) were introduced to a wooded site, situated on a first order tributary, draining from intensively managed grassland. The site was monitored to understand impacts upon water storage, flow regimes and water quality. Results indicated that beaver activity, primarily via the creation of 13 dams, has increased water storage within the site (holding ca. 1000 m(3) in beaver ponds) and beavers were likely to have had a significant flow attenuation impact, as determined from peak discharges (mean 30 +/- 19% reduction), total discharges (mean 34 +/- 9% reduction) and peak rainfall to peak discharge lag times (mean 29 +/- 21% increase) during storm events. Event monitoring of water entering and leaving the site showed lower concentrations of suspended sediment, nitrogen and phosphate leaving the site (e.g. for suspended sediment; average entering site: 112 +/- 72 mgl(-1), average leaving site: 39 +/- 37 mgl(-1)). Combined with attenuated flows, this resulted in lower diffuse pollutant loads in water downstream. Conversely, dissolved organic carbon concentrations and loads downstream were higher. These observed changes are argued to be directly attributable to beaver activity at the site which has created a diverse wetland environment, reducing downstream hydrological connectivity. Results have important implications for beaver reintroduction programs which may provide nature based solutions to the catchment-scale water resource management issues that are faced in agricultural landscapes.

The objective of this study was to examine the impact of climate and land-use change on the hydrological regime and nutrient yield from the 3S River Basin (Sekong, Srepok, and Sesan) into the 3S River system in Southeast Asia. The 3S Rivers are important tributaries of the Lower Mekong River, accounting for 16% of its annual flow. This transboundary basin supports the livelihoods of nearly 3.5 million people in the countries of Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia. To reach a better understanding of the process and fate of pollution (nutrient yield) as well as the hydrological regime, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to simulate water quality and discharge in the 3S River Basin. Future scenarios were developed for three future periods: 2030s (2015-2039), 2060s (2045-2069), and 2090s (2075-2099), using an ensemble of five GCMs (General Circulation Model) simulations: (HadGEM2-AO, CanESM2, IPSL-CM5A-LR, CNRM-CM5, and MPI-ESM-MR), driven by the climate projection for RCPs (Representative Concentration Pathways): RCP4.5 (medium emission) and RCP8.5 (high emission) scenarios, and two land-use change scenarios. The results indicated that the climate in the study area would generally become warmer and wetter under both emission scenarios. Discharge and nutrient yield is predicted to increase in the wet season and decrease in the dry. Overall, the annual discharge and nutrient yield is projected to increase throughout the twenty-first century, suggesting sensitivity in the 3S River Basin to climate and land-use change.The results of this study can assist water resources managers and planners in developing water management strategies for uncertain climate change scenarios in the 3S River Basin.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the risk to human health from ingestion of As, Ba, Co, Cu, Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb, Se and Ni present in soil, sterile and mineralized waste, and water and plants at a gold mine in Serra Pelada, Para, Brazil. Samples of soil, sterile and mineralized waste, water and plants were collected around an artisanal gold mine located in Serra Pelada. The mean concentrations of potentially toxic elements in the soil were higher than the soil quality reference values as defined in the legislation, which may be attributeable to past mining activities. Water from the area close to the mine exhibited As, Ba and Pb concentrations exceeding the reference values established by the World Health Organization, deemed unfit for human consumption. Plants exhibited high Pb concentrations, representing a food safety risk to the population. The mean hazard index (HI) values were below the acceptable limit (1.0) established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, although the highest HI values observed for adults and children were higher than the respective acceptable limits. Environmental contamination and risk to human health were heterogeneous in the surroundings of the mine. Mitigation strategies need to be adopted to decrease the risks of contamination to the environment and to the local population. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Supply-side and demand-side management is a core strategy to address this water shortage. Under this strategy, reclaimed water, which the Canadian public is willing to use for non-potable purposes, is an option. However, no universal guidelines exist for reclaimed water use. Despite the federal government's long-term goal to develop guidelines for many water reuse applications, guidelines have only been prescribed for reclaimed water use in toilet and urinal flushing in Canada. At the provincial level, British Columbia (BC) has promulgated guidelines for wide applications of reclaimed water but only at broad class levels. This research has investigated and proposed probabilistic risk-based recommended values for microbial quality of reclaimed water in various non-potable urban reuses. The health risk was estimated by using quantitative microbial risk assessment. Two-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations were used in the analysis to include variability and uncertainty in input data. The proposed recommended values are based on the indicator organism E. coli. The required treatment levels for reuse were also estimated. In addition, the recommended values were successfully applied to three wastewater treatment effluents in the Okanagan Valley, BC, Canada. The health risks associated with other bacterial pathogens (Campylobacter jejuni and Salmonella spp.), virus (adenovirus, norovirus, and rotavirus), and protozoa (Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia spp.), were also estimated. The estimated risks indicate the effectiveness of the E. coil-based water quality recommended values. Sensitivity analysis shows the pathogenic E. coli ratio and morbidity are the most sensitive input parameters for all water reuses. The proposed recommended values could be further improved by using national or regional data on water exposures, disease burden per case, and the susceptibility fraction of population.

A spatial model to improve site selection for seagrass restoration in shallow boating environments	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Due to widespread and continuing seagrass loss, restoration attempts occur worldwide. This article presents a geospatial modeling technique that ranks the suitability of sites for restoration based on light availability and boating activity, two factors cited in global studies of seagrass loss and restoration failures. The model presented here was created for Estero Bay, Florida and is a predictive model of light availability and boating pressure to aid seagrass restoration efforts. The model is adaptive and can be parameterized for different locations and updated as additional data is collected and knowledge of how factors impact seagrass improves. Light data used for model development were collected over one year from 50 sites throughout the bay. Coupled with high resolution bathymetric data, bottom mean light availability was predicted throughout the bay. Data collection throughout the year also allowed for prediction of light variability at sites, a possible indicator of seagrass growth and survival. Additionally, survey data on boating activities were used to identify areas, outside of marked navigation channels, that receive substantial boating pressure and are likely poor candidate sites for seagrass restoration. The final map product identifies areas where the light environment was suitable for seagrasses and boating pressure was low. A composite map showing the persistence of seagrass coverage in the study area over four years, between 1999 and 2006, was used to validate the model. Eighty-nine percent of the area where seagrass persisted (had been mapped all four years) was ranked as suitable for restoration: 42% with the highest rank (7), 28% with a rank of 6, and 19% with a rank of 5. The results show that the model is a viable tool for selection of seagrass restoration sites in Florida and elsewhere. With knowledge of the light environment and boating patterns, managers will be better equipped to set seagrass restoration and water quality improvement targets and select sites for restoration. The modeling approach outlined here is, broadly applicable and will be of value to a large and diverse suite of scientists and marine resource managers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This research attempts to treat biologically treated palm oil mill effluent final discharge using steam activated oil palm mesocarp fiber bioadsorbent without the use of chemicals as activating agents. Oil palm mesocarp fiber was carbonised at 600 degrees C for 30 min and later activated using steam at same temperature for another 30 min. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of the bioadsorbent was found to be 494 m(2)/g. Bioadsorbent produced was then used to treat biologically treated palm oil mill final discharge by mixing both bioadsorbent and the wastewater into a conical flask and shaken at 150 rpm for 24 h. At 10 g/L dosage, the bioadsorbent reduced the chemical oxygen demand and suspended solid of biologically treated palm oil mill effluent final discharge from 395 mg/L and 117 mg/L down to 303 mg/L and 14 mg/L, respectively. Consecutive treatments at 10 g/L dosage resulted in higher removal of the chemical oxygen demand and suspended solids up to 122 mg/L and 7 mg/L, respectively, which meets the river water quality, making the final wastewater suitable as recycled water for the zero-emission system in the palm oil mill.

Transport and transformation of nutrients and sediment in two agricultural watersheds in Northeast Arkansas	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Understanding pollutant transport at different spatial and temporal scales is crucial to agroecosystems management and planning. This study aimed to reduce the knowledge gap between edge-of-field and larger agricultural watersheds. Nutrients and sediment transport and transformation at two small agricultural watersheds, Little River Ditches Basin (LRDB) and Lower St. Francis Basin (LSFB), in Northeast Arkansas, were evaluated. Flow, nutrients, and sediment were measured at 3-5 instream locations in these two contrasting watersheds. These watersheds differed in primary crop, soil type, and size. Differences in sediment and nutrients loads were measured between the two watersheds primarily due to differences in cropping practices and soil type. LSFB was dominated by rice farms and had more pollutant load per unit area but lower concentrations for all measured parameters except nitrate, whereas LRDB was dominated by cotton farms and had less pollutant load per unit area but higher concentrations. Turbidity increased considerably at LSFB, but it did not increase or decrease at LRDB as water traveled downstream. The median nitrate-N concentration at LRDB increased from 1.64 to 2.34 mg L-1 as watershed size increased, in contrast to no increase at LSFB. Total phosphorus (TP) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentrations remained constant, but ammonium-N decreased as the water traveled downstream in both watersheds. Nitrate-N were high in spring and late fall at both watersheds. The annual loss of nitrate-N was 9.6 and 8.6 kg ha(-1), sediment was 1604 and 1958 kg ha(-1), and SRP was 0.8 and 0.9 kg ha(-1), respectively from LRDB and LSFB. Source control in spring and late fall could be more effective in reducing agricultural pollution.

Agricultural land use and macroinvertebrate assemblages in lowland temporary streams of the Willamette Valley, Oregon, USA	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Streams that dry during part of the year are common throughout the world, yet studies of the macroinvertebrate assemblages in these types of streams are rare compared to those in permanent streams; and studies that assess the effects of agriculture on temporary stream invertebrates are even rarer. We studied macroinvertebrate assemblages in lowland temporary streams of a region with high agricultural land use, the southern Willamette Valley, Oregon, USA. Overall assemblages were dominated by non-insects, and invertebrates tolerant of organic pollution. Nonetheless, these invertebrates displayed adaptations to life in temporary habitats, and as such they may be unique to temporary streams and seasonal wetlands, providing an important addition to regional biodiversity. Stream invertebrates are also important as a prey base for native fish and amphibians using these channels. Benthic invertebrate densities were higher at sites with slower water and more in-stream vegetation; to a lesser degree greater agricultural land use was associated with lower densities. Taxon richness was also negatively affected by agriculture, but this was most evident when least disturbed and highly agricultural sites were compared. Sites in watersheds with a lower proportion of their area under agriculture (mostly west of the Willamette River) had a variety of taxa in disturbance-sensitive insect orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT), plus flies in the family Simuliidae present. In addition, they had greater relative abundances of 2 types of flies in the family Chironomidae. In contrast, sites in watersheds with high agricultural land use (mainly east of the Willamette River) had greater relative abundances of non insects, including ostracods, nematodes, and oligochaete worms. In highly agricultural watersheds, when stream-bottom vegetation was abundant, it was associated with greater benthic invertebrate density, but not with higher taxon richness. Our results suggest that increasing stream-bottom vegetation could be useful when food is limiting for native vertebrates. On the other hand, reduced agricultural land use allows for the development of more diverse benthic invertebrate assemblages. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Time lag may therefore, impede the achievement of remediation deadlines such as those described in the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD). Omitting time lag from catchment characterisation renders evaluation of management practices impossible. Time lag aside, regulators at national scale can only manage the expectations of policy makers at larger scales (e.g. European Union) by demonstrating positive nutrient trajectories in catchments failing to achieve at least 'good' status. Presently, a flexible tool for developing spatial and temporal estimates of trends in water quality/nutrient transport and time lags is not available. The objectives of the present study were first to develop such a flexible, parsimonious framework incorporating existing soil maps, meteorological data and a structured modelling approach, and to secondly, to demonstrate its use in a grassland and an arable catchment (similar to 10 km(2)) in Ireland, assuming full implementation of measures in 2012. Data pertaining to solute transport (meteorology, soil hydraulics, depth of profile and boundary conditions) were collected for both catchments. Low complexity textural data alone gave comparable estimates of nutrient trajectories and time lags but with no spatial or soil series information. Taking a high complexity approach, coupling high resolution soil mapping (1:10,000) with national scale (1:25,000) representative profile datasets to <5 m depth, indicated trends in nutrient transport of 10-12 months and 13-17 months throughout the grassland and arable catchments, respectively. For the same conditions, regulators relying on data from groundwater sampling to test the efficacy of the present measures would be delayed by 61-76 months and 46-79 months, respectively. Variation in meteorological datasets enabled temporal analysis of the trends in nutrient transport and time lag estimates. Such a tool could help catchment scientists to better characterise and manage catchments, determine locations for monitoring or mitigation, assess the efficacy of current measures, and ultimately, advise policy makers and regulators.

The results based on the data on fauna and flora gathered before (in 2003, T+0) and after (in T+2, T+6 and T+11) the reclamation showed that the river canalization and oxbow lake dredging can significantly disturb the ecology of water bodies adjacent to the river. Observations of the oxbow lake (OLS5), showed the decrease in the number of macrophyte phytocenoses from 11 before the dredging to 6 very valuable Potametea phytocenoses, after wards. The development of common pleustonic phytocenoses of Lemnetea minoris and the massive development of green algae resulted from the bottom sediment removal. In the case of population, Stratiotes aloides was rebuilt after elimination during dredging already in T+2. Before hydrotechnical works, the oxbow lake was characterized by 12 invertebrate taxa inhabiting S. aloides, whereas only 9 were found first period after the dredging, 15 taxa in second period and 23 in a recent study. During both observation periods, dominated by Chironomidae larvae (T+0), Trichoptera larvae (T+2 and T+6) and again Chironomidae larvae (T+11). The hydrotechnical activities significantly altered in the first period the structure of fauna and flora inhabiting the water body. Such radical interference in natural values of oxbow lakes is un-suitable for the preservation of ecosystems due to the significant decrease in their biodiversity. Achieved on a similar or higher level of macrophytes diversity and epiphytic invertebrates was noticeable ten years after the dredging of a water body.																	2267-1242						2017	17								UNSP 00005	10.1051/e3sconf/20171700005								WOS:000437167900005

The authors analyzed anaerobic co-digestion of sludge from both water treatment plant and sewage treatment plant. Water sludge is produced during coagulation, ozonation and backwashing of rapid anthracite filters. Its characteristic and properties depend on a raw water quality, treatment methods as well as types of chemicals used and their doses. According to the Polish Act of 4 December 2012 (Journal of Laws from 2013, item 21) the water sludge should be treated as hazardous waste. An alternative way to dispose water sludge and reduce its volume may be sludge reuse. The authors suggested a research methodology and analyzed the preliminary results, which showed that co-digestion of sewage and water sludge enhanced biogas production. The authors assume that the results of the study will provide a basis for development of methodology for sludge control and disposal.																	2267-1242						2017	17								UNSP 00025	10.1051/e3sconf/20171700025								WOS:000437167900025

The protective cement linings are also commonly used for old water pipe renovation. In both cases, the cement lining is an excellent anticorrosion protection of the pipelines, effectively separating the pipe wall from the flowing water. Moreover, cement linings protect the pipelines not only by a mechanical barrier, but also by a chemical barrier creating a highly alkaline environment in water contact with the metal pipe wall. In addition, cement coatings have an ability for so-called self-regeneration and provide the improvement of hydraulic conditions inside the pipelines. In turn, the differences between the analysed cement coatings mainly depend on the types of cements used and techniques of cement mortar spraying. As was expected, they influence the quality of water having contact with the coating. A comparison of the impact of cement coatings manufactured in factories and sprayed on building sites during the renovation on drinking water quality parameters was performed in the study. The experiments were conducted in laboratory conditions, using the test stands prepared for this purpose. The results include analysis of selected water quality parameters for the samples contacting with cement mortar and collected during the investigation.																	2267-1242						2017	17								UNSP 00061	10.1051/e3sconf/20171700061								WOS:000437167900061

This approach make possible to reduce number of performed laboratory analyzes, used for the efficient controlling of water purification process.

This is associated with the imperfection of purification processes, or secondary water pollution. Not only it results in the deterioration of water quality parameters, but it also increases threat of epidemiological problems. The water that is biologically unstable creates ideal conditions for colonization of the microorganisms to the inner surface of pipelines which may form biofilm. The key issue, enabling prevention and control of the impact of the development of biofilms, is to assess the biodiversity of microbiocenosis. In order to obtain comprehensive characteristics of microorganisms communities on a particular substrate, it is necessary to combine several techniques. Further analysis using molecular biology methods are usually after traditional methods of assessing the microbiological quality of water. Standard methods do not reflect the actual species composition, because they are targeted at the bacteria that can be isolated and cultured in the laboratory. Conventional methods are capable of detecting less than 10% of the organisms in the sample. In order to study the biodiversity of organisms inhabiting a biofilm (apart from the conventional methods) analyses of the diversity of nucleic acids should be used. The first method could be the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Another way may be fluorescence in situ hybridization, which allows to detect determined DNA sequence using specially labeled oligonucleotide probes. Visualization of the material is performed using a fluorescence microscope. The main purpose of this article is to present rapid and precise identification groups of microorganisms in their natural habitat in biofilm using fluorescent in situ hybridization method (FISH). FISH method can be successfully used to visualize these microorganisms, which show difficulties in culturing, as well as to provide knowledge on the phylogenetic structure in different habitats. FISH technique allows the quantitative description of environmental samples.																	2267-1242						2017	17								UNSP 00098	10.1051/e3sconf/20171700098								WOS:000437167900098

This study assesses the effects of episodic rainfall in a Carboniferous headwater catchment contaminated by historical Pb and Zn mining. Comprehensive hourly water chemistry measurements combined with modelling using PHREEQC, WHAM/Model VII and WHAM-F-TOX were used in this assessment. For the episodic event, we measured flow increases from a baseline of 0.05 to 2.12 m(3) s(-1) at peak flow. Changes in metal concentration were most marked for ephemeral tributary, with Pb increasing from a baseline concentration of 55 mu g L-1 to a peak of 576 mu g L-1. Behaviour for Pb showed great affinity to form organic complexes or hind to colloidal Al and Fe oxides, whereas for Zn and the tributary flowing subsurface a more complex behaviour was observed. For example, the dissolution of secondary metal carbonate minerals (e.g. smithsonite (ZnCO3)) is likely constrained by higher concentrations of carbonate and bicarbonate derived from increased bedrock weathering under flow conditions induced by episodic rainfall. The abundance of secondary mineral sources and circumneutral pit present during episodic rainfall are important factors controlling the mobilisation of Pb and Zn. Furthermore, episodic rainfall events could enhance metal toxicity but there are aggravating and mitigating factors that depend on site-specific chemical changes. Overall, this study highlighted the complexity of metal mobility and toxicity during these events.

The evaluation was performed to two different subsurface reflectance: Lee et al.'s and Maritonia et al.'s radiative transfer model. As a result, in the case of simple Maritonia et al.'s reflectance model, it shows that the effect of the water column is removable. However, if the actual just above surface reflectance is as more complex as Lee et al.'s model, then the Lyzenga's water column method could reduce the effect of water attenuation but not removed. In fact, based on the mathematical presentation of Lyzenga's model on simulation reflectance formula the effect of depth and water attenuation are in multiplication function. Thus, even after the correction, the water column attenuation effect stillremain.																	1755-1307						2017	47								012018	10.1088/1755-1315/47/1/012018								WOS:000426771600018

The scope of the analyses are water quality monitoring data of the Tisa River at tree measuring points along its flow through Serbia: Martonos, Novi Becej and Titel in period 2004-2014. The analyses encompassed conductivity, dissolved oxygen, BOD5, COD, nitrates and total phosphorus. Assessment of water quality has been conducted by the application of contemporary classifications and criteria of the Republic of Serbia. Reference conditions for achieving excellent ecological status, I class of water quality are achieved for conductivity, dissolved oxygen, along investigated section (measuring points: Martonos, Novi Becej and Titel) and BOD5 at the measuring point Martonos. Downstream at measuring points Novi Becej and Titel for BOD5 water quality belongs to class II. According to concentrations of COD, nitrates and total phosphorus water quality belongs exclusively to class II. Linear regression analyses was applied for determining trend lines of parameters, while Mann-Kendell test in most cases (14/18), i.e. 78%, has confirmed nonexistence of significant trend. Water quality during the past decade is stable. A statistically significant trend was confirmed in 4 cases: nitrates (measuring point Martonos, descending trend), BOD5 and total phosphorus (measuring point Novi Becej, descending trend), and dissolved oxygen (measuring point Titel, increasing trend). Signs of these trends speak in favor of future improvement of water quality of the Tisa River in Serbia.

During the years 2011-2013, samples of treated wastewater and water from the river were collected (upstream and downstream of the wastewater discharge point) and subjected to physicochemical analysis and, in 2013, also to microbiological analysis. The study showed that the treated wastewater outflowing from the treatment plant did not have any negative influence on the quality of the water in the receiver. Water from the Urzedowka River met clarity standards for class I waters; only the concentrations of total phosphorus and nitrate nitrogen exceeded the limit values for water clarity class II. The studies have shown that waters from the Urzedowka River upstream of the treatment plant contained a huge concentration of E. coli bacteria, fecal coliform bacteria and fecal enterococci, which indicates the impact of other sources of microbiological pollution.																	1506-218X						2017	19						370	393										WOS:000423417800020						
J	Ciosmak, M; Grzywna, A; Bochniak, A				Ciosmak, Malgorzata; Grzywna, Antoni; Bochniak, Andrzej			The Effect of Hard Coal Mine Drainage Water on the Quality of Surface and Ground Waters	ROCZNIK OCHRONA SRODOWISKA												The effect of mining waters on the physical and chemical properties of surface and ground waters was evaluated in 2014 and 2015 within the Lublin Coal Basin. Samples of water for physicochemical analyses were taken twice a year. Water was sampled from piezometers, wells, drainage ditches and from the river Swinka. The following parameters were analyzed: pH, conductivity, dissolved substances, general hardness, calcium, magnesium, sodium, nitrates, sulphates and chlorides. The examined indicators were subjected to Friedman's nonparametric univariate analysis (ANOVA) for measurements repeated using the Statistica software. The tests and analysis of water and sewage management make it possible to evaluate the physicochemical parameters of waters within the mining area in the Lublin Coal Basin. The best measure of the intensity of parameter changes can be the response of the surface water environment to contact with mining waters. Underground waters featured low values of chemical indicators. Drinking water drawn from wells in all cases was classified as quality class I. Ground waters sampled from piezometers were most often classified as quality class II. The value of maximum conductivity did not exceed 2500 mu S.cm(-1), while that of dissolved substances, 1500 mg.dm(-3). Only with regard to the content of calcium and chlorides were some cases of water quality class III recorded. The maximum value for calcium was 2500 mg Ca+.dm(-3), while for chlorides this was 300 mg Cl.dm(3). Water in the river featured parameter values similar to those recorded for underground water. Therefore, it could be included in quality class II (the limit value for conductivity is 2000 mu S.cm(-1), for dissolved substances 1000 mg.dm(-3)). The situation was different for water sampled from ditches. Here, water quality indicators were even three times higher than in the river. In this case the limit values for quality class II were exceeded. Such limit values are not determined for other classes. Can observe changes in the examined parameters describing the quality of river Swinka waters, it must be stressed that the significant increase in mining activity had no effect whatsoever on its water quality. The increase in chemical concentrations in mine waters drained to the river are not that high so as to cause irreversible changes in this ecosystem. This is proved by a fast return of water quality in the river to the pre-drainage condition. Comparing their current state to the beginning of mining activity, the majority of mine water indicators show stability. The observed single increases in concentrations do not remain fixed. Waters taken from the piezometers, the well and the river were classified as second water quality, while the waters from the land improvement ditches did not meet these criteria. The highest quality was observed for groundwater which is often classified as Type I water quality. This means that the aquifers provide good insulation and are not affected by the Bogdanka mine's activity.																	1506-218X						2017	19						411	422										WOS:000423417800022						
J	Grzywna, A; Sender, J; Bronowicka-Mielniczuk, U				Grzywna, Antoni; Sender, Joanna; Bronowicka-Mielniczuk, Urszula			Analysis of the Ecological Status of Surface Waters in the Region of the Lublin Conurbation	ROCZNIK OCHRONA SRODOWISKA												The paper presents the results of surveys into the ecological status of rivers in the region of Lublin. Biological and chemical elements were analysed between 2012-2014. Analyses were carried out at the following 8 checkpoints on the rivers. The following chemical and biological indicators were determined in water samples. The obtained results were processed by statistical methods including determining the differentiation of water quality indicators as regards the checkpoint (measuring site) and the year of measurement. To this end, methods of descriptive statistics were used, including box-plots. The data was analysed using Statistica software. The analysed river waters were characterised by very low content of ammonia nitrogen below 0.4 mg N-NH4/1, total nitrogen below 5 mg N.dm(-3) and conductivity below 600 uS/cm. These values are characteristic of class I water purity. The content of Kjeldahl nitrogen within the range of 1-2 mg N.dm(-3), phosphates within the range 0.2-0.4 mg PO4.m(-3), nitrate nitrogen 2-5 mg N-NO3.dm(-3) and phosphorus 0.2-0.4 mg P.dm(-3) makes the analysed waters eligible for purity class II. Sometimes the content of phosphates in the region of Lublin exceeds the limit value for class II 0.4 mg PO4.dm(-3). BOD5 in lake Zalew Zemborzycki continuously exceeded the limit value for class II 6 mg O-2.dm(-3). The results were considerably worse for biological indicators. For MIR the index was 37-41, which made the waters eligible for purity class II. At some checkpoints located within the limits of Lublin city the value of the index lower than 37 made the water eligible for purity class III. For IO the index most often ranged from 0.3 to 0.4, which corresponds to class III water purity. A decrease in the index below 0.3 in Ciemicga and Czechowka rivers made the water eligible for purity class IV. The main reason for the poor ecological status of water was a high content of phosphates and a low diatom index. The largest variability in the value of the index was characteristic of the analysed watercourses for nitrate nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen and oxygen level. The watercourses are not very wide (1-3 m) and not very deep (0.2-1.0 m), they have a low flow and their beds are modified (profiled bed, concrete slabs). Watercourses located outside the city are characterised by moderate ecological potential (quality class III), whereas watercourses in Lublin are characterised by insufficient ecological potential (quality class IV). Anova analysis showed a significant variability in values between checkpoints, which is not applicable to MIR only. In most cases, no significant variability in the values of indicators was recorded between years at respective checkpoints, which is not applicable to phosphates and total phosphorus.																	1506-218X						2017	19						439	450										WOS:000423417800024

However, that the new deposit found its place in water technology, should start research to determine its usefulness in the process of filtration. The aim of this study was to analyzed and evaluated the effectiveness of filtration two unknown, porous filter masses. Therefore, it was examined the behavior of filter bed by filtration in the laboratory, to assess the efficiency of removal of particular contaminants from the water. Chemical indicators were examined in the model water flowing through the mass, such as: pH, electrolytic conductivity, CODMn, dry residue, chloride concentration, ammonium concentration, nitrate (V) concentration, total hardness, iron and manganese concentration. It has been proved that the bed X-1, which has an less equivalent particle diameter, efficiently removed contaminants from the water compared to filter bed X-2. Filter beds X-1 and X-2 does not purify the water to the value of the regulation of the minister of health. The parameters have exceeded values after filtration are: iron concentration, ammonia concentration, manganese concentration and CODMn. It is concluded that probably gave to the second stage of a two-stage filtration.																	1506-218X						2017	19						540	556										WOS:000423417800031

At many streams the outlets of urban drainage systems are also located, contributing to the pollution discharged with the runoff directly to the streams. In retention tanks built on urban streams for flooding protection needs, sedimentation of total suspended solids takes place. Along with the suspended solid also the pollutants adsorbed on solid particle surfaces, including heavy metals, accumulate in the sediments. The main source of heavy metals is urban traffic (spills fuel and automotive fluids, tire wear, brake pads, attrition of the road surface), but metals are also washed out from the roofs surfaces, deposited with dust etc. Assessment of heavy metals concentration is important for future methods of sediments disposal. Sediments deposited in the reservoirs are a very good indicrato of water quality, aquatic ecosystem and also a proper track record of antropogenic. In the article concentrations of four heavy metals: zinc, copper, lead and cadmium was analysed in water and sediment samples collected from five retention tanks along Oliwski Stream. Oliwski Stream is one of the longests streams in gdansk. It flows through the Valley of Joy, Oliwa Park, Zabianka and outflows directly to the Gulf of Gdansk near the popular beach and bathing place in Jelitkowo. Concentrations of zinc, copper and cadmium in water samples were low. In case of lead the admissible mean annual concentrations were exceeded in three locations. Metals concentrations in collected sediment samples were on different levels depending on retention tank and some characteristics of its watershed. Concentrations of zinc varied from 27 to 130 mg/kg d.m., copper from 2,3 do 89 mg/kg d.m, and lead from 7 to 50 mg/kg d.m. The highest concentrations of copper were measured in the bottom sediments from retention tank Grunwaldzka situated in the district old Oliwa, whith relatively high numer of copper roofs. In order to facilitate the quality assessment, concentrations of heavy metals were compared to the geochemical criteria proposed by Polish Geological Insitute and to the German sediment classification LAWA (Lander- Arbeitsge-meinschaft Wasser) from 1998. The concentrations of zinc, lead and cadmium-were on low level, comparing with both classifications. The concentrations of cadmium did not exceed the level of geochemical background, according to Polish Geological Insitute. In case of copper the moderate level of pollution was observed.

We carried out a detailed study on observed and modelled future changes of total organic carbon (TOC) in this large lake catchment (26 459 km(2)), and assessed the implications for current water treatment processes. Concentrations of TOC/CODMn in the lake and its sub-catchments increased during the period 2000-2014 (CODMn was used as a TOC proxy in the statistical analysis because of long-term data availability). Stepwise multiple regression analysis on the relationships between CODMn, water quality parameters, air temperature and runoff in selected 18 catchments indicated that the explaining variables are site-specific and that the observed recent changes are mainly due to a combination of the simultaneously interacting factors of climate and atmospheric deposition. Linear regression analysis revealed no relationships between CODMn increases and land-use related factors or specific catchment characteristics. A catchment-scale dynamic model system (VEMALA) was used to predict future concentrations and fluxes of TOC, using three different climate change scenarios. TOC concentrations were predicted to decrease by 19% in the Dry scenario and increase by 13% in the Wet scenario by the end of the century. The current treatment processes in the city of Helsinki can likely meet the challenges set by climate change in form of changed raw water TOC and quality. Integrated carbon (C) balance calculations indicated large changes in future C fluxes and lake retention time. These changes would markedly affect several key ecosystem processes such as transport of organically bound nutrients to sea areas and the importance of surface waters in the overall landscape C budgets.																	1239-6095	1797-2469					2017	22						317	336										WOS:000425997300001

However, so far not much has been known about the climatic characteristics of thunderstorm distribution and intensity in the country, and how these have changed with changing climate. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyse the spatial and temporal distribution of thunderstorms in Latvia during the period 1960-2015 by using surface observation data from 14 major weather stations. To assess the severity of thunderstorms and suitability of the existing warning system, the frequency and distribution of thunderstorm intensities according to the national warning and hazard criteria was analysed. The results of our analysis show significant decrease in thunderstorm frequency in Latvia since 1960, however indicators of an increase in thunderstorm severity were also found, which reveals and emphasizes the complex nature of convective atmospheric phenomena also on climatic scales.																	1239-6095	1797-2469					2017	22						415	430										WOS:000425997300007

Pollutants, released into the ponds, mineralize during complex natural biochemical processes in the aquatic environment. The paper presents the long-term observation data (2004 - 2016 m.) on the purification of surface wastewater, formed in the company's production territory, in retention ponds. The aim of this work is to identify surface wastewater purification efficiency in retention ponds. Wastewater samples were taken before and after biological treatment. The samples were investigated in the Chemical Analysis Laboratory of the Water Research institute of Lithuania University of Agriculture. Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD7) was determined with titrometric method, suspended solids (SS) - with gravimetric method, having filtered the substance through a mid-thickness filter. Concentrations of oil pollutants were determined with the help of a spectrophotometric device of infrared rays IKAN-1 in the Analytical Department of Agrochemical Study Center of Lithuanian Agricultural Institute. Although the suspended solids, BOD 7, and oil hydrocarbon concentrations, released into the natural environment, were below the MAC when they are collected from the company's production areas, they are often contaminated; therefore, it is necessary to treat them. The purification efficiency of researched materials was satisfactory and reached 61, 64 and 91%.																	1691-4031						2017							133	138		10.22616/rrd.23.2017.020								WOS:000425532600020

Poor water quality might be caused by many natural and anthropogenic factors. The most common anthropogenic factors are water pollution caused by intensive agriculture (e.g. intensive fertilizer use, high density of livestock) and discharges from municipal waste water treatment plants (WWTP). In this study, nutrient load from WWTP to the river Berze basin in time period from the year 2005 to the year 2015 was described. In total, 23 WWTPs of the study area were analysed using descriptive statistics to calculate average values of nutrient amount and concentrations discharged to river Berze basin. From 2005 to 2015 average N and P load from WWTP to the river Berze basin have been reduced, but concentration of N and P in treated wastewater (WW) have increased. The largest WWTP of the study area - Krigeri (WWTP of city Dobele) is subject to the regulations of treated WW quality set by Republic of Latvia Cabinet Regulation No. 34. The WWTP Krigeri meets the regulations, but overall situation in the study area suggests that strict control of smaller WWTP should be made.																	1691-4031						2017							153	159		10.22616/rrd.23.2017.022								WOS:000425532600023

The examined water treatment system consists of a sedimentation pond as a pretreatment plant, a water pump, a water distribution well, and a horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland with the surface area of 160 m(2). During the observation period of 27 months (2014 -2016) water quality parameters such as total suspended solids (TSS), nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N), total nitrogen (TN), orthophosphate phosphorus (PO4-P), and total phosphorus (TP) were monitored and nutrient removal efficiency of the system was examined. Water samples collected at the inlet and outlet were compared. Monitoring results obtained during this study show that on average concentrations of TN and TP were reduced by 22% and 80%, respectively. However, nitrate - nitrogen concentrations on average increased by 10%, as during the time period from June, 2015 to March, 2016 reduction in NO3-N concentrations was not observed.																	1691-4031						2017							160	165		10.22616/rrd.23.2017.024								WOS:000425532600024

Modeling chlorophyll-a and turbidity concentrations in river Ganga (India) using Landsat-8 OLI imagery	EARTH RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMOTE SENSING/GIS APPLICATIONS VIII	Proceedings of SPIE				17th SPIE Conference on Earth Resources and Environmental Remote Sensing/GIS Applications	SEP 12-14, 2017	Warsaw, POLAND	SPIE				Rivers, one of the most complex ecosystems are highly dynamic and vary spatially as well as temporally. Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) is considered one of the primary indicators of water quality and a measure of river productivity, while turbidity in rivers is a measure of suspended organic matter. Monitoring of river water quality is quite challenging, demand tremendous efforts and resources. Numerous algorithms have been developed in the recent years for estimating environmental parameters such as chlorophyll-a and turbidity from remote sensing imagery. However, most of these algorithms were focused on the lentic ecosystems. There is a paucity of algorithms for rivers from which water quality variables can be estimated using remotely sensed imagery. The primary objective of our study is to develop algorithms based on Landsat 8 OLI imagery and in-situ observations for estimating of Chl-a and turbidity in the Upper Ganga river, India. Band reflectance images from multispectral Landsat-8 OLI pertaining to May and October 2016, and May 2017 were used for model development and validation along with near synchronous ground truth data. Algorithms based on Band 3 (R-2=0.73) proved to be the best applicable algorithm for estimating chlorophyll-a. The best algorithm for estimating turbidity was found to be log (B4/B5) (R-2=0.69) based on band combinations (individual band reflectance, band ratio, logarithmically transformed band reflectance and ratios) tested. The developed algorithms were used to generate maps showing the spatiotemporal variability of chlorophyll-a and turbidity concentration in the Upper Ganga river (Brijghat to Narora) which is also a Ramsar site.																	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-1321-8; 978-1-5106-1320-1				2017	10428								UNSP 1042814	10.1117/12.2278289								WOS:000423869700033

Quantifying the percentage of imperviousness within the Xiangjiang River basin is important to pollution control and watershed management. Per-pixel and sub-pixel methods have been widely used for analyzing impervious surface changes, but these methods are considered as complicated, computationally intensive, and sometimes subjective, especially when applied to a large geographic area. In this paper, normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), normalized difference impervious surface index (NDISI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced built-up and bareness index (EBBI) were respectively used to estimate impervious surfaces in Chang-ZhuTan region (CZT) of the Xiangjiang River basin, and a comparative analyses was conducted. Then the optimum spectral index was chosen to map the percentage of impervious surfaces for the study area. The results show that the spectral index of NDBI has the optimum estimation of large-scale impervious surfaces, and the percentage of imperviousness in CZT was 13.87%. The water quality in CZT was characterized as "protected", indicating that water quality protection in the plain areas of CZT is imperative.																	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-1321-8; 978-1-5106-1320-1				2017	10428								UNSP 104281I	10.1117/12.2277984								WOS:000423869700045

QUALITY OF DRINKABLE WATER SPRINGS IN TWO ALBA COUNTY REGIONS - COMPARATIVE STUDY	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY												Water pollution implies any physical, chemical, biological or bacteriological contamination over allowable limits. Alterations of water quality occur as a result of natural phenomena (natural pollution) or due to human activities (artificial pollution). Pollutants are any matter or energy present in the environment in a quantity exceeding a tolerable limit for humans or living species, preventing their normal evolution. Depending on the environmental factors that affect water quality, such outbreaks may occur more frequently in certain seasons of the year. In our study, samples were collected from several sources in two areas within Alba County, Romania. Water samples were studied in terms of physical-chemical properties (pH, mineral content, acidity, nitrite, nitrate and ammonium concentrations) and microbiological load (aerobic mesophilic bacteria, coliforms, Escherichia coli and enterococci). Variations of microbiological parameters in time were studied for both areas. The value of microbiological parameters and their variation in time was compared for the two areas. The study demonstrated that the risks of illness due to water consumption are present in both areas, and that a correlation in the increases of microbiological contamination over time between the two areas was found.																	1311-5065						2017	18	4					1389	1397										WOS:000423283800010

Riparian and landscape disturbance effects on stream fish community composition in an agriculturally-dominated drainage	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												We compared historical stream fish community sampling and remote sensing data from 1993-2011 in an agriculturally-dominated drainage basin to determine the effects of varying levels of riparian and landscape disturbances on fish communities. Stream fish guilds were analyzed with National Land Cover Database and aerial imagery products to quantify disturbance levels at a local and watershed scale. Insectivores and benthic insectivores were associated with intact riparian areas, whereas environmentally tolerant and omnivorous species were found in environments with degraded riparian areas. Riparian disturbances had the greatest effect near the stream (0-10 m), and the effects diminished with increasing distance from the stream. This spatial scale corresponds with those reported in the literature whereby allocthonous inputs and riparian filtering influenced stream fish communities and water quality. The landscape disturbance was not a strong predictor for any fish guild, indicating that local riparian conditions were more biologically meaningful. Considering the rapid rates of land conversion to production agriculture across the midwestern United States, ensuring adequate riparian buffering of streams may help protect specialist aquatic species and their habitat. Given the broad temporal and spatial nature of our data, these results suggest that targeted conservation of the 10-m scale of intact riparian vegetation directly adjacent to streams is a sound practice and should be considered the minimum conservation goal for watershed restoration in low-gradient landscapes historically dominated by agricultural land-use practices.																	1463-4988	1539-4077					2017	20	4			SI		445	456		10.1080/14634988.2017.1368831								WOS:000423091000015

The developed platform utilizes free and open satellite data available from different data sources like COPERNICUS, the European Earth Observation Initiative, or NASA, from different satellites and instruments. The quality of the marine environment is operationally evaluated using parameters like chlorophyll-a concentration, water color and Sea Surface Temperature (SST). For each parameter, there are more than one dataset available, from different data sources or satellites, to allow users to select the most appropriate dataset for their area or time of interest. The above datasets are automatically downloaded from the data provider's services and ingested to the central, spatial engine. The spatial data platform uses the Postgresql database with the PostGIS extension for spatial data storage and Geoserver for the provision of the spatial data services. The system provides daily, 10 days and monthly maps and time series of the above parameters. The information is provided using a web client which is based on the GET SDI PORTAL, an easy to use and feature rich geospatial visualization and analysis platform. The users can examine the temporal variation of the parameters using a simple time animation tool. In addition, with just one click on the map, the system provides an interactive time series chart for any of the parameters of the available datasets.

The study was conducted in 9 sampling stations based on Malacca River sub-basins. The result of WQI indicated that station 4 and 5 are polluted; station 8 and 9 are clean; and other stations are slightly polluted. PCA identified several pollutant sources, namely agricultural, residential, industrial, animal husbandry activities, as well as sewage treatment plants. Applied GIS technique detected several areas as hotspots pollutants sources, namely agricultural activities in station 5; residential activities in station 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7; industrial activities in station 3, 4, 5, and 7; animal husbandry in station 5 and some scatterings in station 1 to 4; as well as sewage treatment plant in moderate hotspot area between station 5 and 6, respectively. Besides the recommendation to reduce the river water pollution through the control of pollutants source, this study provides crucial information for the identification of problematic areas and spatial database of Malacca River for better understanding and management of river water quality in the future, as well as a reference for future land use and urban design development purposes.																	1589-1623	1785-0037					2017	15	4					571	588		10.15666/aeer/1504_571588								WOS:000419994800039

APPLICATION OF CA-MARKOV MODEL AND LAND USE/LAND COVER CHANGES IN MALACCA RIVER WATERSHED, MALAYSIA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Modeling the effects of past and current land use composition on surface water quality of the Malacca River watershed provides valuable information for environmental and land planning. The Land use land cover (LULC) spatio-temporal changes in watershed are classified as non-industrial area, industrial area, vegetation area, open space area, water bodies, as well as farming area. This is compared with the future spatial pattern simulated using CA-Markov model to evaluate qualitative and quantitative changes of LULC over time (between 2001, 2008, 2015, and 2029). This analysis consisted of the entire Malacca River watershed area. Changes may provide information on determinant of river water quality in future. Based on LULC monitoring and future simulation approach, the results may be used in an early warning system by demonstrating trend and consequences of changes in watershed. Continuous downward trends for vegetation area, open space area, and water bodies are due to expansion in non-industrial area, industrial area, and farming areas that increase contamination in the Malacca River. The findings demonstrate the need for more regulation in land use policy design, planning, and development for the protection of river water quality.																	1589-1623	1785-0037					2017	15	4					605	622		10.15666/aeer/1504_605622								WOS:000419994800041

ISOTOPIC (delta C-13 AND delta N-15) VARIATIONS IN TROPICAL RIVER SEDIMENTS OF KELANTAN, MALAYSIA: A RECONNAISSANCE STUDY OF LAND USE IMPACT TO THE WATERSHED	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Intensification of sedimentation process has resulted in shallower river, thus increasing their vulnerability to natural hazards (i.e. climate change, floods). Considering the impact of soil erosion to the sedimentation, identification of the main source of erosion is critical to watershed management. Stable isotope of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (N-15) were carried out in Kelantan catchment. Results from delta C-13 showed that C-3 type plant represents as major plant (-29.10% to -23.60%) in the river. While for delta N-15, the isotopic variations demonstrate distinct pattern of dry (Southwest Monsoon, SWM) and wet (Northeast Monsoon, NEM) seasons, suggesting significant pollutants washout from terrestrial (due to agricultural activities) to the water bodies. In addition, the Kelantan river system is an autochthonous as determined by carbon to nitrogen (C:N) ratio. Essentially, this study will serve as a precursor of future study to understand the impact of anthropogenic activities on carbon and nitrogen cycles in tropical catchment.																	1589-1623	1785-0037					2017	15	4					1101	1119		10.15666/aeer/1504_11011119								WOS:000419994800073

EVALUATION OF GROUNDWATER QUALITY AT COCONUT HUSK RETTING AREA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												This paper evaluates the quality of the groundwater in and around a coconut husk retting area. The area selected for the study is Mondaikadu of Kanyakumari district, Tamil Nadu, India, which is very near to the coast of the Indian Ocean. Groundwater samples were collected during summer, winter and pre-monsoon season and analyzed using analytical instruments. It was observed that the groundwater quality is significantly affected by coconut husk retting process. The pH level in the groundwater was found to be unacceptable because it was below the permissible limit of 6.5 to 9.2 as per the World Health Organization (WHO) and Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). All other parameters such as Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), Electrical conductivity (EC), Hardness, Calcium (Ca), Magnesium (Mg), Sodium (Na), Potassium (K), Ferrous (Fe), Manganese (Mn), Nitrate (NH3), Chloride (Cl), Fluoride (F), Sulphate (SO4) are within the limits. Low pH water was neutralized using addition of Sodium Hydroxide methods (NaoH), addition of soda ash and aeration process. Using correlation analysis, the dependent and independent variables were selected and regression analysis was conducted for these variables and the best fit regression model was created.																	1589-1623	1785-0037					2017	15	4					1745	1756		10.15666/aeer/1504_17451756								WOS:000419994800111

Large-scale mussel farms are known to produce significant volumes of bio deposits, which can be settled beneath the farm, thereby altering sediment characteristics and the benthic community structure. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of mussel Mytilus galloprovinciallis on soluble nutrient dynamic and its effect in aqueous environment by direct observations. Two experiments were carried out in water tanks. The first one was done using water with flow, while in the second one there was no flow. Two water tanks were used: one of them was a control tank, while in the other tank, 320 mussels were placed in four net bags. Dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll-a concentration were declined in the presence of Mytilus galloprovinciallis; marked increases that were observed especially in the concentrations of N-NH4, P-PO4, POC were a result of nutrient regeneration via excretion of Mytilus galloprovinciallis.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	12A					210	216										WOS:000419539900026

The O. mykiss muscle tissue, blood and water samples were obtained simultaneously from all stations on February 2016. For each station, fourteen physicochemical parameters were measured in water samples and water quality levels determined by YSKYY (Surface Water Quality Management Regulation) were recorded. Muscle tissue malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyl (PC) levels, and grade of DNA damage in erythrocytes using comet assay were determined in 0 mykiss from three fish farms. The water's physical and chemical parameters show that based on Turkish YSKYY, the water in all stations are categorised as class II according to the Turkish YSKYY. However, based upon its nitrite and total nitrogen values, Station III was found to be less polluted than the other stations, followed by a moderate degree of pollution for Station II, and significantly higher levels or pollution for Station I. The MDA and protein carbonyl levels were significantly higher in the muscle of the O. mykiss from Station I than Station II and III (p<0.01). Fish from Station I exhibited a significantly higher DNA damage in red blood cells than Station II and Station III (p<0.01). The study concluded that nitrogen species caused by exposure to an accumulation of environmental pollutants are an important source of RNS/ROS generation within the fish's tissue. RNS/ROS-mediated oxidative stress causes DNA fragmentation, lipid oxidation, and protein dysfunction, consequently negatively contributing to the quality of fish as a source of food, and also to their welfare.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	12					7105	7113										WOS:000419539700018

This study (1) estimated GPP, NEP, and R of Lake Abant using diel oxygen technique at three locations over the period of 2012 to 2014; and (2) built empirical models to predict temporal changes in GPP, NEP, and R. To estimate the lake metabolism components, dissolved oxygen concentration (DO, mg L-1), saturated dissolved oxygen value (O-2sat, %), and water temperature (T-w, degrees C) were continuously measured using in situ water quality monitoring probes, while solar radiation (SR, W m(-2)) and wind speed (WS, m s(-1)) were monitored using a meteorological station set up by the lake. Lake Abant was found to be of a net heterotrophic character (GPP/R < 1 and NEP < 0) for 2012, 2013 and 2014. Also, temporal GPP and R dynamics were modelled and validated on a monthly basis.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	12					7114	7121										WOS:000419539700019

For this purpose, the study was conducted in the Istranca Stream, which is draining into the Lake Durusu in Istanbul city, from March 2012 to June 2013, monthly. The sampling surveys were carried out at six stations on the stream, and fish samples were collected from the stations by electro-fishing. Water samples for water quality (NO2-N, NO3-N, SiO2, PO4-P, TP, Fe, SO4 ) and chlorophyll a analyses were taken simultaneously with fish sampling from the stations. At each sampling station, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), conductivity (EC) and water temperature were measured in situ with a portable digital multiparametric analyzer. Water depth, stream width, flow rate and weather temperature were also recorded in situ. To assess the relationships between the biotic variables (fish assemblages and chl-a) and the environmental variables, redundancy analysis (RDA) was employed to explore possible patterns. During the study, a total of 20 taxa belonging to 4 families were captured from the Istranca Stream. Rhodeus amarus (Bloch, 1782) (24%), Squalius cephalus (Linnaeus, 1758) (16%) and Gobio bulgaricus Drensky, 1926 (13%) were determined as the most abundant fish species in the stream. RDA analysis explained 68% of the variation between biotic and environmental variables. Statistical analyses indicated that fish assemblages of the stream highly associated with the environmental variables; flow rate, conductivity and water temperature were the most influential.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	12					7150	7159										WOS:000419539700024

Groundwater status in Pakistan: A review of contamination, health risks, and potential needs	CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												We examined the current groundwater (used for drinking) quality in Pakistan after implementation of Millennium Development Goals, including contaminants, their sources, and relevant health impacts. The drinking water quality parameters of most of the reported results exceeded the guidelines suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO) and National Environmental Quality Standards (NEQS). Natural sources of groundwater contamination have been activated due to anthropogenic activities like mining, and open dumping of industrial and domestic wastes which lead to poor groundwater quality. Globally, 780 million people, and 100 million people in Pakistan are exposed to unsafe water sources. Therefore, this review demonstrates the potential needs to achieve the safe drinking water goal of the Agenda 2030. The development of a proper monitoring network, installation of treatment plants, and implementation of legislations are recommended in this review.

Combined with stricter water regulations this development has already and will continue to pose higher demands on water treatment technologies and their efficiencies. Activated carbon adsorption has been successfully applied to remove a broad range of dissolved molecules in various applications while porous membrane processes are typically applied to retain suspended particles. The combination of both processes promises superior product water quality and improved process stability. However, improved process performance and water quality is not a given for all combinations of adsorption and porous membrane filtration but rather depending on a variety of different influencing factors. This review provides a comprehensive overview on these influencing factors by careful analysis of the available literature, covering aspects from adsorption mechanisms and membrane fouling phenomena over differences in process configurations as well as water composition. Thereby, the review aims to broaden the knowledge and understanding of the process combination with respect to optimal process configuration and long term operation for best process performance and further contribution towards the technical realization of the process combination for other treatment tasks.																	1064-3389	1547-6537					2017	47	19					1783	1835		10.1080/10643389.2017.1382260								WOS:000419157200001

Domestic Water Quality and Sanitation in Panglao Island, Bohol, Philippines	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												A study on water quailty and sanitation is conducted in an urban poor district in Panglao Island, Bohol Province, Philippines. Groundwater is the main domestic water source in the resort Island, where open dug wells and piped-water from deep wells supply the domestic needs of most households. But municipal reports show that from 2000-2003, diarrhea was among the top 10 leading causes of morbidity in the municipality. Household surveys, focused group discussions, infrastructure inspection, and initial field tests showed water quality concerns in the area which include saltwater intrusion and fecal contamination, among others. The aquifer is found to have high level of chlorides (i.e., 990 to 8,550 mg/L and 387 to 8,337 mg/L during wet and dry seasons, respectively) which exceeds WHO threshold value of 250 mg/L. Water sources (wells) in the island are also contaminated in both seasons where 24 out of 26 wells are positive for fecal Conform. Thus, long term solutions for Panglao Island are necessary to safeguard the health of water users in the island resort. One option is water connection to Bohol mainland and installing a sewerage network with centralized treatment.																	0119-1144						2017	20	2					95	109										WOS:000418728500011

E. coli is a faecal indicator microorganism. Climate variables, such as temperature and precipitation, influence E. coli concentrations in surface and drinking water resources. We measure and statistically analyse E. coli concentrations in drinking and surface water in the Kabul River Basin. E. coli concentrations are very high in the basin. Drinking and bathing water standards are violated. Water temperature, surface air temperature, discharge and precipitation were positively correlated with E. coli concentrations. Precipitation induced runoff transports of E. coli from agricultural lands to Kabul River and high temperature coincides with high precipitation and discharge. A linear regression model was developed to assess the net effect of the climate variables on E. coli concentrations. We found that climate variables accounted for more than half of the observed variation in E. coli concentrations in surface (R-2 = 0.61) and drinking water (R-2 = 0.55). This study indicates that increased precipitation together with higher surface air temperature, as expected in this region with climate change, were significantly correlated with increased E. coli concentrations in the future. Waterborne pathogens are expected to respond similarly to hydro-climatic changes, indicating that disease outbreaks could well become more frequent and severe.

Results showed that water quality was comparatively better at the center as Typha latifolia plants were growing toward the center of ponds. In another study, the wastewater treatment ability of T. latifolia was investigated by growing them in industrial and municipal effluent under greenhouse conditions. Water and plant samples were collected periodically (3rd, 10th, 17th, 24th, and 31st day after transplanting) for the measurement of Pb, Cu, and Cd concentrations. A decrease in heavy metal concentration of both effluents was observed as the experiment progressed and metal removal percentages ranged between 81% and 96%. Complementary the increase in metal concentration in plant tissues was observed over experimental period. Among plant tissues, metal concentration of Pb was highest i.e. 362 mg kg(-1) in roots and 313 mg kg(-1) in shoots at end of experiment. Pb, Cu, and Cd concentrations were higher in roots than shoots and hence translocation factors were less than 1.0. Metal removal efficiency was better from industrial wastewater and was in order of Pb > Cu > Cd. T. latifolia can be used for remediation of heavy metal-polluted wastewater.																	1522-6514	1549-7879					2017	19	12					1077	1084		10.1080/15226514.2017.1328387								WOS:000416675000002

The importance of key attenuation factors for microbial and chemical contaminants during managed aquifer recharge: A review	CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												There is increasing interest worldwide to utilize unconventional water resources such as reclaimed water, urban stormwater, or impaired surface water to augment drinking water supplies. Given the presence of traditional and emerging microbial and chemical contaminants (e.g., pathogens, trace organic chemicals, nutrients, trace metals) in these waters, efficient and reliable treatment processes are needed to assure a product water quality that is protective of public health. Natural treatment processes such as managed aquifer recharge (MAR) combine the benefits of efficient biological treatment for these contaminants with a low carbon footprint and a residual free operation. The drawbacks of MAR are the rather large space requirements and a lack of process understanding that can guide more efficient design and operation of these facilities. Among appropriate design and operational parameters as well as geochemical and hydrological conditions, retention time has been identified as a key parameter to achieve attenuation of microbial and chemical contaminants during MAR. Shorter retention time can result in significantly reduced footprints and thus facilitate the integration of MAR into urban and peri-urban water infrastructure. However, different minimum retention times are required to achieve reliable removal of microbial and chemical contaminants.

ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES OF MODERN PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGIES	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY												The problem of cutting difficult-to-machine materials used in the aerospace industry, aircraft industry and automobile industry, led to the development and application of today the most attractive technology for contour cutting - Abrasive Water Jet Cutting. Besides high accuracy, flexibility, and low material loss, abrasive water jet cutting can be described as 'ecological' or 'clean' technology over inert and abundant main processing substances (water, sand) and absence of airborne dust particles, smoke and fumes. The recycling of the abrasives makes the process more economical (savings of 50% in operating costs), effective and environmentally friendly (reduction in waste material). It is widely understood that modern, intensive agricultural production is based on the exploitation of natural, primarily biological, chemical and physical resources. A model indicator of environmental sustainability in rural areas and agricultural production in the form of the index is given. It contains 10 main indicators, where each indicator contains 10 variables.

CALCULATION OF SEDIMENT YIELD USING THE 'RIVER BASIN' AND 'SURFACE AND DISTANCE' MODELS: A CASE STUDY OF THE SHEREMETSKI POTOK WATERSHED, MONTENEGRO	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY												Sediment is a final result of erosion playing an important role in sustainable development of water resource system, controlling riverine hydrology, morphology, ecology, and water quality. A comprehensive approach estimating sediment yield from a watershed is needed to develop proper measures for mitigating sediment disasters and assessing downstream impacts. The researchers are using qualitative and quantitative methods for describing erosion through field observations and laboratory experiments. Indirect valuations of the erosion processes have been carried out using suspended sediment yield data of rivers or by assessing the sediments deposited in reservoirs. Modelling in ungauged basins has been considered as one of the main challenges in hydrological sciences. The objective of this research was to simulate responses of erosion processes in the Sheremetski Potok calculating sediment yield by using the models 'River Basin' and 'Surface and Distance'. Our findings pointed out a low potential of soil erosion risk, although in the river basin prevails very steep slopes (average river basin decline, Isr, 43.42%). With 2058 m(3) yr(-1) of sediment yield, and an area-specific sediment yield of 298 m(3) km(-2) yr(-1), the studied basin belongs to the Montenegrin basins with low sediment discharge. The model outcomes were validated through measurements at the Potpec reservoir.

COMPARISON OF MICROBIOLOGICAL NON-COMPLIANCE FREQUENCIES OF CHEMICAL DISINFECTANTS USED IN SWIMMING POOLS IN TURKEY	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY												Swimming pools are used in Turkey for physical activity and entertainment purposes as in many countries. Such common use brings recreational water-associated illness risk. Disinfection is an important application to prevent RWIs resulting from microbiological agents. This study aimed to calculate the non-compliance frequencies emerging in the use of different chemical disinfectants in swimming pools in Turkey and compare the effectiveness of different disinfection methods in the prevention of microbiological non-compliances. We evaluated the analysis results of a total of 79 087 pool water samples taken from inspection semi-public and public swimming pools in Turkey, where chemical disinfection was used, for routine monitoring purposes in the first eight months of 2015 and 2016. The minimum non-compliance for the total numbers of colony, total coliform, E. coli and P. aeruginosa parameters was determined in pools where chlorine and chlorine compounds were used (0.9-1.0% and 0.4-1.1%, respectively) whereas the highest non-compliance was found in pools using hydrogen peroxide + biguanide (5.5-5.3% and 3.1-9.1%, respectively). The applied statistical tests revealed a statistically significant difference between disinfection methods in terms of non-compliance frequency of all microbiological parameters (p < 0.0000001). This study found that chlorine in semi-public and public pools to be more effective against microbiological pollution than other chemical disinfection methods. This result is extremely important as it emphasises that other methods may be a suitable option in small, domestic pools with low user density whereas chlorine should be the primary preference especially in semi-public and public pools with high user density.																	1311-5065						2017	18	3					1231	1237										WOS:000417113200040

The water quality parameters of dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, salinity, total dissolved solids (TDS), conductivity, chlorophyll-a, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), total alkalinity, total hardness, total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), nitrate (NO3), total phosphate (TP), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), chlorine (C1), total suspended solids (TSS) were measured. Two significant sampling locations (sites 1 and 2) and (site 3) were determined based upon their similarity of water quality characteristics. Hazelnut production is the main income of the town and pesticide and fertilizers were administered intensely. Therefore, results revealed that the major causes of water quality deterioration were related to inflow of effluent from agricultural, industrial, domestic, and saline seeps into the creek at site 3 and resulting from people living in towns and farming at sites 1 and 2.

In this study, a new multivariate analysis approach integrating the maximum likelihood estimation structural equation modelling (ML-SEM) with neural network method is proposed. Twenty-seven variables indicating water quality from 2005 to 2012 were derived from the Dongting Lake Ecological Environment Monitoring Center of Hunan Province. The results showed that: (1) temperature (T) and hydraulic gradient (HG) had the most positive influence on chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) with a sensitivity ratio of 1.218 and 1.039, respectively, (2) transparency (SD) had the most negative effect on Chl-a concentration and (3) Chl-a increased quickly and reached the highest level when total phosphorus (TP) levels were from 0.08 mg/L to 0.12 mg/L. These results would provide guidance for eutrophication control strategies for Dongting Lake. By combining ML-SEM with artificial intelligence technique such as neural network, this study examined the causal and nonlinear relationships involved in the eutrophication process.																	0957-4352	1741-5101					2017	62	1					31	52		10.1504/IJEP.2017.10009295								WOS:000416899000003

An auto-regressive-moving-average with exogenous inputs (ARMAX) model is designed and tested based on the dataset. The model takes into account the effect of the measured water characteristics and nutrient level information. Through this study, it is demonstrated that the developed dynamical model can be used for estimating the fluorescence level (which characterises the phytoplankton biomass) and for predicting the various states of phytoplankton bloom. Thus, the developed model can be used for monitoring phytoplankton biomass in the water which in turn might give information about an unbalanced ecosystem or change in water quality.

Accurate measurements of these air pollutants and greenhouse gases are needed to support management and regulatory decisions. A mobile platform was developed to measure air emissions from tailings pond in the oil sands region of Alberta. The mobile platform was tested in 2015 in a municipal wastewater treatment lagoon. With a flux chamber and a CO2/CH4 sensor on board, the mobile platform was able to measure CO2 and CH4 emissions over two days at two different locations in the pond. Flux emission rates of CO2 and CH4 that were measured over the study period suggest the presence of aerobic and anaerobic zones in the wastewater treatment lagoon. The study demonstrated the capabilities of the mobile platform in measuring fugitive air emissions and identified the potential for the applications in air and water quality monitoring programs. Implications: The Mobile Platform demonstrated in this study has the ability to measure greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from fugitive sources such as municipal wastewater lagoons. This technology can be used to measure emission fluxes from tailings ponds with better detection of spatial and temporal variations of fugitive emissions. Additional air and water sampling equipment could be added to the mobile platform for a broad range of air and water quality studies in the oil sands region of Alberta.																	1096-2247	2162-2906					2017	67	11			SI		1205	1212		10.1080/10962247.2017.1285832								WOS:000416544400006	28152339

J	Zhang, YR				Zhang, Y. R.			Impacts of Nutrient Loading on Mercury Fractionation and Mobility in an Estuarine Wetland in Nansi Lake, China	SOIL & SEDIMENT CONTAMINATION												Total mercury is closely related to nutrient status in ecosystems. However, studies specifying the effects of various nutrient forms on the mobility of mercury are rare. In this study, three fractions of mercury (mobile, semi-mobile, and non-mobile) were examined in the soil of an estuarine wetland with excessive nutrient inputs in northern China. The wetland is located in the east route of China's South-to-North Water Transfer Project. Correlations between the three fractions of mercury and four nutrient parameters were analyzed. Results showed that toxic mobile and semi-mobile mercury comprised a great portion of total soil mercury in the studied wetland. Among the four nutrient parameters, ammonium nitrogen showed a significant negative correlation with mobile toxic mercury and was the principal nutrient component that influenced the mobility and toxicity of mercury. Nitrate nitrogen showed a positive correlation with mobile toxic mercury. Moreover, carbon/nitrogen ratio and soil acid were positively correlated with mercury mobility. Given that lower nitrogen loading is required in the watershed to ensure the water quality during the water transfer project, our study suggested that changes in nitrogen inputs might promote the mobility and bioavailability of mercury in the watershed. Thus, more attention should be provided to the potential hazard of mercury in the food web during the water transfer.																	1532-0383	1549-7887					2017	26	5					526	537		10.1080/15320383.2017.1362371								WOS:000415737500005

Water quantity and hydrochemical quality monitoring of Laspias River, North Greece	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART A-TOXIC/HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES & ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												The water quantity and quality of Laspias River, located in Xanthi Prefecture, Thrace, North Greece, are studied. A data collection program was designed at five stations along the main river course and its main tributary. Sampling frequency was about once every 10days. Temperature (T), electrical conductivity (EC), pH, and dissolved oxygen were measured in situ simultaneously with discharge measurements. Moreover, water samples were collected and analyzed for the determination of nitrites, nitrates, ammonium, total phosphorus, biochemical oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, total suspended solids and alkalinity, according to standard methods. Anions (i.e., SO4-2 and Cl-) and cations (i.e., Li+, Na+, Mg+2, and Ca+2) were determined using ion chromatography (Dionex ICS-3000 ion chromatograph). The results showed that there is an impact of point (e.g., wastewater treatment plant effluent and farms) and non-point (e.g., agricultural activities) sources of pollution on the EC values, and chloride, nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the river water. The trophic state of Laspias River, based on nutrient concentrations, was found eutrophic.

The presence of these compounds might pose a risk to the aquatic environment. To determine a possible (eco) toxicological risk, aquatic samples are tested using various bioassays, including sub-organismic assays such as the luminescent bacteria inhibition test, the acetylcholinesterase inhibition test, and the umu-test. The effect-directed analysis (EDA) combines physicochemical separation methods with biological (in vitro) tests. High-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) has proved to be particularly well suited for the separation of organic compounds and the subsequent analysis of effects by the application of the biotests directly on the surface of the HPTLC plate. The advantage of using HPTLC in comparison to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for EDA is that the solvent which is used as a mobile phase during chromatography is completely evaporated after the separation and therefore can no longer influence the applied bioassays. A prioritization during the complex identification process can be achieved when observed effects are associated with the separated zones in HPTLC. This increases the probability of identifying the substance responsible for an adverse effect from the multitude of organic trace substances in environmental samples. Furthermore, by comparing the pattern of biological effects of a separated sample, it is possible to track and assess changes in biological activity over time, over space, or in the course of a process, even without identifying the substance. HPTLC has already been coupled with various bioassays. Because HPTLC is a very flexible system, various detection techniques can be used and combined. In addition to the UV/Vis absorption and fluorescence measurements, TLC can also be coupled with a mass spectrometer (MS) for compound identification. In addition, detection of functional groups by means of derivatization reagents can support this identification. It is also possible to combine derivatization and HPLC-MS. Two case studies are used to illustrate the significance of HPTLC-EDA in investigating water quality: center dot Study on a wastewater treatment plant center dot Possible influence of an artificial turf surface on ground water																	0724-6145	1616-8542	978-3-319-45908-0; 978-3-319-45906-6				2017	157						187	224		10.1007/10_2016_16	10.1007/978-3-319-45908-0							WOS:000414556600008	27757476

The interannual and quarterly mean concentrations of COD, NH3-N, DO, and river pH value are calculated to evaluate pollution characteristics. Water quality in flood and non-flood periods were monitored to explore the relationship between peak flows and water quality in stormwater. The results showed that in the stormwater period, index concentrations and their fluctuation ranges decreased and were reduced gradually with the increase of peak flow. When peak flow was in the range of 480-680 m(3)/s, concentrations of COD and NH3-N had the same trend of increasing and decreasing in general. During 2005-15, river pH value fluctuated in the range of 7 to 8, and pH value in the second quarter was slightly higher than in the other three quarters. Water quality of the Weihe improved significantly after 2010.																	1230-1485	2083-5906					2017	26	6					2495	2505		10.15244/pjoes/74153								WOS:000414471200008

Zeta potentials of the residual colloidal particles in floated water and other typical water quality indexes measurements reinforced the fact that micro-bubble surface was successfully modified by dosing chitosan in a saturation system. The flotation efficiencies of both natural organic matters (NOM) and particles were obviously enhanced via chitosan-modified bubbles and the effects became more remarkable after the pH of saturation water was adjusted from 7.0 to 5.5, especially for NOM removal. Moreover, the influence of chitosan on DAF performance, as a coagulant aid, was also evaluated. The coagulation-aiding effects of chitosan were equal to acting as a bubble modifier at pH 7.0, but less efficient than the bubble modification DAF at pH 5.5. In addition, the effects of molecular weight (MW) and deacetylation degree (DD) of chitosan on its performance in both dosing strategies were discussed in detail. These findings highlight the advantages of bubble surface modification in surface water treatment and provide an alternative for DAF process optimization.																	1230-1485	2083-5906					2017	26	6					2731	2737		10.15244/pjoes/73806								WOS:000414471200032

Therefore, the objectives of the present work were to identify different factors affecting the ground water quality based on multivariate analysis. This study also aimed to determine the usefulness of multivariate statistical techniques to improve our understanding of factors affecting groundwater properties and their interactions. The original matrix consisted of 25 physico-chemical parameters analyzed in 70 number of ground water samples collected from different sites of sampling stations. All the physical and chemical parameters were analyzed by the standard methods of APHA, whereas minerals were determined by ICP-OES method. Thereafter, experimental 70 x 25 matrix was run through the multivariate statistical data analysis which consists of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), R and Q mode Factor Analysis (FA), and Cluster Analysis (CA). Results showed that physico-chemical factors are important source of variation in the groundwater quality. Interestingly, multivariate analysis revealed that other factors such as dissolution of salts present in the underlying rocks, presence of nutrient load, non-mixing/partial mixing of different types of ground water and moderate type of exchange between river water with adjacent ground water has been found to affect groundwater quality. The study also showed the significant role of multivariate statistical analysis in evaluation and interpretation of the groundwater quality data. The outcome of this study can be used as baseline data to inhospitable and critical areas for future sustainable development and proper management of groundwater system which will ultimately produce good water quality.																	0972-9860	1875-8568					2017	14	4					61	75		10.3233/AJW-170037								WOS:000413285700008

A review of the fate and transport of nitrogen, phosphorus, pathogens, and trace organic chemicals in septic systems	CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												A large population living in suburban and rural areas in the world uses septic systems, also called onsite wastewater treatment systems, to dispose of household wastewater. In a conventional septic system, the wastewater flows from a household to a septic tank, where solids settle and a clarified effluent is produced. This effluent is dispersed into the soil for further treatment and can be a potential source of various contaminants such as nutrients, pathogens, and a new class of compounds known as trace organic chemicals (TOrCs) in shallow groundwater and surface waters. We review the current state of the science on the fate and transport of three groups of contaminants-nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus), pathogens, and TOrCs-and water quality impacts associated with these contaminants in conventional septic systems. We also discuss alternative technologies that may be employed when site conditions or environmental needs preclude the use of conventional septic systems.																	1064-3389	1547-6537					2017	47	7					455	541		10.1080/10643389.2017.1327787								WOS:000414036200002

Analysis of Drinking Water Quality for Presence of Heavy Metals and Its Impacts on Health of Local Population in Sibi District	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT												This study aimed at finding out the presence of heavy metals in the drinking water sources of Sibi District, Pakistan. These metals are causing various diseases in the local population such as browning of the teeth, bone deformations, and malfunctioning of different organs of the human body. The researchers collected water samples from 8 sampling sites of Sibi district and the same were analyzed for fluoride, lead, arsenic and manganese. Modern instruments available in the advanced GSP laboratory were used for examining these samples. The results showed that the values of pH and TDS in water samples ranged from 7.2 to 8.31 and 650 to 9,800, fluoride was present from 2.0 to 12.5 mg/l, arsenic values were observed in the range of 0.0008 to 4.56 mg/l and lead was present from 0.0001 to 0.02 mg/l and manganese was present from 0.002 to 0.353 mg/l. These results show that the values of heavy metals are mostly higher than the values set by World Health Organization (WHO) except values of Manganese and Lead which were mostly within permissible limits. The reason for the presence of these heavy metals was observed to be the combination of rock alterations and exploitation of surface and underground minerals in the selected areas of Sibi district.																	2239-5938	2239-6101					2017	6	4			SI		32	40		10.14207/ejsd.2017.v6n4p32								WOS:000412137100004

J	Shoko, C; Dube, T; Clark, D				Shoko, Cletah; Dube, Timothy; Clark, David			Total evaporation estimation for accurate water accounting purposes: an appraisal of various available estimation methods	GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL												The estimation of total evaporation is fundamental for water accounting, considering its influence on water availability. Moreover, the current increase in water consumption (e.g. in sub-Saharan Africa and the world over), land cover/use changes, deteriorating water quality and the climate change projections in most regions of the world underscore the need to understand water loss. So far, different approaches have been developed and implemented in estimating the variations of total evaporation, with varying accuracies. The aim of this work was therefore, to provide a review of these different approaches for estimating total evaporation, as well as a detailed discussion of their strengths and weaknesses. Findings from this review have shown that total evaporation estimates derived, using ground-based meteorological and micro-meteorological methods are inadequate for representing its large-scale spatial variations. On the other hand, remote sensing technology, which acquires data at different resolutions (i.e. radiometric, spectral, spatial and temporal), provides timely, up-to-date and relatively accurate spatial estimates of total evaporation over large geographic coverage, for sustainable and effective water accounting, which is key for well-informed and improved management of water resources at both catchment and regional scales. In this regard, more details on the remote sensing-based methods of estimating total evaporation are provided, especially considering the robust technological advancements and its potential in characterizing earth features over time and space. This work has also managed to identify research gaps and challenges in the accurate estimation of total evaporation, using remote sensing, especially with the emergence of more advanced sensors and the characteristics of the landscape.

J	Wu, QL; Zhang, ZH; Cao, GD; Zhang, XH				Wu, Qilong; Zhang, Zhenghua; Cao, Guodong; Zhang, Xihui			Impact of polymeric membrane breakage on drinking water quality and an online detection method of the breakage	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART A-TOXIC/HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES & ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												Polymeric membrane has been widely used for the treatment of drinking water in China, and the total treating capacity has reached up to 3.8 million m(3)/d. However, the membrane breakage found in the membrane modules in many water treatment plants resulted in an increase in turbidity and bacterial amount in the membrane permeate. In this study, a membrane module running for 3years in a full-scale application was examined in terms of the breaking positions and the numbers of the broken fibers. It was found that most of the breaking positions were mainly on the outlet side of the module and that the distance from these points to the outlet was about 1/10-2/10 length of the membrane module. The lab-scale tests showed that the increase of the numbers of the breaking fibers in the membrane module (the breaking fibers were from 1 to 4 of 75 fibers) resulted in the increase in turbidity, particle count and the amount of total bacteria and coliform bacteria. Meanwhile, the water quality after the filtration with broken membrane fibers was similar to the quality of the raw water, which indicated that once the membrane fiber breakage occurred in the membrane module, the quality of drinking water after membrane filtration was significantly affected. Furthermore, the breaking position closer to the outlet side of the membrane module exposed much higher microbiological risk than those in the middle or near the bottom side. A pilot scale test was conducted by using a membrane module with 6600 fibers, and the effect of the membrane breakage (1-4 broken fibers) on water quality was also investigated. The results indicated that periodical backwashing caused drastic fluctuation of turbidity, particle count and the bacterial amount in the permeate water, which might be due to the washing force and self-blocking action inside the hollow fibers. Moreover, there is a good quantitative relationship (R-2 = 0.945) between particle count and the bacterial amount, which indicated that an online detection of particle count can be used to evaluate the bacterial risk. It was also suggested that the online detection of particle count after backwashing within 100s would be a quick and precise method to identify any fiber breakage in time. These results are very important for the safety issue in the application of polymeric membrane to water treatment plants.																	1093-4529	1532-4117					2017	52	12					1126	1132		10.1080/10934529.2017.1342496								WOS:000414129100002	28738172

An innovative hybrid process based on biofiltration, ozonation and short SAT (sSAT, with similar to 22 days retention time) was demonstrated in a 6 m(3)/hr pilot system to remove emerging trace organic compounds (TrOCs), organic matter and control Mn2+ dissolution in reclaimed water. The biofiltration stage was proposed for nitrification of ammonia as well as removal of dissolved and particulate organic matter (DOM and POM), to enable efficient ozonation of secondary effluents. The pilot system was operated in two modes, where samples were periodically taken from all pilot stages to observe changes in product water quality. At first (Mode 1), biofiltered effluents were infiltrated through sSAT (i.e., no ozonation prior infiltration). During this operation, ammonia, nitrite and phosphate were completely removed, and pathogens were highly reduced. In addition, all measured TrOCs were effectively removed after sSAT, besides the persistent TrOCs Carbamazepine (CBZ) and Iodine-organic contrast media Iopamidol (IPDL). In Mode 2, biofiltered and ozonated (1.0-1.2 mg ozone/mg DOC) effluents were infiltrated through sSAT. In the final reclaimed product, values of DOC, UVA and Mn2+ were reduced to 0.8 mg/L, 2.2 L/m, and 29-35 mu g/L, respectively. Furthermore, ammonia and nitritewere not detected in the product, and good bacterial quality was obtained. Following 56-75 days of operation at Mode 2, all TrOCs were reduced down to <100 ng/L. The delay in the effect of the pretreatment stages on TrOCs removal by sSAT (>56 days instead of similar to 22 days) could be explained by their displacement retardation in the upper soil layers of the pilot SAT (0-25 cm). In-depth sampling inbservation well and positively affected the quality of the reclaimed water. the observation well after 111 days atMode 2 showed homogeneity along the overall perforated section of the well (from -14 to -26 m) with 0.7-0.9 mg/L DOC, 2.1-2.2 1/m UVA and <10 ng/L CBZ. This result proved that the ozonated water completely covered the area around the observation well and positively affected the quality of the reclaimed water.																	0191-9512	1547-6545					2017	39	5					385	394		10.1080/01919512.2017.1346465								WOS:000413092900010

Hence, the present study aimed to determine the changes in the physicochemical characteristics of the Batang Baram, a tropical river in Malaysia, due to a rainfall event. Two samplings were conducted in the Baram in Sarawak before and after rain. The results show that the mean velocity and mean depth of the river increased substantially after rain. The high volume of surface runoff coupled with the fast-flowing river significantly increased the dissolved oxygen, oxygen saturation, turbidity, chlorophyll a, total sulphide, hydrogen sulphide, and nitrite-nitrogen in the river after rain; whereas the pH, transparency, and organic nitrogen decreased significantly after rain. The water quality index (WQI) in the tributary after rain showed improvement mainly due to an increase in the concentration of dissolved oxygen. On the other hand, the total suspended solids in the main river after rain changed from Class I/II/III to Class III/V due to soil erosion.

The aquatic plants were collected at monthly intervals between March 2014 and November 2014, and epiphytic algae on the plants were identified. In total, 98, 74, and 66 taxa of epiphytic algae were identified on C. demersum, M. spicatum, and P. crispus, respectively. The species composition of the epiphytic algae on the three macrophyte species showed a statistically significant difference (F = 7.07, p<0.05). There was also a statistically significant difference in epiphytic algae species diversity, depending on the sampled month (F = 3.59, p<0.05). The mean species richness and species diversity on C. demersum was 33 and 1.546, respectively. On M. spicatum, the mean species richness and species diversity was 23 and 1.407, respectively. On P. crispus, the mean species richness was 19, and the species diversity was 1.256. The following species were the dominant epiphytic taxa in Gala Lake: Cocconeis placentula, Anabaena constricta, Gomphonema acuminatum, Oscillatoria limosa, Cymbella cistula, and Epithemia sorex. Although the species composition of the epiphytic algae was different, the diversity values were similar on all the macrophyte species.																	1230-1485	2083-5906					2017	26	5					2147	2158		10.15244/pjoes/70232								WOS:000412767500022						
J	Rezaverdinejad, V; Rahimi, M				Rezaverdinejad, Vahid; Rahimi, Mina			Seasonal Assessment of Nitrate, Nitrite, and Heavy Metals Pollution in Groundwater of Ardabil Aquifer, Iran	POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES												One of the most important resources for drinking water is groundwater. Recently, the quality of groundwater has been endangered due to several reasons, including human activities, vast agricultural activities, and the discharge of industrial wastewater containing nitrogen (N) and heavy metals. For this study we investigated the values of NO3, NO2, and some heavy metals and analyzed the groundwater of the Ardabil Aquifer area in wet and dry seasons. For this purpose we evaluated 76 wells in the study area. In order to analyze the results we used World Health Organization (WHO), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Institute of Standard and Industrial Research of Iran (ISIRI) standards. The results indicated that, according to WHO and ISIRI, 10.5% of wells and, according to the EPA, 69.7% of wells have NO3 above the standard level in the wet season, but in the dry season, according to WHO and ISIRI, 29% and, according to the EPA, 80.6% of the wells have NO3 above the permissible level. However, according to all standards, NO2 values are less than the permissible level for drinking consumption. In terms of evaluation criteria of the simultaneous presence of NO3 and NO2 in drinking water (K), 29% of wells in the dry season and 13.15% of wells in the wet season have NO3 and NO2 problems. In order to find an appropriate interpolation method and zoning parameter of NO3 and NO2, different interpolation methods were evaluated and Kriging method with the lowest error was chosen for zoning the parameters. According to zoning maps, in the wet season the Namin and south Ardabil areas, which have the most drinking water wells, contain values of NO3 above the permissible levels, whereas the values of NO3 are at the mediocre level in the dry season. In addition to NO3 and NO2 analysis, the evaluation of heavy metals pollution indices in the aquifer include: heavy metal pollution index (HPI), heavy metal evaluation index (HEI), and contamination degree (C d). Generally, according to the EPA, in terms of NO3 and NO2 pollution, Ardabil aquifer is in an undesirable condition, and according to WHO and ISIRI standards, this area has a mediocre level of undesirable condition. According to HPI and C d indices, most parts are in a high class of heavy metal pollution, as well.																	1230-1485	2083-5906					2017	26	5					2267	2276		10.15244/pjoes/69943								WOS:000412767500035

Concurrent basic water quality parameters and seven nutrients were measured in the water column. Sediment measurements from depositional areas were conducted for bifenthrin, Total Organic Carbon, grain size, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and eight metals. All parameters were measured at 12 sites annually during the late summer for a 3-year period (2014, 2015 and 2016). Univariate regressions, stepwise multiple regressions and canonical correlation statistical analyses were used to determine the relationship between various benthic metrics (i.e., taxa richness and abundance) and all the measured parameters for the 3-year database. Benthic communities comprising 108-110 taxa were collected annually, and were generally dominated by sensitive caddisflies and mayflies. These communities were rated as good to exceptional using the Ohio Invertebrate Community Index. Physical habitat for the various sites was rated as good using the Ohio Qualitative Habitat Evaluation Index, thus suggesting that habitat is not a significant stressor that would likely impact resident benthic communities. Based on a comparison of measured in-stream total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations and criterion value exceedances, it appears that the in-stream nutrient concentrations could be potentially stressful to resident benthic biota. Metal concentrations were below established NOAA Threshold Effects Levels at all sites. Measured PCB concentrations were below levels of detection at all sites. Toxic units' (TUs) calculations based on using sensitive laboratory strains of Hyalella were less than 0.1 for bifenthrin, thus suggesting that bifenthrin sediment toxicity was unlikely. Thirty significant relationships reported between benthic metrics and the various environmental variables based on the 3-year database were as follows: 12 relationships with habitat metrics, 8 relationships with metals, 7 relationships with nutrients, 2 relationships with bifenthrin and 1 relationship with sediment characteristics. Relative habitat quality, habitat preferences, and ecological competition appear to be factors that shape the characteristics of the benthic communities of Big Bureau Creek, rather than stress imposed by toxicants (bifenthrin and metals), nutrients, or sediment characteristics. Complex relationships between benthic metrics and environmental variables are discussed.																	1093-4529	1532-4117					2017	52	10					1008	1021		10.1080/10934529.2017.1328947								WOS:000409999100008	28609223

Various studies demonstrate that the implementation of green roof technology can moderate environmental problems, through the reduction of heat flux and solar reflectivity, the minimisation of buildings' energy consumption, the air pollution removal, the storm water runoff reduction, the air cooling and the effective management of the urban heat island effect. In this framework, the aim of this study is to assess the green roof potential and the quantification of its benefits over Thessaloniki, Greece's second largest city. In order to do so, very high spatial resolution satellite image and natural colour orthoimagery were used along with a geographical object-based image analysis approach. Carbon sequestration potential, rainwater retention and energy conservation were estimated based on coefficients adopted after a comprehensive literature review and actual dynamic energy simulations.

Indicators show that many regions in the European area already suffer from water stress conditions. Meeting domestic water demand is a top priority and may require water transport to urban centers from rather long distances and from different hydrologic basins, in addition to its costly and energy demanding treatment. The EU recognizes the need and the importance of sustainability and more efficient water management through the Water Framework Directive 2000/60. A significant percentage of domestic water is consumed for secondary uses, which do not require potable water quality. In this paper we study the substitution of potable water by ground water that could be pumped from a rather shallow aquifer, in the city of Thessaloniki, Greece, in secondary uses (building cleaning, toilet flushing) and irrigation. It is proved that this solution, which serves the goals of the Water Framework Directive, is economically viable.

The annual dataset belonging physical and chemical features in the reservoir was obtained by the monthly intervals between the years 2010 and 2011. A total of 15 parameters (temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), biological oxygen demand (BOD5), light permeability, conductivity, salinity, chloride, pH, total hardness, Ca, Mg, NO2-N, NO3-N, o-PO4, SO4) have been monitored at three different sampling stations in the reservoir and a total of 495 observations were grouped statistically. The sampled periods have been classified into three different groups by using the BCCA. The results were supported by the PCA and CA statistical methods. Consequently, in order to determine and to evaluate for large complex datasets that belong to environmental properties, multivariate analyses are very useful techniques. Thus, the sampling periods to monitor the physicochemical including in a water resource can be determined.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	8					5007	5012										WOS:000409399600012

The water supplied from the wells in Uluova region is used as drinking, domestic and irrigation water. In the study, the groundwater samples were taken from several wells in Uluova region in March, April, May and September 2007 and March and April 2014 to examine the quality of groundwater in the Uluova region, Elazig, Turkey. They were assayed for quality parameters including pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), hardness, NH4-N, NO2-N, NO3-N, sulfate, chloride, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, Al, Cd, Pb, Ni and total and fecal coliforms. The results obtained were checked against the national and international drinking water standards and indicated that the groundwater samples were utilizable as drinking water based on the physical and the chemical parameters analyzed. Moreover, its suitability for irrigation purpose was evaluated in terms of sodium percentage (Na %) and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR). It was determined that the obtained concentrations of cadmium, lead, nickel and aluminum were lower than the guideline values; the studied water samples were appropriate for both drinking and irrigation purpose.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	8					5092	5102										WOS:000409399600023

The obtained results, at all measuring profiles of river and lake water, showed that concentrations of hazard cations (mu g/L) of Pb2+, Cd2+ and Hg2+ significantly exceeded the maximum allowable concentrations (MAC), and could cause negative impact on the environment. Concentrations of As3+ in water samples at all measured sampling points were within the MAC according to Serbian low and by-lows. The pH of the lake water was from 7.42 to 8.72, the concentration of dissolved oxygen from 3.53 mg/L to 8.82 mg/L and according to those results water lake belong to the fifth class of ecological potential. The higher concentration of Hg cation was in the lake than in the river waters sample tributaries, which indicate the high anthropogenic activities (unsanitary landfills, solid waste, etc.) as the pollution sources on the lake banks. Determined results showed that concentrations of mercury, cadmium, arsenic and lead cations (mg/kg) in sediment and tributaries were significantly lower than the MAC values. Based on two years monitoring results in water sample of tributaries, mathematical regression model was developed to predict the concentrations of heavy metal cations in lake water. High level of correspondence was achieved between dendrograms and real situation in lake accumulation. In December 2013, toxic contamination with cyanobacteria was occurred and use of lake water for production of drinking water for city Uzice and surround settlements was banned. The research activities on lake water quality presented in this paper are the unique model of the Case Study for the first time performed for the ecological status of artificial lake accumulation Vrutci in Serbia.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	8					5184	5189										WOS:000409399600035

In this study, we constructed five kinds of bio-trickling filters loaded with different size distribution of zeolite to systematically investigate the removal characteristics of turbidity, ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) of black water. The results showed that under the same hydraulic loading and influent water quality, the filter filled of small (5mm or less) size zeolite and another one covered with large-size (15-30mm), medium-size (5-15mm), small-size in sequence were better than those filled with large and medium size zeolite respectively or the mixture of three size on the removal efficiency of turbidity, NH4+-N, TN, TP and COD. Although the removal efficiency of the filter filled of small size zeolite was similar to layered model, layered model gave optimal performance for treating water considering the issues of cost and clogging. When the average concentrations of turbidity, NH4+-N, TN, TP, COD were 286.5 NTU, 116.1 mg/L, 159.8 mg/L, 14.9 mg/L, 742.4 mg/L in black-water, the layered model reached them reduction of 88.6%, 97.3%, 70.5%, 22.5%, 77.2%.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	8					5190	5197										WOS:000409399600036

For this reason, the management of rivers for sustainable water management needs to be well managed and its pollution must be well identified and monitored. In this study, biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), suspended solids (SS), pH, conductivity (CE) and temperature (T) values were examined in five locations between December 2012 and December 2013 in Bartin River. Then multiple linear regression (MLR), Radial Basis Neural Network (RBANN), Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks (MLP) models were applied for water quality forecasting. In these models, BOD value was estimated by using T, pH, COD, SS, CE parameters as input data. Forty-one measurement data belonging to the locations were used in the training and the other 18 measurement data were used in the test process. According to the obtained results, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models have shown better results than multiple linear regression model. Compared to the established models, the best performance values were achieved with a radial based artificial neural network model. In this model MAE, RMSE and R2 values obtained 0.998, 1.230 and 0.890 respectively. According to the results of the present research the most successful estimation by ANN models was achieved for the monthly BOD values in Bartin River.

Phytoplankton ecology of a culturally eutrophic embayment: Hamilton Harbour, Lake Ontario	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Hamilton Harbour is a chronically eutrophic embayment located at the western end of Lake Ontario that has experienced many decades of agricultural, industrial, and urban contamination. It has been identified as an Area of Concern under the terms of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement between Canada and the United States. This study examines the ecology of the phytoplankton communities at one centrally located station during the ice-free period (May-October) of three non-consecutive years: 2002, 2004 and 2006. This was the first comprehensive study to be conducted since the 1970s. It was found that the phytoplankton communities are diverse and fluctuate throughout the year, along with changing nutrient, physical and environmental conditions. No consistent patterns of seasonal succession were observed throughout the study. Phytoflagellates including Cryptophyceae and Dinophyceae had a tendency to outnumber and out-compete other phytoplankton since they are mobile and able to seek out optimal habitats within the water column. For a highly eutrophic water body, algal biomass (annual mean approximate to 2.0 g m(-3)) was lower than expected and more consistent with mesotrophic conditions-an observation first made by researchers in the 1970s and attributed to the highly variable physical environment. While our study supports these earlier results, we also conclude that zooplankton grazing likely has a significant role in limiting the size of the algal standing crop. Several algal bloom events were captured during our study. In addition to the somewhat predictable blooms of Diatomeae in the spring and Cyanophyta in the summer, we also observed blooms of Cryptophyceae and Dinophyceae. In one case we observed a bloom with no dominant taxon-it contained a diverse mixture of Cryptophyceae, Euglenophyta and Dinophyceae-challenging the commonly held notion that algal blooms are essentially monocultures. Our results show that such a variable and stressed ecosystem requires frequent sampling to capture the rapid changes that occur.																	1463-4988	1539-4077					2017	20	3			SI		201	213		10.1080/14634988.2017.1307678								WOS:000410570900002

Elevated zooplankton production in a eutrophic Lake Ontario embayment: Hamilton Harbour 2002-2014	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Hamilton Harbour is an Area of Concern in western Lake Ontario, long stressed by cultural eutrophication, urbanization and invasive species. Despite high nutrient levels leading to hypolimnetic hypoxia and contaminated sediment, it is a highly productive environment. To better understand zooplankton dynamics in Hamilton Harbour, we conducted biweekly May to October sampling of zooplankton and rotifer composition at open water harbour sites from 2002-2014. May to October zooplankton density, dry biomass and total production averaged 265 +/- 16 animals l(-1), 306 +/- 19 mg m(-3) and 4131 +/- 359 mg m(-3), (+/- SE), respectively. These values are among the highest reported in the Great Lakes, with biomass two to seven times greater than in other eutrophic embayments. Zooplankton populations and taxonomic seasonality have remained relatively stable in Hamilton Harbour since 2002. Biomass is often dominated by smaller taxa such as Bosmina, Eubosmina and juvenile copepods, suggestive of high fish planktivory, but Daphnia retrocurva and D. galeata mendotae are also dominant during the summer, indicating improvements in the zooplankton community since the 1970s when Daphnia and cyclopoids were uncommon. Conversely, rotifers have declined over the last 40 years, though while still numerically dominant, now comprise <4% of total biomass and production compared to 40% in the 1970s. Both adult Dreissenid Mussels and their veliger larvae are less abundant in Hamilton Harbour compared to nearshore Lake Ontario. Zooplankton appear to be effectively utilizing high production rates of edible algae and microorganisms in the harbour. More work is needed to explore trophic interactions in this eutrophic ecosystem and the effects of hypolimnetic hypoxia on the zooplankton community.																	1463-4988	1539-4077					2017	20	3			SI		230	241		10.1080/14634988.2017.1294425								WOS:000410570900004

Both beaches experienced health advisory postings >60% of the bathing season prior to 2005. In order to de-list Hamilton Harbour as one of 43 areas of concerns, the water quality at Bayfront and Pier 4 Beaches must meet the provincial water quality objective of 100 cfu of Escherichia coli 100 ml(-1) > = 80% of the bathing season for a minimum of three consecutive years. In 2005, the Hamilton Harbour Beach Committee was formed to guide beach managers on decisions pertaining to beach remediation and E. coli mitigation. Here we discuss the various studies, projects and public outreach programs delivered by Environment Canada, the City of Hamilton and the Bay Area Restoration Council to improve beach health and move toward delisting as an Area of Concern by 2020.																	1463-4988	1539-4077					2017	20	3			SI		278	284		10.1080/14634988.2017.1304792								WOS:000410570900008						
J	Vandenberghe, C; Colinet, G				Vandenberghe, Christophe; Colinet, Gilles			The management of soil organic matter, an important issue in reducing nitrate leaching to groundwater	BIOTECHNOLOGIE AGRONOMIE SOCIETE ET ENVIRONNEMENT												Description of the subject. The nitrate concentration in half of the groundwater bodies of the Walloon Region (Belgium) has justified their classification as vulnerable zones under the Nitrates Directive (ND). This vulnerable area has a relatively high diversity of agro-soil environments. Thus, the nitrogen content of agricultural soils can vary locally by a factor 4. Objectives. This study aimed to establish whether the carbon content of a soil is a significant risk factor in nitrate leaching to groundwater. Method. The article is based on measurements of nitrate nitrogen residue (APL) and soil total organic carbon (TOC) at the beginning of the leaching period. The measurements were made in 2012 in 1,500 plots, during inspections organized by the Wallonia Public Service. This was as part of the application of the Program for the Sustainable Management of Nitrogen in Agriculture, the scheme for implementing the ND within the Walloon region. Results. Examination of the results showed both that the APL was positively correlated to the TOC and that plots with "noncompliant" APL results had a significantly higher average TOC than the other plots. Conclusions. Since APL is an environmental indicator of the risk of nitrate leaching, it appears that the TOC may constitute a risk of groundwater contamination by nitrate. It is therefore advisable to improve the inclusion of this parameter in advice regarding nitrogen fertilization and secondly, in the case of summer harvest, to better manage the sowing of catch crops.																	1370-6233	1780-4507					2017	21	3					201	208										WOS:000410109500004

Their concentrations were analyzed using atomic absorption spectroscopy, and it was found that their concentrations were several fold higher in downstream Swan River water samples of the Kahuta Industrial Triangle as compared to upstream. Heavy metal soil concentrations taken from the downstream site were 149% for Cr, 131% for Ni, 176% for Cd, 139% for Zn, 224% for Pb, and 182% for Cu when compared to samples from the upstream site. Quantitative analysis concluded that these metals were higher in milk samples collected from downstream as compared to the samples from upstream water-irrigated sites. The order of metal in milk was as Zn > Cr > Cu > Cd > Pb = Ni. Heavy metal contaminations may affect the drinking water quality, food chain, and ecological environment. It was also suggested that the toxicity due to such polluted water, soil, and milk are seriously dangerous to human health in future.																	1080-7039	1549-7860					2017	23	7					1564	1572		10.1080/10807039.2017.1321956								WOS:000409110300003

This study examined motivations of South Dakota landowners for enrolling in the James River Basin CREP. All 517 newly enrolled landowners were mailed a questionnaire in 2014 measuring demographics, behaviors, opinions, and motivations (60% response rate). Cluster analysis of 10 motivations for enrolling identified three motivation groups (wildlife = 40%, financial = 35%, environmental = 25%). The financial group had the youngest mean age (62 years), followed by the wildlife (65) and environmental groups (68). Among respondents, 43% favored the public access requirement of this CREP with the environmental group most in favor. Understanding landowner enrollment motivations and decision criteria will assist in strategies (e.g., financial incentives, increasing yield via habitat restoration) for increasing future participation.																	1087-1209	1533-158X					2017	22	4					382	389		10.1080/10871209.2017.1324069								WOS:000408862300007

Collections of samples were realized regularly at monthly intervals, always about in the half of the month. Sampling sites were determined in order to assess the impact of natural and anthropogenic source of surface water quality. The results were compared from the limit values set out in Government Regulation No. 269/2010 Coll. The average value of BOD5 for the whole period was 1.58 mg O-2 dm(-3). The highest average concentration of biodegradable organic matter was in February and the minimum in May. Depending on the sampling site, we found the highest average value for the whole monitored period in the northeastern part of Cicov Reserve, and the lowest in the sampling site situated approximately 150 m from the mouth of Cilizian Stream in the reserve. The average value of CODcr for the entire monitored period represented 60.69 mg O-2 dm(-3). Depending on the time of sampling, minimum average value was in February and maximum in September. Depending on the sampling site, we found the highest average value for the whole monitored period in the sampling site located approximately 150 m from the mouth of the Gilizian. The average value of the BOD5/CODcr ratio during the years 2010, 2011, and 2013 was 0.026.																	1230-1485	2083-5906					2017	26	4					1607	1613		10.15244/pjoes/67749								WOS:000408078000019

An experiment was performed in tanks consisting of three treatments: 1) without fish (control treatment, CON), 2) with fish unable to feed on submerged macrophytes (excretion treatment, EXCR), and 3) with fish swimming free (herbivory plus excretion treatment, HERB-EXCR). Treatments were conducted with varying macrophytic compositions (Vallisneria natans (Lour.) Hara, Ceratophyllum demersum L., and both species) and carp densities (low, medium, and high: 0.15, 0.30, and 0.45 g.L-1 respectively, in EXCR and HERB-EXCR). Results indicated that in EXCR and HERB-EXCR, water quality was better with a lower density of grass carp. In EXCR, the water quality in tanks with V. natans was worse than in other tanks, and water quality in C. demersum tanks was better under the HERB-EXCR treament. Compared to EXCR, grass carp in HERB-EXCR significantly increased concentrations of NH4+-N, NO2--N, and chlorophyll a. The effects on biomasses of protozoa, copepods, and total zooplankton in HERB-EXCR were greater than in the other treatments. Integrated analysis showed that grass carp herbivory on submerged macrophytes could be the central mechanism accounting for the changes in water quality and zooplankton communities.																	1230-1485	2083-5906					2017	26	4					1681	1691		10.15244/pjoes/68855								WOS:000408078000026

In this study, multivariate statistical techniques, hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), and principal component analysis (PCA) were applied to data on Yaglidere water quality. Thus, we aimed to determine main pollution factors and time risky polluted areas. During the study, water samples were taken by monitoring 23 physicochemical parameters at five different sites every month between June 2013 and May 2014. In addition, Pearson correlation was used to determine the relationships of all physico-chemical parameters. According to the results of HCA, five sampling areas were grouped into two clusters. From the PCA results, it may be estimated that river pollution is mainly from agricultural runoff and soil weathering, soil erosion, hydroelectric power plant installation activities, domestic disposal, and leaching from solid waste disposal sites. Consequently, the Yaglidere is of good quality according to the physico-chemical data by national and international permissible limits, but it is under pressure. These temporal and spatial scale effects indicate that water-monitoring schemes,need to be scaled-sensitive to water management for coming years.																	1230-1485	2083-5906					2017	26	4					1715	1723		10.15244/pjoes/68952								WOS:000408078000029

In accordance with this statement, the objective of this study was to assess the water quality of "Las Piedras" river located in an Andean basin with 6626 ha in Colombian Highlands. This study analyzed nutrient inputs from agricultural production, spatial crops distribution, human activities and their influence on the ecological state of the river. The evaluation integrated physicochemical and biological parameters in the indexes of water quality, pollution and the aquatic macroinvertebrates community. Results showed that aggregated crop fields occupy 25.2 % in the basin and the biological water quality through the Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP) index denotes the presence of tolerant-pollution organisms, additionally the biodiversity was low (Shannon H 1.1). The water quality in the river satisfies the Colombian regulation criteria for human consumption, even higher concentrations of nutrients in the lower area with 2.20 mg/L nitrates and 1.49 mg/L of phosphates, besides the loss of nutrients by runoff, which was 2.57 mg/L nitrates in the middle area and 0.18 mg/L phosphates in the upper area. In this sense, the nutrient concentration input increases toward the lower area of the basin because of the crop distribution. The agricultural land use modified the hydrological ecosystem services by decreasing the basin water regulatory capacity and nutrients input to the main stream.																	0188-4999						2017	33	3					361	375		10.20937/RICA.2017.33.03.01								WOS:000408053400001

With the rapid development of environmental technology, TiO2 particle has become promising material to adsorb fluoride ion because of its low cost, non-toxic, good chemical stability, and good sorption ability. This work used sol-gel and hydrothermal synthesis methods to prepare TiO2 particles and load them onto SiO2 particles. The physicochemical properties such as heat stability, particle size, and surface area of the resulting TiO2 adsorbents were characterized with various analytical methods. In addition, their adsorption abilities to fluoride were determined under various conditions including different initial fluoride concentration, pH and coexisting ions. The maximum adsorption capacity of the TiO2 adsorbents can reach up to 94.3 mg/g. The adsorption isotherms of fluoride onto the TiO2 adsorbents can be closely described by the Langmuir model, suggesting the monolayer adsorption process.																	0954-2299	2047-6523					2017	29	1					25	32		10.1080/09542299.2016.1269617								WOS:000408007400004

More and more attention thus has been paid to understand the release mechanisms of nutrients from river sediments, especially in estuary and water transfer areas. In this work, flume experiments were conducted to measure the release characteristics of total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) and nitrogen (TDN) from sediments collected from a river bed near Lake Tai under various flow conditions. The release of TDP and TDN was the most dramatic in the initial 30 min, then slowed down from 30 to 60 min, and finally achieved equilibria. Total amount of TDP and TDN released and their equilibrium concentrations were all significantly increased with the increase of flow rate, but slow down after a critical velocity was reached, which could be described as a Logarithmic relationship. A process-based mathematical model was established to describe the distribution of nutrients in the water columns and model simulations matched experimental data well. The re-suspension of sediments induced by flow rate higher than the threshold, is the dominant process affecting nutrient release from sediments.																	0954-2299	2047-6523					2017	29	1					70	77		10.1080/09542299.2017.1320950								WOS:000408007400009

Maritsa River, located in the Thracian Valley, Balkan Peninsula, on the territory of Bulgaria, Turkey and Greece, is one of them. Apart the water quantity, the performance of irrigated agriculture depends also on its quality. In the present study, the quality of Maritsa River water as a source for irrigation was assessed at two monitoring points (MPs) in Bulgaria-MP-1 (upper river) and MP-2 (middle course of the river). The samples were taken in June and August 2014 and 31 physicochemical and microbiological parameters were screened. Water sampling and preparation were performed according to Bulgarian standard complied with ISO standards. Physicochemical parameters were determined spectrophotometricaly, by Multi/340i SET and AAS. For the estimation of total and specific microbial load, selective chromogenic culture medium sheets were used. It was found that river water quality meets the requirements of Bulgarian standard for irrigation water with respect to: temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, total hardness, Ca, Mg, dissolved oxygen, BOD5, COD, N-NH4 (except for June), N-NO3, SO42-, P-PO4 (except for August), suspended solids (except for June), Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, Pb, Ni, Cd, Cr and As. Deviations from the standard were observed for all microbiological parameters at both MPs. The metal concentrations decrease in the order of Fe>Zn>Ni>Pb>Cr>Cu>As>Mn>Cd. Many significant correlations were revealed between controlled water parameters.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	7					4367	4374										WOS:000406355800007

Construction activities usually include dredging, filling, soil excavation or replacement; whereas the operations phase involves anchoring, shading, as well as extensive human activity in a small scale area. These activities may impact the marine environment through physical and chemical disturbances including an increase in the rate of sedimentation, discharge of chemicals, nutrient enrichment, increased wastewater, oil spills, increase in organic matter and heavy metals loads as well as solid waste generation, etc. This paper provides guidelines for conducting an EIA of a fishing port in a semi-enclosed water body, such as the Arabian Gulf or the Red Sea. The purpose of the guidelines is to outline issues that may be relevant to the design and construction of the port and to identify important factors for consideration in an EIA study. Elements to be studied in depth include impacts on water quality, sediment and habitat loss. The paper also provides suggested mitigation measures for minimizing potential impacts along with key aspects to be considered in the development of an adequate Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	7					4504	4516										WOS:000406355800023						
J	Sonmez, F				Sonmez, Feray			OCCURRENCE OF EPILITHIC DIATOMS IN A STREAM WITH CLEAN WATER CONDITIONS: HARINGET STREAM, TURKEY	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN												In the study, species composition of diatoms and their seasonal variations in epilithic associations occurring in a clean water stream (Haringet) were determined between January and December 2014. Sampling was performed monthly at three stations chosen in upper, middle and lower parts of the stream. Water temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solid matter, dissolved oxygen, flow rate, total hardness, total alkalinity, organic matter, salinity, nitrate, ortho-phosphate, sulfate and silica values in water were measured and analysed monthly. A total of 48 diatom taxa all belonging to pennales were identified throughout the study. Members of the genera Cymbella, Diatoma, Epithemia, Gomphonema, Navicula, Nitzschia and Surirella were common epilithic diatoms in the Stream. Nitzschia was the richest in species composition. Cocconeis pediculus, Cymbella affinis, C. helvetica, Diatoma elongata, Fragilaria acus, Gomphonema intricatum, G. olivaceum, Navicula radiosa, Nitzschia sigmoidea and Ulnaria ulna were noticable diatoms with respect to frequency of occurence and individual numbers in epilithon at all stations. Variations in occurrence of diatom species and their abundance were compared at stations and discussed in relation to physical and chemical properties of stream water. The physicochemical values yielded that Haringet Stream has Class I Water Quality according to the Inland Water Quality Criteria. This finding is somehow supported by the occurrence of certain clean water diatom species.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	7					4774	4782										WOS:000406355800059

Using historical climate dataset, stream flow, and water quality data, the improved export coefficient model (IECM) was selected to simulate changes in TN and TP loads characteristics under different hydrological year. The results demonstrate that: 1) The major source of TN and TP was livestock, which accounted for 49.4% of the total, followed by rural living (26%), land use (24.6%), while for the TP ranked differently from those of TN with rural living first (71%), followed by livestock (26.15%) and land use (2.85%); 2) The impacts of precipitation amount change on pollution load are relatively greater when compared to the impacts of rural living, livestock and poultry breeding and land use pollution load increase; the effects from rainfall increment leads to approximately 24% and 27% increases of TN and TP pollution load, respectively; 3) The high-risk areas of TN and TP load were distributed accordance to the amount of precipitation in different hydrological years and the most of the CSAs were locates beside the main stream. Total nitrogen and total phosphorous load per unit area in Miyun, Chicheng and Fengning counties were higher than others. These data will be useful and valuable in evaluating potential NPS pollution load for the control of watershed pollution in the future and understanding its migration and transformation in a large-scale watershed where meteorological and hydrological data are mutative.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	7					4808	4816										WOS:000406355800063

Water Quality Index (WQI), Metal Index (MI), Hazard Quotient (HQ), Hazard Index, and Cancer Risk were calculated in order to evaluate the water quality of these lakes. Correlation analysis revealed that Mn and Fe were derived from natural geological weathering processes and Pb, V, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Cd might have originated from anthropogenic sources. The results revealed that WQI of the remote lake fell into excellent water quality and urban lake fell into poor water quality, which is also supported by the MI calculation. Moreover, the HQ of Mn in urban lake showed values greater than unity suggesting its health risk to the local inhabitants. The cancer index values indicated "high" risk due to Cr, whereas Cd possesses "very low" cancer risk on local population residing nearby areas. This study provides the useful database and suggests for the regular assessment and policy formulation for safeguarding the natural water bodies in the region.

The translocation factors (TFs) and bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) for heavy metals in O. sativa and estimated daily intake (EDI) and health risk index (HRI) were measured. The samples were analyzed for heavy metals using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Pb and Cr concentrations in water samples within and near the electronic-waste dumping area exceeded water quality standards for surface water sources from the Pollution Control Department in the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment of Thailand (PCD). The Pb concentration in soil samples within the area also exceeded soil quality standards for habitat and agriculture from PCD. Most of the metals were highly concentrated in roots, except for Mn which has the highest concentration in leaves. Pb concentrations in rice grains exceeded the FAO/ WHO standard (0.2 mg/kg). The average TF values for heavy metals from the soil to roots, roots to stems, stems to leaves, and stems to grains were Mn > Pb > Ni > Cr, Mn > Cr > Ni > Pb, Ni > Pb > Mn > Cr, and Pb > Ni > Cr > Mn, respectively. The average BAF values in O. sativa were Mn > Ni > Pb > Cr. The EDI for Cr, Pb, Mn, and Ni via O. sativa consumption were 6.19, 6.02, 370.57, and 3.80 mg/kg/day, respectively. The HRI for Cr, Pb, Mn, and Ni via O. sativa consumption were 0.30, 1.50, 2.60, and 0.002, respectively.																	1080-7039	1549-7860					2017	23	5					1086	1098		10.1080/10807039.2017.1300856								WOS:000406365900009

Reducing groundwater extraction is a primary method for alleviating these problems. However, this reduction may create new pollution issues because of an increase in groundwater vulnerability. A case study was done using the DRAOTIC evaluation method (an improved DRASTIC method for organic pollutant in aquifer vulnerability; soil (S factor) has been updated by organic matter (O factor) in the method) for the Hun River Basin, northeastern China, where groundwater intensive extraction had caused serious environmental and hydrogeological problems. The assessment results show that moderate vulnerability level is the main vulnerability level in the Hun River Basin; high vulnerability level and low vulnerability level categories occupy a smaller area; while very high and very low vulnerability categories occupy the smallest area. By combining the predicted groundwater level distribution and DRAOTIC model, the responses of groundwater vulnerability to different groundwater extraction reductions could be studied. The results show that groundwater vulnerability levels increased as groundwater extraction was reduced; this is because the rising groundwater levels make it easier for pollution coming from the surface to reach the aquifer. The more the reduction in groundwater extraction, the greater the increase in the area with higher vulnerability levels, and the greater the increase in pollution risk.																	1080-7039	1549-7860					2017	23	5					1121	1139		10.1080/10807039.2017.1300858								WOS:000406365900011

The problem of coastal groundwater salinity was tackled by considering its hydrological, agronomic and economic aspects. Economic analysis for competitive use vs. regulated management regimes was carried out, considering constant and adaptive watering techniques. We concentrate on the farmers' perspective of water as an input in agriculture, and assess discounted net present value over a period of 30 years. The ultimate goal of this research is to raise the awareness of farmers and policy makers by demonstrating the economic impacts (from the farmer's point of view) of over-exploitation. Our findings for Apulia Region (Southern Italy) indicate that the slowness of the long-term effect of salinity and the ability of farmers to adapt irrigation profiles suggest broadening the perspective of policy intervention. For an effective management of this common resource, policy makers should follow a more comprehensive approach based on economic analysis.																	1943-815X	1943-8168					2017	14	1					59	72		10.1080/1943815X.2017.1351993								WOS:000406721700001

The monitoring was performed during the minimum and maximum rainfall periods. The concentrations of As, Cr, Fe, Ni, Pb and Zn in water exceeded the permissible limits set by the Interim National Water Quality Standards for Malaysia (INWQS). The risk index (RI) values determined for As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb and Zn in sediment presented a low degree of ecological risk. The order of the top three heavy metals measured in fish muscle was Zn >F e> Al. The estimated daily intake (EDI) of As and Cr exceeded the allowable limits in both rainfall periods. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) and translocation factor (TF) values of Zn in water hyacinth were 24.865 and 3.214, respectively. The concentrations of Cu and Zn in the plant tissue were significantly correlated (p < .05) with the concentrations of heavy metals in water. Overall, climbing perch and water hyacinth are excellent bioindicators of environmental impacts on water bodies.																	0275-7540	1029-0370					2017	33	7					637	651		10.1080/02757540.2017.1351553								WOS:000406482600004

Economic valuation of river restoration: An analysis of the valuation literature and its uses in decision-making	WATER RESOURCES AND ECONOMICS												This paper provides an analysis of existing non-market valuations of river restoration primarily in the United States and Europe. The goals of the river restoration in terms of ecosystem services are identified, as are the valuation methods used. More than two-thirds of the 38 river restorations reviewed sought to restore and protect fish populations, including in many cases threatened or endangered species. River restorations were also frequently undertaken to improve wildlife habitat, and water quality for boating. In terms of the use of non-market valuations in decision making, six of 38 restorations reviewed involved benefit-cost analyses or environmental assessments or equivalent decision documents. While both revealed preference and stated preference methods were used for valuing river restorations, the majority of restoration valuations (27 out of 38, about 70%) utilized stated preference methods such as the contingent valuation method (CVM) and choice experiments (CE). Annual willingness-to-pay per household estimated from the stated preference methods appear logically and positively related to the miles of river restored demonstrating weak scope.																	2212-4284					JAN	2017	17				SI		9	19		10.1016/j.wre.2016.12.001								WOS:000405585100002

Presence of excessive quantities of salts in groundwater is one of the major constrains in agro-well farming in Ganga-Sone Divide. Irrigation with poor quality waters may bring undesirable elements to the soil in excessive quantities affecting its fertility. Electrical conductivity (EC), sodium percentage (Na%), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) and residual sodium carbonate (RSC) can be used as criteria for finding the suitability of irrigation waters. The objective of this study is to evaluate the suitability of the irrigation water quality of the Ganga-Sone divide region. Major cations, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+ and major anions, Cl, SO4, HCO3, CO3 were determined from 26 observation sites selected by CGWB located in Ganga-Sone divide region to assess the hazards of salinity, sodium and bicarbonate. Out of selected sites, based on EC, 46% of the wells have medium salinity water, 50% of the wells have high salinity water and 4% of the wells have very high salinity water. Based on percent of sodium, 69% of the wells have excellent irrigation water quality, 19% of the wells have good irrigation water quality, 4% of the wells have permissible irrigation water quality, 4% of the wells have doubtful irrigation water quality and 4% of the wells have unsuitable irrigation water quality. Based on SAR, almost all the wells have the good quality of irrigation water. Based on RSC, 100% of the wells have good irrigation water quality.																	0972-9860	1875-8568					2017	14	3					75	83		10.3233/AJW-170028								WOS:000405333600010

These two villages are situated in the industrial area of Visakhapatnam district of Andhra Pradesh, India. These two villages are surrounded by industries like BHPV, HPCL, Zinc smelter and Coromondel fertilizers. During a preliminary survey in the two villages it was found that the residents of the two villages were suffering from dental flourisis. In view of this, the authors carried out experiments on the determination of physico-chemical characterization. The results were compared with BIS standards. In the two villages, concentration of fluoride was found to be in the range 1.432-2.944 mg/L. Water quality index (WQI) for the two villages was found to be 101.1 for the village Mulagada and 87.5 for the village Yeduruvanipalem. A strong correlation between phosphate and fluoride in the water of the village Mulagada was observed. From the results obtained it was inferred that the water of the two villages is unfit for human consumption.																	0972-9860	1875-8568					2017	14	3					91	101		10.3233/AJW-170030								WOS:000405333600012

Based on the historical data of Xijiu River from January 2012 to July 2014, 21 conventional water quality indicators were chosen according to the Surface Water Environment Quality Standard (GB3838-2002), with the application of fuzzy mathematics method for quantitative calculation and analysis. Two weight calculation methods and evaluation principles were used with four evaluation results obtained, suggesting that Xijiu River is identified as a class III water and reaches the minimum standard for drinking water. Specifically, the parameter of total nitrogen (TN) is assigned to class V, with ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) and total phosphorus (TP) ranked between class V and class III, permanganate to class III, dissolved oxygen to class II, and other 16 indexes to class I. Therefore, water purification process for Jiubin waterworks should be focused on removal of primary pollutants, comprising nutrients (N and P) and organic compounds. Detection and control of these contaminants in the headstream of Xijiu water ought to arouse more attentions.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	6					3778	3787										WOS:000405360700008

ODONATA AS INDICATORS OF RIVERINE HABITATS IN CENTRAL GREECE	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN												Riverine ecosystems offer many valuable services to human societies. Easy-to-use, reliable, inexpensive and efficient assessment and monitoring methods that investigate ecosystem integrity need to be developed for their conservation and protection. Such tools are the bio-indicators, with many recommending the Odonata (dragonflies) as a very appropriate indicator. This study is the first attempt to evaluate the potential of utilizing diversity indices on Odonata species for riverine habitats in Greece. The studied areas were along Sperchios River, Thermopyles spring and Kakavorema stream, located in Sperchios River Basin (Central Greece). The analysis based on the number of different species and three diversity indices, found differences among the three habitats. Sperchios River had the highest biodiversity and Thermopyles spring the lowest. This was also indicated by the water quality parameters and riparian area widths measured. Overall the differences found in these three habitats indicate the potential usefulness of Odonata for evaluating riverine habitats in Greece and the Balkans.

Waterbirds are potential sentinel species of these environments. To analyze how habitat conditions affect the health of Fulica americana, early-warning biomarkers, histopathology, somatic indices, and water quality were examined in two wetlands of the Basin of Mexico: Xochimilco, an urban wetland highly eutrophic with a mixture of pollutants, and Tecocomulco (the reference site), a rural wetland with hunting migratory birds in winter, and with some agricultural contaminants. Coots were collected over 1 year, and the birds were aged, eviscerated, and weighed. Liver samples were analyzed biochemically and histologically. Biomarkers revealed that coots displayed higher lipid peroxidation and elevated activities of gamma-glutamyl transferase and alanine aminotransferase, suggesting hepatic damage during autumn and winter. In Tecocomulco, coots during winter has the highest thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (as a measure of oxidative stress), which may be associated with the presence of predators. In Tecocomulco, the higher gonadosomatic index was detected in spring and summer, while in Xochimilco it was elevated in summer, indicating a delayed egg laying and reproduction in coots from the latter study site. In both wetlands, leukocyte infiltration, alone or combined with vasocongestion, reflected alterations in the inflammatory processes in liver throughout the annual cycle and thus potentially altered hepatic function and organism survival. In both wetlands, coots were permanent residents and chronically exposed to different stressors, suggesting damage may be irreversible with potentially adversely reproductive consequences.

Constructed treatment wetlands are low-cost, require minimal maintenance, can be implemented in a decentralized fashion, and contribute to ecosystem preservation. All of these reasons have brought treatment wetlands to the forefront for consideration by communities working to reduce CSOs and improve water quality, especially in small cities with limited resources. Goals of this study were to compare the removal of stormwater pollutants including total suspended solids (TSS), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) through subsurface flow (SSF) and free-water surface (FWS) wetland configurations. Additionally, each wetland system was composed of multiple basins optimized to remove certain stormwater contaminants. Stormwater, pond and synthetic waters were used to test the efficiency of contaminant removal. Over the course of two years, undergraduate students built wetlands and performed experiments to investigate contaminate removal efficiency. Overall, we found that both wetlands were effective in removing TSS, BOD and nitrate. BOD removal (up to 47%) occurred in the basins with highest organic content, and TSS (up to 82%), nitrate (58-88%) and nitrite (up to 50%) removal occurred in the basins with the highest sand content. The FWS configuration was advantageous for nitrate and nitrite removal, but was not significantly more effective than the SSF. We did not observe significant phosphate removal. Follow up studies will consider additional wetland configurations and operational methods.																			978-0-7844-8059-5				2017							10	33										WOS:000405216400002

It is surrounded by local agricultural activities and one seasonal river is terminated to it. Due to recent years the aquatic life of Zarivar Lake was under serious threat. Water quality study is one of the substantial measures that could be carried out since water quantity has been subjected to drought and low precipitation. Field study was planned in structured regular sampling stations in two straight routes and 24 samples in aggregation. Hypoxia potential investigation in closed shallow water body via current standards was done. Results of analysis demonstrate the potential of hypoxia in closed shallow water body. Significant effects of geological characteristics in hypoxia potential in figure out due to matrix analysis. Comparison of the results with the long-term data on water quality led the conclusion toward a suggestion on the effects of water catchments' activities during land use and land cover (LU/LC) changes over the years. Sources of nutrients associated biological parameters and macro indicators like submerged plants continue to verify and strengthen the relationship between the nitrogen loads of the LU/LC changes. The additional findings support the new hypoxia potential indicator in Zarivar Lake.																			978-0-7844-8059-5				2017							511	518										WOS:000405216400047

The World Bank also noted Panama's progress in the last decade by reporting a remarkable decrease in poverty and increase in access to improved water and sanitation (World Bank 2016). Despite improvements at the national level, pockets of extreme poverty persist in rural areas, especially in the comarcas, the indigenous provinces of Panama. The first two authors served with the U.S. Peace Corps as water and sanitation volunteers in two such remote communities on the Comarca Ngabe Bugle. Both observed how the presence of water and sanitation infrastructure could be counted as "coverage" by the national government and bilateral aid agencies. However, without regular water quality testing, system maintenance, or the presence of a regulating body, calculations of "coverage" fail to capture the reality facing Panama's rural poor. Field research focused on how the connectivity between urban and rural spaces affects water and sanitation system functionality, as well as the relationship between micro-watershed management and water quality.																			978-0-7844-8059-5				2017							687	693										WOS:000405216400061

Method: Environmental or river samples were assayed for NP by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique. Results: The concentration for NP measured in Xiangjiang River, ranging from 0.174 to 3.411 g/L with a mean value of 1.73 g/L, was lower than the Water Quality Criteria for NP of the US (6.6 g/L); however, the NP concentration was maintained at a higher level compare to the developed countries and other civil cities. NP concentration in downstream water was markedly higher than that both in midstream and upstream water. Tissue accumulation of NP was observed in aquatics. A ratio of mean concentration of NP in aquatic (chlamys farreri and hemiculter leucisculus) to that in river water was 241 and 1087, respectively. The presence of NP in tap water in two urban districts of Zunyi was common with a detectable rate reached 100.0%. Mean NP concentration in terminal tap water in Huichuan district was six times as high as Honghuagang district, which was above Standards for the Drinking Water Quality for Phenols of China (2 g/L). Conclusion: The pollution of NP in Xiangjiang River, tap water, and aquatic in Zunyi belongs to moderate or severe level in the world.																	0960-3123	1369-1619					2017	27	3					179	190		10.1080/09603123.2017.1332345								WOS:000405312700003	28587474

Integrated Weighted Overlay Model Using Inverse Distance Weightage for Assessing Groundivater Quality	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												Groundwater management is a potential solution to the global water crisis. This study assessed the groundwater quality at Mettupalayam, Tamil Nadu, India in order to determine its suitability for drinking. Groundwater samples were collected and their physicochemical parameters such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total hardness (TH), total dissolved solids (TDS), Ca2+, Mg2+, SO42- and Cl- were determined and benchmarked with standard drinking water requirements. The variations of these parameters were presented spatially. The groundwater is generally brackish and hard; and of low alkalinity and high salinity. CoriSequently, the groundwater in most parts of the study area is unsuitable for-drinking without treatment. It is recommended that point and nonpoint sources of groundwater pollution at Mettupalayam should be identified, monitored and managed in order to protect the groundwater resource.																	0119-1144						2017	20	1					26	32										WOS:000404946000004

This paper proposes an eutrophication model that describes the ecological behavior of a eutrophic closed ecosystem. This model was used to study the shallow lake - Stiucii located in Cluj area - Romania. The conceptual model analyzes a simply food web (nutrients, primary producers and secondary consumers), and reproduces the spatial and temporal concentration of water quality constituents. The results provided by the model show a good correlation with the recorded values of the studied parameters. The RMSE values for the total nitrogen, zooplankton biomass and ammonia obtained are: 0.2 for zooplankton, 0.21 for ammonia and 0.35 for total nitrogen. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Cost effective, continuous assessment of water quality able to rapidly and sensitively signal the occurrence of noxious compounds is still a demanding, open issue. Since continuous monitoring of aquatic environment using biosensors is not sustainable, we propose a multitiered i.e. a two-step approach: the first one based on dynamics of selected aquatic species (e.g. fish) able to sensitively respond to occurrence of various types of contaminants for triggering the second step based on biosensors for specifically outline the actual perturbing cause. We address this challenge by advancing a new system based on the ICB proprietary solution for assessing the dynamics of fish, using a 3D array of ultrasound transducers, to relate fish behavior to the quality of their environment. Whereas fish behavior is already an established indicator of water quality, there are rather few systems able to effectively monitor and quantitatively assess fish dynamics. Most of such systems are based on image acquisition and processing, and are quite dependent on water turbidity or light level. The ICB proprietary fish behavior monitoring system - deploys a non-invasive technique for continuous monitoring of fish position not dependent on water transparency or lighting and uses a method for data analysis to provide real time information on the dynamics/behavior of (selected) fish species according to water quality and different stimuli.

Arsenic Removal Potential Using Naturally Occurring Iron in Groundwater: A Geo-Spatial Assessment of Household Potable Drinking Water in Bangladesh	WORLD ENVIRONMENTAL AND WATER RESOURCES CONGRESS 2017: GROUNDWATER, SUSTAINABILITY, AND HYDRO-CLIMATE/CLIMATE CHANGE					17th Annual World Environmental and Water Resources Congress	MAY 21-25, 2017	Sacramento, CA	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Environm & Water Resources Inst				Arsenic removal from drinking water by co-precipitation with naturally occurring iron is considered a low-cost water treatment option at the household level but its efficiency depends on the concentration of iron as well as other competing phosphate and silicate salts present in water. This study utilizes the available household-level potable water quality data to estimate upazilla-wise arsenic removal efficiency applying a previously developed competitive sorption model. Assuming a neutral pH and no competing anions, for varying arsenic and iron concentration combinations in potable water, a removal efficiency ranging from 6.34% to 100% is estimated. But considering the interference of phosphate and silicate salts the maximum removal efficiency can potentially be reduced to 71.38%. Consequently, the population exposure in Bangladesh to arsenic contamination above WHO guideline value of 10 ppb, which is currently 32.59%, can only be reduced to 27.77% if interference of phosphate and silicate salts are taken into consideration. These estimates show that treatment of arsenic-contaminated water by co-precipitation with naturally occurring iron will only be marginally efficient for Bangladesh given the prevailing groundwater composition.																			978-0-7844-8061-8				2017							147	160										WOS:000404787300015

Evaluation of Soil Mixes in Shallow Bioretention Systems	WORLD ENVIRONMENTAL AND WATER RESOURCES CONGRESS 2017: GROUNDWATER, SUSTAINABILITY, AND HYDRO-CLIMATE/CLIMATE CHANGE					17th Annual World Environmental and Water Resources Congress	MAY 21-25, 2017	Sacramento, CA	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Environm & Water Resources Inst				Bioretention systems have become common in stormwater management. Bioretention typically requires a large footprint to accommodate required water quality volumes, which may not be feasible in high traffic areas such as ferry terminals, bridges, and other urban areas. Shallow, portable planters with sandy loam and compost were evaluated for zinc and copper retention using synthetic stormwater. The addition of vermiculite, tree bark, and plants (tufted hairgrass) were evaluated. The mass of zinc retained was consistently greater than 90% for both the vermiculite and tree bark systems, and greater than 80% for all planters in every test. Copper and zinc retention varied with each simulated storm event in the control and tufted hairgrass systems. To better understand copper and zinc distribution within the bioretention systems, simulations were conducted in Hydrus 2D. Model simulations showed copper and zinc accumulating near the surface, indicating physical processes are likely the primary mechanism of metal retention in the planters. Our results indicate that shallow bioretention systems, which have a relatively small footprint, effectively retain copper and zinc.																			978-0-7844-8061-8				2017							212	222										WOS:000404787300021

The activated sludge process is a complex process involving physical, chemical and biological processes. A rapid evaluation of the effluent water quality in activated sludge systems would help engineers improve operation conditions and consequently bring economic benefits to wastewater treatment plant. In this study, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used to inform an activated sludge model (ASM1) for the chemical and biological processes, serving to provide a rapid evaluation of effluent water quality. The CFD-ASM1 was validated with the use of measured data, such as the effluent concentrations of chemical oxygen demand, ammonium, and nitrate, from a full-scale activated sludge tank. This study also studied the impacts of air flow rate and bubble size on air volume fraction distribution in the activated sludge tank using the CFD-ASM1. The model developed in this study can further serve as a tool to optimize operation conditions (e.g., air flow rate and bubble size) of activated sludge systems at a low cost.																			978-0-7844-8063-2				2017							12	23										WOS:000404788200002

The potential impacts of urban stormwater have given rise to solutions such as Low Impact Developments (LID) to remove pollutants from entering river/ocean and provide groundwater replenishment/water supply benefits. The Broadway Neighborhood Stormwater Greenway (Project) is a joint partnership between City of Los Angeles, California State Water Resources Control Board, Water Replenishment District of Southern California, Santa Monica Bay Restoration Commission, and Geosyntec Consultants, to develop a neighborhood system of LID stormwater capture/infiltration in South Los Angeles. The Project is located in public right-of-way and retrofits segments of the Broadway neighborhood with stormwater LID designed to capture, infiltrate and treat stormwater runoff, recharge groundwater, and help address Los Angeles River Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) water quality requirements. Total Project cost was $ 4.9 million and has four levels of LID: parcel based (19 residential rain gardens/infiltration trenches); street-ends (eight dry wells); commercial green streets (four parkway infiltration swales); and subregional infiltration gallery (417,000-gallon underneath parking). Water quality monitoring with continuous flow meters are installed to quantify water quality/groundwater recharge. Design drainage area is approximately 45 acres and benefits from a total of tributary area of 220 acres. With its particular location above the "Los Angeles Forebay", the project is expected to recharge on average 41 acre-feet/year into the underlying Central Groundwater Basin. The Project meets TMDL requirements for the design drainage area through the removal of pollutants such as trash, bacteria, and metals. The Project provides educational, ecological, community benefits leading to a healthier, vibrant neighborhood.																			978-0-7844-8063-2				2017							82	96										WOS:000404788200006

We present a design case study of a multiport diffuser for a 1 MGD dense discharge into a shallow 60-foot wide river. CORMIX mixing zone modeling software was used to design the diffuser to achieve dilution to meet water quality criteria within a mixing zone for regulatory compliance. An iterative design process was employed using the CORMIX mixing zone model and the CorHyd internal diffuser hydraulics model. CORMIX simulates the multiport diffuser as a line source to predict downstream water column dilution values needed for regulatory compliance. CorHyd is used to (i) calculate port and pipe velocities, (ii) verify uniform discharge distribution from the ports, and (iii) determine the diffuser head requirements. To decrease the diffuser-induced near-field acceleration zone and enhance mixing, a fanned unidirectional multiport diffuser was designed. The diffuser riser lengths vary to conform to the river bathymetry. The riser ports were fitted with duckbill valves to maintain high port velocity over a range of effluent discharge rates. The design was optimized for dilutions at the mixing zone with port geometry, exit velocity, and spacing that allows individual plumes to merge by the end of the near-field and minimizes the potential for scouring the river bed.																			978-0-7844-8063-2				2017							97	111										WOS:000404788200007

A pilot wetland facility, in conjunction with a biofilm aeration facility, was constructed at Lake Maryout by Alexandria coast, where primary treated wastewater of 50,000 m(3)/day is being handled. The satisfactory results of water quality parameters of the pilot wetland effluent were compared with the performance of the wastewater-natural treatment facility located at Arcata Bay, CA. The results provide motivations for further large scale wetland applications in the available land of Maryout Valley where fresh water supplies are low. Highlights are presented on use of safe wastewater sludge and bio-solids for restoration of constructed and natural wetlands, which serve for coastal defense; e.g. at the Nile Rosetta headland, San Francisco Bay, and the Central Wetlands in Louisiana, USA.																			978-0-7844-8063-2				2017							126	139										WOS:000404788200009

Estimation of Surface Water Temperature of the Tigris River System in Iraq	WORLD ENVIRONMENTAL AND WATER RESOURCES CONGRESS 2017: WATER, WASTEWATER, AND STORMWATER; URBAN WATERSHED MANAGEMENT; AND MUNICIPAL WATER INFRASTRUCTURE					17th Annual World Environmental and Water Resources Congress	MAY 21-25, 2017	Sacramento, CA	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Environm & Water Resources Inst				Monitoring surface water temperatures (Tw) in lakes, rivers, and reservoirs is a key component of environmental management and influences water quality by affecting bio-geo chemical reaction rates, altering the saturation concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO), and influencing the susceptibility of fish to disease. Temperatures in the Tigris River, one of the largest rivers in the Middle East, are influenced by factors such as heat fluxes at the air-water and human activities such as direct discharge of water to the river. However, modeling and management of water temperature is limited by a paucity of in-situ data, which prevents calibration of models. In this study, we infill data gaps by estimating Tw using the thermal bands of both the Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM+ sensors. These satellite-based estimates, typically measured once or twice a month with 60-120m resolution, are then used to develop a regression model that relates daily water temperature to daily air temperature and river flow. These estimates are used to define the Tw boundary conditions for a hydrodynamic and water quality model of the Tigris River based on a 2D implementation of the CE-QUAL-W2 (W2) numerical model. Initial results suggest that there is a significant agreement between modeled and remotely estimated data of Tw. Results suggest that short-wave solar radiation is the most important factor that controls seasonal Tw variations. However, anthropogenic influence is observed as a result of return irrigation flows and flows from Tharthar Lake.																			978-0-7844-8063-2				2017							223	233										WOS:000404788200016

Several green infrastructure technologies on the Villanova University campus have been recently retrofitted to include real-time control to achieve this improved volume removal goal. These systems utilize the physical processes present in green infrastructure (infiltration, evapotranspiration, etc.) tomanipulate the hydrologic timing to optimize performance through actively controlled inflows and discharges from the system. The control is implemented through a cloud-native platform developed by OptiRTC, a technology firm focused on control of stormwater infrastructure. A modeling study was completed of a real-time controlled green and gray roof system on the Villanova University campus. The study site is comprised of an existing extensive green roof and an adjacent gray roof that has been retrofitted to capture excess runoff from the system. Stored runoff is actively released onto the green roof during dry periods to fully utilize the evapotranspiration potential of the green roof while increasing total capture from the system. The system as a whole demonstrates how forecast information, remote sensing, and self-learning components can be integrated into a green infrastructure system to optimize performance. The long-term continuous simulation compared performance of the green roof system to the performance prior to being retrofitted, allowing for the benefit of the real-time control to be evaluated.																			978-0-7844-8063-2				2017							357	364										WOS:000404788200028

This new type of SBR modified the original tank structure, utilizing fixed weir as the effluent pattern. We made a comparative analysis for effluent water quality between fixed weir SBR and original SBR. As a result, making the water level stable inside of water tank is a good method to raise the water quality of effluent. In conclusion, we believe that the fixed weir SBR can become one replaced type of SBR in the future.																			978-0-7844-8063-2				2017							497	505										WOS:000404788200041

As part of a larger reservoir reoperation study, a continuous simulation model of the Russian River watershed in California, USA, was developed using the Hydrologic Engineering Center's Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS). Modelling focused on quantifying soil moisture and reproducing observed runoff through the wet/dry annual cycles of a 60 year simulation period, 1950 through 2010. The Russian River model simulated soil moisture using the soil moisture accounting (SMA) and deficit and constant loss methods coupled with the Penman-Monteith evapotranspiration method. Model calibration focused on reproducing observed basin runoff signatures including flood flow-frequency, seasonal runoff, and the runoff hydrograph. Performance measures quantified the model's ability to reproduce observations and proved the model useful for subsequent reservoir reoperation analyses. This paper presents model development using HEC-HMS for continuous simulation of the Russian River watershed; steps include forming precipitation and evapotranspiration boundary conditions, initializing and calibrating model parameters, and evaluating results, to arrive at a final useful model.																			978-0-7844-8060-1				2017							12	21										WOS:000404786200002

Four major rivers, many smaller creeks, five wastewater treatment plants, and groundwater discharge to the Chehalis River. Flooding is a major problem in the relatively flat areas surrounding the cities of Chehalis and Centralia. As a result, construction of a flood-control dam in the upper basin has been proposed. One major concern of constructing a dam is the potentially severe impacts to fish health and habitat. The Chehalis River has routinely violated water quality standards for primarily temperature and dissolved oxygen. CE-QUAL-W2, a two-dimensional (longitudinal and vertical) hydrodynamic and water quality model, was used to simulate the Chehalis River, including free flowing river stretches and stratified (in summer) lake-like stretches. The goals of this research were to assess the flood retention structure's impacts to water quality, as well as river responses to potential climate change scenarios. In order to use the model to achieve these goals, calibration to field data for flow, temperature, and water quality constituents was performed for the years 2013 and 2014. Once calibration was complete, model scenarios for future climate conditions and dam operating regimes were conducted. Future conditions showed predictions of warmer water temperatures and slight changes to water quality conditions on the river. As fish in the area prefer cooler water temperatures, this could pose a threat to fish health and habitat. Flood retention structures with the purpose of flood retention only (only operating during times of flooding) gave model predictions for daily maximum temperature higher than structures that employed flood retention and flow augmentation (operating during all times of the year). This suggested the management of flow passage or retention by the dam is important for water quality on the river.																			978-0-7844-8060-1				2017							203	217										WOS:000404786200019

Modeling the Impact of Water Quality and Food Web Structure on Bull Trout in Two Washington Reservoirs	WORLD ENVIRONMENTAL AND WATER RESOURCES CONGRESS 2017: WATERSHED MANAGEMENT, IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE, AND WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT					17th Annual World Environmental and Water Resources Congress	MAY 21-25, 2017	Sacramento, CA	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Environm & Water Resources Inst				Mechanistic models of the hydrodynamics and water quality were developed for Lake Kachess and Lake Keechelus in the Yakima River basin of Eastern Washington. These models were coupled to a fish bioenergetics model and used to explore management strategies to improve water quality in the reservoirs affecting kokanee production. The models were also applied to evaluate the impacts of the proposed implementation of the Kachess Drought Relief Pumping Plant (KDRPP) projects. The public domain model, CE-QUAL-W2 Version 4 (Cole and Wells, 2016) was adapted to model the reservoirs. CEQUAL-W2 is a 2-dimensional (longitudinal-vertical) hydrodynamic and water quality model capable of predicting water surface, velocity, temperature, nutrients, multiple algae, zooplankton, periphyton, and macrophyte species, fish bioenergetics, sediment diagenesis, dissolved oxygen, pH, alkalinity, multiple CBOD groups, multiple suspended solids groups, multiple generic constituents (such as tracer, bacteria, toxics), and multiple organic matter groups, both dissolved and particulate. The model is set up to predict these state variables at longitudinal segments and vertical layers. Comparisons of field data to model predictions were made for water level, temperature, NH4-N, NO3-N, PO4-P, total N, Total P, total organic carbon, alkalinity, zooplankton, pH, chlorophyll a, and dissolved oxygen at multiple reservoir sites at various depths.																			978-0-7844-8060-1				2017							218	232										WOS:000404786200020

Many studies have measured pollutant loads from agricultural or urban landuses and majority of them have focused on total suspended solids (TSS), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) pollutant loading into watershed in a specific region. In some cases, the EMC or export load values reported in each of the studies have a wide range of magnitude for a specific landuse. The sources of the difference in the pollutant loading values for each of the landuses could be due to the region and physical characteristics (e.g. slope and soil type) of watershed, methods of measuring EMCs and loads, the number of samples taken from watershed outlet and rainfall intensity. This paper summarizes and combines some published EMC and load values separately categorized for urban and agricultural lanuses. Then, for each of the landuses, a box and whisker or statistic plots were created using median EMC and load values, which are reported in different literatures. Because the results of this study are supposed to be used as an input for Kentucky Nutrient Model (KYNM), the studies that report EMC and load values in State of Kentucky were incorporated in the data as much as possible. The provided range of EMC and load values could be very useful for the users of water quality models who need to have a holistic idea of pollutant magnitude released from each landuse in watershed outlets.																			978-0-7844-8060-1				2017							273	282										WOS:000404786200024

Estimating Risks for Water-Quality Exceedances of Total-Copper from Highway and Urban Runoff under Predevelopment and Current Conditions with the Stochastic Empirical Loading and Dilution Model (SELDM)	WORLD ENVIRONMENTAL AND WATER RESOURCES CONGRESS 2017: WATERSHED MANAGEMENT, IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE, AND WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT					17th Annual World Environmental and Water Resources Congress	MAY 21-25, 2017	Sacramento, CA	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Environm & Water Resources Inst				The Stochastic Empirical Loading and Dilution Model (SELDM) was used to demonstrate methods for estimating risks for water-quality exceedances of event-mean concentrations (EMCs) of total-copper. Monte Carlo methods were used to simulate stormflow, total-hardness, suspended-sediment, and total-copper EMCs as stochastic variables. These simulations were done for the Charles River basin upstream of Interstate 495 in Bellingham, Massachusetts. The hydrology and water quality of this site were simulated with SELDM by using data from nearby, hydrologically similar sites. Three simulations were done to assess the potential effects of the highway on receiving-water quality with and without highway-runoff treatment by a structural best-management practice (BMP). In the low-development scenario, total copper in the receiving stream was simulated by using a sediment transport curve, sediment chemistry, and sediment-water partition coefficients. In this scenario, neither the highway runoff nor the BMP effluent caused concentration exceedances in the receiving stream that exceed the once in three-year threshold (about 0.54 percent). In the second scenario, without the highway, runoff from the large urban areas in the basin caused exceedances in the receiving stream in 2.24 percent of runoff events. In the third scenario, which included the effects of the urban runoff, neither the highway runoff nor the BMP effluent increased the percentage of exceedances in the receiving stream. Comparison of the simulated geometric mean EMCs with data collected at a downstream monitoring site indicates that these simulated values are within the 95-percent confidence interval of the geometric mean of the measured EMCs.																			978-0-7844-8060-1				2017							313	327										WOS:000404786200028

The model tool contains three main modules; the pre-processing tool based GIS functions, the runoff calculation for water balance and nutrient load based on the theory of Generalized Watershed Loading Functions with a number of enhancements and modifications, and the routing calculation engaging with HEC-RAS model for the hydrodynamics and transport processes in river systems. All components are immersed into an open source GIS MapWindow software (www.mapwindow.org) as plug-ins. The modeling tool is programming in VB.NET, and designed to complement and interoperate with enterprise and full-featured under MapWindow GIS functions. A GIS-based numerical tool makes watershed and water quality studies easier by bringing key data and analytical components under one GIS (Geographic Information System) roof. Through the use of GIS, the model has the flexibility to clip, integrate and display a wide range of information (e.g., basins, streams, weather, land use, soils, point source discharges, water supply, withdrawals, nutrient loads, etc.) at a scale chosen by the user. Minimum data requirements and effective application are advantages of this modeling tool. The model has been verified and validated against available well-known watershed models and observation data obtained from real applications for watershed systems in USA and Vietnam.																			978-0-7844-8060-1				2017							373	383										WOS:000404786200033

In this lake, wind shear is the major driving force for flow hydrodynamics. The flow fields, nutrients and chlorophyll concentration in Beasley Lake were simulated using CCHE2D, a hydrodynamic and water quality model developed at the National Center for Computational Hydroscience and Engineering. The effects of runoff and sediment from upland watershed on the lake water quality were taken into accounted. The simulated results were validated using field measurements. It was found that the chlorophyll concentration is greatly affected by suspended sediment concentration in the lake.

Agricultural Drainage in the Northeastern US: Past History and Future Challenges	WORLD ENVIRONMENTAL AND WATER RESOURCES CONGRESS 2017: WATERSHED MANAGEMENT, IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE, AND WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT					17th Annual World Environmental and Water Resources Congress	MAY 21-25, 2017	Sacramento, CA	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Environm & Water Resources Inst				Agriculture drainage increased from the early 1900s to the early 1980s. During the 1970s and 1980s increasing environmental concerns increasingly viewed agricultural drainage as being against the public's best interests. The Clean Water Act amendments in 1977 and the Food Security Act of 1985 all had an effect on agricultural drainage. Water quality effects of agricultural drainage projects started to be reported in the literature in the 1970s and 1980s. There were a number of projects conducted in the Northeast. To address water quality concerns, some controlled drainage systems were installed on the Delmarva Peninsula in the 1990s. Research has shown subsurface drainage can transport large amounts of nitrogen to surface waters. New York has a large dairy population, so manure is the largest input of nitrogen to surface problems in a number of watersheds. Also of concern is the rapid transport of nitrates and bacteria by preferential flow to subsurface drains when liquid manure is spread on fields. On the Delmarva Peninsula poultry manure has been a great concern for many years of in the Chesapeake Bay and Inland Bays watersheds. With the release of the TMDL by EPA in 2010 for the Chesapeake Bay it has become more of a concern																			978-0-7844-8060-1				2017							439	452										WOS:000404786200038

The Total Phosphorus with Point and Non-Point Inflows to Great Lakes-A Critical Review and GLWQA Targets	WORLD ENVIRONMENTAL AND WATER RESOURCES CONGRESS 2017: WATERSHED MANAGEMENT, IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE, AND WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT					17th Annual World Environmental and Water Resources Congress	MAY 21-25, 2017	Sacramento, CA	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Environm & Water Resources Inst				The occurrence of algae blooms in the US waterbodies has become an annually recurring phenomenon. Lake Erie of the Great Lakes (North America) has been experiencing significant and harmful algae-blooms (HABs) during the mid-July to mid-September for more than ten (10) years now. The watersheds in the US are significantly affected by algae-bloom formations during the summer months, and, this has been a vicious cycle that the point and non-point wastewater effluents contribute nutrients to waterbodies, specifically during the Spring time, and the need to draw those intake waters to effectively treat those complex algal-blooms forming during the summer time in maintaining the uninterrupted supply of the potable water to cities and towns. Good reductions of total phosphorus (TP) loadings to Great Lakes, specifically to the Lake Erie, were accomplished compared to the 1970s; however, the non-point source TP loading to Lake Erie has been significant and varying year-to-year. More effective TP estimation methodology with respect to the phosphorus discharging sources will be required. Additional TP reductions are necessary toward a good water quality of Great Lakes. Interim open water TP concentrations and loadings are in effect since 2012, until updated. The Phosphorus Task Committee has recommended that March to July total Spring phosphorus loads should be reduced, and some of the basins of Lake Erie the nutrient load must be reduced as much as by 40%. The best management practices (BMPs) have been identified and recommended to be put into practice. In this work, authors focused on: Great Lakes' water-asset; nutrient TP loadings to Great Lakes and effects; the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement (GLWQA), on nutrient TP concentration and loading targets; TP including the dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) loading targets to the Lake Erie; a review on Lake Michigan; and, the binational (Ca and USA) action plans for TP reductions and, nutrient and excessive algae-bloom control requirements.																			978-0-7844-8060-1				2017							453	467										WOS:000404786200039

To account for a range of uncertainty in future conditions through 2100, a scenario-based approach was developed using climate projections available from Couple Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate model simulations and sea level rise projections consistent with National Research Council (NRC) and the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Report 5 (AR5). The performance of the Central Valley water system was evaluated for a range of metrics including water deliveries, water quality, hydropower, flood control, recreation, fish, and wildlife habitats, ESA species, flow dependent ecological resiliency and the economic impacts of water supply changes using an integrated model package that simulates the federal Central Valley Project, the State Water Project and local system operations and regulatory requirements. The study also included the development and evaluation of a range of water management actions that can help reduce or manage future risks posed by potential changes in climate and socioeconomic conditions. Seven adaptation portfolios were explored that each consisted of a variety of water management actions. These thematic portfolios were evaluated to determine their effectiveness in adapting to potential risks posed by future socioeconomic and climate changes and to assess tradeoffs between their relative performances.																			978-0-7844-8060-1				2017							558	566										WOS:000404786200048

In coastal areas, natural hazards such as flood can significantly threat the coastal infrastructures' functionality. One way to evaluate the infrastructures performance during flooding is to measure its reliability. Reliability of the system is regarded as the probability of successful operation within the assumed time period. In this study, a framework is presented to analyze the wastewater treatment plants reliability during the time of flooding. The case study is New York City which have had experienced severe storms during the past decades and two major disasters in the last 5 years. Here, the reliability is referring to the ability to maintain water quality standards of effluent in wastewater. In this way, the effluent concentration during flooding is considered as a random variable and it is compared with the discharge standards. The effluent concentration is computed by considering the status of different unit operations of WWTP during the flooding time, which may cause a disturbance and/or reduction in the unit's performance. For effluent concentration, different distributions functions are fitted and the water quality reliability of all different distributions are compared. The expected compliance with the discharge standards is computed by assuming a level of confidence which shows the reliability of the system. Results show the significant value of quantifying reliability to assess the performance of WWTP. The methodology can be applied to other coastal settings that are subject to coastal and inland flooding.																			978-0-7844-8060-1				2017							630	641										WOS:000404786200053

The goal of this research is to develop a modeling ensemble for estimating sediment transport within large-scale mountainous catchments (>1000 km(2)). The results from four sediment modules inserted into a common hydrologic framework are presented to quantify uncertainty and improve predictability. The ensemble includes empirical modules: monovariate rating curve (MRC) and the Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (MUSLE), a stochastic module: multi-variate regression using a generalized linear model (GLM) and a physically-based module: Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM) sediment model. Calibration results from a multi-objective optimization routine are presented that optimize parameters and identify performance tradeoffs. The GLM module had the overall highest performance for both daily (NSE=0.84) and eventbased (NSE=0.99) predictions. The MRC module performed well under both time steps (NSE=0.64, NSE=0.91). The MUSLE module had the highest performance in percent bias (0.56%) of all the modules, though it performed poorly in timing and variability for both time steps (NSE=0.22, NSE=0.49). The DHSVM module performed the poorest under the daily simulation (NSE=-0.24), but the skill was greatly enhanced for event-based predictions (NSE=0.96) reflecting the influence of temporal discretization. This work highlights the tradeoffs in sediment prediction across a range of model structures with key differences in daily versus event-based model performance.

Characteristic Spatiotemporal Scales of Runoff and Sediment at the Plot Scale: Implications to Sediment Transport Modeling	WORLD ENVIRONMENTAL AND WATER RESOURCES CONGRESS 2017: HYDRAULICS AND WATERWAYS AND WATER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS ANALYSIS					17th Annual World Environmental and Water Resources Congress	MAY 21-25, 2017	Sacramento, CA	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Environm & Water Resources Inst				Changing climate and topography gradients are factors that collectively account for the variability in water and sediment fluxes in large agricultural systems. This variability hinders the effective management and monitoring of water quality and nutrient cycling, and emanates from the characteristic spatiotemporal scales of runoff and sediment processes for both the smaller and larger systems. The aim of this study is to describe these characteristic spatiotemporal scales at the plot scale by accounting for the interplay between relevant erosion processes and the forcing characteristics. Two experimental cases with uniform slope are considered, rainfall simulators are used to generate rainfall, and runoff and sediment are continuously measured at a downstream weir. Our results show how the coevolution of the aforementioned processes affect the characteristic spatiotemporal scales of runoff and sediment transport. A qualitative assessment of the coevolution of the dominant processes and their impact on the hydrologic response and landscape evolution at the plot scale, combined with the observed spatial features of the plot throughout the rainfall event provide insight into the interplay between these processes. This study is a step towards understanding patterns of runoff and sediment and the associated propagation across scale, as well as informing sediment transport modeling.																			978-0-7844-8062-5				2017							429	438										WOS:000404784900039

Problems that needed priority attention included contaminated sediment, poor water quality, and lost or altered habitat. The transport of nutrients, sediments and contaminants plays an important role on the biogeochemistry, ecology and health of the bay. Local, state and federal agencies have studied the problems caused by excessive nutrients and contaminated sediments. In 1989 Gottlieb et al. deployed tracked drifters from six locations in the bay to map flow patterns. In 2015 Hamidi et al. examined the role of circulation and heat fluxes in the formation of stratification and hypoxia in the bay. Their hydrodynamic model calculates horizontal dispersion using the Smagorinsky turbulence closure model. In 2014 Nguyen et al. used a hydrodynamic model to examine circulation and exchange in the Saginaw Bay-Lake Huron system. Their model was tested against data from a Lagrangian drifter experiment. For this study drifters were deployed in the bay in 2014. Locations of drifters were tracked using GPS transmitters, and those locations were used to calculate one-point dispersion statistics. A Lagrangian particle-tracking model was used to simulate the drifter trajectories. Cross-bay and along-bay velocities were used to compute diffusivities in those directions for observed and simulated drifter tracks. Diffusivity values were estimated using statistical analysis of particles released from a point source in isotropic turbulent flow. The field-data validated diffusivities will be used to improve predictions of the transport and fate of nutrients and sediments in the bay.																			978-0-7844-8062-5				2017							439	448										WOS:000404784900040

The quality of water delivered in a WDS is difficult to maintain and monitor, as water quality can degrade within a water distribution system's pipes. A network of online monitoring stations designed to sample water quality in real-time, and to be strategically placed in a water distribution system has proven an effective method to monitor water quality and provide early warning of a contaminant intrusion. A difficult task for an online monitoring station is to distinguish natural variability in water quality from variability caused by the presence of a contaminant in the water. Prior studies have shown how common water quality indicators (free chlorine, pH, conductivity, total organic carbon) respond to contaminants, and methods to ease the task of recognizing true contaminant presence. This work proposes an objective function incorporating the uncertainty in a monitoring station's detection employed in the framework of a genetic algorithm to place sensors at locations which minimize the expected consequence of a contamination event, and where water quality data are most indicative of true contamination events. Early warning systems composed of fixed water quality stations and inline mobile water quality sensors are designed in a multi-objective framework for a sample water distribution system.

Potential for contaminations and cross connections make it difficult to ensure that the water being delivered to consumers is truly of high quality. The placement of water quality monitoring stations within a WDS system has proven a successful method to prevent the delivery of contaminated water. The locations of monitoring stations in a WDS is critical to the performance of a water quality monitoring station network (early warning system or EWS); ideally sensors will be placed at a limited number of locations which can quickly detect all contamination events. Designing a EWS to protect against every possible contamination event is computationally infeasible; however it is crucial that high impact contamination events will be detected. In this study a contamination event is defined as an intrusion taking place at a specific junction and time in a WDS. A probability distribution is generated according to the portion of a network's population served by water that flows "downstream" from a specific junction at a specific time, within a defined interval of time; this portion of population would be most at risk to exposure of the corresponding junction and time. The newly generated probability distribution is then used for sampling a set of contamination events used to design an EWS. The downstream nodes are calculated using breadth first search and the nodal populations are calculated according to the temporal demands. The relative consequence of a junction being contaminated is calculated using steady state and dynamic hydraulic models; elevating the need to perform numerous complex water quality simulations. Monitoring station networks designed using the proposed importance sampling technique and traditional random sampling are compared.

This study presents a new analysis approach based on clustering insights of water distribution networks connectivity for enhancing its security. Clustering is utilized herein for dynamically exploring the system behavior. Through clustering formations, addition of network components such as pipes and tanks for the layout problem, and valves for its operation - contamination spreading is controlled and contained. The developed methodology is demonstrated on several example applications, showing its capabilities to provide a decision support tool for contaminant control and containment in water distribution systems.

A critical component of CWS, online quality monitoring, involves a network of sensors that assess water quality and alert an operator of contamination. Utilities developing these monitoring systems are faced with the decision of what locations are optimal for deployment of sensors. The TEVA-SPOT software was developed to analyze the vulnerability of systems and aid utilities in designing sensor networks. However, many small utilities do not have the technical or financial resources needed to effectively use TEVA-SPOT. As a result, a sensor placement algorithm (i. e. Water Quality Sensor Placement Tool -WQSPT) was developed and implemented in a commercial network distribution modeling software (i.e. KYPIPE) as a simple tool to aid small utilities in sensor placement. The developed tool was validated using 12 small distribution system models and multiple contamination scenarios for the placement of one and two sensors. Results were compared with data from identical simulations runs in TEVA-SPOT to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Because the proposed algorithm uses a simple complete enumeration strategy for sensor placement, the algorithm was able to select the same or superior nodes to those selected by TEVA-SPOT.																			978-0-7844-8062-5				2017							534	548										WOS:000404784900050

While widely used, the approach has not been examined fully on how it impacts the modeling fidelity. This study intends to evaluate these consequences in a typical water distribution system. We first analyzed tracer test data at 13 locations using a calibrated EPANET model with generalized water demand patterns. Modeling results agree with actual measurements in six locations with high water demand and flow velocity near the storage tank, while fail to replicate the variations in network abundant of dead- ends and Tee/ Cross junctions. Then we further investigated the causes of model inaccuracy using real- time water demand data covering similar to 35% water users. This paper compares several levels of pipe skeletonization and water demand aggregation in water age simulation, and shows significant impacts on water age results because of discrete water demand at pipe nodes. The analysis reveals varying flow properties and the movement of highly aged water parcels in two types of pipe configurations. These results have the implications on network modeling and further studies of water quality simulations.																			978-0-7844-8062-5				2017							593	601										WOS:000404784900055

In the case of a contamination event the contaminated section of the water distribution system should be located, isolated and cleaned before it can be returned to regular service. Depending on the specific contaminant, the cleaning process mainly includes flushing and disinfection. All of the disinfection methods (for example: tablet, continuous and slug) require that the disinfectants will have minimal contact time (T) in a predefined concentration (C) with the pipes and the system's apparatuses. The regulatory agencies, such as the Ministry of Health in Israel or the American Water Work Association, publishes procedures for the disinfection of water systems in which usually only a single water main is considered and no specific procedures are given for larger portions of the water system. This paper presents an optimal operation plan for the disinfection of water distribution systems using the slug feed method while considering the injection times, flow rates and drainage locations while keeping variable disinfection C*T values in different areas of the network. The method is a two stage GA-EPANET procedure. It is demonstrated on a small real-world network section.

It's necessary to establish of a set of water quality early warning system which can quickly and accurately identify contamination. The existing anomaly detection methods are either simple fusion of abnormal judgment results from single index [1], or correlation analysis of multiple parameters at the cost of high time complexity. Aimed to solve these problems, this paper describes a multivariate correlation analysis method based on the longest common subsequence (LCSS) analysis combined with Dempster- Shafer (D- S) evidence theory. The proposed method utilizes adaptive sliding window scale to acquire water quality parameter time sequence, LCSS to describe similarity between different water quality series fluctuation, and D- S evidence theory to calculate abnormal probabilities. The ROC curve is introduced to verify the algorithm performance. Tested by data from the laboratory contaminant injection experiment, this approach shows nice ability in dealing with time series deformation problem rapidly, which to a certain extent can improve the reliability of multi- index correlation degree analysis, and ultimately reduce the abnormal water contamination event detection false alarm rate.																			978-0-7844-8062-5				2017							624	636										WOS:000404784900059

To tackle these challenges, new sustainable water management strategies, like water sensitive urban design (WSUD), have been gaining increasing interest in the last couple of years. The software tool UrbanBEATS (Urban Biophysical Environments and Technologies Simulator) supports decision makers in the planning and implementation of such WSUD strategies, by combining and processing spatial and non-spatial data (e.g. land use, population, elevation, rainfall/ climate). In the field of water distribution system (WDS) analysis, the implementation of decentralized rainwater harvesting or gray water reuse measures can strongly influence the water quality performance of an existing central pipe system. Here, we show how demand reduction scenarios modelled with UrbanBEATS through the implementation of different water efficiency or water use restrictions impact WDS quality analysis undertaken in Epanet2.					rathnayaka, suranji/0000-0001-5454-8336; Zischg, Jonatan/0000-0002-7506-1073; Bach, Peter/0000-0001-5799-6185; Sitzenfrei, Robert/0000-0003-1093-6040														978-0-7844-8062-5				2017							692	702										WOS:000404784900064

When dissolved in ultrapure water, adsorption of the ECs followed the trend of AH > MS > PE, with a positive effect of the adsorbent dose. According to the analysis of the adsorption isotherms and adsorption kinetics, PAC showed strongly higher adsorption efficiency in both capacity and velocity of the adsorption, in agreement with its higher mesoporosity. Equilibrium isotherm data were fitted by Langmuir and Freundlich models. Pseudo-second order kinetics modeled very successfully the adsorption process. Finally, the effect of the presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the water matrices (ultrapure water, surface water and two effluents from wastewater treatment plants) on the adsorption of the selected ECs onto PAC was established, as well as its performance on the removal of water quality parameters. Results show a negative effect of the DOM content on the adsorption efficiency. Over 50% of organic matter was removed with high PAC doses, revealing that adsorption onto PAC is an effective technology to remove both micro-pollutants and DOM from water matrices.																	1093-4529	1532-4117					2017	52	8					727	734		10.1080/10934529.2017.1301751								WOS:000404661400004	28358290

Drought assessment using drought indices have widely conducted for drought monitoring. Remote-sensing-based indices defined as an index which using remote sensing data for mapping the drought condition in particular area or region. This research aims to compare remote-sensing-based drought indices, namely TCI, VCI and VHI to obtain a better understanding about the differentiation between each index, and their application for monitoring drought in East Java on El Nino year 2015. LST and EVI data were used to construct the indices. The result showed, each index proved to be useful, quick, sufficient and inexpensive tool for drought monitoring. However, each index has its differences. TCI proved to be detected drought sensitively in dry season or months when high temperature occurred. While VCI detected drought more sensitive in wet season as well (December-January-February to May) than TCI and VHI. Meanwhile, VHI which the enhancement of TCI and VHI has combined two indicators to provide better comprehension about drought occurrence.																	1755-1307						2017	54								UNSP 012009	10.1088/1755-1315/54/1/012009								WOS:000404120100009

Based on satellite imagery classification, protected region covers 885.76 ha (22.71%), while cultivated region occupied 3,041.69 ha (77.29%) in 2011. It means that the land use and covers change (LUCC) to be cultivated rapidly increase. Those conditions had impacted positively to the local economy development, however it had negatively degrades water quality in Ciputen Agung river. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to analyze LUCC impacts to the water quality (WQ) in Cipunten Agung watershed. Supervised classification method and Water Pollution Index (WPI) approach were correlated to define the optimal solution to reduce the rate of LUCC. The result shows that area of cultivation tree and paddy field are higher than others in midstream, and settlement is higher in downstream, particularly at riparian landscapes. The concentration of total phospate, nitrite, and nitrate which indicated from agriculture land were complies with WPI class 2 until 4 standart. The rate of LUCC of Cipunten Agung watershed and the density of settlement are potential to be the driving factor of water quality degradation. Regional planning with ecology approach was recommended for sustainable development of Cipunten Agung Wateshed.																	1755-1307						2017	54								UNSP 012025	10.1088/1755-1315/54/1/012025								WOS:000404120100025

The main causes of the problems encountered in the Cidanau Watershed are associated with the human factors, especially encroachment and conversion of forest into farmland. The encroachment has made most forest in Cidanau Watershed become bare land. To preserve the ecological function of agroforestry systems in Cidanau Watershed, monitoring of the condition of the vegetation canopy in agroforestry systems is really needed. High intensity thinning of crown density due to deforestation can change stand leaf area index dramatically. By knowing LAI, we can assess the condition of the vegetation canopy in agroforestry systems. LAI in this research was obtained from Hemispherical Photographs analysis using the threshold method in HemiView Canopy Analysis Software. Our research results indicate that there are six types of agroforestry in Cidanau Watershed i.e. Sengon Agroforestry, Clove Agroforestry, Melinjo Agroforestry, Chocolate Agroforestry, Coffee Agroforestry, and Complex Agroforestry. Several factors potentially contribute to variations in the value of LAI in different types of agroforestry. The simple assumptions about differences ranges of LAI values on six types of agroforestry is closely related to leaf area and plant population density.																	1755-1307						2017	54								UNSP 012050	10.1088/1755-1315/54/1/012050								WOS:000404120100050

In monitoring program biotic indices are now widely established in water quality monitoring around the world, including in the tropical countries. The aim of this study was to reveal the ecological status of Cisadane River's headwaters in inside and outside of Mount Halimun-Salak National Park by using benthic macroinvertebrates. The research was conducted in the headwaters of Cisadane River located in Mount Halimun-Salak National Park. Macroinvertebrates were collected from four sites, i.e. inside the park (station 1, 2, 3, and 4) and from two sites outside the park (station 5 and 6). Collections were made twice a month, starting from April to June 2015 by means of Surber sampler (frame area 30x30 cm). A total of 65 genera from 38 families and 11 orders were found in the river. The results showed that based on diversity index, Lincoln Quality Index (LQI), Family Biotic Index (FBI), and Stream Invertebrate Grade Number Average Level 2 (SIGNAL 2), stations located within national park were ecologically better than those outside national park. Rivers with well-preserved riverside vegetation, as in the national park area have greater ecological status.																	1755-1307						2017	54								UNSP 012023	10.1088/1755-1315/54/1/012023								WOS:000404120100023

It is 119 km long with a catchment area of 476 km2. It flows from Bogor Regency and crosses Bogor City, Depok City, and Jakarta before finally flowing into Java Sea through Jakarta Bay. The water quality in Ciliwung River has degraded. Many factors affect water quality. Understanding the relationship between land use and surface water quality is necessary for effective water management. It has been widely accepted that there is a close relationship between the land use type and water quality. This study aims to analyze the influence of various land use types on the water quality within the Ciliwung Watershed based on the water quality monitoring data and remote sensing data in 2010 and 2014. Water quality parameters exhibited significant variations between the urbandominated and forest-dominated sites. The proportion of urban land was strongly positively associated with total nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen concentrations. The result can provide scientific reference for the local land use optimization and water pollution control and guidance for the formulation of policies to coordinate the exploitation and protection of the water resource.																	1755-1307						2017	54								UNSP 012026	10.1088/1755-1315/54/1/012026								WOS:000404120100026

The hair mineral content was compared in Koniks raised in a barn and a nature reserve. The foals bred in the reserve were divided into two groups based on the area occupied by the herds from which they originated. Hair samples were collected from 53 Koniks born over two consecutive years. Green forage and hair samples were analyzed to determine the concentrations of macro-elements (P, K, Mg, Ca and Na) and microelements (Cu, Zn, Mn and Fe). Water quality was evaluated based on its pH and the concentrations of N-NO3, N-NH4, P-PO4, K, Ca, Mg, Na and Cl. The hair coats of foals raised in the reserve had a significantly higher content of K and Na than the hair coats of stabled Koniks. Significant differences in the concentrations of K, Na, P and Ca in the hair coat were also noted between the two groups of horses in the reserve. The hair coats of foals born and raised in a stable had a higher content of Fe, Mn, and Cu. No significant differences in the hair macromineral content were found between the sexes. As regards microminerals, higher concentrations of Fe and Mn were determined in the hair coats of mares. Environmental and management conditions exerted a significant effect on the mineral composition of the hair coat of Polish Konik horses. Differences were observed not only between foals raised in a barn and a nature reserve, but also between Koniks kept in the reserve.																	1644-2296						2017	22	3					857	867		10.5601/jelem.2016.21.4.1340								WOS:000404270000001

EVALUATION OF GRAPHICAL AND MULTIVARIATE STATISTICAL METHODS FOR CLASSIFICATION AND EVALUATION OF GROUNDWATER IN ALATHUR BLOCK, PERAMBALUR DISTRICT, INDIA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												This paper assesses the quality of water using different graphical and statistical methods like Durov, Schoeller, Piper - Tri linear diagram, Box and Whisker plot for three seasons in the study area Alathur block, Perambalur District. The graphical representation provides limitations compared with the multivariate method for large data sets. A total of 10 groundwater samples were collected from hand dug wells in this area and they were analyzed for various physical and chemical parameters. The sequence of the dominance of the major ions are in the following order Na+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > K+ and Cl-> SO42-> HCO3- > NO3-. The dominating hydrochemicals of facies of groundwater are Ca-Cl and mixed Ca-Mg-Cl and alkaline earth metals (Ca2+, Mg2+) and strong acids (SO42-, Cl-) that dominate over alkalis (Na+, K+) and weak acids like HCO3-, CO3-. Based on the analytical result, groundwater in the study area is generally hard to very hard, slightly alkaline to brackish in nature. This indicates that leaching of salts, rock weathering and evaporation are among the most dominant processes in controlling water quality. For industrial purposes, the quality of water was assessed by using the Langeliner saturation index (LSI) and Ryznar saturation index (RSI). Seasonal variations in different parameters were also determined.																	1589-1623	1785-0037					2017	15	3					105	116		10.15666/aeer/1503_105116								WOS:000403811200009

FORECASTING DISSOLVED OXYGEN AND BIOCHEMICAL OXYGEN DEMAND IN A RIVER WITH NUMERICAL SOLUTION OF ONE-DIMENSIONAL BOD-DO MODEL	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												As a main measure of water quality, the concentration of DO always gets much attention. The chemical reactions in water bodies are mainly related to DO, so the concentration of DO has much relationship with the water quality. Biochemical oxygen demand and dissolved oxygen (BOD-DO) model is used to show the relationship of the concentration of BOD or DO with the physical characteristic of the river. For this model, it is difficult to determine the analytical solution, so numerical solution of the model is obtained with Chebyshev orthogonal polynomial. With this method, the model is rewritten with differential form, and then the four order differential of the oxygen deficit was expressed with the Chebyshev orthogonal polynomial, which had coefficients. Lastly, a simulation test was conducted to verify the rationality of the model. The actual BOD and oxygen deficit values are calculated using the original model. With the actual values and formulas, the coefficients could be solved and the predicted values calculated. The forecasting values of concentration of BOD and DO are compared with the actual values. Five statistical measures were used to evaluate the predicted results.																	1589-1623	1785-0037					2017	15	3					323	333		10.15666/aeer/1503_323333								WOS:000403811200023

DYNAMICS OF LAND COVER CHANGES AND DELINEATION OF GROUNDWATER RECHARGE POTENTIAL SITES IN THE AGUANAVAL AQUIFER, ZACATECAS, MEXICO	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Currently, human activities in ecosystems have led to adverse effects in aquifers, with the main consequences being the loss of vegetation and water availability. This paper presents a multi-criteria qualitative matrix which is developed to assign different values which estimate the potential of a specific land cover to be a groundwater recharge site. The matrix was coupled with a quantitative analysis of land cover changes in the Aguanaval aquifer, within the central zone of Zacatecas State, Mexico. Land cover changes were determined using four satellite images from 1986, 1992, 2002 and 2016. The results indicate that from 1986 to 2016 croplands and pasture increased by approximately 33,483 ha, but the most important change for croplands and pasture occurred between 2002 and 2016 with an increase of 31,607 ha; mixed forest land class occupied 16.49% in 1986, but an increase in the period from 1986 to 1992 reached 18.69% and decreased to 13.30% and 11.76% for 2002 and 2016, respectively. For the mixed rangeland covering 61.26% of the aquifer area, the major land cover in 1986 decreased substantially in 2016 reaching only 17.09% of total area. It was identified that the sites with a high recharge potential are located in the east and central-southeast and the medium recharge potential sites are located in the central part while the low potential sites are distributed to the north and southwest side of the aquifer.

GIS BASED WATER SUITABILITY CLASSIFICATION FOR SHEEP - A CASE STUDY OF SAVADKOOH WATERSHED, MAZANDARAN, IRAN	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Water resources are of utmost importance for proper grazing management and optimal use of rangelands. In the present study, suitability of lands from the perspective of water resources is modeled regarding sheep as the grazing livestock. FAO (1991) method was used for the model. The study area is located at Savadkooh, Mazandaran province of Iran. The model comprised three submodels; water quality, water quantity and the distance of water resources to grazing area. According to the climatic conditions and number of permanent water resources, there was no shortage in water quantity. Results of water analysis also revealed no restricted elements for sheeps to drink the water. In the study area, in terms of water quality, the water resources were in S1 suitability class. However, steep slopes and stoniness were two barriers for water accessibility. As demonstrated by the model, 5552.32 ha (57.99%) of the study rangelands were in good class, 1523.85 ha (25.91%) in fair to moderate class while 5.76 ha (0.06%) were in poor suitability class. Non suitable rangelands were 2369.15 hectares which is equal to 20.4% of the surface area.																	1589-1623	1785-0037					2017	15	3					1149	1156		10.15666/aeer/1503_11491156								WOS:000403811200083

SPATIO-TEMPORAL VARIATIONS IN ZOOPLANKTON COMMUNITY STRUCTURE AND WATER QUALITY IN A CHINESE EUTROPHIC RIVER	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												To collect information about the community structure of zooplankton and to study how zooplankton respond to environmental conditions, zooplankton samples were collected from seven stations in a heavily polluted river (the Nanfei River, China). Samples were collected in March (spring) and June (summer) 2014, September (autumn) and December (winter) 2013. A total of 275 species of zooplankton belonging to 79 genera were identified, the total zooplankton abundance was 193 040 ind./L. Protozoa and rotifer comprised a high proportion of species number and abundance of zooplankton. The upper reaches had higher greater species number and lower abundance than those in middle and lower reaches, and at the entrance of Chaohu Lake. The species number and abundance of zooplankton were the highest in autumn, and the lowest in winter. The habitats of Nanfei River had high spatiotemporal heterogeneity, revealed by unweighted pair-group method using arithmetic averages (UPGMA) clustering analyses on environmental factors and detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) clustering analyses on zooplankton abundance. In addition, water quality of upper reaches was better than the middle and lower reaches, and the entrance; and better in autumn than in other three seasons in terms of species number, abundance, Shannon-Wiener index, and Pielou evenness index. Results of canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) indicate that the combination of water temperature, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, pH, chemical oxygen demanded, soluble phosphate, and conductance rate were responsible for the variations in zooplankton community structure. Results of the present study indicated that zooplankton communities of the Nanfei River had obvious spatial and temporal heterogeneity, and the environmental factors played an important role in the changes in zooplankton community in Nanfei River.																	1589-1623	1785-0037					2017	15	3					1417	1442		10.15666/aeer/1503_14171442								WOS:000403811200101
