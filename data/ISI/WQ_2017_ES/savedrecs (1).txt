Quantifying streambank movement and topography using unmanned aircraft system photogrammetry with comparison to terrestrial laser scanning	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Streambank movement is an integral part of geomorphic changes along river corridors and affects a range of physical, ecological, and socio-economic systems including aquatic habitat, water quality, and infrastructure. Various methods have been used to quantify streambank erosion, including bank pins, ground surveys, lidar, and analytical models, however, due to high-cost or labour intensive fieldwork these are typically feasible or appropriate only for site-specific studies. Advancements in unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and photogrammetry provide opportunities for more rapid and economical quantification of streambank erosion and deposition at variable scales. This work assesses the performance of UAS-based photogrammetry for capturing topography of streambank surfaces and quantifying bank movement. UAS data are compared to terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) and GPS surveying from streambank sites located in Vermont that featured a variety of bank conditions and vegetation. Cross-sectional analysis of data from UAS and TLS revealed that the UAS reliably captured the bank surface within 0.2m of TLS and GPS surveys across all sites during leaf-off conditions. Mean error between UAS and TLS was only 0.11m in early spring conditions. Dense summer vegetation resulted in decreased accuracy and was a limiting factor in the ability of the UAS to capture the ground surface. At areas with observed bank movement, the change in cross-sectional area estimated using UAS data compared reliably to TLS survey for net cross-sectional changes greater than 3.5m(2), given a 10% error tolerance. At locations with smaller changes, error increased due to the effect of vegetation, georeferencing, and overhanging bank profiles. UAS-based photogrammetry shows significant promise for capturing bank topography and movement at fine resolutions in a flexible and efficient manner.

J	Piyoosh, AK; Ghosh, SK				Piyoosh, Atul Kant; Ghosh, Sanjay Kumar			Effect of autocorrelation on temporal trends in rainfall in a valley region at the foothills of Indian Himalayas	STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT												This study examines the effect of autocorrelation on step and monotonic trends in seasonal and annual rainfall. Initially, for step change, modified-Pettitt test is applied in two ways. First, using the corrected and unbiased trend-free-pre-whitening (TFPWcu) approach. Second, using a new approach in which time series is modelled by intervention analysis for modified Pettitt test. Subsequently, for monotonic trends, Mann-Kendall (MK) and six approaches of modified Mann-Kendall (MMK) test are applied to NCDC data for period 1901-2012 and its sub-periods. Approaches of MMK include pre-whitening (PW), trend-free-pre-whitening (TFPW), TFPWcu, two Variance Correction Approaches (VCAs) based on empirical formula (VCA:CF1) and Monte-Carlo-Simulations (VCA:CF2) and long term persistence (MK-LTP). A single change point is identified in 1970 for annual and monsoon rainfall from original and modified-Pettitt's test using TFPWcu, while time series modelling approach has not exhibited any change point. Process shift in rainfall series is also studied using CUSUM and multiple change points are identified using Segment-Neighbourhood method. Outcomes of MMK show that TFPWcu is able to efficiently limit the effect of autocorrelation and may be preferred over PW and TFPW. The VCA:CF2 is not dependent on whole autocorrelation structure and corrects variance of all data series using lag-1 autocorrelation and may be preferred over VCA:CF1. MK-LTP considers long term persistence and it has exhibited presence of weaker trends than exhibited by other approaches. VCA:CF2 and MK-LTP are used to study trends of rainfall in Dehradun.																	1436-3240	1436-3259				OCT	2017	31	8					2075	2096		10.1007/s00477-016-1347-y								WOS:000413233000012

In this way a pilot system, comprising an anaerobic pretreatment and two duckweed ponds designed in series (10 m(2) each), was operated with real domestic sewage. The treatment efficiency was evaluated through the monitoring of conventional physical-chemical water quality variables sach as Temperature, pH, total phosphorus (TP), phosphate (PO4), total nitrogen (TN), ammoniacal nitrogen (NH4+-N) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). Simultaneously the excess of biomass produced during the treatment was submitted to Biochemical Methane Potential test (BMP) carried out in a multi-batch reactor system. Three pretreatment approaches (fermentative, drying and alkaline) were performed in triplicate to evaluate their influence on methane production. Findings showed that the duckweed ponds removed the organic matter and nutrients from the wastewater (TN = 94%, TP = 92% and COD = 91%). Moreover, the biomass submitted to a fermentative pretreatment returned higher gas production (0.39 NmA(biogas)(3)/kgVS(fed)) compared with the anaerobic digestion (AD) of unpretreated biomass (0.25 NmA(biogas)(3)/kgVS(fed)). These results highlight the potential of duckweed ponds technologies to treat wastewater and produce clean energy simultaneously.																	1877-2641	1877-265X				OCT	2017	8	7					2363	2369		10.1007/s12649-016-9800-1								WOS:000411975600011

A Modeling System for Monitoring Water Quality in Lagoons	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Regular monitoring of key water quality parameters is important for assessing the hydrological status of a lagoon and its management activities. In this study, a new cost-effective technique based on the geoecological information-modeling system (GIMS) is implemented employing the combined use of simulation experiments and in-field observations to investigate the problem of optimizing water quality monitoring of a lagoon. The GIMS is accompanied by 39 elements selected in 8 management systems and 31 functional elements, which are described in detail. It is shown that the combined use of model and field observations allows reliable recording of lagoon water quality and optimization of the monitoring regime. Finally, simulation experiments are presented, demonstrating the fidelity of the proposed modeling system to optimize water quality control through regular in-field measurements and simulations.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				OCT	2017	228	10							397	10.1007/s11270-017-3581-4								WOS:000413334900022

Evaluation of Water Quality for Sustainable Agriculture in Bangladesh	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Sustainable groundwater quality has become a major concern for the agro-based country like Bangladesh. Integrated approaches of various irrigation water quality indices and geostatistical modeling were applied to evaluate the suitability and for spatial mapping of groundwater quality of Faridpur District in central Bangladesh. The irrigation water quality index (IWQI) revealed that majority of the samples were suitable for irrigation. Similar outcomes were recorded from other indices including Na%, sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), residual sodium bicarbonate (RSBC), total hardness (TH), Kelley's ratio (KR), and magnesium adsorption ratio (MAR). Classifications based on Wilcox diagram and permeability index (PI) plot indicated a similar conclusion wherein almost all the samples were safe for agricultural uses without posing considerable effect on the soil fertility and overall crop yield. Principal component analysis (PCA) grouped the major cations and anions into three principal components including dissolution of calcite minerals, leaching of silicate sediments, and ion exchange process. Spatial mapping of IWQI identified that groundwater in the northern side of Faridpur region were more suitable for irrigational uses relative to central and southern side, possibly due to gradients of domestic discharges and agricultural activates from north to south side. These findings would provide useful information to water distributors, managers, and decision makers for taking adaptive measures in irrigation water quality management systems.

During snowmelt or precipitation events, water runoff carries nutrients into nearby streams and impairs the water quality. There is a need, therefore, to identify improved management of manure application in the soils. This study was conducted to assess water quality impacts associated following manure application during winter months when soil is completely covered with snow. The study site included three watersheds, named south (SW), east (CW), and north (NW) managed with a corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean (Glycine max L.) rotation located in South Dakota. The SW and NW were used as treatment, and CW as the control watershed. The treatments included manure application on the upper half of the SW and lower half of the NW, and CW received no manure application. This study showed that manure improved soil properties including infiltration rate and organic matter. Nitrogen and phosphorus losses in the surface runoff were higher from NW compared to that of SW. The CW had similar nutrient losses compared to the NW with slight differences. It can be concluded that maintaining a setback distance can help in improving the environmental quality as well as managing the agricultural wastes during the winter months.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				OCT	2017	228	10							389	10.1007/s11270-017-3572-5								WOS:000413334900015

The aim of this paper was the assessment of the ecological status of water quality and calculating water pollution index (WPI) of the Danube River in Serbia. For all surface waters, the WFD requires "good ecological status," i.e., low level changes of the natural state that occur as a result of human activities by 2015. The assessment was based on the data obtained from ten hydrological measuring stations on the Danube River in Serbia for 2014. It was ascertained that the ecological status of the Danube River water quality was class III, corresponding to "moderate ecological status" and deviating from the required "good ecological status." According to the calculated WPI = 1.352, the water pollution of the Danube River in Serbia was characterized as moderately polluted and corresponded to class III of surface water. The ecosystem approach clearly indicated that the concentration of physico-chemical parameters of the watercourse deviated from the target values. Therefore, there is an urgent need to take some measures to prevent pollution and improve the water quality of the Danube River as an integral part of the environment in Serbia.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				OCT	2017	228	10							380	10.1007/s11270-017-3551-x								WOS:000413334900004						
J	Yazdi, J				Yazdi, J.			Optimization of hydrometric monitoring network in urban drainage systems using information theory	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Regular and continuous monitoring of urban runoff in both quality and quantity aspects is of great importance for controlling and managing surface runoff. Due to the considerable costs of establishing new gauges, optimization of the monitoring network is essential. This research proposes an approach for site selection of new discharge stations in urban areas, based on entropy theory in conjunction with multi-objective optimization tools and numerical models. The modeling framework provides an optimal trade-off between the maximum possible information content and the minimum shared information among stations. This approach was applied to the main surface-water collection system in Tehran to determine new optimal monitoring points under the cost considerations. Experimental results on this drainage network show that the obtained cost-effective designs noticeably outperform the consulting engineers' proposal in terms of both information contents and shared information. The research also determined the highly frequent sites at the Pareto front which might be important for decision makers to give a priority for gauge installation on those locations of the network.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				OCT	2017	76	7					1603	1613		10.2166/wst.2017.226								WOS:000412778000002	28991778					
J	Chiu, YC; Chiang, CW; Lee, TY				Chiu, Yung-Chia; Chiang, Chih-Wei; Lee, Tsung-Yu			Prediction of biochemical oxygen demand at the upstream catchment of a reservoir using adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The aim of this study is to examine the potential of adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to estimate biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). To illustrate the applicability of ANFIS method, the upstream catchment of Feitsui Reservoir in Taiwan is chosen as the case study area. The appropriate input variables used to develop the ANFIS models are determined based on the t-test. The results obtained by ANFIS are compared with those by multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural networks (ANNs). Simulated results show that the identified ANFIS model is superior to the traditional MLR and nonlinear ANNs models in terms of the performance evaluated by the Pearson coefficient of correlation, the root mean square error, the mean absolute percentage, and the mean absolute error. These results indicate that ANFIS models are more suitable than ANNs or MLR models to predict the nonlinear relationship within the variables caused by the complexity of aquatic systems and to produce the best fit of the measured BOD concentrations. ANFIS can be seen as a powerful predictive alternative to traditional water quality modeling techniques and extended to other areas to improve the understanding of river pollution trends.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				OCT	2017	76	7					1739	1753		10.2166/wst.2017.359								WOS:000412778000014	28991790

We found that organic matter is the main pollution source of Yitong River and its tributaries. A black-odor evaluation model that can describe the pollution of the Yitong River water system was developed, and this model has the parameters I = 0.21 [CODCr] + 0.18 [DO] - 0.36[NH3-N] + 0.91. The model performance was satisfactory with a black-odor defining accuracy of 69%. Moreover, we found that CODCr, NH3-N, and DO are the influential factors of the Yitong River black-odor water body and that their threshold values when the water body transitioned to black odor were 109.2, 1.90, and 7.50 mg.L-1, respectively. We found that most of the Yitong River was polluted by six heavy metals, namely, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn. We used the Nemerow method to calculate the heavy metal pollution degree of each sampling point and found that 60% of the points were seriously polluted. Furthermore, we drew the heavy metal pollution distribution map of the Yitong River. Finally, we proposed an effective measure called new-type multistep constructed wetland to improve the water quality of Yitong River.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				OCT	2017	76	8					2051	2064		10.2166/wst.2017.372								WOS:000413666500011	29068335

To that end, nine water quality parameters [pH, turbidity (TURB), temperature (T), dissolved oxygen (DO), nitrate (NO3), total solids (TS), phosphate (PO4), biological oxygen demand (BOD5), and fecal coliforms (FC)] were analyzed at eight selected stations. According to the proposed classification for water quality indices (higher value (0-100), better water quality), the Wetland water quality was classified as the mean values of the three indices for the three sampled years, as follows: NSFWQI(a) (13.72, 12.81, 12.07); NSFWQI(m) (63.049, 52.388, 49.108); and OWQI (26.867, 14.477, 15.53). The values of NSFWQI(a), NSFWQI(m), and OWQI for the western stations were better than for the other stations in the region over the 29-year span of investigation; however, the remainders of the stations' values were very poor. Because wastewaters discharged from industrial and agricultural areas are more concentrated in the eastern part of the Anzali Wetland, the eastern stations of the Wetland showed lower water quality compared to the central and western stations. The water of the Anzali Wetland has different quality classes according to the aggregation methods employed. It is concluded that when evaluating water quality of aquatic ecosystems, several indices should be used to obtain more comprehensive results.

Three small eutrophic urban ponds which displayed considerable within-pond and betweenpond variability in water quality and cyanobacterial community composition were used as trial sites. On-board algorithms provide field measurements of phycocyanin (CPC) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) from surface reflectance spectra measured by the instrument. These were compared with laboratory measurements. Although significant but weak relationships were found between WISP-3 measured CPC and cyanobacterial biovolume measurements and WISP-3 and laboratory Chl-a measurements, there was considerable scatter in the data due likely to error in both WISP-3 and laboratory measurements. The relationships generally differed only slightly between ponds, indicating that different cyanobacterial communities had little effect on the pigment retrievals of the WISP-3. The on-board algorithms need appropriate modification for local conditions, posing a problem if it is to be used extensively across water bodies with differing optical properties. Although suffering a range of other limitations, the WISP-3 has a potential as a rapid screening tool for preliminary risk assessment of cyanobacterial blooms. However, such field assessment would still require adequate support by sampling and laboratory-based analysis.

J	Chen, CJ; Zhao, TC; Liu, RL; Luo, LG				Chen, Chongjuan; Zhao, Tiancheng; Liu, Ruliang; Luo, Liangguo			Performance of five plant species in removal of nitrogen and phosphorus from an experimental phytoremediation system in the Ningxia irrigation area	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Agricultural non-point source (ANPS) pollution is an important contributor to elevated nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in surface waters, which can cause serious environmental problems. Considerable effort has therefore gone into the development of methods that control the ANPS input of N and P to surface waters. Phytoremediation has been extensively used because it is cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and efficient. The N and P loads from agricultural drainage are a potential threat to the water quality of the Yellow River in Ningxia, China. Yet, phytoremediation has only rarely been applied within the Ningxia irrigation area. In an experimental setup, five species (Ipomoea aquatica, IA; Lactuca sativa, LS; Oryza sativa, OS; Typha latifolia, TL; Zizania latifolia, ZL) were evaluated for their ability to reduceNand P loads over 62 days and five observation periods. Total N and P concentrations, plant biomass, and nutrient content were measured. The results showed that OS, LS, and IA performed better than ZL and TL in terms of nutrients removal, biomass accumulation, and nutrients storage. The highest overall removal rates of N and P (57.7 and 57.3%, respectively) were achieved by LS treatment. In addition, plant uptake contributed significantly to nutrient removal, causing a 25.9-72.0% reduction in N removal and a 54.386.5% reduction in P removal. Thus, this study suggests that OS, LS, and IA would be more suitable than ZL and TL for controlling nutrient loads in the Ningxia irrigation area using phytoremediation.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				OCT	2017	189	10							497	10.1007/s10661-017-6213-y								WOS:000411166100015	28890992

Assessing condition of macroinvertebrate communities and bed sediment toxicity in the Rochester Embayment Area of Concern, New York, USA	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The United States and Canada agreed to restore the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Great Lakes ecosystem under the first Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement in 1972. The lowest reach of the Genesee River and the Rochester Embayment on Lake Ontario between Bogus Point and Nine Mile Point, including Braddock Bay, were designated as an Area of Concern (AOC) due to effects of contaminated sediments and physical disturbance on several beneficial uses. Following sediment remedial efforts and with conditions improving in the AOC, the present study was conducted to reevaluate the status of the benthic macroinvertebrate (benthos) beneficial use impairment (BUI). Benthic macroinvertebrate community assessments and 10-day Chironomus dilutus bioassays were used to test the hypotheses that sediments within the AOC were no more toxic than sediments from surrounding reference areas. The study was separated into three discrete systems (Genesee River, Lake Ontario, and Braddock Bay) and non-parametric analyses determined that a multimetric index of benthic macroinvertebrate community integrity was significantly higher at AOC sites compared to reference sites on the Genesee River and in Braddock Bay while AOC and reference sites on Lake Ontario did not differ significantly. Survival and growth of C. dilutus were also similar between AOC and reference sites for each system with the exception of significantly higher growth at reference sites on Lake Ontario. Results generally indicated that the condition of benthos and toxicity of sediment of the Rochester Embayment AOC are similar to or better than that in the surrounding area.

J	Howell, ET; Dove, A				Howell, E. Todd; Dove, Alice			Chronic nutrient loading from Lake Erie affecting water quality and nuisance algae on the St. Catharines shores of Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Water quality and lake circulation in the nearshore of Lake Ontario bordering the city of St. Catharines were examined from May to October 2013 to interpret factors impacting water resources and contributing to nuisance algae. Our findings suggest that loadings from eastern Lake Erie via Twelve Mile Creek and the Welland Canal are a primary driver of variability in nearshore water quality, creating mixing areas enriched in particulate and dissolved phosphorus and turbidity. Impingement of the Niagara River plume and regional lake circulation also impact water quality conditions. Quantitative benthic sampling revealed that Cladophora was abundant to lake depths of about six meters, which is shallower than other nearshore areas of Lake Ontario. Estimates of PAR intensity at the lakebed interpolated over the study area suggest that light limitation counteracts the stimulation of Cladophora growth attributable to elevated dissolved phosphorus over the discharge mixing areas. No evidence was found that the chronic loading of phosphorus in the area resulted in a higher prevalence of Cladophora compared with other areas of the lake. The abundance of dreissenid mussels, reaching 4760 individuals/m(2), was not correlated with water chemistry features or biomass of Cladophora. Interactions between dreissenids and Cladophora may be muted in the area due to overriding physical factors which appear to limit Cladophora to shallow depths and mussels to deeper waters.

J	Stammler, KL; Taylor, WD; Mohamed, MN				Stammler, Katie L.; Taylor, William D.; Mohamed, Mohamed N.			Long-term decline in stream total phosphorus concentrations: A pervasive pattern in all watershed types in Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Cultural eutrophication of the Great Lakes resulted in actions to reduce phosphorus loading beginning in the 1970's. Despite these measures, a resurgence of harmful algae blooms began in the 1990s. Non-point sources and changing agricultural practices are frequently cited as contributing to this resurgence. We examined changes in total phosphorus concentrations ([TP]) and several other water quality parameters from April through November from 1979 to 2011 using 56 streams throughout Ontario, including agricultural, undeveloped, urban, and mixed-use watersheds. Growing season median [TP] was not significantly different among stream types, but decreased in 32 of the 56 sites; only one urban site increased. There were weak differences among land uses; mixed sites typically had the highest [TP] and steepest declines. Soluble reactive P concentration [SRP] decreased at 12 sites, and increased at one agricultural and three urban sites. Where trends were significant, suspended solids typically decreased, while [Cl-] and alkalinity typically increased. As adequate winter data were not available and there may have been changes in the seasonal distribution of high flow during the period we studied, the changes we observed in median growing season [TP] may not reflect changes in loading. However, seasonal discharge trends were not significant except for one site with a decreasing trend in spring discharge. Possible mechanisms for pervasive downward trends in TP include improved rural and urban land use practices, reduced acid precipitation, increased nitrogen availability in terrestrial ecosystems, and ongoing forest regrowth after initial clear-cutting.

But most of the total maximum daily load (TMDL) implementation plans crafted to meet water quality standards in the USA are developed assuming stationary climate and at best a small number of land use futures, although neither assumption seems reliably justified. To address this challenge, this study employs robust decision making (RDM) methods, commonly used to help develop water supply plans, to stress test the proposed Enhanced Watershed Management Plan (EWMP), a TMDL implementation plan, for the Tujunga Wash, the largest subwatershed of the Los Angeles River, over a wide range of climate and land use futures. We find that climate change could significantly reduce the ability of the Tujunga EWMP to meet water quality goals; however, meeting the city's goals for increasing permeable land cover offsets the risk of non-compliance in the face of climate change uncertainties. This study also introduces innovations in RDM analyses, including: treatment of the deeply uncertain incidence of extreme precipitation events, an explicit link between RDM scenario discovery methods and the specification of signposts for adaptive policy pathways, and the use of (imprecise) probabilistic climate projections to inform the choice among robust adaptive policy pathways. The paper also contributes to a larger debate over how to address climate and other uncertainties in regulatory processes involving water quality.																	0165-0009	1573-1480				OCT	2017	144	4					625	639		10.1007/s10584-017-2062-5								WOS:000411875800008

Intercomparison of regional-scale hydrological models and climate change impacts projected for 12 large river basins worldwide-a synthesis	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												An intercomparison of climate change impacts projected by nine regional-scale hydrological models for 12 large river basins on all continents was performed, and sources of uncertainty were quantified in the framework of the ISIMIP project. The models ECOMAG, HBV, HYMOD, HYPE, mHM, SWAT, SWIM, VIC andWaterGAP3 were applied in the following basins: Rhine and Tagus in Europe, Niger and Blue Nile in Africa, Ganges, Lena, Upper Yellow and Upper Yangtze in Asia, Upper Mississippi, MacKenzie and Upper Amazon in America, and Darling in Australia. The model calibration and validation was done using WATCH climate data for the period 1971-2000. The results, evaluated with 14 criteria, are mostly satisfactory, except for the low flow. Climate change impacts were analyzed using projections from five global climate models under four representative concentration pathways. Trends in the period 2070-2099 in relation to the reference period 1975-2004 were evaluated for three variables: the long-term mean annual flow and high and low flow percentiles Q(10) and Q(90), as well as for flows in three months high-and low-flow periods denoted as HF and LF. For three river basins: the Lena, MacKenzie and Tagus strong trends in all five variables were found (except for Q(10) in the MacKenzie); trends with moderate certainty for three to five variables were confirmed for the Rhine, Ganges and Upper Mississippi; and increases in HF and LF were found for the Upper Amazon, Upper Yangtze and Upper Yellow. The analysis of projected streamflow seasonality demonstrated increasing streamflow volumes during the high-flow period in four basins influenced by monsoonal precipitation (Ganges, Upper Amazon, Upper Yangtze and Upper Yellow), an amplification of the snowmelt flood peaks in the Lena and MacKenzie, and a substantial decrease of discharge in the Tagus (all months). The overall average fractions of uncertainty for the annual mean flow projections in the multi-model ensemble applied for all basins were 57% for GCMs, 27% for RCPs, and 16% for hydrological models.

THE EFFECT OF pH ON CHRONIC ZINC TOXICITY DIFFERS BETWEEN DAPHNID SPECIES: DEVELOPMENT OF A PRELIMINARY CHRONIC ZINC CERIODAPHNIA DUBIA BIOAVAILABILITY MODEL	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												In the present study, we observed that the chronic Zn Daphnia magna biotic ligand model (BLM) could not accurately predict the chronic Zn toxicity to Ceriodaphnia dubia in a series of (modified) field waters, although the intrinsic sensitivities of the D. magna BLM were specifically calibrated on the sensitivity of C. dubia. Moreover, it was observed that the D. magna BLM underestimated the effect of pH on the toxicity of the free Zn2+ ion. A preliminary species-specific chronic Zn C. dubia bioavailability model was developed based on the data. The preliminary Zn C. dubia bioavailability model was shown to predict Zn toxicity to C. dubia in a series of natural waters with pH ranging between 7 and 8.3 with reasonable accuracy. The difference in the effect of pH on Zn2+ toxicity between D. magna and C. dubia (2 phylogenetically closely related species) suggested by our results deserves further attention because of the importance of the cross-species application of bioavailability models in ecological risk-assessment procedures and environmental quality standard derivations for metals.

Bank filtration in a coastal lake in South Brazil: water quality, natural organic matter (NOM) and redox conditions study	CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY												Bank filtration (BF) was evaluated as new treatment or pre-treatment option for drinking water production in Brazil. General water quality parameters, natural organic matter (NOM) and redox conditions were evaluated in Lagoa do Peri, a costal lake in Santa Catarina, South Brazil. Studies in two periods at two bank filtrations well systems, in a 45-m-length column and in a test filter laboratory scale set-up, were performed. The well systems and the column showed the removal of turbidity and colour from around 7 NTU and 65 Pt-Co, respectively, to below the local regulations (1 NTU and 15 Pt-Co units). Both systems demonstrated a good removal of NOM and trihalomethanes (THM) precursors with a preference removal of THM precursors. The NOM and THM precursor removal in the large column and the test filter were effectively modelled. In both cases, an easily degradable organic matter fraction was modelled; in the large column a moderate degradable fraction was identified as well. The first fraction was removed during the first days of travel time of the bank filtrate. A change to reduced redox conditions was observed in the large column experiment. The same happened in the wells system, showing the dissolution of iron, manganese and sulphide in the bank filtrate. This was the principal drawback of BF comparing with the already existing direct filtration (DF) treatment plant. BF performed slightly better in THM precursor removal (52%) than DF (42%). Therefore, BF could be a pre-treatment for the DF treatment system, and the existing facility could be adapted for iron and manganese removal.

Influence of land use and lithology on sources and ages of nutritional resources for stream macroinvertebrates: a multi-isotopic approach	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Terrestrially-derived carbon (C) and organic matter (OM)-often of significant age-dominate in many streams and rivers, yet little is known about their potential nutritional contributions to aquatic macroinvertebrate consumers. Impacts of watershed characteristics (e.g., land use and lithology) on the sources and ages of C and OM utilized by aquatic consumers are also poorly understood. To assess these factors, macroinvertebrates were collected from six headwater streams having different watershed lithologies and land uses in the Hudson-Mohawk River system (New York, USA) and analyzed for natural delta C-13, delta N-15, delta H-2, and a dagger C-14. A Bayesian stable isotopic mixing model revealed that autochthonous primary production dominated (62-92%) the biomass of all functional feeding groups (FFGs) across all sites, with allochthonous sources being of secondary but still significant (21-31%) importance. Macroinvertebrates collected from streams in watersheds having low vs. high agricultural land use were estimated to assimilate 0-13 and 4-31% soil-derived C and OM, respectively. a dagger C-14 values and apparent ages of macroinvertebrates from shale-rich and shale-poor sites were also significantly different (mean a dagger C-14 = -75 and -34aEuro degrees; equivalent C-14 ages = 630 and 280 years B.P., respectively). Inclusion of a dagger C-14 data in mixing models confirmed the importance of autochthonous primary production, and also demonstrated indirect lithological control of nutritional resource utilization by influencing stream substrate type and potential retention of allochthonous C and OM. Findings from this study further showed that the relative magnitudes of autochthonous vs. allochthonous contributions to macroinvertebrates were dependent on FFG, land use type, and lithology.																	1015-1621	1420-9055				OCT	2017	79	4					925	939		10.1007/s00027-017-0542-3								WOS:000410781000011						
J	Wang, HB; Qin, J; Hu, YH				Wang, Hongbing; Qin, Jun; Hu, Yonghong			Are green roofs a source or sink of runoff pollutants?	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Retention of rainwater runoff is a primary function of green roofs in their contribution as one of the main indicators of "Sponge City". However, the influence of green roofs on runoff quality and whether they are a source or sink of pollutants is ambiguous. A concept model of pollutant cycling is proposed in this paper, based on a systematic literature review, which includes the direct factors substrate and structure of the green roof system; and indirect factors such as plant species, irrigation, fertilizer, atmospheric deposition, and age of the green roof. In addition, the model identifies each factor as a pollutant source or sink and explores relations among the factors. Examples in the literature were drawn to demonstrate the factors and pollutant materials including metallic elements such as Zn, Pb, Cd, Fe, Mn, Cr, Cu, and Ca; and nutrients such as N, NO3--N, NH4-N, DON, P, PO43--P, K, and DOC. The concept of "moderate growth vigor" is proposed; moderate growth is optimal for runoff quality and low and persistent fertility, and a low benchmark to control diseases and insect pests. The concept of "clean sources and pollutant retention" should be adopted, i.e., pollutant sources such as substrate, irrigation water, fertilizer, pesticide, and other local pollution sources should be removed or cleaned, and pollutants should be detained or decreased by plant degradation, slow-release material, filter layer, and actinic and microbial degradation. These results will aid understanding of the mechanism of runoff pollution and improve stormwater runoff quality from source to sink in green roofs.

Impacts of gravel jetting on the composition of fish spawning substrates: Implications for river restoration and fisheries management	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Fine sediments can impact river biota, with egg and larval stages of lithophilic fish particularly sensitive to deposition of sand- to clay-sized particles ('fines') in spawning gravels. Mitigation and restoration methods include jetting to cleanse gravels of fines. Despite wide application, impacts of jetting on gravel composition and quality have rarely been quantified. Here, gravel jetting impacts on sediment composition in the River Great Ouse (UK), were tested during an in-situ experiment completed at riffle (55.6 +/- 13.4 m(2)) and patch (0.3 m(2)) scales to determine its magnitude and persistence on surface and subsurface substrate conditions. Before-after (riffle) and control-impact (patch) designs were used, with bedload sediment traps installed downstream of experimental patches to investigate the sediments mobilised during jetting. At the riffle scale, surface grain size was significantly altered; fines were removed resulting in coarser and better-sorted sediments. Similar patterns were detected at the patch scale, although sediment sorting was not significantly altered. Despite reduced fine sediment content of subsurface gravels at the riffle scale, the overall grain size composition was not significantly altered. At the patch scale, no subsurface improvements were detected. Temporally, at the riffle scale, no changes in surface or subsurface sediments lasted more than 12 months; patch scale changes generally persisted for less than 3 months. Thus, whilst gravel jetting could improve spawning gravel quality for surface spawning fishes, including European barbel Barbus barbus, its effects are short-lived. Because subsurface sediments are not affected by gravel jetting, the benefits are limited for redd-building fishes, such as salmonids. Consequently, reducing fine sediment delivery to rivers, such as by changes in agricultural practices, is more sustainable for managing excessive river sedimentation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

N.; Abed, Suhail N.; Scholz, Miklas			Recycling of domestic wastewater treated by vertical-flow wetlands for irrigation of two consecutive Capsicum annuum generations	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Due to water scarcity, there is great interest in reusing various nutrient-rich wastewaters. The aim of this article is consequently to evaluate if domestic wastewater treated by various wetland systems can be successfully recycled to irrigate generations of commercial crops such as Chilli (Capsicum annuum) grown in compost within a laboratory environment to obtain a cultivar adapted to domestic wastewater. The corresponding objectives were to assess the irrigation water for long-term growth when applying recycled wastewater, the impact of various wastewaters subject to the wetland characteristics, the impact of treated wastewater volume for irrigation, and the economic return of different experimental set-ups in terms of marketable yields. The vertical-flow wetlands treated domestic wastewater well, meeting the irrigation water quality standards for most water quality parameters, except for phosphorus (4.2 +/- 0.48 mg/l), ammonia-nitrogen (4.2 +/- 2.64 mg/l), potassium (7.0 +/- 3.03 mg/l) and total coliforms (69647 +/- 64852.6 CFU/100 ml), which showed high values significantly (p < 0.05) exceeding common thresholds set for irrigation applications of 2 mg/l, 5 mg/l, 2 mg/l, and 1000 CFU/100 ml. Chilli generations were grown successfully when applying wastewater treated by wetlands and organic soil. High Chilli generation yields concerning economic return were linked with wetlands containing small aggregates with long contact and resting times and fed with a high inflow loading rate (undiluted wastewater), releasing more nutrients into their effluent producing the best fruit quality with respect to weight, length and width resulting in a greater marketable profit of about 46% compared with the others. First generation Chilli plants were grown with considerably shorter heights and produced abundant fruit numbers, which were harvested earlier than their mothers due to the reduction (approximately 55%) of irrigation water volume used for them compared to their mothers. However, excessive nutrients applied on mother plants via irrigation water resulted in better fruit quality regarding dimensions and weights compared with their corresponding first generation plants, leading to a greater marketable profit by about 25%.

J	Shrestha, S; Farrelly, J; Eggleton, M; Chen, YS				Shrestha, Sagar; Farrelly, John; Eggleton, Michael; Chen, Yushun			Effects of conservation wetlands on stream habitat, water quality and fish communities in agricultural watersheds of the lower Mississippi River Basin	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Wetland conservation programs (e.g., Wetland Reserve Program and Conservation Reserve Program) have been implemented throughout the Mississippi River Basin to reduce environmental impacts from agricultural activities. However, there is limited information on the overall effectiveness of these programs on improving stream ecological conditions. To address this issue, replicate streams from southeastern Arkansas draining watersheds containing predominately croplands (n = 4, termed "cropland") and created wetlands (n = 4, termed "wetland") were monitored monthly from August 2012 through July 2013. Although repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVA) detected many significant time x stream type interactions, several habitat parameters and total habitat scores exhibited a general improvement in wetland streams. Some water quality conditions were better in wetland streams (e.g., lower turbidity, total suspended solids, and nutrient) compared to cropland streams. The time (season) effect was significant (p < 0.05) for 13 of the 14 water quality parameters measured, meaning that water quality varied seasonally. Among the water quality parameters measured, three (water temperature, pH, and turbidity) exhibited significant (p < 0.05) time x stream type interaction, meaning that the stream type effect was not consistent through time (seasons). Fish community sampling collected 6543 specimens from 12 species during the study period; 4410 and 2133 fish specimens were collected from cropland and wetland streams, respectively. Fish community metrics such as species diversity, species evenness, and species richness index were not significantly (p > 0.05) greater in wetland streams. Overall, the conservation wetlands in the Lower Mississippi River Basin appear to have significantly improved stream habitat and moderately improved water quality, though no significant fish community effect was detected.

We present a case study of rural mining-agricultural communities in the Lake Poopo Basin, one of the poorest regions on the Bolivian Altiplano. Here, relatively low rainfall, high evaporation, salinization and unregulated mining activity have contributed to environmental degradation and water issues, which is a situation facing many Altiplano communities. Social data from 72 households and chemical water quality data from 27 surface water and groundwater sites obtained between August 2013 and July 2014 were used to develop locally relevant vulnerability assessment methodologies and ratings with respect to water availability and quality, and Chemical Water Quality Hazard Ratings to assess water quality status. Levels of natural and mining-related contamination in many waters (CWQHR >= 6; 78% of assessed sites) mean that effective remediation would be challenging and require substantial investment. Although waters of fair to good chemical quality (CWQHR <= 5; 22% of assessed sites) do exist, treatment may still be required depending on use, and access issues remain problematic. There is a need to comply with water quality legislation, improve and maintain basic water supply and storage infrastructure, build and operate water and wastewater treatment plants, and adequately and safely contain and treat mine waste. This study serves as a framework that could be used elsewhere for assessing and mitigating water contamination and availability affecting vulnerable populations.																	0364-152X	1432-1009				OCT	2017	60	4					555	573		10.1007/s00267-017-0893-5								WOS:000410806800001	28597053

Public-Private Partnerships Working Beyond Scale Challenges toward Water Quality Improvements from Private Lands	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												In recognition that Iowa agriculture must maintain long-term production of food, fiber, clean water, healthy soil, and robust rural economies, Iowa recently devised a nutrient reduction strategy to set objectives for water quality improvements. To demonstrate how watershed programs and farmers can reduce nutrient and sediment pollution in Iowa waters, the Iowa Water Quality Initiative selected the Boone River Watershed Nutrient Management Initiative as one of eight demonstration projects. For over a decade, diverse public, private, and non-profit partner organizations have worked in the Boone River Watershed to engage farmers in water quality management efforts. To evaluate social dynamics in the Boone River Watershed and provide partners with actionable recommendations, we conducted and analyzed semi-structured interviews with 33 program leaders, farmers, and local agronomists. We triangulated primary interview data with formal analysis of Boone River Watershed documents such as grant applications, progress reports, and outreach materials. Our evaluation suggests that while multi-stakeholder collaboration has enabled partners to overcome many of the traditional barriers to watershed programming, scale mismatches caused by external socio-economic and ecological forces still present substantial obstacles to programmatic resilience. Public funding restrictions and timeframes, for example, often cause interruptions to adaptive management of water quality monitoring and farmer engagement. We present our findings within a resilience framework to demonstrate how multi-stakeholder collaboration can help sustain adaptive watershed programs to improve socio-ecological function in agricultural watersheds such as the Boone River Watershed.																	0364-152X	1432-1009				OCT	2017	60	4					574	587		10.1007/s00267-017-0905-5								WOS:000410806800002	28664235

Cully			Invertebrate-Based Water Quality Impairments and Associated Stressors Identified through the US Clean Water Act	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Macroinvertebrate community assessment is used in most US states to evaluate stream health under the Clean Water Act. While water quality assessment and impairment determinations are reported to the US Environmental Protection Agency, there is no national summary of biological assessment findings. The objective of this work was to determine the national extent of invertebrate-based impairments and to identify pollutants primarily responsible for those impairments. Evaluation of state data in the US Environmental Protection Agency's Assessment and Total Maximum Daily Load Tracking and Implementation System database revealed considerable differences in reporting approaches and terminologies including differences in if and how states report specific biological assessment findings. Only 15% of waters impaired for aquatic life could be identified as having impairments determined by biological assessments (e.g., invertebrates, fish, periphyton); approximately one-third of these were associated with macroinvertebrate bioassessment. Nearly 650 invertebrate-impaired waters were identified nationwide, and sediment was the most common pollutant in bedded (63%) and suspended (9%) forms. This finding is not unexpected, given previous work on the negative impacts of sediment on aquatic life, and highlights the need to more specifically identify the mechanisms driving sediment impairments in order to design effective remediation plans. It also reinforces the importance of efforts to derive sediment-specific biological indices and numerical sediment quality guidelines. Standardization of state reporting approaches and terminology would significantly increase the potential application of water quality assessment data, reveal national trends, and encourage sharing of best practices to facilitate the attainment of water quality goals.																	0364-152X	1432-1009				OCT	2017	60	4					598	614		10.1007/s00267-017-0907-3								WOS:000410806800004	28667407

The main goal of this study was to assess the contamination levels of heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Pb, Zn) in surface sediments and red mullet (Mullus barbatus) of the BIB and AB and to examine the possibility of the use of their enrichment factors (EFs) to track down the sources of metals (natural processes or human activity). The geoaccumulation index (I (geo)) was calculated as a criterion to indicate the contamination level for each heavy metal. Moreover, geographical information systems based on spatial analysis methods (inverse distance weighting (IDW)) and statistical approaches (the principal component (PCA)) were performed to assess the spatial influences of multiple anthropogenic sources in different sampled areas. The results of both EF and I (geo) revealed that the study area is exposed to various anthropogenic activities. The pollution load index (PLI) values of sediment samples in the different sites of Algiers and BIB ranged from 0.2 to 3.4 illustrating highly contaminated sediments. Significant bioaccumulation of Cd, Cu, Hg, Pb, and Zn (bioaccumulation factor > 100%) were observed in muscle and liver of red mullet, suggesting potential health risks through consuming this fish species.																	1420-2026	1573-2967				OCT	2017	22	5					473	490		10.1007/s10666-017-9550-x								WOS:000410832200006

Waste water management and water quality of river Yamuna in the megacity of Delhi	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The present study aims at assessing water quality of river Yamuna in one of the world's most polluted and populated megacities, Delhi. Conductivity, salinity and sodium content were within the permissible categories. Chloride concentration exceeded acceptable levels of drinking water guidelines. Water quality was poor at all locations with respect to heavy metal contamination, especially along the lower section of the Delhi stretch. Heavy metal concentrations were manifold higher than the acceptable limits of drinking water according to the BIS guidelines and reached similar to 29, 4.9, 10, 31, 27, 83, 7.3 and 27 times higher, respectively, for metals aluminum, copper, chromium, cadmium, iron, lead, manganese and nickel. The Najafgarh and the Shahdara drains are major point sources. Low oxidation-reduction potential reflected high organic loads and traces of eutrophication together with significant levels of nitrate and total phosphate. Discharges from agriculture, sewage and power plants could be important sources of high metal concentration. This calls for urgent measures to be taken for prevention of metal contamination in the river, through both, technology as well as implementation of regulations in order to sustain huge populations in megacities like Delhi. Waste water treatment from point sources needs tremendous improvement on the city. Treatment of the entire waste generated up to the tertiary level is required for minimizing dissolved solids, especially toxic metals, and rendering reuse in agriculture suitable. Treatment plants need proper operation, maintenance, uninterrupted power supply and regular monitoring. Various measure and programmes need to be undertaken to ensure safe reuse of wastewater.																	1735-1472	1735-2630				OCT	2017	14	10					2109	2124		10.1007/s13762-017-1280-8								WOS:000410751800005

Mercury Uptake by Eastern Oysters (Crassostrea virginica) in Oyster Restoration Project of the New York Harbor	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The Billion Oyster Project is a New York City-wide effort to reintroduce eastern oysters back into the New York Harbor and help improve water quality by reducing heavy metal concentrations in the environment. In particular, the bioaccumulation of mercury in oyster tissue was investigated in the New York Harbor oysters acquired from two sites. Mercury levels exceed the standard Environmental Protection Agency-recommended levels as the New York Harbor oysters exhibit mercury levels ranging from 0.36 +/- 0.05 to 0.55 +/- 0.08 mu g Hg g(-1) dry weight. In an ideal scenario, one billion of these oysters are roughly projected to capture a maximum of 110 g of mercury from the New York Harbor by 2030, assuming an average uptake of 0.55 mu g Hg g(-1) dry weight for every oyster added to the reef. In addition to the bioaccumulation of mercury within the oyster tissue, stunted physical growth of the oysters and abnormal discoloration of the tissue indicate the presence of other heavy metals. This study demonstrates the promising role that eastern oysters play in removing heavy metals, such as mercury, from their water environment and preview significant and measurable impacts on the ecosystem.

The results showed that although the water column was typically net heterotrophic, the ecosystem as a whole displayed autotrophic characteristics. The mean net community production from the seagrass meadows was 99.31 +/- 45.13 mM C m(-2) d(-1), while the P/R ratio varied between 1.49 and 1.56. Oxygen produced through in situ photosynthesis, exhibited higher dependence over dissolved CO2 and available light. Apportionment of carbon stores in biomass indicated that nearly three-fourths were available belowground compared to aboveground. However, the sediment horizon accumulated nearly 40 times more carbon than live biomass. The carbon storage capacities of the sediments and seagrass biomass were comparable with the global mean for seagrass meadows. The results of this study highlight the major role of seagrass meadows in modification of seawater chemistry. Though the seagrass meadows of Palk Bay are increasingly subject to human impacts, with coupled regulatory and management efforts focused on improved water quality and habitat conservation, these key coastal ecosystems will continue to be valuable for climate change mitigation, considering their vital role in C dynamics and interactions with the overlying water column.

J	Ji, XL; Xie, RT; Hao, Y; Lu, J				Ji, Xiaoliang; Xie, Runting; Hao, Yun; Lu, Jun			Quantitative identification of nitrate pollution sources and uncertainty analysis based on dual isotope approach in an agricultural watershed	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Quantitative identification of nitrate (NO3--N) sources is critical to the control of nonpoint source nitrogen pollution in an agricultural watershed. Combined with water quality monitoring, we adopted the environmental isotope (delta D-H2O, delta O-18-H2O, delta N-18-NO3-, and delta O-18-NO3-) analysis and the Markov Chain Monte 'Carlo (MCMC) mixing model to determine the proportions of riverine NO3--N inputs from four potential NOT-N sources, namely, atmospheric deposition (AD), chemical nitrogen fertilizer (NF), soil nitrogen (SN), and manure and sewage (M&S), in the ChangLe River watershed of eastern China. Results showed that NO3--N was the main form of nitrogen in this watershed, accounting for approximately 74% of the total nitrogen concentration. A strong hydraulic interaction existed between the surface and groundwater for NO3--N pollution. The variations of the isotopic composition in NO3--N suggested that microbial nitrification was the dominant nitrogen transformation process in surface water, whereas significant denitrification was observed in groundwater. MCMC mixing model outputs revealed that M&S was the predominant contributor to riverine NO3--N pollution (contributing 41.8% on average), followed by SN (34.0%), NF (21.9%), and AD (2.3%) sources. Finally, we constructed an uncertainty index, UI90, to quantitatively characterize the uncertainties inherent in NO3--N source apportionment and discussed the reasons behind the uncertainties.

The response of soil and stream chemistry to decreases in acid deposition in the Catskill Mountains, New York, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												The Catskill Mountains have been adversely impacted by decades of acid deposition, however, since the early 1990s, levels have decreased sharply as a result of decreases in emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. This study examines trends in acid deposition, stream-water chemistry, and soil chemistry in the southeastern Catskill Mountains. We measured significant reductions in acid deposition and improvement in stream-water quality in 5 streams included in this study from 1992 to 2014. The largest, most significant trends were for sulfate (SO42-) concentrations (mean trend of -2.5 mu eq L-1 yr(-1)); hydrogen ion (H+) and inorganic monomeric aluminum (Al-im) also decreased significantly (mean trends of -0.3 mu eg L-1 yr(-1) for H+ and -0.1 mu eq L-1 yr(-1) for Al-im for the 3 most acidic sites). Acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) increased by a mean of 0.65 mu eq L-1 yr(-1) for all 5 sites, which was 4 fold less than the decrease in SO42- concentrations. These upward trends in ANC were limited by coincident decreases in base cations (-1.3 mu eq L-1 yr(-1) for calcium + magnesium). No significant trends were detected in stream-water nitrate (NO3-) concentrations despite significant decreasing trends in NO3- wet deposition. We measured no recovery in soil chemistry which we attributed to an initially low soil buffering capacity that has been further depleted by decades of acid deposition. Tightly coupled decreasing trends in stream-water silicon (Si) (-0.2 NO3-) and base cations suggest a decrease in the soil mineral weathering rate. We hypothesize that a decrease in the ionic strength of soil water and shallow groundwater may be the principal driver of this apparent decrease in the weathering rate. A decreasing weathering rate would help to explain the slow recovery of stream pH and ANC as well as that of soil base cations.

Influence of land use configurations on river sediment pollution	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Land use is an influential factor in river sediment pollution. However, land use type alone is found to be inadequate to explain pollutant contributions to the aquatic environment since configurations within the same land use type such as land cover and development layout could also exert an important influence. Consequently, this paper discusses a research study, which consisted of an in-depth investigation into the relationship between land use type and river sediment pollution by introducing robust parameters that represent configurations within the primary land use types. Urban water pollutants, namely, nutrients, total carbon, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and metals were investigated in the study. The outcomes show that higher patch density and more diverse land use development forms contribute relatively greater pollutant loads to receiving waters and consequently leading to higher sediment pollution. The study outcomes are expected to contribute essential knowledge for creating robust management strategies to minimise waterway pollution and thereby protect the health of aquatic ecosystems.

ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												Soil heavy metal contents were measured in newly submerged areas of the Danjiangkou Reservoir, China. We aimed to determine the heavy metal distribution in this area and the associated ecological risk. Most of these heavy metal contents (except Pb and Mn) suggest enrichment compared with the background values of soils from Henan Province, especially As and Cd with mean geo-accumulation index (I-geo) values of 0.84 and 0.54. The spatial analysis results indicated that the highest heavy metal contents were distributed in the arable soils above 160 m elevation, whereas low heavy metal contents were observed under other land-use types above 160 m elevation. According to I-geo and EF values, Cd was the major heavy metal contaminant in the newly submerged area, Cr, Pb and Mn mainly originated from natural geochemical sources. In contrast, Ni, Cd, As, Cu, and Zn mainly originated from anthropogenic sources. Evaluation using the potential ecological risk (PER) method indicated that PER of individual elements were low in the studied soils, and the comprehensive PER index was at a moderate level, indicating heavy metals in the soils of newly submerged areas may not threaten the water quality of Danjiangkou Reservoir, especially in winter.																	0147-6513	1090-2414				OCT	2017	144						380	386		10.1016/j.ecoenv.2017.06.050								WOS:000408520100046	28647605

But water quality criterias (WQCs) of PPCPs for protecting aquatic environment are lacking, which hinders the environmental management of these emerging contaminants. In the present study, in order to support their WQC derivation, acute and chronic hazardous concentrations for 5% of species (HC(5)s) of some frequently detected PPCPs in China were calculated based on acute and chronic species sensitivity distributions (SSDs), respectively, using both parametric (log-normal and log-logistic) and nonparametric bootstrap approaches. The groups of aquatic species used in SSDs included planktons, zooplanktons, invertebrates and vertebrates. Acute and chronic predicted no effect concentrations (PNECs) were derived from the HC(5)s. The acute PNECs of the selected PPCPs were in a range from 1.1 to 4993 mu g/L. While the chronic PNECs were one or two orders of magnitude lower than the acute PNECs, with a range from 0.02 to 298 mu g/L. Among these PPCPs, the compound with the highest acute effect on the aquatic environment was clarithromycin while erythromycin was the one with the highest chronic toxicity effect. Among the studied PPCPs, erythromycin caused a relatively higher aquatic ecological risk in China. This study helps derive WQCs of PPCPs in the aquatic environment, which is essential for environmental managment of these emerging contaminants.

Trace element concentrations in the groundwater of the Tamiraparani river basin, South India: Insights from human health risk and multivariate statistical techniques	CHEMOSPHERE					18th International Conference on Heavy Metals in the Environment (ICHMET)	SEP 12-15, 2016	Ghent Univ, Ghent, BELGIUM		Ghent Univ			This study investigates the concentration of trace elements in the groundwater of Tamiraparani river basin, South India. 124 groundwater samples were collected representing diverse landuse condition over the study area. The results reveal that the mean concentrations of Fe, Mn, Cu, Cr, Pb, Zn and Ni were 0.269, 0.02, 0.007, 0.007, 0.003, 0.066, and 0.004 ppm respectively. The decreasing trend of trace element content shows the'following order: Fe > Zn > Mn > Cu > Cr > Ni > Pb. Significant positive correlation (p < 0.05) is found between most of the variables such as water level and Fe, Pb; EC and Ni; Fe and Pb; Mn and Pb; Cu and Zn, Ni; Cr and Pb; Zn and Ni. The studied trace elements are found below the international drinking water guidelines except Fe, Mn, and Pb. The Empirical Bayesian Kriging (EBK) model is used to interpolate the studied metal concentrations in the groundwater of the study area. A health risk assessment was carried out using exposure dose index (CDI) and hazard quotient (HQ). The CDI values of trace elements for oral and dermal pathways shows the following order of Fe > Zn > Mn > Cu > Cr > Ni > Pb and Fe > Zn > Mn > Cr > Cu > Ni > Pb respectively. The Hazard quotients suggest that the risk of contamination through oral and dermal pathways is feeble as all the elements show values less than one. The multivariate statistical analysis reveals that the source of trace elements in the groundwater is through natural origin except copper, chromium and lead as these contaminants are derived from anthropogenic activities.

Oude			Fast calculation of groundwater exfiltration salinity in a lowland catchment using a lumped celerity/velocity approach	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												To support operational water management of freshwater resources in coastal lowlands, a need exists for a rapid, well-identifiable model to simulate salinity dynamics of exfiltrating groundwater. This paper presents the lumped Rapid Saline Groundwater Exfiltration Model (RSGEM). RSGEM simulates groundwater exfiltration salinity dynamics as governed by the interplay between water velocity, gradually adjusting the subsurface salinity distribution, and pressure wave celerity, resulting in a fast flow path response to groundwater level changes. RSGEM was applied to a field site in the coastal region of the Netherlands, parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis were performed using generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation. The model showed good correspondence to measured groundwater levels, exfiltration rates and salinity response. Moreover, RSGEM results were very similar to a detailed, complex groundwater flow and transport model previously applied to this field site. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Roadside soil, stream sediment and background soil were also studied for comparison. Sequential extractions were carried out, and lead isotopic compositions of each extraction were determined to apportion Pb sources. Besides, particle size distribution of roadside soil, and metal concentrations and Pb isotopes of each size group were determined to characterize metal contamination. In result, Zn and Cu were enriched in sediment through roadside soil. The data on metal partitioning implied that Zn posed potential hazards for water quality. Meanwhile, the noticeable reduction of the Pb-206/(207) Pb isotopic ratio in the acid-soluble fraction in the size group 200 mu m - 2 mm of national roadside soil indicated that this size group was highly contaminated by automotive emission with precipitation of acid-soluble secondary minerals during evaporation. Based on the Pb isotopic ratios, the dry deposition of Asian dust (AD) and non-Asian dust (NAD) affected roadside soil, while the effects of AD and NAD on bottom sediment appeared to be low given the low metal concentrations in sediment. Metal concentrations and Pb isotopic compositions indicated that sediments were a mixture of background and roadside soil. Source apportionment calculations showed that the average proportion of traffic Pb in bottom and stream sediments was respectively 34 and 31% in non residual fractions, and 26 and 28% in residual fraction. The residual fraction of sediments appeared to be as contaminated as the non-residual fractions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Inhibition of phosphorus sorption on calcite by dairy manure-sourced DOC	CHEMOSPHERE												In confined animal feeding operations, such as dairies, manure is amended to soils at high rates leading to increases in P and organic matter in the soils. Phosphorus reacts with soil-Ca to form Ca-P minerals, which controls P availability for leaching and transport through the watershed. In this research, the effects of manure sourced dissolved organic matter (DOM) on P sorption on calcite were measured at different reaction times and concentrations. Reactions were monitored in 1% and 10% manure-to-water extract solutions spiked with P. When manure-DOM was present, a significant reduction in P sorption occurred (2-90% absolute decrease) compared to samples without manure-DOM. The greatest decrease occurred in the samples reacted in the 10% manure solution. XANES spectroscopic analysis showed that at 1% manure solution, a Ca-P phase similar to hydroxyapatite formed. In the calcite samples reacted in the 10% Manure solution, K-edge XANES spectroscopy revealed that P occurred as a Ca-Mg-P phase instead of the less soluble hydroxyapatite-like phase. Results from this study suggest that in manure amended calcareous soils, increased DOM from manure will decrease P sorption capacity and increase the overall P concentration in solution, which will increase the mobility of P and subsequently pose greater risks for impairment of surface water quality.

As yet, water quality criteria with respect to nonylphenol pollution have not been established in China. Here, the predicted "no effect concentration" of nonylphenol was derived from an analysis of species sensitivity distribution covering a range of species mainly native to China, as a means of quantifying the ecological risk of nonylphenol in surface fresh water. The resulting model, based on the log logistic distribution, proved to be robust; the minimum sample sizes required for generating a stable estimate of HC5 were 12 for acute toxicity and 13 for chronic toxicity. The criteria maximum concentration and criteria continuous concentration were, respectively 18.49 mu g L-1 and 1.85 mu g L-1. Among the 24 sites surveyed, two were associated with a high ecological risk (risk quotient > 1) and 12 with a moderate ecological risk (risk quotient > 0.1). The potentially affected fraction ranged from 0.008% to 24.600%. The analysis provides a theoretical basis for both short- and long-term risk assessments with respect to nonylphenol, and also a means to quantify the risk to aquatic ecosystems.

Case study: "Mar Piccolo" Taranto (South Italy)	CHEMOSPHERE												Almost all marine coastal ecosystems possess complex structural and dynamic characteristics, which are influenced by anthropogenic causes and natural processes as well. Revealing the impact of sources and factors controlling the spatial distributions of contaminants within highly polluted areas is a fundamental propaedeutic step of their quality evaluation. Combination of different pattern recognition techniques, applied to one of the most polluted Mediterranean coastal basin, resulted in a more reliable hazard assessment. PCA/CA and factorial ANOVA were exploited as complementary techniques for apprehending the impact of multi-sources and multi-factors acting simultaneously and leading to similarities or differences in the spatial contamination pattern. The combination of PCA/CA and factorial ANOVA allowed, on one hand to determine the main processes and factors controlling the contamination trend within different layers and different basins, and, on the other hand, to ascertain possible synergistic effects. This approach showed the significance of a spatially representative overview given by the combination of PCA-CA/ANOVA in inferring the historical anthropogenic sources loading on the area.

This results in a very heterogeneous pattern of mobility and bioavailability, which is difficult to capture reliably and in a cost effective manner. The diffusive gradients in thin-films (DGT) technique is a popular analytical tool for testing water quality, primarily because it provides a time integrated measurement. However, to date, the most widely used DGT configuration for oxyanion sampling, the slurry ferrihydrite binding layer (SF-DGT) has only been fully characterized for phosphate. Confirmatory testing of the functional range of ionic strengths, pH, deployment times and ionic competition effects, that the SF-DGT's operates within has not been carried out, but is addressed in this study for V-V, As-V, Sb-V and Mo-Vl. In this study SF-DGT Sb-V measurements functioned over the largest range of conditions (ionic strength, 0.1-500 mM; pH 3.86-9.90), while ionic strengths above 100 and 500 mM were found to be problematic for As-V and Mo-Vl, respectively. Low pH (below 4) caused inferences with V-V, conversely Asv and Mo-VI determination faltered/deviated from predicted responses in pH conditions of similar to 9. SF-DGT measurements adequately predicted up to weeklong averaged in situ metal oxyanion concentrations in a freshwater river. This study concludes that the SF-DGT configuration is highly suitable for pollution monitoring applications in freshwater systems for key oxyanion species. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Shomar, B; Hawari, J				Shomar, Basem; Hawari, Jalal			Desalinated drinking water in the GCC countries - The need to address consumer perceptions	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries consist of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. These countries depend mainly on seawater desalination to meet their water needs. Although great emphasis is given to characterize desalinated water for its physicochemical and microbial properties, e.g. presence of metals, other organic contaminants and for bacteria, sensorial characteristics including smell, taste and color have not received the same attention. This is possibly attributed to the fact that inhabitants of GCC States do not use desalinated tap water for drinking consumption, rather they depend on locally produced or imported bottled water where color, taste and odor are not problematic. To address the consumer needs and perceptions of drinking desalinated water in GCC countries, water quality standards and guidelines, should respond to the public concern about other sensorial characteristics (organoleptic properties) including taste, odor, and trigeminal sensations. Often the root causes of color and smell in water are attributed to the presence of organic and inorganic contaminants and to bacterial growth which is frequently accompanied by the production of metabolites and byproducts that are obnoxious. The unpleasant sensorial problems associated with desalinated drinking tap water may constitute the driving force for most people in GCC countries to depend on bottled water. To encourage people in the GCC countries to consume desalinated tap water, it is essential that water testing include measurements of physicochemical properties, biofilm presence and organoleptic parameters to improve overall water quality. This review highlights the contribUtion of organoleptics for consumers of desalinated tap water. It extends water quality research to be addressed by standards for organoleptic parameters in desalinated drinking water. Accordingly, consumer awareness and outreach campaigns should be implemented to encourage people to drink tap water in the GCC countries.																	0013-9351	1096-0953				OCT	2017	158						203	211		10.1016/j.envres.2017.06.018								WOS:000408184700023	28651147

Effectiveness of table top water pitcher filters to remove arsenic from drinking water	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Arsenic contamination of drinking water is a serious threat to the health of hundreds of millions of people worldwide. In the United States similar to 3 million individuals drink well water that contains arsenic levels above the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 10 mu g/L. Several technologies are available to remove arsenic from well water including anion exchange, adsorptive media and reverse osmosis. In addition, bottled water is an alternative to drinking well water contaminated with arsenic. However, there are several drawbacks associated with these approaches including relatively high cost and, in the case of bottled water, the generation of plastic waste. In this study, we tested the ability of five tabletop water pitcher filters to remove arsenic from drinking water. We report that only one tabletop water pitcher filter tested, ZeroWater (R), reduced the arsenic concentration, both As3+ and As5+, from 1000 mu g/L to < 3 mu g/L, well below the MCL. Moreover, the amount of total dissolved solids or competing ions did not affect the ability of the ZeroWater (R) filter to remove arsenic below the MCL. Thus, the ZeroWater (R) pitcher filter is a cost effective and short-term solution to remove arsenic from drinking water and its use reduces plastic waste associated with bottled water.																	0013-9351	1096-0953				OCT	2017	158						610	615		10.1016/j.envres.2017.07.018								WOS:000408184700067	28719869

We conducted a household mail survey of 1136 residents in southern Wisconsin. In general, residents were more likely to support water quality policies if they were communitarians, egalitarians, concerned about water pollution, and perceived water quality as poor. The majority of respondents somewhat to strongly supported all of the seven proposed water quality policies, but opposed relying on voluntary action without government involvement on farms. Residents had higher support for incentives and market-based approaches (carrot policies) than regulation and taxes (stick policies). A more complicated pattern emerged in within-subject comparisons of residents' views of carrot and stick approaches. Stick approaches polarized respondents by decreasing support among people with individualistic worldviews, while slightly increasing support among people with communitarian worldviews. Residents with an agricultural occupation were more likely to support voluntary, non-governmental approaches for reducing agricultural runoff, and were also more likely to support regulation for reducing urban lawn runoff. This research highlights the dominant role of cultural worldviews and the secondary roles of water pollution concern, perceived water quality, and self-interest in explaining support for diverse policies to reduce nonpoint source pollution.																	1462-9011	1873-6416				OCT	2017	76						82	89		10.1016/j.envsci.2017.04.012								WOS:000407981300010

The purpose of this study is to examine the extent of this threat and identify more specific permitting requirements to protect surface waters. To better understand the extent of the threat, this paper identified and characterized the use of waste surface impoundments at O & G facilities as well as the threat level from O & G spills in California. To assess the efficacy of the current federal and state-permitting regime, the paper evaluated stormwater permit compliance in two California counties. It also reviewed selected spill cases and associated Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure Plans and Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plans to identify the adequacy of current industry practices. The analysis showed that contaminated stormwater from O & G facilities can be better regulated. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency does not require O & G facilities to file for an Industrial Stormwater General Permit even though many O & G industry practices have the potential to contaminate stormwater runoff from the site. When O & G facilities discharge a Reportable Quantity of a hazardous chemical or violate a water quality standard, they are required to enroll in the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit program. Spills, although not a direct indication of stormwater runoff, can highlight polluted runoff discharges that should have been regulated. Medium and large spills that reached waterways were such a risk for which operators did not file for a permit. In California new filing requirements for the oil and gas industry require all facilities that discharge stormwater that has come into contact with any overburden, raw material, or intermediate products located on the site, to file for an Industrial Stormwater General Permit. As this study showed, there has been an increase in enrollment since the enactment of the new requirements. Having all facilities enroll in the general permit program, as done in California, would require minimum monitoring and maintenance that could help prevent spills. A further step to ensure better protocol is to require specific pollution control practices in addition to the current general permit requirements. Such permitting regimes not only can be implemented on the US federal level but also internationally.																	1462-9011	1873-6416				OCT	2017	76						139	145		10.1016/j.envsci.2017.06.016								WOS:000407981300016

Considering wild hogs are widely dispersed across the landscape, they are extremely difficult to control. Disagreements can arise among different stakeholders over whether and how their populations should be managed. The purpose of this article was to examine Tennessee, United States landowners' attitudes toward wild hogs, to compare acceptability of control methods, and to evaluate factors significantly influencing public support for regulations to control wild hogs. Logistic regression was employed to analyze data collected from a statewide survey of rural landowners in the fall of 2015. Landowners had overwhelmingly negative attitudes towards wild hogs, and were concerned about their impact on the natural environment and rural economy. Although landowners showed support for controlling wild hogs, levels of acceptability for management options varied. Respondents favored active management and supported education and incentive-based control programs to control wild hogs. Cognitive concepts such as social and personal norms and awareness of consequences, as well as demographic characteristics, significantly predicted landowners' support for state regulations to control wild hogs in Tennessee. Findings increase our understanding of the human dimensions of wild hog management and that of other similarly invasive animals, and may guide resource managers in designing effective and socially acceptable management strategies to control wild hog populations in Tennessee and elsewhere.

This study develops a remote sensing-based multiscale modeling system by integrating multi-sensor satellite data merging and image reconstruction algorithms in support of feature extraction with machine learning leading to automate continuous water quality monitoring in environmentally sensitive regions. This new Earth observation platform, termed "cross mission data merging and image reconstruction with machine learning" (CDMIM), is capable of merging multiple satellite imageries to provide daily water quality monitoring through a series of image processing, enhancement, reconstruction, and data mining/machine learning techniques. Two existing key algorithms, including Spectral Information Adaptation and Synthesis Scheme (SIASS) and SMart Information Reconstruction (SMIR), are highlighted to support feature extraction and content-based. mapping. Whereas SIASS can support various data merging efforts to merge images collected from cross-mission satellite sensors, SMIR can overcome data gaps by reconstructing the information of value-missing pixels due to impacts such as cloud obstruction. Practical implementation of CDMIM was assessed by predicting the water quality over seasons in terms of the concentrations of nutrients and chlorophyll-a, as well as water clarity in Lake Nicaragua, providing synergistic efforts to better monitor the aquatic environment and offer insightful lake watershed management strategies.

Proactive modeling of water quality impacts of extreme precipitation events in a drinking water reservoir	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Extreme precipitation events are of concern to managers of drinking water sources because these occurrences can affect both water supply quantity and quality. However, little is known about how these low probability events impact organic matter and nutrient loads to surface water sources and how these loads may impact raw water quality. This study describes a method for evaluating the sensitivity of a water body of interest from watershed input simulations under extreme precipitation events. An example application of the method is illustrated using the Wachusett Reservoir, an oligo-mesotrophic surface water reservoir in central Massachusetts and a major drinking water supply to metropolitan Boston. Extreme precipitation event simulations during the spring and summer resulted in total organic carbon, UV-254 (a surrogate measurement for reactive organic matter), and total algae concentrations at the drinking water intake that exceeded recorded maximums. Nutrient concentrations after storm events were less likely to exceed recorded historical maximums. For this particular reservoir, increasing inter reservoir transfers of water with lower organic matter content after a large precipitation event has been shown in practice and in model simulations to decrease organic matter levels at the drinking water intake, therefore decreasing treatment associated oxidant demand, energy for UV disinfection, and the potential for formation of disinfection byproducts.

Bacterial mobilization and transport through manure enriched soils: Experiment and modeling	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												A precise evaluation of bacteria transport and mathematical investigations are useful for best management practices in agroecosystems. In this study, using laboratory experiments and modeling approaches, we assess the transport of bacteria released from three types of manure (cow, sheep, and poultry) to find the importance of the common manures in agricultural activities in soil and water pollution. Thirty six intact soil columns with different textures (sandy, loamy, and silty clay loam) were sampled. Fecal coliform leaching from layers of the manures on the soil surface was conducted under steady-state saturated flow conditions at 20 degrees C for up to four Pore Volumes (PVs). Separate leaching experiments were conducted to obtain the initial concentrations of bacteria released from the manures (Co). Influent (Co) and effluent (C) bacteria concentrations were measured by the plate-count method and the normalized concentrations (C/C0) were plotted versus PV representing the breakthrough curves (BTCs). Transport parameters were predicted using the attachment/detachment model (two-kinetic site) in HYDRUS-1D. Simulations fitted well the experimental data (R-2 = 0.50-0.96). The attachment, detachment, and straining coefficients of bacteria were more influenced by the soils treated with cow manure compared to the sheep and poultry manures. Influent curves of fecal coliforms from the manures (leached without soil) illustrated that the poultry manure had the highest potential to pollute the effluent water from the soils in term of concentration, but the BTCs and simulated data related to the treated soils illustrated that the physical shape of cow manure was more important to both straining and detachment of bacteria back into the soil solution. Detachment trends of bacteria were observed through loam and silty clay loam soils treated with cow manure compared to the cow manure enriched sandy soil. We conclude that management strategies must specifically minimize the effect of fecal coliform concentrations before field application, especially for the combination of poultry and cow manures, which has higher solubility and tailing behavior, respectively. Interestingly, the addition of sheep manure with all three soils had the lowest mobilization of bacteria. We also suggest studying the chemistry of soil solution affected by manures to present all relevant information which affect bacterial movement through soils during leaching. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

A loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for the rapid detection of Enterococcus spp. in water	WATER RESEARCH												Faecal pollution of water and the resulting potential presence of human enteric pathogens is a predominant threat to public health. Microbiological water quality can be assessed by the detection of standard faecal indicator bacteria (SFIB) such as E. coil or certain Enterococcus species. In recent years, isothermal amplification methods have become a useful alternative to polymerase chain reaction (PCR), allowing molecular diagnostics with simple or no instrumentation. In this study, a novel screening method for the molecular detection of Enterococcus spp. by loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is described. A set of six specific LAMP primers was designed to amplify a diagnostic fragment of the Enterococcus 23S rRNA gene, which is present in several enterococcal species targeted by quantitative PCR (qPCR), which is the standard technique recommended by the US Environmental Protection Agency. Sensitivity and specificity tests were performed using a set of 30 Enterococcus and non-target bacterial reference strains. It is shown that LAMP is equally sensitive and even more specific than the qPCR assay. A dilution series of Enterococcus faeons DNA revealed that the LAMP method can reliably detect 130 DNA target copies per reaction within 45 min. Additionally, enterococci isolated from Austrian surface waterbodies, as well as a set of DNA extracts from environmental waters, were tested. Contingency analysis demonstrated a highly significant correlation between the results of the developed LAMP assay and the reference qPCR method. Furthermore, a simple staining procedure with a fluorescence dye demonstrated the identification of amplified products by eye. In conclusion, this method is an important component for the efficient screening and testing of water samples in low-resource settings lacking sophisticated laboratory equipment and highly trained personnel, requiring only a simple heating block.

Two pilot-scale ozonation reactors (4-5 m(3) h(-1)), a 4-chamber reactor and a tubular reactor, were investigated by either conventional ozonation and/or the advanced oxidation process (AOP) O-3/H2O2. The effects of selected operational parameters, such as ozone dose (0.5-3 mg L-1) and H2O2 dose (O-3:H2O2 = 1:3-3:1 (mass ratio)), and selected water quality parameters, such as pH (6.5-8.5) and initial bromide concentration (15 200 Lig L-1), on micropollutant abatement and bromate formation were investigated. Under the studied conditions, compounds with high second-order rate constants k03>104 M-1 s(-1) for their reaction with ozone were well abated (>90%) even for the lowest ozone dose of 0.5 mg L-1. Conversely, the abatement efficiency of sucralose, which only reacts with hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH), varied between 19 and 90%. Generally, the abatement efficiency increased with higher ozone doses and higher pH and lower bromide concentrations. H2O2 addition accelerated the ozone conversion to "OH, which enables a faster abatement of ozone-resistant micropollutants. Interestingly, the abatement of micropollutants decreased with higher bromide concentrations during conventional ozonation due to competitive ozone-consuming reactions, except for lamotrigine. due to the suspected reaction of HOBr/ORC with the primary amine moieties. In addition to the abatement of micropollutants, the evolution of the two main transformation products (TPs) of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) and tramadol (TRA), chlorothiazide (CTZ) and tramadol N oxide (TRA-NOX), respectively, was assessed by chemical analysis and kinetic modeling. Both selected TPs were quickly formed initially to reach a maximum concentration followed by a decrease of their concentrations for longer contact times. For the studied conditions, the TP's concentrations at the outlet of the reactors ranged from 0 to 61% of the initial parent compound concentration, CTZ being a more persistent TP against further oxidation than TRA-NOX. Finally, it was demonstrated in both reactors that the formation of bromate (BrOi), a potentially carcinogenic oxidation by-product, could be controlled by H2O2 addition with a general improvement on micropollutant abatement. Post-treatment by granular activated carbon (GAC) filtration enabled the reduction of micropollutants and TPs concentrations but no changes in bromate were observed. The combined algae assay showed that water quality was				McArdell, Christa/R-9710-2017	McArdell, Christa/0000-0002-5251-7541												0043-1354					OCT 1	2017	122						234	245		10.1016/j.watres.2017.05.018								WOS:000407404300024	28601791

High pesticide loadings can potentially result in polluted stream water. The objective of this study was to determine the pesticide loadings and concentrations of three typical pesticides (atrazine, oxadiazon, and isoprothiolane) in river water from a middle high latitude agricultural watershed in northern China. During this study, we evaluated the watershed pesticide loss patterns for two crop types over three decades. For this purpose, we integrated data from field investigations, laboratory experiments, and modeling simulations involving a distributed hydrological solute transport model (Soil and Water Assessment Tool, SWAT). SWAT was employed to compare the temporal spatial fate and behaviors of atrazine, oxadiazon, and isoprothiolane from 1990 to 2014 in a watershed area amounting to 141.5 km(2). The results showed that the three pesticides could be detected at different locations throughout the watershed, and isoprothiolane was detected at the maximum value of 1.082 mu g/L in surface runoff of paddy land. The temporal trend for the yearly loading of atrazine decreased slightly over time, but the trends for oxadiazon and isoprothiolane increased markedly over an 18-year analysis period. In regard to the pesticide concentrations in water, atrazine was associated with the largest value of nearly 1.4 mu g/L. July and August were the found to be prime periods for pesticide loss from paddy land, and the biggest monthly loss of atrazine from dryland appeared in June. Under similar usage conditions, isoprothiolane loading from paddy fields ranked as the largest one among the three types of pesticides and reached up to 17 g/ha. Limited monitoring data were useful for validating the model, which yielded valuable temporal-spatial data on the fate of pesticides in this watershed. With the expansion of paddy rice cultivation, risks for pesticide contamination of water bodies will increase. The results of this study should be valuable for future exposure and risk assessments aimed at protecting the environment and human health. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Winton, RS; River, M				Winton, R. Scott; River, Mark			The biogeochemical implications of massive gull flocks at landfills	WATER RESEARCH												Gulls have long been observed concentrating in flocks of tens to hundreds of thousands at the anthropogenic food sources provided by landfills. Yet, the biogeochemical implications of the landfill gull phenomenon have been largely ignored. This study has two goals: 1) to understand the magnitude and geographic extent of landfill gulls in North America, and 2) to quantify the amount of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) transported from landfills to gull roosting sites in order to understand their potential impacts on water quality and methane (CH4) emission. We synthesized and mapped data from the eBird Citizen Science database and found that 1.4 million gulls have been documented at landfills throughout North America, though the actual population is probably greater than 5 million. Using a carnivorous bird transport model we estimate that these gulls transport 39,000 to 139,000 kg of P and 240,000 to 858,000 kg of N y(-1) to neighboring water bodies and avoid roughly 1.1 to 3.9 Tg y(-1) of landfill CH4 emissions. The avoided CH4 emission mitigation is insignificant in the context of gross landfill emissions, but the transported nutrients may be relevant to water quality management at local and continental scales. For example, at the Jordan Lake reservoir in North Carolina, a flock of 49,000 Ring billed Gulls (Larus delawarensis) annually deposits landfill feces containing 1070 kg P, an amount equivalent to approximately half of total maximum daily load reduction targets and worth roughly $2.2 million USD in nutrient credits. We estimate that continent-wide gull impacts are worth at least $100 million in nutrient offset credits. We conclude that mega-flocks of landfill gulls are common and widespread, and that their capacity to transport nutrients may be contributing to the eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems and water supplies.

Information on the abundance and distribution of cyanobacteria is fundamental to support risk assessment and management activities. In the present study, an approach based on Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis was used to estimate the concentrations of chlorophyll a (Chla) and the cyanobacterial biomarker pigment phycocyanin (PC) using data from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in Lake Chaohu (China's fifth largest freshwater lake). The approach was developed and tested using fourteen years (2000-2014) of MODIS images, which showed significant spatial and temporal variability of the PC:Chla ratio, an indicator of cyanobacterial dominance. The results had unbiased RMS uncertainties of <60% for Chla ranging between 10 and 300 mu g/L, and unbiased RMS uncertainties of <65% for PC between 10 and 500 mu g/L. Further analysis showed the importance of nutrient and climate conditions for this dominance. Low TN:TP ratios (<29:1) and elevated temperatures were found to influence the seasonal shift of phytoplankton community. The resultant MODIS Chla and PC products were then used for cyanobacterial risk mapping with a decision tree classification model. The resulting Water Quality Decision Matrix (WQDM) was designed to assist authorities in the identification of possible intake areas, as well as specific months when higher frequency monitoring and more intense water treatment would be required if the location of the present intake area remained the same. Remote sensing cyanobacterial risk mapping provides a new tool for reservoir and lake management programs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Cd is a typical heavy metal leached from farmland that is related to phosphate fertilizers and carries serious environmental risk. The spatial-vertical pattern of Cd in soil and the vertical trend of Cd in the river sediment core were analyzed, which showed the migration and accumulation of Cd in the watershed. To prevent watershed Cd loss, biochar was employed, and leaching experiments were conducted to investigate the Cd loss from soil depending on the initial concentration. Four rainfall intensities, 1.25 mm/ h, 2.50 mmih, 5.00 mm/h, and 10.00 mm/h, were used to simulate typical rainfall scenarios for the study area. Biochar was prepared from corn straw after pretreatment with ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (ADP) and pyrolysis at 400 degrees C under anoxic conditions. To identify the effects of biochar amendment on Cd migration, the biochar was mixed with soil for 90 days at concentrations of 0%, 0.5%, 1.0%, 3.0%, and 5.0% soil by weight. The results showed that the Cd leaching load increased as the initial load and rainfall intensity increased and that eluviation caused surface Cd to diffuse to the deep soils. The biochar application caused more of the heavy metals to be immobilized in the amended soil rather than transported into the waterbody. The sorption efficiency of the biochar for Cd increased as the addition level increased to 3%, which showed better performance than the 5% addition level under some initial concentration and rainfall conditions. The research indicated that biochar is a potential material to prevent diffuse heavy metal pollution and that a lower addition makes the application more feasible. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

It is based upon aqueous geochemistry and the stepwise modifications of soil solution during its transfer from the surface till aquifer. Meadows of Crau (SE France), irrigated since the 16th century, were field monitored (2012-2015) and modelled. Except for N, the mineral requirements of hay are largely covered by dissolved elements brought by irrigation water with only slight deficits in K and P, which are compensated by P-K fertilizers and the winter pasture by sheep. N cycle results in a very small nitrate leakage. The main determinants of the chemical composition changes of water are: concentration by evaporation, equilibration with soil pCO(2), mineral nutrition of plants, input of fertilizers, sheep grazing, mineral-solution interactions in superficial formations till the aquifer, including ion exchange. Inverse modelling with PHREEQC allows for quantifying these processes. For groundwater, measured composition fit statistically very well with those computed, validating thus this approach. This long-term established agrosystem protects both soil and water resources: soil nutritional status remains constant with even some P and (minor) K fixation in soils; long-term decarbonatation occurs but it is greatly slowed by saturation of irrigation water by carbonate; P fixation in soil protects groundwater from eutrophication.

Performance of surface and subsurface flow constructed wetlands treating eutrophic waters	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Three medium size constructed wetlands (CWs) with a total surface of 90 ha are working since 2009 in the Albufera de Valencia Natural Park (Spain). Two of them are fed with eutrophic waters from l'Albufera Lake. Their objectives are both reduce the phytoplankton biomass and increase the biodiversity; consequently, improved water quality is returned to the lake. A "science based governance" of these CWs is ongoing inside the LIFE + 12 Albufera Project to demonstrate the environmental benefits of these features. In this paper, results and relationships among hydraulic operation, physicochemical variables and plankton in two different CWs typologies, five free water surface CW (FWSCW) and one horizontal subsurface flow CW(HSSFCW), were analysed showing that CWs were capable of improving the water quality and biodiversity but showing clear differences depending on the CW type. The CWs worked under different hydraulic load rates (HLR) from <0.12 to 54.75 m yr(-1). Inflow water quality was typical from eutrophic waters with mean values of chlorophyll a (Chl a) about 22-90 mu g Chl a l(-1) and mean total phosphorus (TP) between 0.122 and 0.337 mg l(-1). The main conclusion is that HSSFCW was much more efficient than FWSCW in the removal of organic matter, suspended solids and nutrients. The biological role of several shallow lagoons located at the end of the CWs has also been evaluated, showing that they contribute to increase the zooplankton biomass, a key factor to control the phytoplankton blooms.

This work aims to develop a green water treatment sequence using a natural coagulant (Moringa oleifera) and a natural activated carbon (vegetable coconut palm) to remove Microcystis aeruginosa and natural organic matter in an integrated process. The proposed sequence, coagulation/flocculation/dissolved air flotation and activated carbon, is an eco-friendly and innovative option for water treatment managers, since it includes environmentally friendly products for the contaminant removal from water, replacing the traditional inorganic/synthetic coagulants and adsorbents. Results demonstrated that waters with concentrations as high as 150-200 mu g/I. of chlorophyll a and natural organic matter between 5 and 16 mg C/L presented removals higher than 80% for turbidity and chlorophyll a, 70-80% for dissolved organic matter and 80-90% for UV254nm. Moringa oleifera natural coagulant removed almost 80% of Microcystis aeruginosa cells in coagulation/flocculation/dissolved air flotation processes. The coconut palm activated carbon showed a high capacity to adsorb DOC from water with a maximum adsorbed capacity of 51.8 mg/g at equilibrium. The values obtained in treated water for the parameters measured are very encouraging, so this innovative integrated sequence may be used for improving water quality, benefiting human health and wellbeing.

J	Garcia, CA; Hodaifa, G				Agabo Garcia, Cristina; Hodaifa, Gassan			Real olive oil mill wastewater treatment by photo-Fenton system using artificial ultraviolet light lamps	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Large volume of untreated olive oil mill wastewater (OMW) is being stored in evaporation rafts. Given the high organic load and the presence of phenolic compounds in OMW, an effective treatment process should be implemented. In this work, an advanced oxidation process (photo-Fenton) operating in a batch reactor was used to treat OMW. All experiments were developed using FeCl3 as a catalyst. Different H2O2 concentrations (5.0, 8.0, 11.0, 15.0, 16.0, 21.0, 24.0 and 30.0 g/L) were studied as well as four commercial medium pressure UV-lamps (Standard, Z1, Z2 and Z3). The common operation conditions were: pH = 3, temperature 20 degrees C, [catalyst] = 3.0 and direct ultraviolet light (UV-light). The samples were analysed at different times during the experiments to determine water quality parameters. In general, high total carbon, total organic carbon, total phenolic compounds and turbidity removal percentages (>90%) were registered in all experiments, at all oxidant concentrations studied. Increasing oxidant concentrations did not imply a noticeable rise on the final removal percentages (approximately 5% at these experimental conditions). Total nitrogen content removal percentages were determined and varied in the range of 62.5 - 75.5%. UV-lamps presented virtually similar removal percentages with the following averages COD = 95.7 +/- 0.53%, total phenolic compounds = 93.6 +/- 2.5%, total carbon = 94.0 +/- 1.2%, total organic carbon = 96.3 +/- 0.6%, total nitrogen = 74.9 +/- 6.8% and turbidity 92.5 +/- 1.9%.

And aeration plays an important role in its sustainable operation, as well as economic and environmental feasibility. In this study, two patterns to reduce aeration intensity, i.e., semi aeration (SA) and intermittent aeration (IA) were used to improve the economic and environmental benefits of media-based aquaponics. Results showed that SA aquaponics, in which the energy efficiencies on culturing fish and crop were improved respectively by 78.20% and 77.61% compared with Control, had the potential to obtain higher economic benefits. Although both SA and IA could save half of the aeration cost by reducing aeration flux and time respectively, the product yields in SA weren't impaired seriously while in IA aquaponics they were. And the nitrogen utilization efficiency (NUE) of SA aquaponics was 113% higher than that of IA aquaponics, mainly attributed to the more stable dissolved oxygen concentration in SA. Better water quality was obtained in IA aquaponics, however, it was achieved at the cost of higher N loss (mainly in the form of N-2), which subsequently reduced the potential for further improvement of NUE. Both SA and IA could considerably reduce GHG emissions from aquaponics, due to lower energy requirement. IA aquaponics showed the lowest N2O emission, but the primary source (over 97%) of greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions from aquaponics was off-site indirect CO2 emission. Taking productivity and environmental impact into consideration, semi-aeration was believed to be a better choice when reducing aeration. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Effects of an Extreme Flood on Trace Elements in River Water-From Urban Stream to Major River Basin	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Major floods adversely affect water quality through surface runoff, groundwater discharge, and damage to municipal water infrastructure. Despite their importance, it can be difficult to assess the effects of floods on streamwater chemistry because of challenges collecting samples and the absence of baseline data. This study documents water quality during the September 2013 extreme flood in the South Platte River, Colorado, USA. Weekly time-series water samples were collected from 3 urban source waters (municipal tap water, streamwater, and wastewater treatment facility effluent) under normal-flow and flood conditions. In addition, water samples were collected during the flood at 5 locations along the South Platte River and from 7 tributaries along the Colorado Front Range. Samples were analyzed for 54 major and trace elements. Specific chemical tracers, representing different natural and anthropogenic sources and geochemical behaviors, were used to compare streamwater composition before and during the flood. The results differentiate hydrological processes that affected water quality: (1) in the upper watershed, runoff diluted most dissolved constituents, (2) in the urban corridor and lower watershed, runoff mobilized soluble constituents accumulated on the landscape and contributed to stream loading, and (3) flood induced groundwater discharge mobilized soluble constituents stored in the vadose zone.

About 7 indicators are considered, including ecological degradation intensity (EDI), hydrodynamic disturbance (IHD), engineering types, water quality, economic investment, population growth, and reclaimed land area. Meanwhile, an integrated framework enhanced methods in terms of (a) measuring intensity of ecological degradation process under multi-scale impact, (b) developing the indicator system of CRI, and discussing the driving forces and trends of coastal reclamation, (c) determining fuzzy preference relations of weight and calculating the specific value of CRI with the case study areas of Yellow River estuary from 2000 to 2015. As the result, the CRI has been expanded unceasingly in recent years. The total growth rate from 2000 to 2015 is about 37.97%. It is concluded that CRI has climbed to a higher intensity level in resent 15 years.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				SEP 15	2017	122	1-2					27	37		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.05.065								WOS:000408076900015	28633950

The lagoons have similar physical and hydrological characteristics, but differ substantially in the degree of watershed urban development and nutrient loading rates. In total the lagoons experienced 22 storm events during the period studied. Specifically, we examine (1) whether there are influences on water quality in the lagoons from watershed development, (2) whether there are influences on water quality in the lagoons from storm activity, and (3) whether water quality is affected to a greater degree by watershed development versus storm activity. The two urbanized lagoons typically showed higher water-column nitrate, dissolved organic nitrogen, and phosphate compared with the non-urbanized lagoon. One of the urbanized lagoons had higher water-column chlorophyll a concentrations than the other two lagoons on most sampling dates, and higher light extinction coefficients on some sampling dates. The non-urbanized lagoon had higher water-column dissolved oxygen concentrations than other lagoons on many sampling dates. Our results suggest long-term influences of watershed development on coastal water quality. We also found some evidence of significant storm effects on water quality, such as increased nitrate, phosphate, and dissolved oxygen, and decreased salinity and water temperature. However, the influences of watershed development on water quality were greater. These results suggest that changes in water quality induced by human watershed development pervade despite the storm effects. These findings may be useful for environmental management since they suggest that storms do not profoundly alter long-term changes in water quality that resulted from human development of watersheds.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				SEP 15	2017	122	1-2					207	216		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.06.038								WOS:000408076900033	28662980

Elucidation of seasonal variations of physicochemical and biological parameters with statistical analysis methods in Puducherry coastal waters	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												The present investigation aimed to study the effect of monsoonal and anthropogenic influences on the water quality parameters of Puducherry coastal waters. Surface water sampling was performed at three fixed stations in four distinct seasons during 2011. Physical water quality parameters such as salinity and TSM showed strong seasonal and spatial variability. Evaporation and monsoonal runoff seem to be the major controlling forces for these parameters in the coastal waters. Seasonal distribution of the parameters showed a random pattern for nitrate and a well-defined pattern for silicate. Chl-alpha was minimum during monsoon when high TSM was encountered in the system. Moreover, factors that regulated the phytoplankton biomass varied with seasons. Moreover, TSM was strongly correlated with silicate. The relationship between Chl-alpha and nutrients were more consistent throughout the year, and much weaker correlations were noticed between Chl-alpha and TSM. Cluster analysis depicted the existence of a marked seasonal heterogeneity.

The results show that while salinity has undergone several shifts, seawater temperature exhibited a steady increasing trend since the 1980s. The observed salinity shows strong correlation with Shatt Al-Arab River discharge indicating primary contribution of freshwater to salinity among other factors (evaporation and desalination effluent). Recent data show that salinity is at its highest level in the last 30 years with less pronounced seasonal variability in response to severe decline in the freshwater runoff into the northwestern Arabian Gulf. The changes in hydrographic conditions may have significant implications on hydrodynamics, water quality, and ecosystems in the Gulf. Thus, cooperation among the concerned countries - both coastal and riparian nations - would be essential for prevention of further major changes in the Gulf.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				SEP 15	2017	122	1-2					488	499		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.06.056								WOS:000408076900069	28697945

Modeling washoff of total suspended solids in the tropics	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Washoff behavior in the tropics is expected to behave differently from temperate areas due to differences in rainfall characteristics. In this study, rainfall, runoff and total suspended solids (TSS) were monitored from 9 catchments distinguished by different types of land use, in Singapore. The catchments ranged in size from 5.7ha to 85.2ha. Over 120 rain events were studied and more than 1000 storm samples were collected and analyzed. Monte Carlo analysis was applied to obtain the best fit values of the washoff model parameters consisting the washoff coefficient c(3), washoff exponent c(4) and initial mass on surface Bini. The exponent c(4) was found to be approximately unity for all the events monitored, in agreement with other studies. The values of c(3) and B-ini were found to vary between events. Among all the rainfall and runoff characteristics studied, rainfall depth of the current event (d) was found to be the single parameter that significantly influenced the values of c(3) and B-ini. Contrary to expectations, B-ini did not correlate well with antecedent dry period or with rainfall depth of the prior storm event. The results show that the common modeling practice where B-ini is assumed to vary with antecedent dry period and previous rainfall depth should be reassessed when applied to catchments in the tropics. ANCOVA analysis showed that land use was not significant, but rather the variation of c(3) and B-ini with d was found to correlate well with the catchment area. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the key blackening and stinking pollutants and their sources are still unclear. In this study, water quality of a black-stinking urban river in Beijing, Dongsha River, was evaluated firstly; then the distribution of the blackening and stinking pollutants was investigated, and the key pollutants and their potential sources were identified; and finally, the health risk of those pollutants was assessed. The results showed that NH3-N, total phosphorus, dissolved oxygen and chemical oxygen demand ranged from 1.3 to 5.3 mg/L, 0.7 -3.0 mg/L, 1.0-3.2 mg/L and 29-104 mg/L, respectively. The value of TP-based trophic level index indicated that Dongsha River reached severe eutrophication level; the maximum value of chroma and odor level reached 32 and 4, respectively. The main dissolved organic compounds included aromatic protein II, soluble microbiological metabolites, fulvic acids and humic acids. The blackening pollutants Fe, Mn, Cu and S2- were extensively detected, with significantly spatial differences along the river. Dimethyl sulfide, beta-ionone, 2-methylisoborneol and geosmin were identified to be the stinking pollutants. Their concentrations covered wide ranges, and even the lowest concentration value was thousands of times higher than its olfactory threshold. Correlation analysis indicated that in the overlaying water S2- was the key blackening pollutant, while beta-ionone and geosmin were the key stinking pollutants. Principal components analysis combining with the site survey revealed their potential sources. S2- was mainly associated with the decomposition of endogenous sulfur-containing organics; beta-ionone might be generated by the endogenous beta-carotene bio-conversion and the exogenous discharges, while geosmin might originate from the endogenous humus bio-conversion and anthropic wastes. Furthermore, multi metals in the sediment posed health risks to children, while dimethyl sulfide had non-cancer health risk for adults and children. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Giri, S; Qiu, ZY; Zhang, Z				Giri, Subhasis; Qiu, Zeyuan; Zhang, Zhen			A novel technique for establishing soil topographic index thresholds in defining hydrologically sensitive areas in landscapes	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Hydrologically sensitive areas (HSAs) are useful for analyzing a watershed. However, correct delineation of HSAs is critical for conducting such analysis. Scientifically defensible methods for delineating HSAs are lacking. The objectives of this study are to identify threshold soil topographic indices (STIs) based on the relationship between the observed soil moisture and the calculated STI in two sites using a trellis plot approach, and validate the identified threshold STIs in delineating HSAs in 15 watersheds in North Central New Jersey based on a linear mixed modeling of the relationship between land use and water quality at the watershed and HSA scales. Field soil moisture data are collected during April, May, June, July, August, and September for three years at Christie Hoffman Park and Fairview Farm in Central New Jersey. The linear mixed models assess the relationship between land use metrics in terms of percentages of land uses and three water quality indicators including total suspended solids, total nitrogen and total phosphorus in streams at both watershed and HSA scales. Trellis plot analyses based on a polynomial regression model of order of two to four identify the threshold STIs ranging from nine to 15 for delineating HSAs. The linear mixed modeling results indicate that the relationships between land use and three water quality indicators at the HSA scales are similar to their relationships at the watershed scale. The predictive powers of these HSA and watershed scale models are very similar. These results suggest that it is appropriate for policymakers and watershed managers to use HSAs rather than entire watersheds to characterize watersheds and devise management strategies to optimize resource uses. The novel technique developed in this study can be used in other parts of the world.

J	Lee, M; Kim, M; Kim, Y; Han, M				Lee, Minju; Kim, Mikyeong; Kim, Yonghwan; Han, Mooyoung			Consideration of rainwater quality parameters for drinking purposes: A case study in rural Vietnam	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Rainwater, which is used for drinking purposes near Hanoi, Vietnam, was analysed for water quality based on 1.5 years of monitoring data. In total, 23 samples were collected from different points within two rainwater harvesting systems (RWHSs). Most parameters met the standard except micro-organisms. Coliform and Escherichia coli (E. coil) were detected when the rainwater was not treated with ultraviolet (UV) light; however, analysis of rainwater after UV sterilisation showed no trace of micro-organisms. The RWHSs appear to provide drinking water of relatively good quality compared with surface water and groundwater. The superior quality of the rainwater suggests the necessity for new drinking rainwater standards because applying all of the drinking water quality standards to rainwater is highly inefficient. The traditionally implemented standards could cause more difficulties for developing countries using RWHSs installed decentralized as a source of drinking water, particularly in areas not well supplied with testing equipment, because such countries must bear the expense and time for these measures. This paper proposes the necessity of rainwater quality guideline, which could serve as a safe and cost-effective alternative to provide an access to safe drinking water. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Citizen science for water quality monitoring: Data implications of citizen perspectives	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Citizen science, where citizens play an active role in the scientific process, is increasingly used to expand the reach and scope of scientific research while also achieving engagement and educational goals. Despite the emergence of studies exploring data outcomes of citizen science, the process and experience of engaging with citizens and citizen-lead groups through participatory science is less explored. This includes how citizen perspectives alter data outcomes, a critical upshot given prevalent mistrust of citizen versus scientist data. This study uses a citizen science campaign investigating watershed impacts on water quality to interrogate the nature and implications of citizen involvement in producing scientifically and societally relevant data. Data representing scientific outcomes are presented alongside a series of vignettes that offer context regarding how, why, and where citizens engaged with the project. From these vignettes, six specific lessons are examined towards understanding how integration of citizen participation alters data outcomes relative to 'professional' science. In particular, elements of participant social identity (e.g., their motivation for participation), and contextual knowledge (e.g., of the research program itself) can shape participation and resulting data outcomes. Such scientific outcomes are particularly relevant given continued concerns regarding the quality of citizen data, which could hinder scientific acceptance of citizen sciences. Importantly, the potential for meaningful engagement with citizen and participants within citizen groups - given significant capacity within the community - represents a substantial and under-realized opportunity.

Transcriptomic approach for assessment of the impact on microalga and macrophyte of in-situ exposure in river sites contaminated by chlor-alkali plant effluents	WATER RESEARCH												Water quality degradation is a worldwide problem, but risk evaluation of chronic pollution in-situ is still a challenge. The present study aimed to evaluate the potential of transcriptomic analyses in representative aquatic primary producers to assess the impact of environmental pollution in-situ: the microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and the macrophyte Elodea nuttallii were exposed 2 h in the Babeni Reservoir of the Olt River impacted by chlor-alkali plant effluent release resulting in increased concentrations of Hg and NaCl in receiving water. The response at the transcriptomic level was strong, resulting in up to 5485, and 8700 dysregulated genes (DG) for the microalga and for the macrophyte exposed in the most contaminated site, respectively. Transcriptomic response was congruent with the concentrations of Hg and NaCl in the water of the impacted reservoir. Genes involved in development, energy metabolism, lipid metabolism, nutrition, and RedOx homeostasis were dysregulated during in-situ exposure of both organisms. In addition, genes involved in the cell motility of C. reinhardtii and development of the cell wall of E. nuttallii were affected. DG were in line with adverse outcome pathways and transcriptomic studies reported after exposure to high concentrations of Hg and NaCl under controlled conditions in the laboratory. Transcriptomic response provided a sensitive measurement of the exposure as well as hints on the tolerance mechanisms of environmental pollution, and is thus promising as an early-warning tool to assess water quality degradation.

Seabed gallery intakes: Investigation of the water pretreatment effectiveness of the active layer using a long-term column experiment	WATER RESEARCH												Seabed gallery intake systems used for seawater reverse osmosis facilities employ the same principle of water treatment as slow sand filtration in freshwater systems. An investigation concerning the effectiveness of the active layer (top layer) in improving raw water quality was conducted by using a long-term bench-scale columns experiment. Two different media types, silica and carbonate sand, were tested in 1 m columns to evaluate the effectiveness of media type in terms of algae, bacteria, Natural Organic Matter (NOM) and Transparent Exopolymer Particles (TEP) removal over a period of 620 days. Nearly all algae in the silica sand column, 87% (sigma = 0.04) of the bacteria, 59% (sigma = 0.11) of the biopolymer fraction of NOM, 59% (sigma = 0.16) of particulate and 32% (sigma = 0.25) of colloidal TEP were removed during the last 330 days of the experiment. Total removal was observed in the carbonate sand column for algal concentration, while the bacterial removal was lower at 74% (sigma = 0.08). Removal of biopolymers, particulate and colloidal TEP were higher in the carbonate column during the last 330 days with 72% (sigma = 0.15), 66% (sigma =0.08) and 36% (sigma = 0.12) removed for these organics respectively. Removal of these key organics through the 1 m thick column, representing the active layer, will likely reduce the rate of biofouling, reduce chemical usage and minimize operating cost in SWRO systems. The data show that the media will require several months at the beginning of operation to reach equilibrium so that high organic removal rates can be achieved. No development of a "schmutzdecke" layer occurred. The experimental results suggest that unlike freshwater slow sand filtration wherein most water treatment occurs in the upper 10 cm, in seawater systems treatment occurs throughout the full active layer depth of 1 m. The results of this study will help in designing and operating seabed gallery intake systems in varied geological conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Evaluation of methods to sample fecal indicator bacteria in foreshore sand and pore water at freshwater beaches	WATER RESEARCH												Fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) are known to accumulate in foreshore beach sand and pore water (referred to as foreshore reservoir) where they act as a non-point source for contaminating adjacent surface waters. While guidelines exist for sampling surface waters at recreational beaches, there is no widely-accepted method to collect sand/sediment or pore water samples for FIB enumeration. The effect of different sampling strategies in quantifying the abundance of FIB in the foreshore reservoir is unclear. Sampling was conducted at six freshwater beaches with different sand types to evaluate sampling methods for characterizing the abundance of E. coli in the foreshore reservoir as well as the partitioning of E. coli between different components in the foreshore reservoir (pore water, saturated sand, unsaturated sand). Methods were evaluated for collection of pore water (drive point, shovel, and careful excavation), unsaturated sand (top 1 cm, top 5 cm), and saturated sand (sediment core, shovel, and careful excavation). Ankle-depth surface water samples were also collected for comparison. Pore water sampled with a shovel resulted in the highest observed E. coli concentrations (only statistically significant at fine sand beaches) and lowest variability compared to other sampling methods. Collection of the top 1 cm of unsaturated sand resulted in higher and more variable concentrations than the top 5 cm of sand. There were no statistical differences in E. coli concentrations when using different methods to sample the saturated sand. Overall, the unsaturated sand had the highest amount of E. coli when compared to saturated sand and pore water (considered on a bulk volumetric basis). The findings presented will help determine the appropriate sampling strategy for characterizing FIB abundance in the foreshore reservoir as a means of predicting its potential impact on nearshore surface water quality and public health risk.

However, the development of reliable WQMS is fatally constrained by severe contamination and biofouling of sensors due to the hostile analytical environment of wastewaters, especially raw sewages, that challenges the limit of existing sensing technologies. In this work, we report a technological solution to enable the development of WQMS for real-time abnormal event detection with high reliability and practicality. A vectored high flow hydrodynamic self-cleaning approach and a dual-sensor self-diagnostic concept are adopted for WQMS to effectively encounter vital sensor failing issues caused by contamination and biofouling and ensure the integrity of sensing data. The performance of the WQMS has been evaluated over a 3-year trial period at different sewage catchment sites across three Australian states. It has demonstrated that the developed WQMS is capable of continuously operating in raw sewage for a prolonged period up to 24 months without maintenance and failure, signifying the high reliability and practicality. The demonstrated WQMS capability to reliably acquire real-time wastewater quality information leaps forward the development of effective wastewater source management system. The reported self-cleaning and self-diagnostic concepts should be applicable to other online water quality monitoring systems, opening a new way to encounter the common reliability and stability issues caused by sensor contamination and biofouling.

Incidence of gastrointestinal illness following wet weather recreational exposures: Harmonization of quantitative microbial risk assessment with an epidemiologic investigation of surfers	WATER RESEARCH												We modeled the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) illness associated with recreational exposures to marine water following storm events in San Diego County, California. We estimated GI illness risks via quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) techniques by consolidating site specific pathogen monitoring data of stormwater, site specific dilution estimates, literature-based water ingestion data, and literature based pathogen dose-response and morbidity information. Our water quality results indicated that human sources of contamination contribute viral and bacterial pathogens to streams draining an urban watershed during wet weather that then enter the ocean and affect nearshore water quality. We evaluated a series of approaches to account for uncertainty in the norovirus dose-response model selection and compared our model results to those from a concurrently conducted epidemiological study that provided empirical estimates for illness risk following ocean exposure. The preferred norovirus dose-response approach yielded median risk estimates for water recreation-associated illness (15 GI illnesses per 1000 recreation events) that closely matched the reported epidemiological results (12 excess GI illnesses per 1000 wet weather recreation events). The results are consistent with norovirus, or other pathogens associated with norovirus, as an important cause of gastrointestinal illness among surfers in this setting. This study demonstrates the applicability of QMRA for recreational water risk estimation, even under wet weather conditions and describes a process that might be useful in developing site-specific water quality criteria in this and other locations.

In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was applied to model streamflow, sediment, and pesticide diuron loading in the San Joaquinwatershed, a major contributing area to the elevated pesticide levels in the downstream Delta. The Sequential Uncertainty Fitting version 2 (SUFI-2) algorithm was employed to perform calibration and uncertainty analysis. A combination of performance measures (PMs) and standardized performance evaluation criteria (PEC) was applied to evaluate model performance, while prediction uncertainty was quantified by 95% prediction uncertainty band (95PPU). Results showed that streamflow simulation was at least "satisfactory" at most stations, with more than 50% of the observed data bracketed by the 95PPU. Sediment simulation was rated as at least "satisfactory" based on two PMs, and diuron simulation was judged as "good" by all PMs. The 95PPU of sediment and diuron bracketed about 40% and 30% of the observed data, respectively. Significant correlations were observed between the diuron loads, and precipitation, streamflow, and the current and antecedent pesticide use. Results also showed that the majority (>70%) of agricultural diuron was transported during winter months, when direct exposure of biocontrol agents to diuron runoff is limited. However, exposure in the dry season could be a concern because diuron is relatively persistent in aquatic system. This study not only provides valuable information for the development of biological weed control plan in the Delta, but also serves as a foundation for the continued research on calibration, evaluation, and uncertainty analysisof spatially distributed, physically based hydrologic models.

Persistent Urban Influence on Surface Water Quality via Impacted Groundwater	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Growing urban environments stress hydrologic systems and. impact downstream water quality. We examined a third-order catchment that transitions from an undisturbed mountain environment into urban Salt Lake City, Utah. We performed synoptic surveys during al range of seasonal baseflow conditions and utilized multiple lines of, evidence to identify mechanisms by which urbanization impacts water quality. Surface water chemistry did not change appreciably until several kilometers into the urban environment, where concentrations of solutes such as, chloride and nitrate increase quickly in a gaining reach: Groundwater springs discharging in this gaining system demonstrate the role of contaminated baseflow from an aquifer in driving stream chemistry. Hydrometric and hydrochemical observations were used to estimate that the aquifer contains approximately 18% water sourced from the urban area. The carbon and nitrogen dynamics indicated the urban aquifer also serves as a biogeochemical reactor. The evidence of surface water groundwater exchange on a spatial scale of kilometers and time scale of months to years suggests a need to evolve the hydrologic model of anthropogenic impacts to urban water quality to include exchange with the subsurface. This has implications on the space and time scales of water quality mitigation efforts.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				SEP 5	2017	51	17					9477	9487		10.1021/acs.est.7b00271								WOS:000410255800007	28730814

Trees and Streets as Drivers of Urban Stormwater Nutrient Pollution	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Expansion of tree cover is a major management goal in cities because of the substantial benefits provided to people, and potentially to water quality through reduction of stormwater volume by interception. However, few studies have addressed the full range of potential impacts of trees on urban runoff, which includes deposition of nutrient-rich leaf litter onto streets connected to storm drains. We analyzed the influence of trees on stormwater nitrogen and phosphorus export across 19 urban watersheds in Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN, U.S.A., and at the scale of individual streets within one residential watershed. Stormwater nutrient concentrations were highly variable across watersheds and strongly related to tree canopy over streets, especially for phosphorus. Stormwater nutrient loads were primarily related to road density, the dominant control over runoff volume. Street canopy exerted opposing effects on loading, where elevated nutrient concentrations from trees near roads outweighed the weak influence of trees on runoff reduction. These results demonstrate that vegetation near streets contributes substantially to stormwater nutrient pollution, and therefore to eutrophication of urban surface waters. Urban landscape design and management that account for trees as nutrient pollution sources could improve water quality outcomes, while allowing cities to enjoy the myriad benefits of urban forests.

Quantifying Lake Water Quality Evolution: Coupled Geochemistry, Hydrodynamics, and Aquatic Ecology in an Acidic Pit Lake	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Assessment of water quality evolution in the thousands of existing and future mine pit lakes worldwide requires new numerical tools that integrate geochemical, hydrological, and biological processes. A coupled model was used to test alternative hypothesized controls on water quality in a pit lake over years. The evolution of pH, Al, and Fe were closely linked; field observations were reproduced with generic solubility equilibrium controls on Fe(III) and Al and a commonly reported acceleration of the abiotic Fe(II) oxidation rate by 2-3 orders of magnitude. Simulations indicated an ongoing acidity loading at the site, and the depletion of Al mineral buffering capacity after similar to 5 years. Simulations also supported the existence of pH limitation on nitrification, and a limitation on phytoplankton growth other than the commonly postulated P and DIC limitations. Furthermore, the model reproduced the general patterns of salinity, pH, Al, and Fe during an uncontrolled river breach in 2011, however, incorporating sediment biogeochemical feedbacks is required to reproduce the observed postbreach internal alkalinity generation in the lake. The modeling approach is applicable to the study of hydrological, geochemical, and biological interactions for a range of lake and reservoir management challenges.

J	Meng, FL; Fu, GT; Butler, D				Meng, Fanlin; Fu, Guangtao; Butler, David			Cost-Effective River Water Quality Management using Integrated Real-Time Control Technology	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Integrated real-time control (RTC) of urban wastewater systems is increasingly presented as a promising and emerging strategy to deliver improved surface water quality by responsive operation according to real-time data collected from the sewer system, treatment plant, and the receiving water. However, the detailed benefits and costs associated with integrated RTC have yet to be comprehensively evaluated. Built on state-of-the-art modeling and analytical tools, a three-step framework is proposed to develop integrated RTC strategies which cost-effectively maximize environmental outcomes. Results from a case study show integrated RTC can improve river quality by over 20% to meet the "good status" requirements of the EU Water Framework Directive with a 15% reduced cost, due to responsive aeration with changing environmental assimilation capacity. The cost-effectiveness of integrated RTC strategies is further demonstrated against tightening environmental standards (to the strictest levels) and against two commonly used compliance strategies. Compared to current practices (seasonal/monthly based operation), integrated RTC strategies can reduce costs while improving resilience of the system to disturbances and reducing environmental risk.

A dataset consists of 132 field measurements were used. Out of 132 observations randomly selected 88 observations were used for training, whereas remaining 44 were used for testing the model. Input variables consist of cumulative time (T-f), type of impurities (I-t), concentration of impurities (C-i), and moisture content (Wc) whereas the infiltration rate was considered as output. Correlation coefficient (CC), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), relative absolute error (RAE) and root relative square error (RRSE) were considered to compare the performance the both modelling approaches. The result of evolution suggests that Random forest regression approach works well than the other two models (ANN and M5P model tree). The estimated value of infiltration rate using Random forest regression lies within +/- 25% error lines. Sensitivity analysis suggests that cumulative time is an important parameter for predicting the infiltration rate of the soil.																	2363-6203	2363-6211				SEP	2017	3	3					996	1001		10.1007/s40808-017-0347-3								WOS:000432245400010

This deposited on soil, plants and in the water, further contributing to human exposure and It mixes in the blood and pumped all-around the body. The most important air pollutants found over Delhi were sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxides (NO2) and suspended particulate matter (SPM). Statistical and wavelet analysis of these air pollutants at three different sample sites two residential namely Janakpuri, Nizamuddin, and one industrial namely Shahazada Bagh over Delhi for the more than 20 year period from 1987 to 2010 in India have been studied. The results shown that the mean concentration of SO2 decreased for both residential (Janakpuri, Nizamuddin) as well as industrial (Shahzada Bagh) area, whereas NO2 increased but it is under the prescribed limits of National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Janakpuri and Nizamuddin represent almost equal but lower mean values of SO2 concentration than Shahzada Bagh. SO2, NO2 and SPM at all sites depicts symmetrical and platykurtic behaviour except Shahzada bagh, for that it follows leptokurtic. Discrete wavelet analysis of air pollutants using Daubechies wavelet (level 5) have been calculated for the study. It is also observed that the values at five different levels of signal data for all air pollutants varies between -225 and +225.																	2363-6203	2363-6211				SEP	2017	3	3					1178	1189		10.1007/s40808-017-0366-0								WOS:000432245400025

Therefore, in this study, a hydrodynamics model of an actual dam reservoir in three dimensions for simulating a real dam reservoir flows for summer season is created. The model is developed using nonlinear and unsteady continuity, momentum, energy and k-epsilon turbulence model equations. In order to include the Coriolis force effect on the flow in a dam reservoir, Coriolis force parameter is also added the model equations. Those equations are constructed using actual dimensions, shape, boundary and initial conditions of the dam and reservoir. Temperature profiles and flow visualizations are used to evaluate flow conditions in the reservoir. The model successfully simulates the formation of density currents and the thermal characteristics of the reservoir system for seasonal heat exchanges. Model simulations results obtained for summer season are compared with field measurements obtained from gauging stations founded on the dam reservoir. The results are found to be in accordance with the actual values measured. This investigation can be also useful for sedimentation studies, water quality modeling and management, and habitat assessment in a reservoir.																	1582-9596	1843-3707				SEP	2017	16	9					2009	2024										WOS:000419141100009

There were evident spatial variations of the heavy metal concentrations downstream and upstream of the three cascade dams; the heavy metal pollutions were higher downstream of the Xiaowan Dam and upstream of the Manwan Dam. The mean concentrations of As, Cd, Pb, and Zn were higher than the background values in soil in Yunnan Province in China, and the maximum coefficient of variation of Cd reached 81%. Comparison results of two toxicity guidelines showed that the adverse effects in three cascade dams were not very high; there exists some relatively high pollution level sample sites, which were sufficiently high to cause adverse effects. The calculated geo-accumulation index (I-geo) results indicate that the investigated sediments can be classified as "unpolluted" with Cr, Cu, Zn, Ni, and Pb, "moderately polluted" with Cd, and "unpolluted to moderately polluted" with As. Except for Cd (moderately pollution indices), all other six heavy metals varied more or less in the range of the local natural background concentrations. This pollution condition can be seen as a good sign for the dam environment. 44%, 26%, 30% of sample sites, which were located in the river center downstream of the Manwan Dam, exhibited low, moderate, and high ecological risks of heavy metal pollution and a decreasing trend of potential ecological risk Z(1) (downstream of Xiaowan and upstream of the Manwan Reservoir) were higher than those in Z(2) (downstream of Manwan and upstream of the Dachaoshan Reservoir). The calculated Eir mean values of the potential ecological risk for individual heavy metals is ordered as Cd>As>Pb>Cu>Ni>Zn>Cr. The principal component analysis result showed two primary components explaining 92.83% of the total variance. Zn, Cu, Cd, As, and Pb were considered to be "anthropogenic heavy metal loads,"while Cr and Ni were related to represent "natural heavy metal loads."																	1582-9596	1843-3707				SEP	2017	16	9					2075	2087										WOS:000419141100015

With the excess influx of nutrients from human activities, the eutrophication process begins and causes a breeding ground for algae. The amount of nutrients present in any given cycle will be higher than the levels present in previous cycles. Therefore, it is very important to manage water quality in lakes and dams to prevent and to slow or to reverse the eutrophication process. This can be ensured by using effective and comprehensive tools for prediction and modeling of eutrophication in a water resource. In this study, Support Vector Machines (SVM) were first used for eutrophication classification in the third largest dam (Dez) in the world. The technique of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), as an input pre-processing method, was used to reduce the number of input variables in the model. The technique was found to be effective in reducing the number of input variables from 20 to 4 (TP, TN, DO, temperature). Subsequently, the model support vector machine classifier was developed using these four variables. The results showed the important role of preprocessing variables by PCA. An accuracy of 98% was achieved by the SVM classification method, which demonstrated the potential effect of eutrophication classification, and consequently showed its ability for pattern recognition of this phenomenon. Modeling with SVM technique can be attractive with high accuracy, especially for monitoring the quality of water in reservoirs. Additionally, the method can be used as a tool to develop new management approaches.																	1582-9596	1843-3707				SEP	2017	16	9					2139	2146										WOS:000419141100021

This multiyear program (2011-15) examined several environmental management issues and questions involving concerns with water quality (e.g., nutrients) and the health of this ecosystem (e.g., eutrophication). Multiple projects ranging from the assessment of phytoplankton to fish to wetlands, as well as hydrodynamic/water quality and ecosystem modeling, were conducted each year to fill in critical data gaps and to define the bay's baseline condition for future comparisons (e.g., a nuclear generating station on the bay with a once-through cooling system will close in 2019). Issues of concern for environmental agencies and the public include nuisance jellyfish; excess nutrients; benefits of conservation zones; and the status of fish, crab, and shellfish populations. Three projects examined the potential for developing biological indicators of nutrient (i.e. nitrogen and phosphorus) effects. Three other projects studied the unique habitat features (i.e. salt marshes, sedge islands, submerged aquatic vegetation beds) in BB-LEH that may need protection and/or restoration. Ecosystem baseline conditions were examined by six projects, and data were used in the Ecopath-Ecosim model to predict potential future changes in the biomass of major biological groups and species using specific scenarios (i.e. closure of the Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station, reducing nutrient inputs and fishery management plans). Noteworthy is the collection of these data pre- and post-Superstorm Sandy, which made landfall a few kilometers south of the estuary in 2012. The subsequent 19 papers in this special issue provide an in-depth examination of these areas of concern, the results of which are exceedingly relevant to the management of this and other estuarine systems.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				FAL	2017					78		1	6		10.2112/SI78-001.1								WOS:000417480200001

Barnegat Bay and its tributaries were evaluated for multiple water quality metrics and from various perspectives. The nutrient concentrations and loadings from the tributaries in the northern watershed are higher than those from the tributaries in the southern portion of the watershed. Within Barnegat Bay, higher nitrogen concentrations were observed in the northern portion, while higher total phosphorus (TP) concentrations occurred in the southern portion. Daily variability of water quality at certain locations was observed from the results of intensive sampling events (six samples per day over 4 consecutive days of sampling). Analysis of multiple years of data suggests that water quality has not varied significantly year to year from 2011 to 2015. Violation of the existing applicable numeric criterion was identified for dissolved oxygen, TP, and turbidity within some assessment units in Barnegat Bay and its watershed. A comparison made between these data and the targets used by other estuaries in the NE United States related to nutrient criteria found that portions of the bay would not achieve the water quality thresholds used by these other estuaries.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				FAL	2017					78		7	21		10.2112/SI78-002.1								WOS:000417480200002

Data evaluated spanned from the 1970s through July of 2013. Trends were evaluated after regionalizing sampling locations into 17 geographic zones. Over 1700 sampling stations within freshwater and Bay zones provided over 280,000 data results for 20 parameters. The parameters evaluated include: temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, nutrients, indicator bacteria, and solids. Temperature data comparing the 1970s with the present show statistically significant increasing trends in 13 of 17 zones during the summer months. Seven of those zones also saw increasing temperatures in at least one other season. Increasing trends were also seen for salinity in 8 of the 10 estuarine zones for two or more seasons. Potentially related to the increasing trends in salinity and temperature, DO concentrations were often decreasing or unchanged. Significant decreases in DO concentration can be seen in 12 of the 17 zones for one or more seasons. The pH was shown to be increasing in 10 of the 17 zones during one to four seasons. Four zones experienced a decreasing trend in pH, but only during one to two seasons. The interpretation of the nutrient data over this long time period proved to be a challenge, with multiple species of nitrogen and phosphorus reported but often with insufficient data to draw significant conclusions.

Toward a Comprehensive Water-Quality Modeling of Barnegat Bay: Development of ROMS to WASP Coupler	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												The Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) has been coupled with the Water Quality Analysis Simulation Program (WASP) to be used in a comprehensive analysis of water quality in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey. The coupler can spatially aggregate hydrodynamic information in ROMS cells into larger WASP segments. It can also be used to resample ROMS output at a finer temporal scale to meet WASP time-stepping requirements. The coupler aggregates flow components, temperature, and salinity in ROMS output for input to WASP via a hydrodynamic linkage file. The coupler was tested initially with idealized cases designed to verify the water mass balance and conservation of constituent mass using one-to-one and one-to-many connectivity options between segments. A realistic example from the Toms River embayment, a subdomain of Barnegat Bay, was used to demonstrate the functionality of the coupling. A WASP eutrophication model accounting for dissolved oxygen (DO), nitrogen, and constant phytoplankton concentrations was applied to explore the distribution and trends in DO and nitrogen in the embayment for the period of July-August 2012. Results of DO modeling indicate satisfactory agreement with measurements collected at in-bay stations and also indicate that this coupled approach, despite substantial differences in spatiotemporal discretization between the models, provides adequate predictive capabilities.

Synchronized phytoplankton and water-quality data collected between August 2011 and August 2013 from the Barnegat Bay Water Quality Monitoring Program were used as calibration data set. The results showed that one-fifth of samples were from the least-impaired habitat condition, with low turbidity and low concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and orthophosphate (PO4). Nearly 60% of samples were from undesirable conditions with poor water clarity and excess nutrients. Phytoplankton reference communities, in comparison with communities in impaired conditions, were characterized with low concentrations of chlorophyll a (Chl a), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP), low Chl a/C ratio, low summer picoplankton biomass, and high spring and summer dissolved oxygen. Thirty-four metrics were evaluated for their ability to discriminate between the least-impaired and impaired habitat conditions. Nine phytoplankton metrics and three physiological and chemical metrics, which showed strong discriminatory ability, were selected, and different combinations of these metrics were used to create phytoplankton indices for spring and summer mesohaline and polyhaline zones in BB-LEH. The current P-IBI was able to correctly classify 64-100% for spring samples and 68-88% for summer samples in the calibration data set. Our work is the first attempt to develop a P-IBI for this region. The calculated reference communities and P-IBI, though constrained because of limited data availability, were region specific and intended to facilitate water-quality assessment and management efforts in BB-LEH. The differences of TN and TP between the least-impaired and impaired conditions in most of season-salinity zones suggested that dual reduction of N and P are necessary to control eutrophication in BB-LEH. Further work on the refinement of the P-IBI is underway as additional phytoplankton and water-quality data are being collected and assessed.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				FAL	2017					78		89	105		10.2112/SI78-009.1								WOS:000417480200009

Zooplankton Community Dynamics in a Western Mid-Atlantic Lagoonal Estuary	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Zooplankton are an integral component of the food web in estuarine ecosystems. The most recent studies of zooplankton in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey, occurred almost 40 years ago. Since then, this coastal lagoon estuary has been affected by anthropogenic impacts that threaten its ecological integrity, including nutrient enrichment, algal blooms, alterations of freshwater inputs, and extensive development around the bay and its watershed. Assessing the zooplankton community in this ecosystem provided updated information on the status of this important component of the bay's living resources. Zooplankton samples were collected from the upper meter of the water column with horizontal surface net tows using bongo plankton nets monthly during the winter and twice a month during spring, summer, and fall. Sites were located along a longitudinal transect in the bay. Data included abundance and distribution of copepods, gelatinous macrozooplankton, bivalves, and decapods. The zooplankton community was characterized by strong spatial, seasonal, and interannual trends in abundance and diversity. Spatial variability is most apparent between the northern and southern sections of the bay. The northern bay was characterized by higher nitrogen and chlorophyll a; high abundances of copepods, ctenophores, and barnacle larvae; and lowest species diversity. Alkalinity, phosphate, and species diversity were higher in the southern bay. This was a typical pattern for the study, remaining stable even between seasons. It is apparent that direct and/or indirect effects of weather and climate affect zooplankton abundance in Barnegat Bay. Such sensitivity to changes in weather patterns has the potential to cause long- term shifts in the zooplankton community as a result of climate change.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				FAL	2017					78		141	168		10.2112/SI78-012.1								WOS:000417480200012

Urban, agricultural, and environmental protection practices for sustainable water quality	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER												Sustainable water management often emphasizes water resource quantity, with focus on availability and use practices. However, only a subset of the available water may be usable when also considering water quality. Water quality management is examined within three broad sectors-urban, agriculture, and environmental systems-to investigate how water quality sustainability (WQS) is defined by each and across the three sectors. The definitions determined for both urban and agricultural WQS mention downstream human and ecosystem use; however, regulatory policy does not always support these definitions. This challenge of managing water quality locally and downstream, coupled with interactions across multiple sectors, has led to a fragmented approach to water quality management. Legislation typically divides water quality management into compartments without considering the entire system. Within the United States, there is an uneven distribution of responsibility regarding water quality protection, and notable policies which counteract efforts to improve water quality. The review suggests that despite a growing intention to use a single system approach where water is considered as a limited resource that must supply all competing interests, one does not yet exist and is even hindered by current policies and regulations. Recent policy is signaling a shift toward increasing interagency coordination; however, the basic definitions of WQS remain disconnected across sectors. It is the conclusion of this review that sustainable water quality is not currently practiced in the United States.

Egrinya			Extractability and bioavailability of phosphorus in soils amended with poultry manure co-composted with crop wastes	JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION												Intensive livestock production and poor agricultural management have resulted to excessive loading of soil with phosphorus (P), thereby contributing to environmental pollution and impairment of water quality. A study was carried out to determine the extractability and bioavailability of P in soils treated with poultry litter (PL) co-composted with sugarcane and cabbage wastes. The manure was applied based on total P contents at 200 and 400 kg P ha(-1), with maize (Zea mays L.) as the test crop. The co-composted PL increased maize growth relative to PL alone with the best growth occurring at the treatment rate of 400 kg P ha(-1). Maize biomass and available P in soil varied in the order PL co-composted with sugarcane waste and cabbage waste (%) 50 > 33 > 25 > 0. Phosphorus contents in maize shoot were higher in sandy clay than silt loam soil and its recovery was higher in soil treated with PL co-composted sugarcane waste than co-composted with cabbage waste. An amendment with co-composted PL increased the extractable P fractions and P availability in the soils. The P fractions in the postharvest soils varied in the order HCl-P > H2O-P > NaHCO3-P > NaOH-P and the fractions were significantly higher in the sandy clay than the silt loam soil. Also, the PL co-composted with sugarcane waste exhibited higher levels of P fractions in soils than co-composted with cabbage waste. Thus, co-composting poultry manure with crop wastes would better improve plant growth and P nutrition than sole-composted manure.																	0718-9516					SEP	2017	17	3					609	623										WOS:000414530300005

The data depicted that calcium and bicarbonates were dominating among the cations and anions. The results indicate the trend of cation dominance as Ca2+ > Na+>Mg2+ > K+, whereas anion dominance was in the order of HCO3- > Cl- > SO42-. Ratio of calcium to magnesium indicated the dissolution of Ca2+ from CaCO3, which results in an increased levels of Ca2+ in the groundwater. Interpretation of Piper Trilinear plot understands the various geochemical processes affecting the groundwater quality and shows groundwater was dominated by Ca-HCO3 type. The pH was recorded in the slightly alkalinity range 7.2-7.8 and was showing positive correlation with HCO3-. The chloro-alkaline indices revealed 86% of the sources exchange by a type of base-exchange reactions, rest by cation-anion exchange. Gibbs diagram revealed groundwater sources fall in the category of rock dominance. The concentration of the nitrogen compounds was in the progression of NO3-N > NH4- N > NO2-N, and the PO4- fluctuated from 0.12 to 0.22 mg/L. Moreover, corrosivity ratio indicated that water from the majority of sources (71%) is safe to supply using pipes without any corrosive effects, while 29% of sources are corrosive in nature and need non-corrosive pipes for transporting and lifting of groundwater. The results revealed, groundwater samples were within permissible limits as prescribed by International and National standards, for drinking purposes. The State government and NGO's can show their interest in utilizing such water resources to overcome the shortage of drinking water in a sustainable way for the daily consumption of the people living in the vicinity of Jhelum River.

Effects of domestic and industrial effluent discharges into the lake and their impact on the drinking water in Pandravedu village, Tamil Nadu, India	GLOBAL NEST JOURNAL												Increasing demand for water from agriculture, industrial and domestic sectors, resulted in stress on the water resources both from quantity and quality perspectives. Due to urbanization many of the dyeing units have shifted from urban to nearby rural areas. Here safe disposal of untreated effluent from the dyeing units is a challenge and is often let into nearby water bodies. Pandravedu Lake, located in Thiruvallur district of Tamil Nadu, India is one such case were the present study is carried out. Water samples were collected from twelve locations during premonsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon seasons, in pre-cleaned polyethylene cans and analyzed for physicochemical parameters like pH, total dissolved solids, electrical conductivity, total alkalinity, total hardness, calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, iron, nitrate, chloride, fluoride and sulphate following the standard analytical procedures recommended by American Public Health Association (2005). The analytical results indicated that 40% to 70% of samples exceeded the drinking water quality standards prescribed by Bureau of Indian standards (BIS, 2012). Water quality index computed indicate that both the bore wells that supply drinking water to the village falls in very poor category (101 - 150) across three seasons. Correlation analysis indicated that seasonal changes in correlation among the parameters are linked to the fluctuations of wastewater discharge and its characteristics.																	1790-7632					SEP	2017	19	2					225	231										WOS:000412801100001

Together with known empirical relations, the model comprises a new formulation for resuspension due to fish activity. Experiments on erosion of natural sediments in the annular flume at Aachen University are used for model calibration. Empirical coefficients were evaluated with genetic algorithms to achieve the best agreement between the model results and the experimental data. The presented model shows sufficient flexibility to account for various sediment properties, including different sediment sources, natural and artificial contaminants, presence or absence of aquatic organisms, and results in an average coefficient of determination, R-2 = 90.5% between the model results and the experimental data. Model validation allows it to be assumed that different contaminants affect bed properties differently. Fish activity plays an essential role in correct resuspension prediction. Further sediment erosion experiments with carefully chosen conditions will allow a more comprehensive model evaluation. The presented model is intended to serve as a building block in the development of a hydraulic-sediment-biota model within the W-3-Hydro: Water Quality Event Detection for Urban Water Security and Urban Water Management Based on Hydrotoxicological Investigations project that aims to improve the knowledge concerning bioavailability, transport, fate, and effects of contaminants on the aquatic environment.

Assessment of hydrogeoecological features of the Yesil River Basin	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												Aim: The aim of the present study was to examine the hydrochemical composition and geoecological features and to assess the level and nature of anthropogenic pollution in the Yesil river basin. Methodology : Field studies are an integral part of observation and analysis of landscape components. Sample analysis of chemical composition of the Yesil river basin water was conducted in July-August 2016 to ascertain the current state of geo-environmental pollution of the basin water. Results: Reduction of river water causes sharp deterioration in the sanitary condition of river. Great harm is caused by pollution by industrial, agricultural, municipal and domestic sewage. However, there is an increased content of SO4, NO, and NO2, Fe and total salinity of water. Interpretation: Systematic analysis of water quality in the Yesil indicates that the river copes with pollution mainly by the self-cleaning processes. Comparative analysis of qualitative and quantitative indicators of the Yesil river basin water surface indicates the presence of some of their relationship. The solution to the problem of stabilization and improvement of the ecological state of the Yesil river basin geosystems, under intensive anthropogenic impact, requires maximum consideration of the specific nature condition and the analysis of key factors and processes that affect its condition.

Rob; Krause, Stefan			High-frequency monitoring of catchment nutrient exports reveals highly variable storm event responses and dynamic source zone activation	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Storm events can drive highly variable behavior in catchment nutrient and water fluxes, yet short-term event dynamics are frequently missed by low-resolution sampling regimes. In addition, nutrient source zone contributions can vary significantly within and between storm events. Our inability to identify and characterize time-dynamic source zone contributions severely hampers the adequate design of land use management practices in order to control nutrient exports from agricultural landscapes. Here we utilize an 8month high-frequency (hourly) time series of streamflow, nitrate (NO3-N), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and hydroclimatic variables for a headwater agricultural catchment. We identified 29 distinct storm events across the monitoring period. These events represented 31% of the time series and contributed disproportionately to nutrient loads (42% of NO3-N and 43% of DOC) relative to their duration. Regression analysis identified a small subset of hydroclimatological variables (notably precipitation intensity and antecedent conditions) as key drivers of nutrient dynamics during storm events. Hysteresis analysis of nutrient concentration-discharge relationships highlighted the dynamic activation of discrete NO3-N and DOC source zones, which varied on an event-specific basis. Our results highlight the benefits of high-frequency in situ monitoring for characterizing short-term nutrient fluxes and unraveling connections between hydroclimatological variability and river nutrient export and source zone activation under extreme flow conditions. These new process-based insights, which we summarize in a conceptual model, are fundamental to underpinning targeted management measures to reduce nutrient loading of surface waters.

Environmental health disparities in the Central Appalachian region of the United States	REVIEWS ON ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH												Health disparities that cannot be fully explained by socio-behavioral factors persist in the Central Appalachian region of the United States. A review of available studies of environmental impacts on Appalachian health and analysis of recent public data indicates that while disparities exist, most studies of local environmental quality focus on the preservation of nonhuman biodiversity rather than on effects on human health. The limited public health studies available focus primarily on the impacts of coal mining and do not measure personal exposure, constraining the ability to identify causal relationships between environmental conditions and public health. Future efforts must engage community members in examining all potential sources of environmental health disparities to identify effective potential interventions.																	0048-7554	2191-0308				SEP	2017	32	3					253	266		10.1515/reveh-2017-0012								WOS:000412134600005	28682789

The impact of intrusion can be catastrophic if residual disinfectant (chlorine) is not present. To avoid microbiological water quality failure, higher levels of secondary chlorination doses can be a possible solution, but they can produce disinfectant by-products which lead to taste and odour complaints. This study presents a methodology to identify potential intrusion points in a DN and optimize booster chlorination based on trade-offs among microbiological risk, chemical risk and life-cycle cost for booster chlorination. A point-scoring scheme was developed to identify the potential intrusion points within a DN. It utilized factors such as pollutant source (e.g., sewer characteristics), pollution pathway (water main diameter, length, age, and surrounding soil properties, etc.), consequence of contamination (e.g., population, and land use), and operational factors (e.g., water pressure) integrated through a geographical information system using advanced ArcMap 10 operations. The contaminant intrusion was modelled for E. Coli O156: H7 (a microbiological indicator) using the EPANET-MSX programmer's toolkit. The quantitative microbial risk assessment and chemical (human health) risk assessment frameworks were adapted to estimate risk potentials. Booster chlorination locations and dosages were selected using a multi-objective genetic algorithm. The methodology was illustrated through a case study on a portion of a municipal DN.																	1436-3240	1436-3259				SEP	2017	31	7			SI		1759	1775		10.1007/s00477-017-1440-x								WOS:000412457300015						
J	Hering, JG				Hering, Janet G.			Managing the 'Monitoring Imperative' in the Context of SDG Target 6.3 on Water Quality and Wastewater	SUSTAINABILITY												Monitoring the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 for water and sanitation builds on monitoring frameworks that were developed for the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), specifically the WHO/ UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP). Yet, since SDG 6 goes beyond the MDG focus on drinking water and sanitation, it also significantly expands monitoring and reporting responsibilities. The target to improve water quality (Target 6.3) calls for water quality monitoring and data reporting that are likely to pose a significant challenge to countries that lack an established monitoring program. At the same time, redundant burdens may be imposed on countries that already have established programs and report out water quality data to inter-or supranational agencies. In this context, there is a risk that the intention that water quality data should serve as a basis for evidence-based decision making will become subsidiary to the resource-intensive activities of data collection and management. Alternatively, policies could be designed based on historical experience with measures of proven effectiveness, prioritizing policies that could have multiple benefits. Policies could be implemented in parallel with the development of monitoring programs and conventional monitoring data could be complemented by information gained from sources such as remote sensing and unstructured data.																	2071-1050					SEP	2017	9	9							1572	10.3390/su9091572								WOS:000411621200175

The study area encompassed eight small catchments with areas ranging from 58.6 to 13,442.4 ha in the subtropical region of South China. On-site observations of P concentrations, stream fluxes, and social investigation of P input were conducted over a 3-year period. The regional variations of net anthropogenic phosphorus inputs (NAPI) and responses of riverine P export were quantitatively analyzed. Results showed that the total NAPI of catchments varied from 11.04 to 40.52 kg P ha(-1) year(-1), where cropland systems (NAPI(c)) were the largest P sources, accounting for 47.7-67.7% in total. Meanwhile, net food and feed P input varied from 3.87 to 30.73 kg P ha(-1) year(-1), accounting for 35.0-75.8% in total, followed by fertilizer and non-food P input with 4.65-10.48 and 0.63-2.89 kg P ha(-1) year(-1), respectively. Riverine P export and the soil total P and Olsen P contents in croplands were all positively related to NAPI (p < 0.05). A simple empirical model was simulated to predict the annual riverine total P fluxes using NAPIc with greater accuracy than with using NAPI or NAPI for residential land (NAPI(r)). Gray relational analysis suggested that livestock density was the most important influencing factor for NAPI. It is concluded from these results that, although the livestock accounted for the largest part of the NAPI, the cropland contributed the greatest to catchment riverine P export. This probably due to recycling of animal manure for plant cropping systems. Therefore, maintaining a reasonable scale of livestock production, and reducing the internal cycle of manure or replacing part of the chemical fertilizer should be a major approach in reducing NAPI and corresponding riverine P export in the study area.																	2071-1050					SEP	2017	9	9							1480	10.3390/su9091480								WOS:000411621200004

In recent years, the Chinese government implemented several water resource protection policies to improve the river's water quality. In order to evaluate the influence of the new policies on the water quality in the Songhua River, water quality data from 2006 to 2015 were collected monthly from the nine sites along the mainstream of the Songhua River. Results show that the water quality in the Songhua River could be divided into two groups during the last 10 years. Before 2010, water quality in the Songhua River was primarily influenced by regional human activities. Industries were the major pollutant sources in the upstream of the Songhua River. After several new policies were implemented by the local government in 2010, water quality in the Songhua River improved. As a result, the biodiversity of fish and ecological health in the Songhua River improved.

The new technique has been used Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) model to describe overland flow routing and Soil Conservation Service Method (SCS) used to model infiltration or subsurface flow. The modeling technique has been proven successful, as the predicted and observed closely match each other, with a mean error of 4.58 to 7.32%. The calibrated model then used to determine the ratio of the flow exchange between the surface and subsurface drainage system. Results from the model showed that the runoff ratio exchange between the surface and subsurface is 60 to 90%.

The method takes into account nonlinearity and hysteresis effects during storm events, and hydrological conditions variability. High-frequency records of total P and reactive P originating from four contrasting European agricultural catchments in terms of P loads were used to test the method. The models were calibrated on weekly grab sampling data combined with 10 storms surveyed subhourly per year (weekly+ survey) and then used to reconstruct P concentrations during all storm events for computing annual loads. For total P, results showed that this modeling approach allowed the estimation of annual loads with limited uncertainties (approximate to -10%+/- 15%), more reliable than estimations based on simple linear regressions using turbidity, based on interpolated weekly+ data without storm event reconstruction, or on discharge weighted calculations from weekly series or monthly series. For reactive P, load uncertainties based on the nonlinear model were similar to uncertainties based on storm event reconstruction using simple linear regression (approximate to 20%+/- 30%), and remained lower than uncertainties obtained without storm reconstruction on weekly or monthly series, but larger than uncertainties based on interpolated weekly+ data (approximate to -15%+/- 20%). These empirical models showed we could estimate reliable P exports from noncontinuous P time series when using continuous proxies, and this could potentially be very useful for completing time-series data sets in high-frequency surveys, even over extended periods. Plain Language Abstract Phosphorus (P) loads transported by rivers and streams have to be estimated reliably, but this is a difficult task because P loads can be transported during very short period of time, like during storm events, and most P surveys are executed with low sampling frequencies. Because continuous surveys of P are costly, we tested a modeling approach using commonly used low-cost continuous records of turbidity and discharge as surrogate variables. This had to take into account nonlinear relationships and the fact that the relationship between P and turbidity or discharge is different during a rising phase or a descending phase. The model we developed estimates P concentration variations during storm events and provides continuous time series of P. From the model estimations, total annual loads of P could be predicted with low uncertainty ranges when using turbidity as a surrogate variable, showing its ability at estimating phosphorus exports values closer to the reality. The soluble reactive form was however less reliably predicted by discharge records, but our method could still be improved.

Calibration of a modified temperature-light intensity logger for quantifying water electrical conductivity	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The Stream Temperature, Intermittency, and Conductivity (STIC) electrical conductivity (EC) logger as presented by Chapin et al. (2014) serves as an inexpensive (similar to 50 USD) means to assess relative EC in freshwater environments. This communication demonstrates the calibration of the STIC logger for quantifying EC, and provides examples from a month long field deployment in the High Arctic. Calibration models followed multiple nonlinear regression and produced calibration curves with high coefficient of determination values (R-2=0.995-0.998; n=5). Percent error of mean predicted specific conductance at 25 degrees C (SpC) to known SpC ranged in magnitude from -0.6% to 13% (mean=-1.4%), and mean absolute percent error (MAPE) ranged from 2.1% to 13% (mean=5.3%). Across all tested loggers we found good accuracy and precision, with both error metrics increasing with increasing SpC values. During 10, month-long field deployments, there were no logger failures and full data recovery was achieved. Point SpC measurements at the location of STIC loggers recorded via a more expensive commercial electrical conductivity logger followed similar trends to STIC SpC records, with 1:1.05 and 1:1.08 relationships between the STIC and commercial logger SpC values. These results demonstrate that STIC loggers calibrated to quantify EC are an economical means to increase the spatiotemporal resolution of water quality investigations.																	0043-1397	1944-7973				SEP	2017	53	9					8120	8126		10.1002/2017WR020634								WOS:000413484200035						
J	Isazadeh, M; Biazar, SM; Ashrafzadeh, A				Isazadeh, Mohammad; Biazar, Seyed Mostafa; Ashrafzadeh, Afshin			Support vector machines and feed-forward neural networks for spatial modeling of groundwater qualitative parameters	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The present study attempts to model the spatial variability of three groundwater qualitative parameters in Guilan Province, northern Iran, using artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector machines (SVMs). Data collected from 140 observation wells for the years 2002-2014 were used. Five variables, X and Y coordinates of the observation well, distance of the observation well from the shoreline, areal average 6-month rainfall depth, and groundwater level at the day of water quality sampling, were considered as primary input variables. In addition, nine qualitative variables were also considered as auxiliary input variables. Electrical conductivity (EC), sodium concentration (Na+),and sulfate concentration (SO42-) of the groundwater in the region were estimated using ANNs and SVMs with different input combinations. The results showed that both ANNs and SVMs work well when the only primary input variable is the well location. The ANN yielded an RMSE of 1.03 mEq/l for SO42-, 1.05 mEq/l for Na+, and 203.17 mu S/cm for EC, using the X and Y coordinates of the observation wells in the study area. In the case of SVM, these values were, respectively, 0.87, 0.87, and 176.68. Considering the auxiliary input variables (pH, EC, and the concentrations of Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, SO42-, and HCO3-) resulted in a significant decrease in the RMSE of both ANNs (0.22, 0.30, and 33.04) and SVMs (0.26, 0.34, and 36.23). Comparing these RMSE values with those of cokriging interpolation technique (0.59, 0.98, and 177.59) indicated that ANNs and SVMs produced more accurate estimates of the three qualitative parameters. The relative importance of auxiliary input variables was also determined using Gamma test. The output uncertainty of ANNs and SVMs were determined using p-factor and d-factor. The results showed that SVMs have less uncertainty than ANNs.

However, the driving forces of riverine N export that is closely related to water N pollution are still not well understood. In this study, we used a mass balance approach to quantify the sources of N discharge and analyzed the effect of land use composition on riverine N export, taking Zhejiang Province, China as a case study. We found that the total reactive N discharge to rivers in Zhejiang increased from 0.22 to 0.26 Tg yr(-1) from 2000 to 2015. At the watershed scale, our estimate of N export agrees well with the monitored riverine N concentration in the eight major watersheds in Zhejiang. Direct discharge of domestic wastewater and effluents from wastewater treatment plants are dominant sources of riverine N export, followed by agricultural non-point sources. Although riverine N export increases with the increasing proportion of urban and agricultural land uses, we did not find any relationship between land use change and changes in riverine N export. This suggests that the dominant factor affecting riverine N export should be human activities (e.g. wastewater discharge and fertilization level), while land use only mediates riverine N export.

Development of suspect and non-target screening methods for detection of organic contaminants in highway runoff and fish tissue with high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS												Untreated urban stormwater runoff contributes to poor water quality in receiving waters. The ability to identify toxicants and other bioactive molecules responsible for observed adverse effects in a complex mixture of contaminants is critical to effective protection of ecosystem and human health, yet this is a challenging analytical task. The objective of this study was to develop analytical methods using liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS) to detect organic contaminants in highway runoff and in runoff-exposed fish (adult coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch). Processing of paired water and tissue samples facilitated contaminant prioritization and aided investigation of chemical bioavailability and uptake processes. Simple, minimal processing effort solid phase extraction (SPE) and elution procedures were optimized for water samples, and selective pressurized liquid extraction (SPLE) procedures were optimized for fish tissues. Extraction methods were compared by detection of non-target features and target compounds (e.g., quantity and peak area), while minimizing matrix interferences. Suspect screening techniques utilized in-house and commercial databases to prioritize high-risk detections for subsequent MS/MS characterization and identification efforts. Presumptive annotations were also screened with an in-house linear regression (log K-ow vs. retention time) to exclude isobaric compounds. Examples of confirmed identifications (via reference standard comparison) in highway runoff include ethoprophos, prometon, DEET, caffeine, cotinine, 4(or 5)-methyl-1H-methylbenzotriazole, and acetanilide. Acetanilide was also detected in runoff-exposed fish gill and liver samples. Further characterization of highway runoff and fish tissues (14 and 19 compounds, respectively with tentative identification by MS/MS data) suggests that many novel or poorly characterized organic contaminants exist in urban stormwater runoff and exposed biota.

Use of Principal Components Analysis and Kriging to Predict Groundwater-Sourced Rural Drinking Water Quality in Saskatchewan	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH												Groundwater drinking water supply surveillance data were accessed to summarize water quality delivered as public and private water supplies in southern Saskatchewan as part of an exposure assessment for epidemiologic analyses of associations between water quality and type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular disease. Arsenic in drinking water has been linked to a variety of chronic diseases and previous studies have identified multiple wells with arsenic above the drinking water standard of 0.01 mg/L; therefore, arsenic concentrations were of specific interest. Principal components analysis was applied to obtain principal component (PC) scores to summarize mixtures of correlated parameters identified as health standards and those identified as aesthetic objectives in the Saskatchewan Drinking Water Quality Standards and Objective. Ordinary, universal, and empirical Bayesian kriging were used to interpolate arsenic concentrations and PC scores in southern Saskatchewan, and the results were compared. Empirical Bayesian kriging performed best across all analyses, based on having the greatest number of variables for which the root mean square error was lowest. While all of the kriging methods appeared to underestimate high values of arsenic and PC scores, empirical Bayesian kriging was chosen to summarize large scale geographic trends in groundwater-sourced drinking water quality and assess exposure to mixtures of trace metals and ions.																	1660-4601					SEP	2017	14	9							1065	10.3390/ijerph14091065								WOS:000411574400117	28914824

The role of alluvial aquifer sediments in attenuating a dissolved arsenic plume	JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY												In a crude-oil-contaminated sandy aquifer at the Bemidji site in northern Minnesota, biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons has resulted in release of naturally occurring As to groundwater under Fe-reducing conditions. This study used chemical extractions of aquifer sediments collected in 1993 and 2011-2014 to evaluate the relationship between Fe and As in different redox zones (oxic, methanogenic, Fe-reducing, anoxic-suboxic transition) of the contaminated aquifer over a twenty-year period. Results show that 1) the aquifer has the capacity to naturally attenuate the plume of dissolved As, primarily through sorption; 2) Fe and As are linearly correlated in sediment across all redox zones, and a regression analysis between Fe and As reasonably predicted As concentrations in sediment from 1993 using only Fe concentrations; 3) an As-rich "iron curtain," associated with the anoxic-suboxic transition zone, migrated 30 m downgradient between 1993 and 2013 as a result of the hydrocarbon plume evolution; and 4) silt lenses in the aquifer preferentially sequester dissolved As, though As is remobilized into groundwater from sediment after reducing conditions are established. Using results of this study coupled with historical data, we develop a conceptual model which summarizes the natural attenuation of As and Fe over time and space that can be applied to other sites that experience As mobilization due to an influx of bioavailable organic matter.

J	Truax, B; Gagnon, D; Lambert, F; Fortier, J				Truax, Benoit; Gagnon, Daniel; Lambert, France; Fortier, Julien			Riparian buffer growth and soil nitrate supply are affected by tree species selection and black plastic mulching	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Tree species selection in the design of agricultural riparian buffers is important to optimize particular ecosystem services, while vegetation management (weed treatment) is often critical in obtaining first-rate tree growth and survival. This farm-scale study took place along a 1 km section of a headwater stream in southern Quebec (southeastern Canada). Five tree species with contrasted ecological characteristics were planted (Populus x canadensis, Fraxinus pennsylvanica, Quercus macrocarpa, Quercus rubra and Pinus strobus), with black plastic (polyethylene) mulches as the vegetation management method, as well as a control with no vegetation management, all within a fenced herbaceous riparian buffer. Tree growth and survival were measured along with soil nutrient supply. Significant Species x Vegetation treatment interactions where observed for all growth variables (p < 0.001), but also for soil nitrate (NO3) supply (p < 0.01). All species benefited from the plastic mulch treatment, but varied greatly in their responses. After 5 years, mulched hybrid poplar produced 774 times more stem volume than red oak without mulch. Across all species/vegetation treatment combinations, a 13-fold variation in soil NO3 supply rate was observed during the 4th growing season. Compared to the other species, NO3 supply rate in hybrid poplar plots was 3987% lower in the plastic mulch treatment and 4862% lower in the control treatment. Significantly higher soil NO3 supply rates were observed beneath the mulches of non nitrophilous species (white pine and red oak). Red oak growth was negatively correlated with NO3 supply (R-2 = 0.57, p < 0.05) in the mulch treatment. Early-successional nitrophilous species (hybrid poplar and red ash) planted with the plastic mulch led to the lowest increase in soil NO3 and the greatest gains in buffer structural attributes (stem volume, diameter and height). Hybrid poplar growth was positively correlated with soil NO3 supply (R-2 = 0.86, p < 0.001) in the control treatment. Natural abandoned field/grassland invaders (white pine and bur oak) grew well without black plastic mulch, while the growth of non-mulched red oaks was marginal. In the control treatment, stem volume was a strong negative predictor (across all species) of soil NO3 supply (R-2 = 0.91, p < 0.05), indicating that under herbaceous vegetation competition larger trees have a greater ability to reduce soil NO3. This study provides evidence that particular tree species/vegetation management treatment combinations strongly influence early riparian buffer structural development and soil NO3 dynamics in agricultural riparian zones.

Finding the harvesting frequency to maximize nutrient removal in a constructed wetland dominated by submerged aquatic plants	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Water quality is still poor in many freshwater ecosystems around the world as a result of anthropogenic nutrient loading. Constructed wetlands can be used to remove excess nutrients. In these wetlands, helophytes or free floating aquatic plants are traditionally used to absorb the nutrients. The nutrients are subsequently exported upon harvesting of the plants. However, rooted submerged plants may be more effective to extract nutrients from moderately eutrophicated ecosystems than helophytes or floating species. Here, we tested how the frequency of harvesting affected submerged biomass production, biomass nutrient content and the resulting amount of nutrients removed, as well as the vegetation composition and structure. Two Myriophyllum spicatum dominated shallow ponds, with moderately low surface water nutrient loading (similar to 5.6 mg N.m(-2).d(-1) and similar to 1.32 mg P.m(-2).d(-1)) were used. Each pond was subjected to four harvesting treatments: mowing lx, 2x, 3 x or 5 x between May and September 2015. Harvesting 2 x or 3 x removed most biomass and nutrients, while mowing either 5 x or only once at the end of the growing season removed the lowest amount of nutrients from the system. Furthermore, the dominance of M. spicatum in the vegetation was best maintained in plots mown 2 x, while its cover declined in plots mown more frequently, resulting in an increase of charophyte abundance. We conclude that harvesting at an intermediate frequency is best when aiming to remove the maximum amount of nutrients under a moderately low nutrient loading. Harvesting more frequently may be a suitable management method to reduce dominance of M. spicatum in situations where it causes nuisance problems due to massive growth. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A consistent investigation for three years about macrophyte, phy-toplankton, zooplankton and water quality has been conducted to explore the effect of macrophyte restoration on improving aquatic ecosystem. The results showed that macrophyte biomass and coverage after the restoration were as high as 821 g/m(2) and 55%, respectively, and the dominant species were Cer-atophyllum demersum, Myriophyllum verticillatum and Potamogeton crispus. Moreover, chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN), total suspended solids (TSS) and nitrate nitrogen (NN) significantly decreased yearly, but the changes in total phosphorus (TP) and ammonia nitrogen (AN) were not significant during the investigation. Phytoplankton density and biomass significantly decreased, and the dominant species changed from blue-green algae to green algae. Zooplankton density and biomass, however, significantly increased yearly, and the small-sized dominant species (such as, Keratella cochlearis, Polyarthra trigla, etc.) were gradually replaced by the large-sized species (such as, Asplanchna priodonala, Alma guttata, etc.) during the restoration. In addition, macrophyte was negatively correlated with nutrients, but positively correlated with zooplankton. Phytoplankton was also positively related with TN. These correlations showed that restored macrophytes could decrease nutrition loading in water body, inhibit phytoplankton growth to decrease the risk of algae blooms, and support more large-sized zooplankton to strengthen the top-down control of phytoplankton. Therefore, our results showed that macrophyte restoration is a very potential and effective method to combat with the eutrophication and develop water quality in the eutrophic subtropical lakes, and deserves more attentions in future subtropical/tropical lake managements.

Comparing A Bayesian and Fuzzy Number Approach to Uncertainty Quantification in Short-Term Dissolved Oxygen Prediction	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS												A new autoregressive-type, updating fuzzy linear regression method is proposed to predict daily dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in a highly urbanized riverine environment. Results of this model are compared to results from an updating Bayesian regression model. Both methods use lagged daily DO (at four different lags) as the independent variable. Uncertainty in the models is represented by a fuzzy number based approach in the first case, and by a Bayesian framework in the second. Real-time data from the Bow River in Calgary, Canada is used to calibrate the models sequentially to mimic a real-time updating model. Four different performance metrics were used to measure the performance of each model. Lastly, the input data resolution is reduced to measure the impact on model performance. Results show that the physical system can be adequately characterized using only one year of data. Both approaches can capture the general trend of daily DO, but the fuzzy number based method can better capture the changes in observed variability. The metrics for both models are comparable, with the one-day lag case categorized as "very good"; however, the performance reduces at higher lags. The fuzzy number method captures more low DO events than the Bayesian approach, with a much lower mean squared error. A possibility to probability transformation is used to highlight the risk of low DO days for the fuzzy case. Lastly, reducing the input data resolution from 96 to 6 points per day has a minimal impact on model performance, suggesting the limited efficacy or utility in increasing sampling rates.																	1726-2135	1684-8799				SEP	2017	30	1					1	16		10.3808/jei.201700371								WOS:000412031900001

Long-Term Effects of Ecological Factors on Nonpoint Source Pollution in the Upper Reach of the Yangtze River	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS												Nowadays, nonpoint source pollution has been a dominant cause of water quality deterioration and eutrophication. For large basins, long-term effects of ecological factors on nonpoint source pollution are significant and have gained worldwide attention. Yangtze River is the largest river in China, and water environment protection of its upper reach is crucial to maintain the whole river health and the Three Gorges Project successful operation. The objective of this study is to reveal the effects of ecological factors on nonpoint source pollution in the upper reach of the Yangtze River during the period from 1960 through 2003 by the Improved Export Coefficient Model and the Nutrient Losses Empirical Model. The results indicated that during those decades the effects of ecological factors on dissolved pollutants were constant whereas those on sediment as well as absorbed pollutants changed slightly and decreased obviously after 2000. Comparing to anthropogenic factors, ecological ones had a dominant influence on sediment and absorbed pollutants. As for load intensities, long-term effects of ecological factors on dissolved pollutants hadn't changed much, while those on sediment as well as absorbed pollutants was increasingly significant and then reached an ultimate in 1980. Atmospheric deposition, grassland as well as forest were important sources of dissolved nitrogen export, nevertheless, grassland and forest were the main export areas of dissolved phosphorus, sediment as well as absorbed pollutants. The study would facilitate the source identification and nonpoint source pollution control in the upper reach of the Yangtze River to improve water quality.																	1726-2135	1684-8799				SEP	2017	30	1					17	28		10.3808/jei.201700370								WOS:000412031900002						
J	Daryanto, S; Wang, LX; Jacinthe, PA				Daryanto, Stefani; Wang, Lixin; Jacinthe, Pierre Andre			Meta-Analysis of Phosphorus Loss from No-Till Soils	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Agriculture is a significant contributor to phosphorus (P) enrichment in aquatic ecosystems. No-till (NT) farming has been proposed as an alternative approach to conventional tillage (CT) in reducing soil P export, but published data have shown contrasting impacts, likely due to the interacting effects of different physical (climate region, rainfall variability, transport pathway, slope gradient) and management variables (NT duration, crop species). We conducted a meta-analysis to understand the extent to which each of these variables controls the concentration and load of different P fractions (dissolved P, particulate P) in agricultural runoff and leaching. In comparison with CT, particulate P loss was significantly lower with NT adoption (45 and 55% reduction in concentration and load, respectively), but an increase in dissolved P loss was observed. The extent of the reduction or increase, however, varied with different physical and management variables. In comparison with CT, for example, NT was not effective in reducing particulate P concentration during wet years and particulate P load on steep slopes (4-9%). Total P concentration was also similar with CT at sites under prolonged NT duration (similar to 10 yr) and at NT fields planted with soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]. Our results underscore the need to consider the covarying physical and management factors when assessing the potential of NT farming in controlling P loss in the environment. The limited impact of NT on dissolved P loss remains a serious impediment toward harnessing the water quality benefits of this management practice.

Assessing the Yield and Load of Contaminants with Stream Order: Would Policy Requiring Livestock to Be Fenced Out of High-Order Streams Decrease Catchment Contaminant Loads?	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Catchment contaminant loads vary with stream order as catchment characteristics influence inputs and in-stream processing. However, the relative influence and policy significance of these characteristics across a number of contaminants and at a national scale is unclear. We modeled the significance of catchment characteristics (e.g., climate, topography, geology, land cover), as captured by a national-scale River Environment Classification (REC) system, and stream order in the estimation of contaminant yields. We used this model to test if potential regulation in New Zealand requiring livestock to be fenced off from large (high)-order streams would substantially decrease catchment contaminant loads. Concentration and flow data for 1998 to 2009 were used to calculate catchment load and yields of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) species, suspended sediment, and Escherichia coli at 728 water quality monitoring sites. On average, the yields of all contaminants increased with increasing stream order in catchments dominated by agriculture (generally lowland and pastoral REC land cover classes). Loads from low-order small streams (< 1 m wide, 30 cm deep, and in flat catchments dominated by pasture) exempt from potential fencing regulations accounted for an average of 77% of the national load (varying from 73% for total N to 84% for dissolved reactive P). This means that to substantially reduce contaminant losses, other mitigations should be investigated in small streams, particularly where fencing of larger streams has low efficacy.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				SEP-OCT	2017	46	5					1038	1047		10.2134/jeq2017.05.0212								WOS:000411433900013	28991968

However, E. coli does not provide enough information to determine fecal source or public health risk. The stsudy objective was to determine factors influencing the presence of E. coli and host-specific markers (HSM) from upstream to downstream in Beaver Lake Reservoir (BLR). From February 2014 to September 2015, 420 base flow and rain event samples were collected from seven sites-two sites from streams (White River [WR] and War Eagle Creek) draining into BLR and five sites from within BLR. Each sample was analyzed for E. coli and by quantitative polymerase chain reaction for HSM related to human, bovine, and poultry. The data indicate that overall levels of E. coli were significantly greater in the WR and significantly lower at the most downstream sampling location in BLR. Escherichia coli is more likely present during spring (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.86), at the WR sampling site (aOR = 3.39), or during a rain event (aOR = 2.73). Moreover, the HSM HumM2 is more likely present (aOR = 1.99) when E. coli is present. These same factors were associated with E. coli concentrations >126 most probable number 100 mL(-1) (aOR = 2.76-12.48), except the poultry marker CL was more likely associated (aOR = 3.81) than HumM2. This study revealed that both seasonal and locational factors are important variables for fecal pollution in BLR. Moreover, these same factors may apply to fecal pollution in manmade reservoirs within similar types of watersheds across the United States, as well as internationally.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				SEP-OCT	2017	46	5					1048	1056		10.2134/jeq2017.03.0105								WOS:000411433900014	28991970

Tile Drainage Nitrate Losses and Corn Yield Response to Fall and Spring Nitrogen Management	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Nitrogen (N) management strategies that maintain high crop productivity with reduced water quality impacts are needed for tile-drained landscapes of the US Midwest. The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of N application rate, timing, and fall nitrapyrin addition on tile drainage nitrate losses, corn (Zea mays L.) yield, N recovery efficiency, and postharvest soil nitrate content over 3 yr in a corn-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotation. In addition to an unfertilized control, the following eight N treatments were applied as anhydrous ammonia in a replicated, field-scale experiment with both corn and soybean phases present each year in Illinois: fall and spring applications of 78, 156, and 234 kg N ha(-1), fall application of 156 kg N ha(-1) + nitrapyrin, and sidedress (V5-V6) application of 156 kg N ha(-1). Across the 3-yr study period, increases in flow-weighted NO3 concentrations were found with increasing N rate for fall and spring N applications, whereas N load results were variable. At the same N rate, spring vs. fall N applications reduced flow-weighted NO3 concentrations only in the corn-soybean-corn rotation. Fall nitrapyrin and sidedress N treatments did not decrease flow-weighted NO3 concentrations in either rotation compared with fall and spring N applications, respectively, or increase corn yield, crop N uptake, or N recovery efficiency in any year. This study indicates that compared with fall N application, spring and sidedress N applications (for corn-soybean-corn) and sidedress N applications (for soybean-corn-soybean) reduced 3-yr mean flow-weighted NO3 concentrations while maintaining yields.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				SEP-OCT	2017	46	5					1057	1064		10.2134/jeq2017.03.0109								WOS:000411433900015	28991986

Structural Equation Model of Total Phosphorus Loads in the Red River of the North Basin, USA and Canada	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Attribution of the causes of trends in nutrient loading is often limited to correlation, qualitative reasoning, or references to the work of others. This paper represents efforts to improve causal attribution of water-quality changes. The Red River of the North basin provides a regional test case because of international interest in the reduction of total phosphorus loads and the availability of long-term total phosphorus data and ancillary geospatial data with the potential to explain changes in water quality over time. The objectives of the study are to investigate structural equation modeling methods for application to water-quality problems and to test causal hypotheses related to the drivers of total phosphorus loads over the period 1970 to 2012. Multiple working hypotheses that explain total phosphorus loads and methods for estimating missing ancillary data were developed, and water-quality related challenges to structural equation modeling (including skewed data and scaling issues) were addressed. The model indicates that increased precipitation in season 1 (November-February) or season 2 (March-June) would increase total phosphorus loads in the basin. The effect of agricultural practices on total phosphorus loads was significant, although the effect is about one-third of the effect of season 1 precipitation. The structural equation model representing loads at six sites in the basin shows that climate and agricultural practices explain almost 60% of the annual total phosphorus load in the Red River of the North basin. The modeling process and the unexplained variance highlight the need for better ancillary long-term data for causal assessments.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				SEP-OCT	2017	46	5					1072	1080		10.2134/jeq2017.04.0131								WOS:000411433900017	28991977

Characterising urban zinc generation to identify surface pollutant hotspots in a low intensity rainfall climate	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Characterising stormwater runoff quality provides useful insights into the dynamics of pollutant generation and wash off rates. These can be used to prioritise stormwater management strategies. This study examined the effects of a low intensity rainfall climate on zinc contributions from different impermeable urban surface types. First flush (FF) and steady state samples were collected from seven different surfaces for characterisation, and the data were also used to calibrate an event-based pollutant load model to predict individual 'hotspot' surfaces across the catchment. Unpainted galvanised roofs generated very high concentrations of zinc, primarily in the more biologically available dissolved form. An older, unpainted galvanised roof had FF concentrations averaging 32,338 mu g/L, while the new unpainted roof averaged 4,782 mu g/L. Roads and carparks also had elevated zinc, but FF concentrations averaged only 822-1,584 mu g/L. Modelling and mapping expected zinc loads from individual impermeable surfaces across the catchment identified specific commercial roof surfaces to be targeted for zinc management. The results validate a policy strategy to replace old galvanised roof materials and avoid unpainted galvanised roofing in future urban development for better urban water quality outcomes. In the interim, readily-implemented treatment options are required to help mitigate chronic zinc impacts on receiving waterways.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				SEP	2017	76	6					1370	1377		10.2166/wst.2017.306								WOS:000411845600009	28953463

Multivariate statistical techniques were applied to study temporal and spatial variations in water quality of a segment of the Marikina River. The data set included 12 physico-chemical parameters for five monitoring stations over a year. Cluster analysis grouped the monitoring stations into four clusters and identified January-May as dry season and June-September as wet season. Principal components analysis showed that three latent factors are responsible for the data set explaining 83% of its total variance. The chemical oxygen demand, biochemical oxygen demand, total dissolved solids, Cl- and PO43- are influenced by anthropogenic impact/eutrophication pollution from point sources. Total suspended solids, turbidity and SO42- are influenced by rain and soil erosion. The highest state of pollution is at the Payatas creek outfall from March to May, whereas at downstream stations it is in May. The current study indicates that the river monitoring requires only four stations, nine water quality parameters and testing over three specific months of the year. The findings of this study imply that Payatas landfill requires a proper leachate collection and treatment system to reduce its impact on the Marikina River.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				SEP	2017	76	6					1510	1522		10.2166/wst.2017.279								WOS:000411845600023	28953477

Effect of Land Cover Changes on the Sediment and Water Quality Characteristics of Brays Bayou Watershed	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Rapid increase in impervious surfaces due to urbanization often intensifies the frequency of flooding which in turn increases runoff of environmental pollutants. The Brays Bayouwatershed (BBW) is a heavily urbanized and densely populated watershed located mostly in Harris County, TX. The objectives of our study are (1) to analyze and interpret the spatial and temporal land use and land cover changes in BBW and (2) to determine nutrient, heavy metal, and bacterial contamination in the Brays Bayou. Water and sediment samples were collected from selected sampling locations along the Brays Bayou and analyzed for various nutrient and metal concentrations. Bacterial analysis was conducted to enumerate the fecal coliform bacteria in water samples. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite images sampled from over three decades (19802010) for the BBW study area were processed and analyzed for land use and land cover changes. Our remote sensing analysis revealed that the BBW lost about 28.4% (9463 acres) vegetation during the period of 1984 to 2010. The loss in vegetative areas resulted in increased impervious surface areas. In sediment samples, increasing trends for Al, Cu, Fe, Pb, and Zn were observed towards the downstream of Brays Bayou. Lead concentrations were found at the highest concentration (70 mg/kg) in certain Brays Bayou sampling locations. Escherichia coli concentrations decreased towards the downstream of Brays Bayou and were found below 200 maximum probable numbers/100 ml. Integration of remote sensing along with the chemical and biological analysis helped to understand the impact of land cover changes on the bayou water quality.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				SEP	2017	228	9							336	10.1007/s11270-017-3538-7								WOS:000410827400019

Water Quality and Toxicological Impact Assessment Using the Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans Bioassay in a Long-Term Intensive Agricultural Area	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Due to intensive agricultural activities to meet the growing needs for food, large volumes of water are consumed and an increasing amount of agrochemicals are released into the environment threatening the aquatic ecosystem. In order to ensure a sustainable agricultural management, it is crucial to develop an integrated water assessment plan that includes not only water quantity and quality but also toxicological assessments. The Pergamino River basin (province of Buenos Aires, Argentina) was selected as a representative case of study to monitor and assess the impact of both the long-term intensification of soybean production and fast-growing urban development on surface and ground-water sources. Physicochemical analyses and a Water Quality Index were determined and showed that water quality falls into the marginal category, compromising the irrigation purposes and threatening aquatic life. Glyphosate and aminomethylphosphonic acid were detected at least once in all sites. Caenorhabditis elegans toxic bioassays were performed and a toxicological ranking was developed. This analysis proved to be useful to detect toxicity even when water parameters met regulatory requirements and water quality seemed to be satisfactory. This research constitutes a valuable model to be replicated in other river basins that have been impacted by intensive agriculture and growing urban development in order to assess water quality conditions and ensure sound water resources management.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				SEP	2017	228	9							333	10.1007/s11270-017-3512-4								WOS:000410827400016

In order to control weeds in the plantations and increase productivity, the mixing of different herbicides during spraying operations is commonplace. This practice is unregulated, and the impact on water quality and nontarget tropical species is poorly understood. In the present work, exposure and recovery assays were used to evaluate antioxidant enzyme activity and histopathological alterations in the liver of tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) following exposure to mixtures of the herbicides widely used in sugarcane crops: ametryn (AMT), tebuthiuron (TBUT), diuron (DIU), and hexazinone (HZN). The greatest biochemical changes were observed for the mixture (DIU+HZN)+AMT+TBUT at the highest concentration tested (1/10 96hLC50). This mixture caused a significant increase (p < 0.01) of approximately 82% in GST activity after 14 days of exposure. For three of the mixtures evaluated, GST and CAT could be considered potential biochemical biomarkers of exposure to the herbicide mixtures due to the frequency, intensity, and statistical significance of alterations in the assimilation phase. Although morphological changes were evident in the hepatic tissue, severe damage was only noted in a few samples, and there were no statistically significant differences, relative to the control. The results of hepatic lesion recovery assays suggested that the most sensitive individuals affected by the xenobiotics were unable to achieve full recovery. It is anticipated that the data obtained may assist in the selection of biomarkers for monitoring purposes, as well as in reinforcing standards of conduct in the use of agrochemical mixtures in agriculture.

J	Olofsson, B; Rasul, H; Lundmark, A				Olofsson, Bo; Rasul, Hedi; Lundmark, Annika			Spread of Water-Borne Pollutants at Traffic Accidents on Roads	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Traffic accidents sometimes lead to the spread of hazardous compounds to the environment. Accidental spills of hazardous compounds on roads in the vicinity of vulnerable objects such as water supplies pose a serious threat to water quality and have to be assessed. This study compared three different assessment methods, electrical resistivity measurements, analytical flow calculations, and 1D and 2D dynamic flow modeling, to describe rapid transport processes in the road shoulder and roadside verge after a major spill. The infiltration and flow paths of water-borne substances were described during simulated discharge of pollutants on different road types. Full-scale tracer tests using sodium chloride were carried out at nine different road locations in Sweden. Analysis of grain size distribution and infiltrometer tests were carried out at the road shoulder and verges. The pathways and travel times were traced using resistivity measurements and 3D inverse modeling. The resistivity measurements were compared to analytical flow calculations and 1D and 2D dynamic modeling. All measurement sites were highly heterogeneous, which caused preferential flow. Vertical flow velocities of 1.4-8.6 x 10(-4) m/s were measured. The results of the analytical calculations and flow modeling were of the same order of magnitude. The measurements showed that almost all infiltration goes directly into the road embankment, hence the composition and structure of the built-up road must be considered. The non-destructive resistivity measurements and 3D modeling provided useful information for clarifying the infiltration and flow pattern of water-borne compounds from road runoff.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				SEP	2017	228	9							323	10.1007/s11270-017-3477-3								WOS:000410827400006	28845063

Influences of Coal Ash Leachates and Emergent Macrophytes on Water Quality in Wetland Microcosms	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												The storage of coal combustion residue (CCR) in surface water impoundments may have an impact on nearby water quality and aquatic ecosystems. CCR contains leachable trace elements that can enter nearby waters through spills and monitored discharge. It is important, therefore, to understand their environmental fate in affected systems. This experiment examined trace element leachability into freshwater from fly ash (FA), the most common form of CCR. The effects on water quality of FA derived from both high and low sulfur coal sources as well as the influences of two different emergent macrophytes, Juncus effusus and Eleocharis quadrangulata, were evaluated in wetland microcosms. FA leachate dosings increased water electric conductivity (EC), altered pH, and, most notably, elevated the concentrations of boron (B), molybdenum (Mo), and manganese (Mn). The presence of either macrophyte species helped reduce elevated EC, and B, Mo, and Mn concentrations over time, relative to microcosms containing no plants. B and Mo appeared to bioaccumulate in the plant tissue from the water when elevated by FA dosing, while Mn was not higher in plants dosed with FA leachates. The results of this study indicate that emergent macrophytes could help ameliorate downstream water contamination from CCR storage facilities and could potentially be utilized in wetland filtration systems to treat CCR wastewater before discharge. Additionally, measuring elevated B and Mo in aquatic plants may have potential as a monitoring tool for downstream CCR contamination.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				SEP	2017	228	9							344	10.1007/s11270-017-3520-4								WOS:000410827400027

WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Salt applied to roads for de-icing can persist for decades in watersheds, and understanding rates of salt accumulation and export is important for anticipating the magnitude and duration of its environmental impacts. Salt removal is affected by storm frequency and intensity, both of which are projected to change as a result of anthropogenic climate change. To examine the potential outcomes of changing storm regimes on rates of salt export from watersheds, we studied chloride concentrations in baseflow and surface runoff in 5 years of streamflow data (taken at 20-min intervals) in a headwater tributary of the Hudson River. Baseflow, with chloride concentrations of 200-230 mg/L year-round, dominated streamflow, except during and after large storms, and accounted for about 90% of chloride export from the watershed. Extreme precipitation events (e.g., tropical storms) increased salt export mainly by increasing baseflow discharge, which remained elevated long after storms ended. While intense events accomplished more salt export per storm, they did not produce disproportionately higher export per volume of precipitation, compared to smaller rain events. Chloride export in a wet year was almost twice that in a dry year, despite less than a doubling of rainfall. Under future climate conditions, if winter precipitation shifts toward a higher proportion of rainfall, or summers experience a greater frequency of tropical storms, then long-term residence time of road salt in watersheds may be shorter than previously anticipated. Conversely, if climate becomes drier, with increased evapotranspiration, reduced infiltration and baseflow discharge may prolong salt storage, which could exacerbate biotic stresses from high chloride concentrations in streams.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				SEP	2017	228	9							362	10.1007/s11270-017-3455-9								WOS:000410827400045

Combined Use of Caffeine and Turbidity to Evaluate the Impact of CSOs on River Water Quality	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Several studies have demonstrated that the most effective way to control eutrophication is to reduce phosphorus input at the scale. Water quality monitoring programs need to separately evaluate the different polluting sources to provide a suitable estimate of their relative contributions and thus accurately prioritize possible restoration actions. Urban area cases, where a portion of untreated wastewater is often discharged directly into receiving surface waters by combined sewer overflows (CSOs) during rain events, remain unsolved. In this context, an urban watershed located in Northern Italy with 60 CSOs has been chosen as a case study, and four rainy events have been hourly monitored. The proposed monitoring program consists of the combined use of caffeine and turbidity to estimate the volume and phosphorus load spilled into the river from the CSOs, respectively. Caffeine proved to be a suitablemolecule to quantify the volume of wastewater discharged into water bodies, based on a per capita caffeine load of 10.8 mg inhab(-1) d(-1), estimated in the present work. This research showed that, on average, more than half of the total phosphorus loads transported by the river is due to the CSO discharges (56.5%). The knowledge of the prevailing responsibility of the CSO discharges for the Lambro River quality allows prioritizing effective restoration actions.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				SEP	2017	228	9							330	10.1007/s11270-017-3505-3								WOS:000410827400013						
J	Zhang, J; Hua, P; Krebs, P				Zhang, Jin; Hua, Pei; Krebs, Peter			The Influence of Surface Pavement on the Distribution of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) in Urban Watershed	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												The presence of urban surface pollutants washed off by stormwater is a growing concern due to their adverse effects on receiving water quality. The stormwater quality mitigation strategies, therefore, should be based on the knowledge of the distribution and source apportionment of pollutants on urban surfaces. This study showcases the distribution of particulate-associated PAHs as a function of surface characteristic. Samples were obtained from six sites in the city of Dresden, Germany, using a wet vacuum sample-taking method. Both surface load (mg/m(2)) and solid-phase concentration (mg/g) of PAHs were determined. Results show that the highest surface load of Sigma 16(PAHs) was found at a natural stone-paved pedestrian path with 34.5 mu g/m(2). By contrast, the highest solidphase concentration occurred at a high traffic load road with 36 mg/kg. Through a combined qualitative diagnostic ratio and quantitative principal component analysis with stepwise multiple linear regression (PCA-MLR) source apportionment, two significant contributors to PAH at vehicular roads were primarily identified as pyrogenic and petrogenic sources; 81.6% of the PAH burden was ascribed to pyrogenic sources including vehicle emission, coal, and wood combustions; 18.4% was attributed to petrogenic sources, such as spilled engine oil and vehicular tire debris. To minimize the adverse influence of surface sediments adsorbed PAHs to the receiving waters via stormwater runoff, a surface pavement-based city street sweeping strategy could be planned and optimized to remove hazardous materials from the impervious urban surfaces.

Organic sediment pulses impact rivers across multiple levels of ecological organization	ECOHYDROLOGY												Sedimentation is a pervasive environmental pressure affecting rivers globally. Headwaters draining catchments rich in organic soils (i.e., peat) are particularly vulnerable to enhanced sedimentation caused by land management and environmental change, yet many of the ecological consequences of peat deposition are poorly understood. We conducted a before-after-control-impact experiment in two rivers draining blanket peatland in Northern England to test the effect of sediment inputs on water quality, macroinvertebrate drift, macroinvertebrate community structure, and ecosystem metabolism. Sediment addition increased concentrations of dissolved organic carbon, total oxidised nitrogen and suspended sediment concentration in rivers, and intensified the total drift of macroinvertebrates particularly at night. By contrast, the abundance and richness of benthic macroinvertebrates were unaffected, except for declines in Coleoptera abundance in one river. The gross primary production of both rivers was strongly suppressed as the benthos was smothered by sediment. Community respiration also declined, albeit by different extents in the two rivers. Our experiment revealed that short-term pulses of organic sediment in rivers can have broad effects on water quality and biota, from influences on the dispersal of individual organisms to the modification of ecosystem processes. Organic sediments therefore warrant further examination, to include longer observation periods and more sites. It is particularly important to clarify the extent to which impacts extend from peatland streams into larger rivers downstream. Such studies are necessary to inform global management efforts to restore the integrity of river ecosystems under a range of water and biodiversity policy mechanisms.

Using Adaptive Processes and Adverse Outcome Pathways to Develop Meaningful, Robust, and Actionable Environmental Monitoring Programs	INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT												The primary goals of environmental monitoring are to indicate whether unexpected changes related to development are occurring in the physical, chemical, and biological attributes of ecosystems and to inform meaningful management intervention. Although achieving these objectives is conceptually simple, varying scientific and social challenges often result in their breakdown. Conceptualizing, designing, and operating programs that better delineate monitoring, management, and risk assessment processes supported by hypothesis-driven approaches, strong inference, and adverse outcome pathways can overcome many of the challenges. Generally, a robust monitoring program is characterized by hypothesis-driven questions associated with potential adverse outcomes and feedback loops informed by data. Specifically, key and basic features are predictions of future observations (triggers) and mechanisms to respond to success or failure of those predictions (tiers). The adaptive processes accelerate or decelerate the effort to highlight and overcome ignorance while preventing the potentially unnecessary escalation of unguided monitoring and management. The deployment of the mutually reinforcing components can allow for more meaningful and actionable monitoring programs that better associate activities with consequences. (C) 2017 The Authors.

J	Boyacioglu, H; Boyacioglu, H				Boyacioglu, Hulya; Boyacioglu, Hayal			Application of environmetric methods to investigate control factors on water quality	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION												In the study, environmetric methods were successfully performed a) to explore natural and anthropogenic controls on reservoir water quality, b) to investigate spatial and temporal differences in quality, and c) to determine quality variables discriminating three reservoirs in Izmir, Turkey. Results showed that overall water quality was mainly governed by "natural factors" in the whole region. A parameter that was the most important in contributing to water quality variation for one reservoir was not important for another. Between summer and winter periods, difference in arsenic concentrations were statistically significant in the Tahtali, Urkmez and iron concentrations were in the Balcova reservoirs. Observation of high/low levels in two seasons was explained by different processes as for instance, dilution from runoff at times of high flow seeped through soil and entered the river along with the rainwater run-off and adsorption. Three variables "boron, arsenic and sulphate" discriminated quality among Balcova & Tahtali, Balcova & Urkmez and two variables "zinc and arsenic" among the Tahtali & Urkmez reservoirs. The results illustrated the usefulness of multivariate statistical techniques to fingerprint pollution sources and investigate temporal/spatial variations in water quality.																	2083-4772	2083-4810				SEP	2017	43	3					17	23		10.1515/aep-2017-0026								WOS:000410003100003						
J	Ahmad, T; Ahmad, K; Alam, M				Ahmad, Tarique; Ahmad, Kafeel; Alam, Mehtab			Sludge quantification at water treatment plant and its management scenario	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Large volume of sludge is generated at the water treatment plants during the purification of surface water for potable supplies. Handling and disposal of sludge require careful attention from civic bodies, plant operators, and environmentalists. Quantification of the sludge produced at the treatment plants is important to develop suitable management strategies for its economical and environment friendly disposal. Present study deals with the quantification of sludge using empirical relation between turbidity, suspended solids, and coagulant dosing. Seasonal variation has significant effect on the raw water quality received at the water treatment plants so forth sludge generation also varies. Yearly production of the sludge in a water treatment plant at Ghaziabad, India, is estimated to be 29,700 ton. Sustainable disposal of such a quantity of sludge is a challenging task under stringent environmental legislation. Several beneficial reuses of sludge in civil engineering and constructional work have been identified globally such as raw material in manufacturing cement, bricks, and artificial aggregates, as cementitious material, and sand substitute in preparing concrete and mortar. About 54 to 60% sand, 24 to 28% silt, and 16% clay constitute the sludge generated at the water treatment plant under investigation. Characteristics of the sludge are found suitable for its potential utilization as locally available construction material for safe disposal. An overview of the sustainable management scenario involving beneficial reuses of the sludge has also been presented.

Estimation of tile drainage contribution to streamflow and nutrient loads at the watershed scale based on continuously monitored data	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Nitrogen losses from artificially drained watersheds degrade water quality at local and regional scales. In this study, we used an end-member mixing analysis (EMMA) together with high temporal resolution water quality and streamflow data collected in the 122 km(2) Otter Creek watershed located in northeast Iowa. We estimated the contribution of three end-members (groundwater, tile drainage, and quick flow) to streamflow and nitrogen loads and tested several combinations of possible nitrate concentrations for the end-members. Results indicated that subsurface tile drainage is responsible for at least 50% of the watershed nitrogen load between April 15 and November 1, 2015. Tiles delivered up to 80% of the stream N load while providing only 15-43% of the streamflow, whereas quick flows only marginally contributed to N loading. Data collected offer guidance about areas of the watershed that should be targeted for nitrogen export mitigation strategies.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				SEP	2017	189	9							426	10.1007/s10661-017-6139-4								WOS:000410476500001						
J	Bereskie, T; Haider, H; Rodriguez, MJ; Sadiq, R				Bereskie, Ty; Haider, Husnain; Rodriguez, Manuel J.; Sadiq, Rehan			Small drinking water systems under spatiotemporal water quality variability: a risk-based performance benchmarking framework	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Traditional approaches for benchmarking drinking water systems are binary, based solely on the compliance and/or non-compliance of one or more water quality performance indicators against defined regulatory guidelines/standards. The consequence of water quality failure is dependent on location within a water supply system as well as time of the year (i.e., season) with varying levels of water consumption. Conventional approaches used for water quality comparison purposes fail to incorporate spatiotemporal variability and degrees of compliance and/or non-compliance. This can lead to misleading or inaccurate performance assessment data used in the performance benchmarking process. In this research, a hierarchical risk-based water quality performance benchmarking framework is proposed to evaluate small drinking water systems (SDWSs) through cross-comparison amongst similar systems. The proposed framework (RWQI framework) is designed to quantify consequence associated with seasonal and location-specific water quality issues in a given drinking water supply system to facilitate more efficient decisionmaking for SDWSs striving for continuous performance improvement. Fuzzy rule-based modelling is used to address imprecision associated with measuring performance based on singular water quality guidelines/standards and the uncertainties present in SDWS operations and monitoring. This proposed RWQI framework has been demonstrated using data collected from 16 SDWSs in Newfoundland and Labrador and Quebec, Canada, and compared to the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment WQI, a traditional, guidelines/standard-based approach. The study found that the RWQI framework provides an in-depth state of water quality and benchmarks SDWSs more rationally based on the frequency of occurrence and consequence of failure events.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				SEP	2017	189	9							464	10.1007/s10661-017-6176-z								WOS:000410476500039	28836091

The application of high temporal resolution data in river catchment modelling and management strategies	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Modelling changes in river water quality, and by extension developing river management strategies, has historically been reliant on empirical data collected at relatively low temporal resolutions. With access to data collected at higher temporal resolutions, this study investigated how these new dataset types could be employed to assess the precision and accuracy of two phosphorus (P) load apportionment models (LAMs) developed on lower resolution empirical data. Predictions were made of point and diffuse sources of P across ten different sampling scenarios. Sampling resolution ranged from hourly to monthly through the use of 2000 newly created datasets from high frequency P and discharge data collected from a eutrophic river draining a 9.48 km(2) catchment. Outputs from the two LAMs were found to differ significantly in the P load apportionment (51.4% versus 4.6% from point sources) with reducing precision and increasing bias as sampling frequency decreased. Residual analysis identified a large deviation from observed data at high flows. This deviation affected the apportionment of P from diffuse sources in particular. The study demonstrated the potential problems in developing empirical models such as LAMs based on temporally relatively poorly-resolved data (the level of resolution that is available for the majority of catchments). When these models are applied ad hoc and outside an expert modelling framework using extant datasets of lower resolution, interpretations of their outputs could potentially reduce the effectiveness of management decisions aimed at improving water quality.

It serves many people, especially low-income earners, by providing a more affordable access to safe drinking water when compared with table water. However, some of the producers of SW do not effectively treat raw water before packaging them for sale. This study investigates the presence and concentrations of heavy metals, such as chromium (Cr), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), copper (Cu), aluminum (Al), and zinc (Zn) in some samples of SW sold within Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria. Samples of SW from nine different producers were purchased for four consecutive weeks and analyzed to determine the concentrations of these heavy metals in them. Furthermore, health risk indicators, such as chronic daily intake (CDI) and health risk indices (HRI) for children and adults, were calculated separately. The metal concentrations were compared with allowable limits set by the World Health Organization (WHO), Nigerian Industrial Standard (NIS), and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA). High concentrations of Cr, Fe, and Al were found in all the nine samples and exceeded the maximum allowable limits (MAL) of all the standards considered. However, the concentrations of Zn, Mn, and Cu were within permissible limits. The HRIs of heavy metals were in the order of Cu > Fe > Zn > Mn > Al > Cr, but since the standard limits set for some metals were exceeded, proper and effective treatment is required to safeguard the health of consumers.

By integrating a catchment model with a river model of water quality, we developed a method to estimate the effect of pollution sources on ambient water quality. Using integrated model simulations, we estimate (1) the relative contribution from point (industrial and domestic) and non-point sources (river catchment) to river water quality and (2) pollutant transfer coefficients for zones along the lower section of the river. Transfer coefficients provide the basis for policy analyses in relation to the location of new industries and the setting of priorities for industrial pollution control. They also offer valuable information to design socially optimal economic policy to manage industrialized river catchments.

Impact and ecosystem service of forest and sacred grove as saviour of water quantity and quality in Garhwal Himalaya, India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The present study was conducted in environs of the sacred grove of Garhwal Himalaya, India, with a view to assess the impacts of sacred groves and forests on the quality and quantity of water and also to assess the effect of seasonality on perennial stream quality. Water samples were collected from three randomly selected stream spots of both the sacred grove dominated by deodar (Cedrus deodara) and the non-sacred patch dominated by oak (Quercus leucotrichophora). Water samples from both patches were within the World Health Organization (WHO) standard limits. Based on an already established water quality index, water quality of both patches was safe for domestic and irrigation purposes but needs treatment for drinking purposes. Results of the present study also showed a very prominent impact of forest type as well as management condition on water quality and quantity. The water discharge from an oak forest shows more consistency than the discharge from a deodar forest. Due to the presence of the sacred grove, the area has become the source of good quality water supply during lean season for the surrounding villages. Water quality and quantity differed along with the change in season. The sacred grove and the existing forest leave a great impression on local dwellers, as due to its presence, local dwellers never run out of water supply during the dry season. As a result, the villagers sincerely want to protect the area for the sake of their own well-being.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				SEP	2017	189	9							477	10.1007/s10661-017-6173-2								WOS:000410476500052	28852894					
J	Khare, P				Khare, Peeyush			A large-scale investigation of the quality of groundwater in six major districts of Central India during the 2010-2011 sampling campaign	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												This paper investigates the groundwater quality in six major districts of Madhya Pradesh in central India, namely, Balaghat, Chhindwara, Dhar, Jhabua, Mandla, and Seoni during the 2010-2011 sampling campaign, and discusses improvements made in the supplied water quality between the years 2011 and 2017. Groundwater is the main source of water for a combined rural population of over 7 million in these districts. Its contamination could have a huge impact on public health. We analyzed the data collected from a large-scale water sampling campaign carried out by the Public Health Engineering Department (PHED), Government of Madhya Pradesh between 2010 and 2011 during which all rural tube wells and dug wells were sampled in these six districts. Eight hundred thirty-one dug wells and 47,606 tube wells were sampled in total and were analyzed for turbidity, hardness, iron, nitrate, fluoride, chloride, and sulfate ion concentrations. Our study found water in 21 out of the 228 dug wells in Chhindwara district unfit for drinking due to fluoride contamination while all dug wells in Balaghat had fluoride within the permissible limit. Twenty-six of the 56 dug wells and 4825 of the 9390 tube wells in Dhar district exceeded the permissible limit for nitrate while 100% dug wells in Balaghat, Seoni, and Chhindwara had low levels of nitrate. Twenty-four of the 228 dug wells and 1669 of 6790 tube wells in Chhindwara had high iron concentration. The median pH value in both dug wells and tube wells varied between 6 and 8 in all six districts. Still, a significant number of tube wells exceeded a pH of 8.5 especially in Mandla and Seoni districts. In conclusion, this study shows that parts of inhabited rural Madhya Pradesh were potentially exposed to contaminated subsurface water during 2010-2011. The analysis has been correlated with rural health survey results wherever available to estimate the visible impact. We next highlight that the quality of drinking water has enormously improved since 2011 in all six districts as a result of rigorous treatment of extracted subsurface water on the ground before supplying to rural habitations as well as efficient distribution from healthy wells. Our research could provide impetus to the state government to develop innovative solutions for improving groundwater quality in these areas as existing solutions are largely protective techniques. We have identified specific ions responsible for groundwater contamination in different districts which would allow the development of district specific effective mitigation strategies.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				SEP	2017	189	9							429	10.1007/s10661-017-6130-0								WOS:000410476500004	28770431

Although the SE water had no adverse effects on the growth of the algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, it could lead to water quality degradation of rivers in terms of its toxic unit value, whereas the use of RO and NF permeates would not lead to such degradation. The recharge of rivers, into which domestic wastewater and livestock effluents might be discharged in southern Okinawa Island, with reclaimed water subjected to advanced treatment could dilute the concentrations of chemicals that cause biological effects and improve the water quality of the rivers, based on the results of the bioassay using P. subcapitata. Comparing the results of bioassays of reclaimed water with those of the ambient water at a site might be effective in assessing the water quality of reclaimed water for environmental use at the site.

Metal concentrations in American oyster Crassotrea virginica and adjacent sediments from harvestable and non-harvestable sites in the Southeastern USA	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Human population growth in coastal areas continues to threaten estuarine ecosystems and resources. Populations of Crassostrea virginica have declined across the USA due to water quality degradation, disease pressure, alteration of habitat, and other changes related to anthropogenic impacts. Metals that may be present in estuarine habitats can bioaccumulate in oysters, with potential consequences to the health of oysters and humans consumers. This study (1) evaluated the occurrence and relationships of metal concentrations in oyster tissue versus estuarine sediments, (2) examined oyster tissue concentrations in relation to state water quality designations, and (3) evaluated the potential risk for humans from oyster consumption related to metal concentrations from harvestable waters. Results indicated metal concentrations in sediments and oysters along coastal South Carolina remain low compared to other areas and that concentrations in oyster tissue and adjacent sediments were not highly correlated with each other. However, high concentrations of some metals occurred in oysters sampled from areas designated as Approved for Harvesting. This is important because most harvest area designation systems rely on regular bacterial monitoring when evaluating the safety of consumption. Others safety measurements may be necessary as part of routine monitoring.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				SEP	2017	189	9							481	10.1007/s10661-017-6158-1								WOS:000410476500056	28861838

Groundwater is an important resource for drinking and agricultural purposes due to the lack of surface water resources in the region. The main objectives of the present study are to identify the hydrogeochemical processes and the potential sources of major, minor, and trace metals and metalloids such as Cr, Mn, Cd, Fe, Al, and As by using joint hydrogeochemical techniques and multivariate statistical analysis and to evaluate groundwater quality deterioration with the use of PoS environmental index. To achieve these objectives, 23 groundwater samples were collected in September 2015. Piper diagram shows that the mixed Ca-Mg-Cl is the dominant groundwater type, and some of the samples have Ca-HCO3, Ca-Cl, and Na-Cl types. Multivariate statistical analyses indicate that weathering and dissolution of different rocks and minerals, e.g., silicates, gypsum, and halite, ion exchange, and agricultural activities influence the hydrogeochemistry of the study area. The cluster analysis divides the samples into two distinct clusters which are completely different in EC (and its dependent variables such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, SO42-, and Cl-), Cd, and Cr variables according to the ANOVA statistical test. Based on the median values, the concentrations of pH, NO3-, SiO2, and As in cluster 1 are elevated compared with those of cluster 2, while their maximum values occur in cluster 2. According to the PoS index, the dominant parameter that controls quality deterioration is As, with 60% of contribution. Samples of lowest PoS values are located in the southern and northern parts (recharge area) while samples of the highest values are located in the discharge area and the eastern part.

Assessment of the water quality monitoring network of the Piabanha River experimental watersheds in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, using autoassociative neural networks	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Water quality monitoring is a complex issue that requires support tools in order to provide information for water resource management. Budget constraints as well as an inadequate water quality network design call for the development of evaluation tools to provide efficient water quality monitoring. For this purpose, a nonlinear principal component analysis (NLPCA) based on an autoassociative neural network was performed to assess the redundancy of the parameters and monitoring locations of the water quality network in the Piabanha River watershed. Oftentimes, a small number of variables contain the most relevant information, while the others add little or no interpretation to the variability of water quality. Principal component analysis (PCA) is widely used for this purpose. However, conventional PCA is not able to capture the nonlinearities of water quality data, while neural networks can represent those nonlinear relationships. The results presented in this work demonstrate that NLPCA performs better than PCA in the reconstruction of the water quality data of Piabanha watershed, explaining most of data variance. From the results of NLPCA, the most relevant water quality parameter is fecal coliforms (FCs) and the least relevant is chemical oxygen demand (COD). Regarding the monitoring locations, the most relevant is Poco Tarzan (PT) and the least is Parque Petropolis (PP).

J	Yadav, A; Pandey, J				Yadav, Amita; Pandey, Jitendra			Contribution of point sources and non-point sources to nutrient and carbon loads and their influence on the trophic status of the Ganga River at Varanasi, India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												To determine the possible contributions of point and non-point sources to carbon and nutrient loading in the Ganga River, we analyzed N, P, and organic carbon (OC) in the atmospheric deposits, surface runoff, and in the river along a 37-km stretch from 2013 to 2015. We also assessed the trophic status of the river as influenced by such sources of nutrient input. Although the river N, P, and productivity showed a declining trend with increasing discharge, runoff DOC and dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) increased by 88.05 and 122.7% between the Adpr and Rjht sites, indicating contributions from atmospheric deposition (AD) coupled with land use where agriculture appeared to be the major contributor. Point source input led to increased river concentrations of NO3-, NH4+, DRP, and DOC by 10.5, 115.9, 115.2, and 67.3%, respectively. Increases in N, P, and productivity along the gradient were significantly negatively correlated with river discharge (p < 0.001), while river DOC and dissolved silica showed positive relationships. The results revealed large differences in point and non-point sources of carbon and nutrient input into the Ganga River, although these variations were strongly influenced by the seasonality in surface runoff and river discharge. Despite these variations, N and P concentrations were sufficient to enhance phytoplankton growth along the study stretch. Allochthonous input together with enhanced autotrophy would accelerate heterotrophic growth, degrading the river more rapidly in the near future. This study suggests the need for large-scale inter-regional time series data on the point and non-point source partitioning and associated food web dynamics of this major river system.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				SEP	2017	189	9							475	10.1007/s10661-017-6188-8								WOS:000410476500050	28849425

Sakarya River located in Turkey flows from the northeast of Afyonkarahisar City to the Black Sea. Nineteen different micropollutants including trihalomethanes (THMs), haloacetic acids (HAAs), endocrine disrupting compound (EDC) and pharmaceuticals personal care product (PPCP) groups, and water quality parameters such as dissolved organic carbon (DOC), ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm wavelength (UV254), hardness, and conductivity values were examined. To remove the micropollutants and improve the water quality, the treatment was performed with ozone, microfiltration (MF), and ultra-filtration (UF) membranes. The highest treatment efficiency was obtained with 1 mg/L ozone dosage and UP005 UF membrane. The trihalomethan formation potential (THMFP) and haloacetic acid formation potential (HAAFP) decreased with ozone + membrane at a concentration of 79 and 75%, respectively. After the treatment with ozone + membrane, the concentration of the micropollutants in the EDC and PPCP group remained below the detection limit. It was found that by using only membrane and only ozone, the maximum DOC removal efficiency achieved was 46 and 18%, respectively; and with ozone + membrane, this efficiency increased up to 82%. The results from the High-Pressure Size Exclusion Chromatography (HPSEC) analyses pointed that the substances with high molecular weight were converted into substances with low molecular weight after the treatment. The Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) analysis results showed that the aromatic and aliphatic functional groups in water changed after the treatment with ozone and that the peak values decreased more after the ozone + membrane treatment.

J	Yeh, TY; Chen, HC				Yeh, Tzung-Yuh; Chen, Ho-Chi			Conservative heavy metal total discharge schemes	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Currently, according to Taiwan's Water Pollution Control Act, the environmental control of waterbodies and water quality depends on the effluent standards and the standard of water quality in the rivers. The Act demands that each stationary pollution source comply with the effluent standard before being discharged into the rivers, and that the overall water quality in the river shall not exceed the declared standard of water quality. To improve the condition of the waterbodies and water quality of the rivers, the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) in Taiwan has made stricter regulations concerning the discharge standard. Such regulations will help to reduce the weight of individual pollutants discharged; the discharged wastewater, however, will still gradually worsen the water quality of the rivers even after complying with the effluent standard since some of the pollutant dischargers may decrease the concentration of pollutants by diluting the water before discharging; thus, the total weight of metals discharged in the rivers will not be reduced, and the water quality in the areas where the pollutant sources are concentrated will not thereby be significantly improved. To protect the irrigation water and farmlands from being polluted by discharged heavy metals in industrial wastewater, the EPA started controlling the sources in accordance with the total quantity control (TQC) as defined in the Water Pollution Control Act, in the hope of perfecting the environmental protection of waterbodies and water quality, as well as ensuring clean water sources without any pollution for the rivers, land, and people.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				SEP	2017	24	27					21517	21529		10.1007/s11356-017-9404-8								WOS:000409962200001	28836183

The concentrations of the heavy metals varied spatially, with most of the highest concentrations in the Raohe river-lake ecosystem (RH). All heavy metals except As, Cd, W, and Tl were enriched in sediments possessing high total organic carbon contents or in finer sediments. Based on enrichment factors and statistical methods, it was found that Cd in sediments in the Xiushui (XS), Ganjiang (GJ), Xinjiang (XJ) river-lake ecosystems, and RH; Mn in the XS, GJ, and RH; and Win the XS and GJ were greatly affected by anthropogenic inputs. Moreover, the origins of Cu, Zn, and As require more attention due to the high concentrations found. The high enrichment factor of Cd in the sediments indicated that this metal might cause significant pollution in the environment. The results of the modified potential ecological risk index revealed that the XS, GJ, RH, and XJ were at considerable ecological risk, while the sediments in the Fuhe river-lake ecosystem (FH) were at moderate ecological risk, with Cd contributing the highest proportion of risk. The hazard score fundamentally validated the modified potential ecological risk analysis and revealed a mean toxicity of 57.80% to the benthic organisms in the RH.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				SEP	2017	24	27					21902	21916		10.1007/s11356-017-9855-y								WOS:000409962200036	28780687

Effect of first-flush device, roofing material, and antecedent dry days on water quality of harvested rainwater	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Two rainwater harvesting systems, which included first-flush diversion devices, connected to the roofs of two adjacent buildings, were monitored for water quality. The roofs were constructed from different materials, i.e., one roof was covered with ceramic tiles and the other was made of concrete. Water quality samples from the two storage tanks and the first-flush devices were collected and analyzed, showing satisfactory water quality in the tanks for residential non-potable use, while the water in the first-flush device was of poorer quality. Between the two collection surfaces, statistically significant differences were found only in the concentrations of NH4-N, orthophosphate, and Ca2+. Total coliforms were detected in both the storage tanks and the first-flush devices, indicating that disinfection of harvested rainwater may be necessary if it is collected for potable uses. Finally, first-flush water quality was related to antecedent dry days, showing that when the number of dry days increased, the accumulation of materials on the concrete roof was reduced while it was increased on the ceramic tile roof. This is attributed to the fact that the concrete roof is nearly horizontal (very slightly sloped), and the wind action easily removes various materials which accumulate on it.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				SEP	2017	24	27					21997	22006		10.1007/s11356-017-9868-6								WOS:000409962200044	28785942

The extracted pollutants were purified using solid phase extraction and then analyzed by liquid chromatography with diode array detection and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. All analyzed compounds were detected in at least one site in one sample. The analysis revealed maximum concentrations of 27.0 mu g L-1 CAF, 5.17 mu g L-1 ASA, 0.34 mu g L-1 NAP, 0.62 mu g L-1 KET, 1.42 mu g L-1 E1, 1.48 mu g L-1 EET, and 0.94 mu g L-1 E2. The results indicated that IguaScu river water is contaminated with emerging pollutants and nutrients and that this may be due to domestic sewage and water from tributary rivers mixing with IguaScu river water. Statistical analysis demonstrated that the study of emerging environmental contaminants is a useful tool to determine if contamination is due to domestic sewage input once traditional physical, chemical and spectroscopic analyses have been insufficient to prove an anthropogenic influence.

Peak flows were released in the early part of the pulse to simulate a spring flood, with approximately 101.7 mcm released at Morelos Dam on the U.S.-Mexico border. The remainder of the pulse flow water was released to the riparian corridor via Mexicali Valley irrigation spillway canals, with 20.9 mcm released at Km 27 Spillway (41 km below Morelos Dam) and 9.3 mcm released at Km 18 Spillway (78 km below Morelos Dam). We used sequential satellite images, overflights, ground observations, water discharge measurements, and automated temperature, river stage and water quality loggers to document and describe the progression of pulse flow water through the study area. The rate of advance of the wetted front was slowed by infiltration and high channel roughness as the pulse flow crossed more than 40 km of dry channel which was disconnected from underlying groundwater and partially overgrown with salt cedar. High lag time and significant attenuation of flow resulted in a changing hydrograph as the pulse flow progressed to the downstream delivery points; two peak flows occurred in some lower reaches. The pulse flow advanced more than 120 km downstream from Morelos Dam to reach the Colorado River estuary at the northern end of the Gulf of California. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Winners and losers as mangrove, coral and seagrass ecosystems respond to sea-level rise in Solomon Islands	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												A 2007 earthquake in the western Solomon Islands resulted in a localised subsidence event in which sea level (relative to the previous coastal settings) rose approximately 30-70 cm, providing insight into impacts of future rapid changes to sea level on coastal ecosystems. Here, we show that increasing sea level by 30-70 cm can have contrasting impacts on mangrove, seagrass and coral reef ecosystems. Coral reef habitats were the clear winners with a steady lateral growth from 2006-2014, yielding a 157% increase in areal coverage over seven years. Mangrove ecosystems, on the other hand, suffered the largest impact through a rapid dieback of 35% (130 ha) of mangrove forest in the study area after subsidence. These forests, however, had partially recovered seven years after the earthquake albeit with a different community structure. The shallow seagrass ecosystems demonstrated the most dynamic response to relative shifts in sea level with both losses and gains in areal extent at small scales of 10-100 m. The results of this study emphasize the importance of considering the impacts of sea-level rise within a complex landscape in which winners and losers may vary over time and space.																	1748-9326					SEP	2017	12	9							094009	10.1088/1748-9326/aa7e68								WOS:000410458700002						
J	Luo, C; Li, ZF; Wu, M; Jiang, KX; Chen, XM; Li, HP				Luo, Chuan; Li, Zhaofu; Wu, Min; Jiang, Kaixia; Chen, Xiaomin; Li, Hengpeng			Comprehensive study on parameter sensitivity for flow and nutrient modeling in the Hydrological Simulation Program Fortran model	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Numerous parameters are used to construct the HSPF (Hydrological Simulation Program Fortran) model, which results in significant difficulty in calibrating the model. Parameter sensitivity analysis is an efficient method to identify important model parameters. Through this method, a model's calibration process can be simplified on the basis of understanding the model's structure. This study investigated the sensitivity of the flow and nutrient parameters of HSPF using the DSA (differential sensitivity analysis) method in the Xitiaoxi watershed, China. The results showed that flow was mostly affected by parameters related to groundwater and evapotranspiration, including DEEPFR (fraction of groundwater inflow to deep recharge), LZETP (lower-zone evapotranspiration parameter), and AGWRC (base groundwater recession), and most of the sensitive parameters had negative and nonlinear effects on flow. Additionally, nutrient components were commonly affected by parameters from land processes, including MON-SQOLIM (monthly values limiting storage of water quality in overland flow), MON-ACCUM (monthly values of accumulation), MON-IFLW-CONC (monthly concentration of water quality in interflow), and MON-GRND-CONC (monthly concentration of water quality in active groundwater). Besides, parameters from river systems, KATM20 (unit oxidation rate of total ammonia at 20 degrees C) had a negative and almost linear effect on ammonia concentration and MALGR (maximal unit algal growth rate for phytoplankton) had a negative and nonlinear effect on ammonia and orthophosphate concentrations. After calibrating these sensitive parameters, our model performed well for simulating flow and nutrient outputs, with R-2 and E-NS (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency) both greater than 0.75 for flow and greater than 0.5 for nutrient components. This study is expected to serve as a valuable complement to the documentation of the HSPF model to help users identify key parameters and provide a reference for performing sensitivity analyses on other models.

A detailed understanding of relationship between water quality and land use is critical for effective land use management to improve water quality. Linear mixed effects and multiple regression models were applied to water quality data collected from 2003 to 2010 from 36 stations in the Huai River basin together with topography and climate data, to characterize the land use impacts on water quality and their spatial scale and seasonal dependence. The results indicated that the influence of land use categories on specific water quality parameter was multiple and varied with spatial scales and seasons. Land use exhibited strongest association with dissolved oxygen (DO) and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) concentrations at entire watershed scale and with total phosphorus (TP) and fluoride concentrations at finer scales. However, the spatial scale, at which land use exerted strongest influence on instream chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) levels, varied with seasons. In addition, land use composition was responsible for the seasonal pattern observed in contaminant concentrations. COD, NH3-N, and fluoride generally peaked during dry seasons in highly urbanized regions and during rainy seasons in less urbanized regions. High proportion of agricultural and rural areas was associated with high nutrient contamination risk during spring. The results highlight the spatial scale and seasonal dependence of land use impacts on water quality and can provide scientific basis for scale-specific land management and seasonal contamination control.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				SEP	2017	24	26					20995	21010		10.1007/s11356-017-9733-7								WOS:000409040700016	28726224

Sixteen diversion scenarios and five sewage interception scenarios were defined to assess the improvement of water quality parameters including ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), total phosphorus (TP) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) under different diverted water flows, diverting times, diverting points, diverting routines and sewage interception proportions. An index of pollutant removal rate per unit diverted water flow (PRUWF) was proposed to evaluate the effect of the clean water diversion. Results show that operating conditions played important roles in water quality improvement of medium-sized inland rivers. The optimal clean water diversion was operated under the conditions of a flow rate of 5 m(3)/s for 48 h with an additional constructed bridge sluice. A global sensitivity analysis using the Latin Hypercube One-Factor-at-a-Time (LH-OAT) method was conducted to distinguish the contributions of various driving forces to inland river water restoration. Results show that sewage interception was more important than diverted water flow and diverting time with respect to water quality improvement, especially for COD.

As a result, the dynamic balances among freshwater, brine, and seawater have been disturbed and the quality of groundwater has deteriorated. To fully understand the groundwater chemical distribution and evolution in the regional aquifers, hydrogeochemical and isotopic studies have been conducted based on the water samples from 102 observation wells. Groundwater levels and salinities in four monitoring wells are as well measured to inspect the general groundwater flow and chemical patterns and seasonal variations. Chemical components such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Sr2+, Cl-, SO4 (2-), HCO3 (-), NO3 (-), F-, and TDS during the same period are analyzed to explore geochemical evolution, water-rock interactions, sources of salt, nitrate, and fluoride pollution in fresh, brackish, saline, and brine waters. The decreased water levels without typical seasonal variation in the southeast of the study area confirm an over-exploitation of groundwater. The hydrogeochemical characteristics indicate fresh-saline-brine-saline transition pattern from inland to coast where evaporation is a vital factor to control the chemical evolution. The cation exchange processes are occurred at fresh-saline interfaces of mixtures along the hydraulic gradient. Meanwhile, isotopic data indicate that the brine in aquifers was either originated from older meteoric water with mineral dissolution and evaporation or repeatedly evaporation of retained seawater with fresher water recharge and mixing in geological time. Groundwater suitability for drinking is further evaluated according to water quality standard of China. Results reveal high risks of nitrate and fluoride contamination. The elevated nitrate concentration of 560 mg/L, which as high as 28 times of the standard content in drinking water is identified in the south region. In addition, the nitrate and ammonia data of the Wei River suggests decreasing nitrification rate in the study area from inland to estuary. High fluoride concentration, larger than 1 mg/L, is also detected in an area of about 50% of the study region. The saltwater intrusion is analyzed to be responsible for part of dissolution of minerals containing fluoride. Therefore, water treatment before drinking is needed in urgent to reduce the health expose risk.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				SEP	2017	24	26					21073	21090		10.1007/s11356-017-9641-x								WOS:000409040700022	28730358

Except the concentrations of total suspended solids (TSS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) in the influent and effluent that were measured, the removal mechanism of pollutants was discussed further. The results indicate that the surface materials influence the removal efficiency of pollutants greatly and have different effects on certain pollutant. Furthermore, the physical interception and adsorption would be the main mechanism for the removal of pollutants from runoff. For example, for all surface materials, the average removal efficiency of TSS is nearly about 90.0% because of physical interception. Due to the amount of iron oxide, the removal efficiency of COD, NO3-N, and TN of shale brick was 88.2, 35.1, and 17.5%, respectively. NH4-N and TN can be easily removed by porous asphalt due to the high content of organic matter. By lacking of useful adsorption sites, all the surface materials had little effect on the removal of TP from runoff. This research could offer useful guidelines for the better design of permeable pavement system and promote the insight into the removal mechanism of pollutants in permeable pavement system.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				SEP	2017	24	26					21103	21110		10.1007/s11356-017-9750-6								WOS:000409040700024	28730361

This technique, however, presents a risk to surface water and groundwater resources, owing to the leakage of metals, anions, and organic compounds. The geochemical monitoring of water resources is therefore extremely important, since the leachate can compromise the quality and use of surface water and groundwater close to landfills. In this paper, the results of analyses of metals, anions, ammonia, and physicochemical parameters were used to identify possible contamination of surface water and groundwater in a landfill area. A statistical multivariate approach was used. The values found for alkali metals, nitrate, and chloride indicate contamination in the regional groundwater and, moreover, surface waters also show variation when compared to the other background points, mainly for ammonia. Thus, the results of this study evidence the landfill leachate influence on the quality of groundwater and surface water in the study area.

The applied MST tools combined microbial analyses and molecular tests to detect and define the source(s) and dominant origin(s) of faecal water contamination. Faecal indicator bacteria Escherichia coli and host-specific Bacteroidales 16 s rRNA gene markers have been employed. The study revealed that the newly developed contribution profiling of faecal origin derived from the Bacteroidales DNA could quantitatively distinguish between human and non-human pollution origins. Further, the outcomes of the MST test have been compared with the results of both physicochemical analyses and tests of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs). A strong positive correlation was discovered between the human marker and PPCPs. Gabapentin was the most frequently detected compound and it showed the uppermost positive correlation with the human marker. The study demonstrated that the NBTS performs satisfactorily with the removal of E. coli but not PPCPs. Interestingly, the presence of PPCPs in the water samples was not correlated with high concentrations of E. coli. Neither has the latter an apparent correlation with the human marker.

Adapted optimization model for planning regional wastewater systems: case study	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Wastewater systems are of crucial importance to the promotion of sustainable development. Through an integrated planning approach, the costs can be minimized and the resulting benefits maximized. A planning approach at regional level exploits the economies of scale, while achieving a better environmental performance. In this paper we set out a decision support approach for the planning of regional wastewater systems. Optimization models are used, aimed at finding optimal configurations for the location, type and size of the system's infrastructure: sewers, pump stations, and wastewater treatment plants. Solutions are evaluated in terms of the cost of installing, operating and maintaining the infrastructure, and the water quality in the river that receives the treated wastewater. The river water quality varies in accordance with the effluent discharges, and is assessed using environmental parameters. The models are solved with a simulated annealing algorithm complemented by a local improvement procedure. Its application is illustrated through a case study in the Una river basin region, in Brazil.

Generally, nutrient contents gradually decreased from the estuary to the central bay, which confirmed that terrigenous inputs from Sanya River and Sanya Harbor were the primary nutrient sources. The results of K-means cluster analysis suggested the Luhuitou fringing reef is in danger of being affected by the pollution source. The results of nutrient diffusive fluxes at the sediment-seawater interface indicated diffusion from pore water to overlying water. Compared with other coral reef areas around the world, nutrient levels in Luhuitou fringing reef were at the medium level. Significant correlation between temporal variation of nutrients and living coral cover was not found, which suggests that low nutrient enrichment, ranging from 1.89 to 2.89 mu mol/L for DIN and from 0.1 to 0.49 mu mol/L for PO43-, may not be responsible for the coral reef decline on Luhuitou fringing reef from 2002 to 2014.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				SEP	2017	33	5					1148	1160		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-15-00190.1								WOS:000409252500014

In the studied soil environments, the average moisture content was 28.07%, soil salinity was 5.86 ppt, and total nitrogen was 1.02 mg/g. In water environments, the average dissolved oxygen was 9.04 mg/L, water salinity was 13.66 ppt, nitrate nitrogen (NOx-N) was 1.0712 mg/L, and ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) was 0.3790 mg/L. The correlation analysis of P. australis communities revealed that there was a relatively strong negative correlation between soil salinity and annual production (r = -0.584, N = 22). The ordination using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) of edaphic factors and water quality factors showed that soil salinity, water salinity, and water nitrate-nitrogen play important roles in types of P. australis communities. It was separated as three coastal habitat Phragmites community types by cluster analysis and three Phragmites community types including brackish water group in both freshwater and seawater groups by CCA. The understanding of Phragmites distribution in three habitat types would help inform successful management.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				SEP	2017	33	5					1210	1216		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-16-00065.1								WOS:000409252500020

This resulted in a flexible, objectively based design for a 1128-km(2) watershed without prior water quality data (La Miel River), and a network redesign of a 1052-km(2) watershed with historical water quality monitoring (Chinchina River). Monitoring design for the undocumented basin incorporated mathematical expressions for physical, anthropological, and historical factors-and was based on clear objectives for diagnosis and intervention of water pollution. Network redesign identified network redundancy, which resulted in a 64% reduction in the number of water quality monitoring stations along the channel, and a 78% reduction of stations throughout the basin. Most tropical drainage basins throughout the world have little to no prior water quality data. But even in well-studied drainage basins like the Chinchina River, which is among the most thoroughly studied basins in Colombia, redesign of historical and existing monitoring networks will become a standard tool to advance the restoration of polluted surface waters, not only in Colombia, but also throughout the world.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				SEP	2017	24	25					20134	20148		10.1007/s11356-017-9021-6								WOS:000408698700003	28432628

Especially in the Adriatic region, water used for drinking water supply purposes pass from many different countries, turning its management into a hard task to achieve. During the DRINKADRIA project, a common methodological framework has been developed, for efficient and effective cross-border water supply and resources management, taking into consideration different resources types (surface and groundwater) emphasizing in drinking water supply intake. The common methodology for water resources management is based on four pillars: climate characteristics and climate change, water resources availability, quality, and security. The present paper assesses both present and future vulnerability of water resources in the Adriatic region, with special focus on Corfu Island, Greece. The results showed that climate change is expected to impact negatively on water resources availability while at the same time, water demand is expected to increase. Water quality problems will be intensified especially due to land use changes and salt water intrusion. The analysis identified areas where water resources are more vulnerable, allowing decision makers develop management strategies.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				SEP	2017	24	25					20173	20186		10.1007/s11356-017-9732-8								WOS:000408698700006	28730364

However, after the occurrence of the two algae blooms in 1998 and 1999, the safety of water quality has been put into question. In order to study the historical deposition of nutrients, sediment cores were collected in different regions from the Xin'an Reservoir. The stable isotopes delta C-13 and delta N-15, nutrients, total organic carbon (TOC), and inorganic carbon (IC) in the sediment cores were determined. Radiometric methods (Pb-210 and Cs-137) were used to obtain sediment chronologies. Spatially, it was found that the average total nitrogen (TN) content in the upper 5 cm of sediments increased from 0.21% in the riverine zone, to 0.33%, and then to 0.57% in the lacustrine zone. The average TP content in the upper 5 cm increased from 0.67 g kg(-1) in the riverine zone, to 1.03 g kg(-1) in the estuary region, and then to 1.65 g kg(-1) in the lacustrine zone. In addition, TOC levels showed a distinct increase from 1.42% in the bottom to 5.97% in the surface of the lacustrine zone. These results demonstrated that although primary productivity and the input of nutrients constantly increased in recent years, algae blooms rarely occurred in the Xin'an Reservoir, due to "depth effect" and an aquatic environment protection-oriented fishery policy. However, high TOC flux and high bio-available phosphorus and nitrogen in surface sediment demonstrated that the reservoir is still confronted with the potential risk of algae blooms.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				SEP	2017	24	25					20330	20341		10.1007/s11356-017-9537-9								WOS:000408698700017	28707236

Water quality parameters including total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), nitrite (NO2 (-)), nitrate (NO3 (-)), phosphate (PO4 (3-)), pH, and dissolved oxygen (DO) were determined in outlet of the aquaponic system during a 60-day experimental period. Cherry tomato was planted at four densities of 0 (control), 3 (T1), 6 (T2), and 9 (T3) plants per aquaponic unit with a constant fish stock density. Each treatment was equipped with aquaponic systems containing fish tank and plant growing bed. Productivity of the system was measured by recording the fish and plant growth indices. The potential in removing nitrogen of the water was the highest in T3 (with nine plants) compared to other treatments (p < 0.05). The highest concentrations of TAN (6.59 +/- 0.241 mg/L), nitrite (0.42 +/- 0.005 mg/L), nitrate (0.45 +/- 0.162 mg/L), and phosphate (30.47 +/- 0.371 mg/L) were obtained in control group, while the lowest concentrations of TAN (0.05 +/- 0.091 mg/L), NO2 (-) (0.11 +/- 0.008 mg/L), NO3 (-) (29.77 +/- 0.205 mg/L), and phosphate (18.59 +/- 0.185 mg/L) were detected in T3 (p < 0.05). The maximum fish weight gain was recorded in T3 (26 +/- 0.014%) with 1.26 +/- 0.059 FCR, and the lowest fish weight gain was measured in the control group (15 +/- 0.024%) with 2.19 +/- 0.446 FCR (p < 0.05). Total plant length gain was reached at the maximum value in T3 (74.70 +/- 1.153 cm) in comparison to other groups (p < 0.05). It was concluded that small-scale aquaponic growing bed system can be created a sustainable ecosystem which both the plant and fish can thrive and suitable for home-made production system.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				SEP	2017	24	25					20634	20640		10.1007/s11356-017-9702-1								WOS:000408698700043	28712082					
J	Zolfagharipoor, MA; Ahmadi, A				Zolfagharipoor, Mohammad Amin; Ahmadi, Azadeh			Effluent trading in river systems through stochastic decision-making process: a case study	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												The objective of this paper is to provide an efficient framework for effluent trading in river systems. The proposed framework consists of two pessimistic and optimistic decision-making models to increase the executability of river water quality trading programs. The models used for this purpose are (1) stochastic fallback bargaining (SFB) to reach an agreement among wastewater dischargers and (2) stochastic multi-criteria decision-making (SMCDM) to determine the optimal treatment strategy. The Monte-Carlo simulation method is used to incorporate the uncertainty into analysis. This uncertainty arises from stochastic nature and the errors in the calculation of wastewater treatment costs. The results of river water quality simulation model are used as the inputs of models. The proposed models are used in a case study on the Zarjoub River in northern Iran to determine the best solution for the pollution load allocation. The best treatment alternatives selected by each model are imported, as the initial pollution discharge permits, into an optimization model developed for trading of pollution discharge permits among pollutant sources. The results show that the SFB-based water pollution trading approach reduces the costs by US$ 14,834 while providing a relative consensus among pollutant sources. Meanwhile, the SMCDM-based water pollution trading approach reduces the costs by US$ 218,852, but it is less acceptable by pollutant sources. Therefore, it appears that giving due attention to stability, or in other words acceptability of pollution trading programs for all pollutant sources, is an essential element of their success.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				SEP	2017	24	25					20655	20672		10.1007/s11356-017-9720-z								WOS:000408698700045	28712084

Land-use changes, such as converting riparian vegetation to human use or changing the management practices of farm ponds, are assumed to be major factors that change such ecosystems from a clear-water state to a turbid state, leading to deterioration of water quality and biodiversity in such ponds. Using the database of a large-scale pond survey, we evaluated the effects of surrounding land use (landscape factors and modern pond management practices), fish abundance, and other environmental variables on total phosphorus concentration and taxonomic richness patterns of six biological indicators associated with changes in the trophic state. Local- and landscape-level vegetation structure associated with land use and total fish abundance were among the factors influencing the total phosphorus concentration of farm ponds, a main driver of trophic state changes. In addition, a transition from a clear-water state to a turbid state was associated with lower taxonomic richness of aquatic plants, macroinvertebrates, and adult Odonata, and a higher taxonomic richness of phytoplankton and fish. Based on these results, we discuss potential land-use and pond management strategies for conserving and/or restoring the water quality and biodiversity of farm ponds through maintenance of a clear-water state.

Relative role of transport and source -limited controls for estrogen, TDP, and DOC export for two manure application methods	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Developing successful mitigation strategies for emerging contaminants can be difficult due to incomplete understanding of factors controlling their fate and transport. A variety of data analysis techniques can be used to assess the fate and transport behavior of pollutants in runoff water. Here, we use concentration-discharge, load discharge, and coefficient of variation relationships to examine how two methods of dairy manure application (surface broadcast and shallow disk injection) affect the transport dynamics of estrogens, total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Nine surface runoff events were sampled from Oct 2014 June 2015 from 12 research plots (six with each application method) in Central Pennsylvania after fall application. The plots received inorganic fertilizer for 15 years, but only four manure applications since 2012. Both TDP and DOC exhibited similar transport behavior under both manure application methods that indicate transport-limited control of export, potentially due to legacy sources in soils. However, estrogen loads exhibited dilution responses, a sign of source-limited controls. The strength of the dilution response for estrogens was greater for surface applied manure relative to the injected manure, suggesting that manure application methods can be used to control the mobilization potential of estrogens. Additionally, results suggest the longer-term application history of inorganic fertilizer led to the transport-limited dynamics exhibited by TDP, while the short-term application history of manure caused estrogen transport to be source-limited. Our findings provide insight into how anthropogenic drivers (application type, method, and history) and natural drivers (hydrology, biogeochemistry) are interconnected in agricultural fields, and point to opportunities for protecting, downstream water quality.																	0167-8809	1873-2305				SEP 1	2017	247						308	318		10.1016/j.agee.2017.06.045								WOS:000408597800034

An integrated approach for evaluation of groundwater quality in Korba district, Chhattisgarh using Geomatic techniques	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												Aim: The objective of the study was to evaluate and assess present groundwater quality scenario by developing groundwater quality index map for Korba district in Chhattisgarh. Methodology: For the study, well wise water quality data was collected for 719 villages over the period of six years from 2009 to 2015.The relative weights, quality rating scale and accordingly weighted values were calculated to estimate the overall groundwater quality index (GQI) and calculation of GQI was carried out for 10 parameters such as pH, turbidity, total hardness, chloride, calcium, nitrate, iron, magnesium, sulphate and fluoride. GQI map was developed by creating spatial reference to point locations for which the quality of groundwater is known using GIS software. Results: The concentration of the parameters in the study area was found in the following order: Turbidity > Iron > pH > Fluoride > Nitrate > Magnesium > Calcium > Chloride > Total Hardness > Sulphate. Groundwater quality index map show decrease in water quality from north to east in the study area. According to the classification of GQI, 8.86% of water sampling locations were found having GQI less than100 means bearing good quality water and 91.14% having GQI greater than100 indicating non potable water. Interpretation: Application of GQI in the present work communicates comparative information on groundwater quality of Korba district. Presence of low water quality in the study area may be attributed due to mining activities and overexploitation of groundwater. Analysis suggests that groundwater in the study area needs specific treatment before supply to the public as potable water.																	0254-8704					SEP	2017	38	5					865	872		10.22438/jeb/38/5/MRN-600								WOS:000407544700022

Assessment of the environmental quality of two urbanized lotic systems using multiple indicators	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Urbanization impacts ecosystems through loss and fragmentation of habitat, loss of diversity, increase in runoff, and contaminant discharges, and the invasion of exotic species. Potrero de los Funes Village (San Luis, Argentina) is experiencing not only a population increase during summer months due to tourism but also an accelerated growth of its permanent population. In order to evaluate the potential effects of urbanization, the environmental quality of Potrero de los Funes River and Las Chacras Stream was assessed, using physical-chemical and biological indicators. Macroinvertebrates, through the application of the Biotic Index for San Luis Sierras (BISLS), anuran amphibian richness and relative abundance, and riparian vegetation were used as bioindicators. While the Simplified Index of Water Quality (SIWQ) was used to characterize the physical-chemical quality of water at each site. SIWQ and BISLS scores were significantly different between sites (F-7,F-28=9.88, p<.001 and F-7,F-28=24.18, p<.001, respectively). SIWQ was significantly correlated with BISLS (Spearman correlation coefficient=0.8, p<.001). Four anuran species were registered along Potrero River, with no significant differences in the intensity of vocalizations between sites. No species were detected in Las Chacras Stream. Average total plant species richness, exotic plants richness, and vegetation cover were higher at the most impaired system, Las Chacras Stream. The principal component analysis showed that the first two principal components (PCs) explained 76.3% of the total variance. PC1, with strong loadings of SIWQ, BISLS, and amphibian richness, was principally driven by chemical water quality and biological conditions. PC2 was mainly determined by plant richness. The chemical and biological water quality of Potrero and Las Chacras is somewhat impaired, being the upper Las Chacras Stream the most compromised area. This study provides information that will certainly be used to manage future impacts of urbanization on aquatic resources.																	1535-1459	1535-1467				SEP	2017	33	7					1119	1129		10.1002/rra.3160								WOS:000409105100014

Until now, general end-users have had no effective method to measure the drinking water quality in situ and identify first-hand any violation. In return, there has been no feedback closed-loop of water quality monitoring and a control regime along distribution systems to provide real-time in situ early-warning for water treatment plants. This study targeted this crucial challenge by developing flat flexible thin micro-electrode array (MEA) sensors that integrate multiple types of mm-sized sensors to simultaneously monitor critical water quality parameters (temperature, conductivity, pH, Cl- and ClO-). MEA films were directly mounted onto a water tube that simulated a distribution system. Each type of sensor showed high accuracy with an R-2 value higher than 0.95 in the calibration tests. The shock tests clearly demonstrated the higher sensitivity of the MEA sensors than commercial sensors, and the advantage of integrating multiple types of sensors on a single film for autocorrection. More importantly, the Ag nanoparticle-modified ClO- MEA sensors showed high selectivity in the presence of competing elements (Cl-). Four-week tests in tap water revealed the intact structure of the MEA sensors and stable signal output. Overall, the MEAs possessed high accuracy, sensitivity, and selectivity for monitoring water quality. The flat flexible thin material and integrated configuration make the deployment of the sensors easy along distribution systems and at end-user points, and ultimately enable the in situ assessment of water quality in the water infrastructure.																	2053-1400	2053-1419				SEP 1	2017	3	5					865	874		10.1039/c7ew00103g								WOS:000408431500008						
J	Yuan, PY; Kim, Y				Yuan, Pengyi; Kim, Younggy			Accurate and rapid organic detection by eliminating hysteresis in bioanode sensor applications	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY												Bioanode sensors utilizing exoelectrogenic bacteria can be used for real-time and in situ assessment of water quality. The main challenges for practical applications of bioanode sensors in water quality assessment include their narrow detection range, long analysis time, and hysteresis effects. To overcome these limitations, a new operation method was proposed and examined in microbial electrolysis cell (MEC)-based bioanode sensors. The new operation method consists of normal operation (0.6 V application), a reset step (1.8 V application for 1 min), and a test step (1.2 V application for 2 min). The inclusion of the reset step in the sensor operation eliminated potential hysteresis effects and thus resulted in accurate correlations between readily biodegradable COD (chemical oxygen demand) and electric current with consistent R-2 values of 99% in triplicated sensor experiments. The high voltage application (1.2 V) during the test step not only enhanced sensor accuracy but also extended the detection range up to 130 mg-COD L-1. The combination of a reset step and a test step was proven to allow reliable sensor applications of MECs and other bioelectrochemical systems. Even with the greatly improved sensor accuracy, the correlation between readily biodegradable COD (acetate) and electric current varied substantially in 2 days. The findings indicate that bioanode sensors can be used for rapid organic detection in 3 min with very high accuracies but require frequent sensor calibration.

Assessing ecological impairments in Neotropical rivers of Mexico: calibration and validation of the Biomonitoring Working Party Index	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Freshwater ecosystems are one of the most endangered and threatened ecosystems worldwide, particularly in developing countries, where population growth, industrialization, urbanization, and changes in land use are increasing. In Mexico, water ecosystems are severely impacted and an easy-to-use tool is needed for monitoring freshwater ecosystems. This study presents the development of a calibration and validation procedure for the Biological Monitoring Working Party Index using physical-chemical and biological data from Neotropical rivers in Mexico (Apatlaco and Chalma-Tembembe). Water quality and macroinvertebrates were monitored in four campaigns including the dry and rainy seasons (2012-2013). Calibration of the index was performed in the following steps: determination of a physicochemical quality index, identification of the abundance class for each family of macroinvertebrates, incorporation of abundances in the corresponding physicochemical quality index interval, and determination of bioindication values for each macroinvertebrate family. With the calibrated values, the index was assessed for each study site and period. The calibrated index was validated by a statistical test. Ranges for water quality categories were defined by three statistical procedures. The range of the Biological Monitoring Working Party Index was tested with study sites from adjacent sub-basins. The Chalma-Tembembe River in agricultural areas comprised the categories "Bad polluted" to "regular and moderately polluted," whereas the largest portion of the Apatlaco River in urban zones comprised "Bad, very polluted" to "Bad, extremely polluted." Thus, the calibrated index is a suitable biomonitoring tool, allowing the detection of zones that need urgent management and a recovery plan.

Projections from four global climate models (GCMs) under representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP8.5 are used to drive the hydrological models. An ensemble prediction in the future period (2021-2050) from three competing hydrological models is generated using the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method. Though hydrological models do well in simulating daily discharges, all underestimate the observed low flows to some extent. Such underestimation of low flows could be compensated by application of the BMA method. Uncertainty from GCMs is a predominating source for monthly mean discharges. An increase in intensity of 7Q10, 7Q20, and 7Q30 is found under both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 for most cases. The increase of 7Q10, 7Q20, and 7Q30 could be more related to minimum monthly precipitation rather than the amount of monthly mean precipitation. The magnitude of the increase is smaller under RCP8.5 than RCP4.5, which could be explained by the higher temperature increase under RCP8.5. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Therefore, a complementary effect-based risk assessment by bioanalyses on mixtures of bioavailable micropollutants is proposed: the Smart Integrated Monitoring (SIMONI) strategy. The goal of this strategy is to obtain more reliable information on the water quality to select optimum measures for improvement. The SIMONI strategy is 2-tiered. Tier 1 is a bioanalytical hazard identification of sites. A tier 2 ecological risk assessment is carried out only at a limited number of sites where increased hazards are detected in tier 1. Tier 2 will be customized, based on tier 1 evaluation and additional knowledge of the aquatic system. The present study focuses on the tier 1 bioanalytical hazard identification to distinguish "hot spots" of chemical pollution. First, a selection was made of relevant and cost-effective bioanalytical endpoints to cover a wide spectrum of micropollutant modes of action. Specific endpoints may indicate which classes of chemicals might cause adverse effects. Second, effect-based trigger values (EBT) were derived for these bioassays to indicate potential ecological risks. Comparison of EBT with bioassay responses should discriminate sites exhibiting different chemical hazards. Third, a model was designed to estimate the overall risks for aquatic ecosystems. The associated follow-up for risk management is a "toxicity traffic light" system: green, low hazard (no action required); orange, potential risk (further research needed); and red, high risk (mitigation measures). Thanks to cost-effectiveness, flexibility, and relevance, the SIMONI strategy has the potential to become the first bioanalytical tool to be applied in regular water quality monitoring programs.

The first tier of the Smart Integrated Monitoring (SIMONI) strategy, which was described in part I, is based on the combination of passive sampling and bioanalytical measurements. Bioassay responses are compared with effect-based trigger values (EBT), and an overall SIMONI score on all bioassay data was designed to indicate environmental risks. The present study is focused on analyzing the feasibility of the hazard identification tier by evaluating results of 45 field campaigns at sites with different pollution profiles near the city of Amsterdam. A Daphnia assay was performed in situ, while silicon rubber or polar organic chemical integrative sampler (POCIS) extracts were tested with 4 nonspecific (daphnids, algae, bacteria, and cell culture) and 10 specific (9 Chemical Activated Luciferase Gene Expression [CALUX] assays and antibiotics scan) bioassays. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated the relevance of 2 classification variables in the SIMONI score formula on all bioanalytical data. The model indicated increased risks for the ecosystem at surface waters in greenhouse areas and undiluted wastewater-treatment plant (WWTP) effluents. The choice of testing specific bioassays on either polar or nonpolar passive sampling extracts is cost-effective and still provided meaningful insights on micropollutant risks. Statistical analyses revealed that the model provides a relevant overall impact assessment based on bioassay responses. Data analyses on the chemically determined mixture toxic pressure and bioanalytical methods provided similar insights in relative risk ranking of water bodies. The SIMONI combination of passive sampling and bioanalytical testing appears to be a feasible strategy to identify chemical hazards.

LENTIC, LOTIC, AND SULFATE-DEPENDENT WATERBORNE SELENIUM SCREENING GUIDELINES FOR FRESHWATER SYSTEMS	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												There is consensus that fish are the most sensitive aquatic organisms to selenium(Se) and that Se concentrations in fish tissue are the most reliable indicators of potential toxicity. Differences in Se speciation, biological productivity, Se concentration, and parameters that affect Se bioavailability (e.g., sulfate) may influence the relationship between Se concentrations in water and fish tissue. It is desirable to identify environmentally protective waterborne Se guidelines that, if not exceeded, reduce the need to directly measure Se concentrations in fish tissue. Three factors that should currently be considered in developing waterborne Se screening guidelines are 1) differences between lotic and lentic sites, 2) the influence of exposure concentration on Se partitioning among compartments, and 3) the influence of sulfate on selenate bioavailability. Colocated data sets of Se concentrations in 1) water and particulates, 2) particulates and invertebrates, and 3) invertebrates and fish tissue were compiled; and a quantile regression approach was used to derive waterborne Se screening guidelines. Use of a regression-based approach for describing relationships in Se concentrations between compartments reduces uncertainty associated with selection of partitioning factors that are generally not constant over ranges of exposure concentrations. Waterborne Se screening guidelines of 6.5 and 3.0 mg/L for lotic and lentic water bodies were derived, and a sulfate-based waterborne Se guideline equation for selenate-dominated lotic waters was also developed.

J	Asner, GP; Tupayachi, R				Asner, Gregory P.; Tupayachi, Raul			Accelerated losses of protected forests from gold mining in the Peruvian Amazon	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Gold mining in Amazonia involves forest removal, soil excavation, and the use of liquid mercury, which together pose a major threat to biodiversity, water quality, forest carbon stocks, and human health. Within the global biodiversity hotspot ofMadre de Dios, Peru, gold mining has continued despite numerous 2012 government decrees and enforcement actions against it. Mining is now also thought to have entered federally protected areas, but the rates of miner encroachment are unknown. Here, we utilize high-resolution remote sensing to assess annual changes in gold mining extent from 1999 to 2016 throughout theMadre de Dios region, including the high-diversity Tambopata National Reserve and buffer zone. Regionally, gold mining-related losses of forest averaged 4437 ha yr(-1). A temporary downward inflection in the annual growth rate of mining-related forest loss following 2012 government action was followed by a near doubling of the deforestation rate from mining in 2013-2014.

J	Hanlon, JW				Hanlon, Jeffrey W.			Complementary safeguards for robust regional watershed governance in a federation: New York City and its municipal water supply	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY												In federations such as the United States, governments at various levels are experimenting with new watershed governance arrangements to protect water quality for both ecosystem health and human consumption. Such arrangements may bring previously uncooperative governments together to credibly commit to resource protection under the auspices of new and intricate formal institutions. Given the risks of cooperation, theory indicates that a robust arrangement will contain means of holding governing actors accountable to each other. This paper examines a purportedly successful case, the New York City watershed governance arrangement, to identify how safeguards against intergovernmental opportunism promote lasting cooperation. Using the qualitative method of process tracing, this paper finds that the New York City watershed governance arrangement uses structural, judicial, and popular safeguards against opportunistic behaviors by governing actors that might threaten the resource or the arrangement. The results indicate that such safeguards are present and interact with other safeguards and rule institutions at the state and federal level to maintain compliance.																	1462-9011	1873-6416				SEP	2017	75						47	55		10.1016/j.envsci.2017.04.014								WOS:000407869500006						
J	Junter, GA; Lebrun, L				Junter, Guy-Alain; Lebrun, Laurent			Cellulose-based virus-retentive filters: a review	REVIEWS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND BIO-TECHNOLOGY												Viral filtration is a critical step in the purification of biologics and in the monitoring of microbiological water quality. Viral filters are also essential protection elements against airborne viral particles. The present review first focuses on cellulosebased filter media currently used for size-exclusion and/or adsorptive filtration of viruses from biopharmaceutical and environmental water samples. Data from spiking studies quantifying the viral filtration performance of cellulosic filters are detailed, i.e., first, the virus reduction capacity of regenerated cellulose hollow fiber filters in the manufacturing process of blood products and, second, the efficiency of virus recovery/concentration from water samples by the viradel (virus adsorption-elution) method using charge modified, electropositive cellulosic filters or conventional electronegative cellulose ester microfilters. Viral analysis of field water samples by the viradel technique is also surveyed. This review then describes cellulose-based filter media used in individual protection equipment against airborne viral pathogens, presenting innovative filtration media with virucidal properties. Some pros and cons of cellulosic viral filters and perspectives for cellulose-based materials in viral filtration are underlined in the review.																	1569-1705	1572-9826				SEP	2017	16	3					455	489		10.1007/s11157-017-9434-1								WOS:000407961300004

Hydrologic Performance of Regenerative Stormwater Conveyance in the North Carolina Coastal Plain	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												Regenerative stormwater conveyance (RSC) is an open channel, sand-filtering system composed of a series of shallow aquatic pools, riffle weirs, native vegetation, and underlying media beds. Surface runoff entering an RSC is conveyed as nonerosive surface flow or subsurface seep through the media, and exits the system as surface flow, seep out, exfiltration into parent soil, or evapotranspiration (ET). Regenerative stormwater conveyances are expected to perform similar to other sand-media-based low-impact development (LID) stormwater control measures (SCMs), but the hydrological and water quality efficiencies of RSC have not been sufficiently validated in a variety of hydrogeological conditions to date. A RSC was installed in the coastal plain of North Carolina, receiving runoff from 5.2 ha. Surface flow was reduced substantially through the RSC, with 84% of inflow converted to a shallow interflow-like seep, referred to in this paper as seep out. High groundwater levels resulted in small overall exfiltration rates, but increased evaporation rates due to extended ponding. The conversion of surface runoff to seep out has significant implications for stormwater mitigation, releasing filtered water at slower rates than conventional conveyance channels, similar to undeveloped watersheds. The Brunswick RSC released similar fraction of seep out to that of shallow interflow observed in undeveloped watersheds.

Correcting Systematic Underprediction of Biochemical Oxygen Demand in Support Vector Regression	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) is a variable that is missing or inaccurate in many water quality data sets because of difficulties in diluting highly polluted water samples. Machine learning algorithms, particularly support vector regression (SVR), are useful to build regression models to fill gaps in these data sets. The SVR can underpredict extreme-high values when they are few in number and underrepresented. This paper evaluates two methods, bootstrapping and data expansion, to mitigate the problem by increasing the proportion of extreme-high BOD in the data set before training the gap-filling model. Both methods were tested on the water quality data of Yuen Long Creek, Hong Kong, for the years 2000-2014. Both methods were effective in mitigating systematic underprediction and reducing their residual errors when the proportion of extreme-high values in the data set were increased from 3 to 30-40%. Both methods were useful for gap filling on BOD time series because extreme-high values are often the ones missing or inaccurate when highly polluted samples are diluted.

Evaluation of Bioretention Cell Performance Seven Years Postconstruction	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												Bioretention cells (BRCs) are stormwater control measures that integrate water quantity and quality management. Previous research primarily focused on the performance of cells less than two years old, before potential clogging and sorption site saturation. To assess long-term effectiveness, this project evaluated the performance of a BRC after seven years to determine reductions in flow rate, flow volume, suspended solids, nitrogen, phosphorus, and fecal indicator bacteria (FIB). These observations were compared with analyses conducted immediately postconstruction. Inflow and outflow water samples were collected for sediment, nutrients, and FIB. Soil media samples were collected from multiple depths and analyzed for denitrifying bacteria. Results indicate the BRC remains effective at reducing storm flows, nutrients, and FIB. These reductions were correlated to outflow volume, rather than storm characteristics. The majority of denitrifying bacteria were present in the top media layers, despite the presence of an internal water storage layer for denitrification. This finding suggests denitrification primarily occurs at anoxic microsites in the upper layers and that a lack of carbon at deeper depths may limit significant microbial growth.

This lake supplies approximately four million people with drinking water and has undergone strong re-oligotrophication over the past decades. We calculated depth-specific annual oxygen depletion rates (ODRs) during the period of stratification and found that 50% of the observed variability in ODR was already explained by a simple separation into a sediment- and volume-related oxygen consumption. Adding a linear factor for water depth further improved the model indicating that oxygen depletion increased substantially along the depth. Two other factors turned out to significantly influence ODR: total phosphorus as a proxy for the lake's trophic state and mean oxygen concentration in the respective depth layer. Our analysis points to the importance of nutrient reductions as effective management measures to improve and protect the oxygen status of such large and deep lakes.

The objective of this study was to assess the effects of land use and land cover and river discharge on water quality in the Migina catchment, southern Rwanda. Rainfall, discharge and water quality (total nitrogen, total phosphorus, total suspended solids, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, pH, and temperature) were measured in different periods from May 2009 to June 2013. In 2011, measurements were done at the outlets of 3 sub-catchments (Munyazi, Mukura and Akagera). Between May 2012 and May 2013 the measurements were done in 16 reaches of Munyazi dominated by rice, vegetables, grass/forest or ponds/reservoirs. Water quality was also measured during two rainfall events. Results showed seasonal trends in water quality associated with high water flows and farming activities. Across all sites, the total suspended solids related positively to discharge, increasing 2-8 times during high flow periods. Conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH decreased with increasing discharge, while total nitrogen and total phosphorus did not show a clear pattern. The total suspended solids concentrations were consistently higher downstream of reaches dominated by rice and vegetable farming. For total nitrogen and total phosphorus results were mixed, but suggesting higher concentration of total nitrogen and total phosphorus during the dry and early rainy (and farming) season, and then wash out during the rainy season, with subsequent dilution at the end of the rains. Rice and vegetable farming generate the transport of sediment as opposed to ponds/reservoir and grass/forest.

During the summers of 2012-2014, we collected and analyzed surface-water samples for water-quality indicators, including fecal indicator bacteria Escherichia coli, nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, carbon), suspended sediment concentration, pharmaceuticals, and hormones. Samples were collected upstream and downstream from different types of visitor use at weekly to biweekly intervals and during summer storms. We conducted a park-wide synoptic sampling campaign during summer 2014, and sampled upstream and downstream from meadows to evaluate the mitigating effect of meadows on water quality. At pack stock stream crossings, Escherichia coli concentrations were greater downstream from crossings than upstream (median downstream increase in Escherichia coli of three colony forming units 100 mL(-1)), with the greatest increases occurring during storms (median downstream increase in Escherichia coli of 32 CFU 100 mL(-1)). At backpacker use sites, hormones, and pharmaceuticals (e.g., insect repellent) were detected at downstream sites, and Escherichia coli concentrations were greater at downstream sites (median downstream increase in Escherichia coli of 1 CFU 100 mL(-1)). Differences in water quality downstream vs. upstream from meadows grazed by pack stock were not detectable for most water-quality indicators, however, Escherichia coli concentrations decreased downstream, suggesting entrapment and die-off of fecal indicator bacteria in meadows. Our results indicate that under current-use levels pack stock trail use and backpacker use are associated with detectable, but relatively minor, effects on water quality, which are most pronounced during storms.																	0364-152X	1432-1009				SEP	2017	60	3					526	543		10.1007/s00267-017-0899-z								WOS:000406954700013	28597051

Shifting paradigms in restoration of the world's coral reefs	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Many ecosystems around the world are rapidly deteriorating due to both local and global pressures, and perhaps none so precipitously as coral reefs. Management of coral reefs through maintenance (e.g., marine-protected areas, catchment management to improve water quality), restoration, as well as global and national governmental agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (e.g., the 2015 Paris Agreement) is critical for the persistence of coral reefs. Despite these initiatives, the health and abundance of corals reefs are rapidly declining and other solutions will soon be required. We have recently discussed options for using assisted evolution (i.e., selective breeding, assisted gene flow, conditioning or epigenetic programming, and the manipulation of the coral microbiome) as a means to enhance environmental stress tolerance of corals and the success of coral reef restoration efforts. The 2014-2016 global coral bleaching event has sharpened the focus on such interventionist approaches. We highlight the necessity for consideration of alternative (e.g., hybrid) ecosystem states, discuss traits of resilient corals and coral reef ecosystems, and propose a decision tree for incorporating assisted evolution into restoration initiatives to enhance climate resilience of coral reefs.

Multiple stressors threaten the imperiled coastal foundation species eelgrass (Zostera marina) in Chesapeake Bay, USA	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Interactions among global change stressors and their effects at large scales are often proposed, but seldom evaluated. This situation is primarily due to lack of comprehensive, sufficiently long-term, and spatially extensive datasets. Seagrasses, which provide nursery habitat, improve water quality, and constitute a globally important carbon sink, are among the most vulnerable habitats on the planet. Here, we unite 31 years of high-resolution aerial monitoring and water quality data to elucidate the patterns and drivers of eelgrass (Zostera marina) abundance in Chesapeake Bay, USA, one of the largest and most valuable estuaries in the world, with an unparalleled history of regulatory efforts. We show that eelgrass area has declined 29% in total since 1991, with wide-ranging and severe ecological and economic consequences. We go on to identify an interaction between decreasing water clarity and warming temperatures as the primary drivers of this trend. Declining clarity has gradually reduced eelgrass cover the past two decades, primarily in deeper beds where light is already limiting. In shallow beds, however, reduced visibility exacerbates the physiological stress of acute warming, leading to recent instances of decline approaching 80%. While degraded water quality has long been known to influence underwater grasses worldwide, we demonstrate a clear and rapidly emerging interaction with climate change. We highlight the urgent need to integrate a broader perspective into local water quality management, in the Chesapeake Bay and in the many other coastal systems facing similar stressors.

Airborne measurements may fill the gap, yet they are often hindered by the high cost and difficulty in deployment. Here we demonstrate the capacity of a low-cost, low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in assessing an intense phytoplankton (Phaeocystis globosa) bloom (chlorophyll concentrations ranged from 73 to 45.6 mg/m(3)) in Weitou Bay in the western Taiwan Strait. The UAV was equipped with a hyperspectral sensor to measure the water color with a footprint of 5 mat every 30 m distance along the flight track. A novel approach was developed to obtain remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) from the UAV at-sensor radiometric measurements. Compared with concurrent and co-located field measured R-rs (14 stations in total), the UAV-derived R-rs showed reasonable agreement with root mean square difference ranging 0.0028-0.0043 sr(-1) (relative difference similar to 20-32%) of such turbid waters for the six MODIS bands (412-667 nm). The magnitude of the bloom was further evaluated from the UAV-derived R-rs. For the bloom waters, the estimated surface chlorophyll a concentration (Chl) ranged 6-98 mg/m(3), which is 3-50 times of the Chl under normal conditions. This effort demonstrates for the first time a successful retrieval of both water color (i.e., R-rs) and Chl in a nearshore environment from UAV hyperspectral measurements, which advocates the use of UAVs for rapid assessment of water quality, especially for nearshore or difficult-to-reach waters, due to its flexibility, low cost, high spatial resolution, and sound accuracy.

J	Rodrigues, T; Alcantara, E; Watanabe, F; Imai, N				Rodrigues, Thanan; Alcantara, Enner; Watanabe, Fernanda; Imai, Nilton			Retrieval of Secchi disk depth from a reservoir using a semi-analytical scheme	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The mechanistic model reported in Lee et al. (2015) estimating the Secchi disk depth (Z(SD)) was applied to an oligo- to mesotrophic reservoir in Brazil. The model was originally validated with data covering lake, oceanic, and coastal waters; however, the model used the quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA) designed for optically deep waters as input and was applied to oceanic and coastal waters to derive absorption [a] and backscattering [b(b)] coefficients. The hypothesis is that the use of QAA(v5) (http://www.ioccg.org/groups/Software_OCA/QAA_v5.pdf) to estimate both a and b(b) (step M1) to retrieve K-d (step M2) and Z(SD) (step M3) will lead to errors caused by M1 preventing an accurate estimate in oligo- to mesotrophic water. To test this hypothesis, data collected in three field trips were used to apply the mechanistic model based on the spectral bands from OLI/Landsat-8, (often applied to oceanic and coastal waters), and multispectral instrument (MSI)/Sentinel-2 bands (applied to QAA designed for very turbid inland water). The impact of step M1 over steps M2 and M3 was analyzed by the error analysis. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for K-d using QAA(v5) ranged between 1035% and 19.76%, while the error using QAA(M14) varied between 12.68% and 28.29%. Regarding the errors of step M3 and applying QAA 5, the total root-mean-square difference (RMSD) varied from 055 to 1.18 m and MAPE ranged between 12.86% and 31.17%, while the RMSD ranged between 0.70 and 1.50 m and MAPE varied from 1433% to 39.13% when using QAA(M14). However, the result from QAA(v5) showed a better correlation with in situ data, although underestimating K-d and Z(SD). Therefore, a modified version of QAA(v5) (QAA(R17)) was evaluated. The results showed an improvement of K-d (MAPE ranging between 8.89% to 18.76%) and Z(SD) (RMSD ranging between 032 and 0.90 m and MAPE ranging between 8.65 and 19.75%), bringing the values close to the 1:1 line. The largest error was observed for the data of the second field trip, where the bio-optical properties showed a horizontal gradient along the reservoir. In addition, the magnitude of the remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) also varied depending on the water quality. Thus, with respect to Z(SD) mapping, this research showed that environments with a high variability in R-rs can limit the accurate estimation of inherent optical properties (IOPs) based on QAA(v5). Therefore, the limiting step of the model was attributed to M1, which means that the mechanistic model from Lee et al. (2015) can be considered an universal approach if M1 is modified based on the type of water. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, the nutrient and sediment reduction efficiencies of these novel designs are virtually unknown, and the possibility of increasing riverine flow in the Chesapeake Bay watershed associated with climate change this century necessitates an evaluation of their performance to develop and utilize those that optimize reductions in nutrient and sediment fluxes. We compare pre- and post-construction loads (total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and total suspended solids (TSS)) from RSCs (i.e., upland BMPs) and a SWC (i.e., stream restoration) constructed at the outflow of a highly developed watershed in the Coastal Plain physiographic province of Maryland. The largest of the two RSCs performed best in relation to expected nutrient and sediment reductions because of superior water retention capability. By the length of river reach restored, the SWC attained from 79 to 88% of its N reduction TMDL goal, but only 19 to 23 and 2.7 to 3.1% for TP and TSS, respectively; by watershed area, % attainments of TMDL goals were much lower. Results indicate that SWCs have the potential to curtail N loading from developed catchments, but additional water quality benefits may be limited. Climate change projections indicate that there will be an increased frequency of larger-volume storms that will result in an increase in stormflow runoff from urban areas, and increased pollutant loads will likely curtail potential gains made by efforts to achieve TMDL goals. Given the large-scale implementation of BMPs currently underway to accommodate the Chesapeake Bay TMDL, the restoration community needs to adopt a concerted strategy of building climate resilience into many types of urban BMPs to help attain and maintain loads at TMDL levels in anticipation of a progressively wetter climate throughout this century.																	1559-2723	1559-2731				SEP	2017	40	5					1227	1246		10.1007/s12237-017-0226-1								WOS:000406333700002

Developing a regional diatom index for assessment and monitoring of freshwater streams in sub-tropical Australia	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The use of borrowed indices to assess stream health has limitations and research suggests a need to develop more reliable regionally based indices that are sensitive to the relationship between taxa and environmental conditions. Implementing this is challenging in the Southern Hemisphere given the scarcity of diatom indices, specifically in sub-tropical areas. The purpose of this study was to develop a regionally based diatom index to assess freshwater lotic systems in sub-tropical eastern Australia and compare the results with borrowed indices to derive meaningful inferences on river health. A total of 119 epilithic diatom and water samples were collected during 2014-2015 from the Richmond River Catchment in Northern NSW Australia. Statistical analysis indicated that total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) were strong variables influencing the data set and subsequently TP was chosen as a nutrient proxy for the index. Analysis of diatoms resulted in TP sensitivity values (1-5) being assigned to 105 species with relative abundance of > 1% in the data set. These species were used to calculate the Richmond River Diatom Index (RRDI) for 45 sites within the Catchment. The index effectively scored sites along the environmental gradient with sites in the upper catchment generally scoring lower (healthier) than the mid and lower catchment sites. The index compared positively with both the Diatom Species Index for Australian Rivers (DSIAR) (r = 0.76) and the Trophic Diatom Index (TDI) (r = 0.65).

After water retention, the potential ecological risk of metal contamination in the riparian soils of the Miyun Reservoir (MYR) to water quality has raised public concern. The remobilization characteristics of cobalt (Co) in MYR riparian soils are still unknown. Riparian soil samples (considering five different land use types and three vertical elevations) were collected from the MYR prior to water impoundment. Total Co concentrations, soil properties, total Co in soil solution, Co chemical fractions and labile Co measured by diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) are applied to investigate the Co remobilization characteristics. The results showed that the total concentrations of Co (C-total-Co) were approximately equal to background values of Co in Beijing and China at most of the sites. The highest values of C-total-Co were observed at 140 m and 145 m in recreational land (S3), which may be influenced by the anthropogenic activities. No obvious differences in C-total-Co and DGT-labile Co (C-DGT-Co) were found with the variation of land use types and vertical elevations in the soils of the MYR. C-DGT-Co made up 9%-52% of the total dissolved Co, with an average value of 25%, indicating that Co in the soil solution was partially sustained by the solid phase. The highest C-DGT-Co were observed in grassland and mountain land, indicating that the previous intensive mining in the upstream areas of the MYR is responsible for the release of Co. The results of the sequential extraction showed that Co is mainly bound to the residual fraction. DGT-labile Co had no correlation with non-residual fractions measured by sequential extraction, but had a significantly positive relationship with C-DGT-Mn, indicating that Co trapped by DGT mainly came from the dissolution of MnOx. When the MYR riparian soils are submerged, a reducing environment will be formed. In this case, Co associated with MnOx may be also released into the water.

J	Windle, J; Rolfe, J; Pascoe, S				Windle, Jill; Rolfe, John; Pascoe, Sean			Assessing recreational benefits as an economic indicator for an industrial harbour report card	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Industrial harbours are a complex interface between environmental, economic and social systems. Trying to manage the social and economic needs of the community while maintaining the integrity of environmental ecosystems is complicated, as is the identification and evaluation of the various factors that underpin the drivers of economic, community and resource condition. An increasingly popular strategy to deal with the identification and evaluation challenges in complex human-environmental systems is to use a report card system which can be used as a summary assessment tool to monitor the health of aquatic ecosystems. To date though these have largely focused on environmental factors, and it is only very recently that attempts are being made to include social, cultural and economic indicators. There has been limited consensus in the selection of social and economic indicators applied in different aquatic report cards but as recreation is such an important activity, typically some measure of recreation benefit is included. However, there has been no commonality in the measures applied to assess its performance as an economic indicator. This paper is focused on the assessment of recreational benefits as an indicator of economic value in the report card for Gladstone Harbour in Queensland, Australia. It is the first aquatic health report card to include an assessment of the nonmarket value of recreation which makes it a more comprehensive indicator of economic value compared to other report cards based on measures of employment, participation or expenditure. There have now been three consecutive years of reporting (2014-2016) of the Gladstone Harbour report card, and the results indicate that the recreation index appears to be effective in monitoring changes over time.

Nutrient concentrations in tidal creeks as indicators of the water quality role of mangrove wetlands in Southwest Florida	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Coastal mangroves have the potential to improve the water quality of urban and rural runoff before it is discharged into adjacent coastal bays and oceans; but they also can be impaired by excessive pollutants from upstream. Nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen), salinity, and other water quality parameters were measured in five mangrove tidal creeks in different hydrogeomorphic and urbanization settings during high and low tides over a calendar year of wet (June and August 2015) and dry (February and April 2016) seasons in the Greater Naples Bay area in Southwest Florida, USA. Nutrient concentrations (ave. +/- error) in the tidal creeks were 0.055 +/- 0.008 mg-P/L for total phosphorus (TP) and 0.610 +/- 0.020 mg-N/L for total nitrogen (TN), with an average N:P ratio of 11.4:1. Average wet season TP (0.075 +/- 0.010 mg-P/L) was significantly higher than the dry season TP (0.033 +/- 0.003 mg-P/L; p < 0.01, f = 15.17, f(crit) = 3.89) and the average wet season TN (0.75 +/- 0.03 mg-N/L) was significantly higher than dry season TN (0.52 +/- 0.02 mg/L; p < 0.01, f = 64.14, f(crit) = 3.89), suggesting that urban stormwater runoff is directly or indirectly affecting the nutrient conditions in these mangroves. Significant differences in nutrient concentrations between low tide and high tide were not found for either TP (p = 0.43, f =.63, f(crit) = 3.88) or TN (p = 0.20, f = 1.66, f(crit) = 3.89). These differences were confirmed by a PCA and cluster analyses, which found differences to be seasonal. We could not conclude from these results whether these five mangrove wetlands were sources nor sinks of nutrients based simply on the measurement of nutrient concentrations. But we illustrated that nutrient concentrations were indicators of the mangroves' hydrogeomorphic settings, their tidal fluxes from Naples Bay, and the Bay's upstream watersheds, and less by direct urban runoff.																	1470-160X	1872-7034				SEP	2017	80						316	326		10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.05.043								WOS:000406436100033						
J	Bell, CD; Tague, CL; McMillan, SK				Bell, Colin D.; Tague, Christina L.; McMillan, Sara K.			A model of hydrology and water quality for stormwater control measures	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												Stormwater control measures (SCMs) are a management strategy that can reduce runoff and nitrogen (N) export from urban watersheds by creating an ecosystem that stores water and promotes N retention and removal. This work develops and explores a computer model that simulates the dynamic hydrologic and water quality processes of SCMs. Data from an SCM in Charlotte, NC was used for model calibration and validation. The hydrologic routines successfully simulated distributions of observed storm event outflow volumes and duration without calibration. Through calibration, the model reproduced observed distributions of event mean concentrations of both nitrate and ammonium in SCM outflow. Model sensitivity to varied air temperature, inflow N concentrations, and inflow volumes was determined. Scenario testing showed that deeper SCMs have greater inorganic N removal efficiencies because they have more stored volume of relatively N-deplete water, and therefore have a greater capacity to dilute relatively N-rich inflow.

Chronic toxicity of five metals to the polar marine microalga Cryothecomonas armigera - Application of a new bioassay	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												The paucity of ecotoxicological data for Antarctic organisms is impeding the development of region specific water quality guidelines. To address this limitation, toxicity testing protocols need to be developed to account for the unique physiology of polar organisms, in particular their slow growth rates. In this study, a toxicity test protocol was developed to investigate the toxicities of five metals to the polar marine microalga Cryothecomonas armigera. The concentrations which reduced population growth rate by 10% (EC10) after 24-d for Cu, Pb, Zn, Cd and Ni were 21.6, 152, 366, 454, and 1220 mu g.L-1, respectively. At the concentrations used in tests, only Cu and Ni were sufficiently toxic to enable the derivation of EC50 values of 63.1 and 1570 mu g.L-1 respectively. All metals affected C armigera's cellular physiology including cellular chlorophyll a fluorescence, cell complexity and size, and lipid concentrations. However, no changes to cellular membrane permeability were observed. The reduction in cellular lipid concentrations was a more sensitive indicator of toxicity for Cd, Ni, and Pb than growth rate inhibition, with EC10 values of 89, 894, and 11 mu g.L-1, respectively, highlighting its potential as a sensitive measure of metal toxicity.

A.; Paterson, Eric; McRoberts, Colin W.; Stutter, Marc			Potential tracers for tracking septic tank effluent discharges in watercourses	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Septic tank effluent (STE) contributes to catchment nutrient and pollutant loads. To assess the role of STE discharges in impairment of surface water, it is essential to identify the sources of pollution by tracing contaminants in watercourses. We examined tracers that were present in STE to establish their potential for identifying STE contamination in two stream systems (low and high dilution levels) against the background of upstream sources. The studied tracers were microbial, organic matter fluorescence, caffeine, artificial sweeteners and effluent chemical concentrations. The results revealed that tracer concentration ratios Cl/EC, Cl/NH4-N, Cl/TN, Cl/TSS, Cl/turbidity, Cl/total coliforms, Cl/sucralose, Cl/saccharin and Cl/Zn had potential as tracers in the stream with low dilution level (P < 0.05). Fluorescence spectroscopy could detect STE inputs through the presence of the tryptophan-like peak, but was limited to water courses with low level of dilution and was positively correlated with stream Escherichia coil (E. coil) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP). The results also suggested that caffeine and artificial sweeteners can be suitable tracers for effluent discharge in streams with low and high level of dilution. Caffeine and saccharin were positively correlated with faecal coliforms, E. coil, total P and SRP, indicating their potential to trace discharge of a faecal origin and to be a marker for effluent P. Caffeine and SRP had similar attenuation behaviour in the receiving stream waters suggesting caffeine's potential role as a surrogate indicator for the behaviour of P downstream of effluent inputs. Taken together, results suggest that a single tracer alone was not sufficient to evaluate STE contamination of watercourses, but rather a combination of multiple chemical and physical tracing approaches should be employed. A multiple tracing approach would help to identify individual and cumulative STE inputs that pose risks to stream waters in order to prioritise and target effective mitigation measures.

Hence it is important to develop an eco-friendly and cost effective technology to treat the dyes contaminated wastewater. In this research, an integrated approach of electrochemical oxidation (EO) and biodegradation process (BP) was studied of methyl red (MR) dye. In EO, RuO2-IrO2-TiO2 is used as anode and titanium mesh electrode as cathode. This was followed by BP of the treated EO effluent. Various parameters viz., pH (5-10), sodium chloride con centrations (NaCI) (1-5 g L-1) and current density (10-30 mA cm(2)) were optimized. The results of the EO showed 99.96% of MR decolorization within 10 min at pH of 5, NaCI of 2 g L-1 and current density of 30 mA cm2. The EO treated MR was further treated by BP Pseudomonas stutzeri MN1, Acinetobacter baumannii MN3 and mixed consortia of MN1 and MN3. The out of three treatments, the results of mixed consortium BP showed 90% removal of COD at the end of 24 h. The phytotoxic evaluation using Vigna radiate seeds confirmed the toxicity of untreated MR solution, whereas, 100% germination was observed in treated (biodegraded) MR solution. Overall these results evidenced that MR dye was completely decolorized and mineralized by EO and BP within 10 min and 24 h respectively. Hence, this integrated approach can be used as an effective degradation method to treat dyes in the textile industry. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Heritier, L; Meistertzheim, AL; Verneau, O				Heritier, Laurent; Meistertzheim, Anne-Leila; Verneau, Olivier			Oxidative stress biomarkers in the Mediterranean pond turtle (Mauremys leprosa) reveal contrasted aquatic environments in Southern France	CHEMOSPHERE												Increasing anthropogenic activities, like agricultural practices, constitute the main causes of the loss of water quality and disruption of freshwater ecosystems. High concentrations of pesticides, as shown under experimental conditions, can indeed impact freshwater animals. In Southern France, especially in the Pyrenees-Orientales department, because agricultural activities are mainly based on fruit crops and vineyards, glyphosate and AMPA were detected in some watercourses. Thereby we investigated the effects of degraded waters on the physiology of the endemic endangered freshwater species, namely the Mediterranean pond turtle Mauremys leprosa, in contrasted environments along the same rivers on the one hand and between different rivers on the other. We measured the activity and gene expression of two enzymes involved in the oxidative detoxification processes, namely the Catalase and the Superoxide dismutase. We showed significant variations in the Catalase gene expression and activity within turtles of the Fosseille River depending of their location, i.e. upstream or downstream of the wastewater treatment plants (WTP). Because agricultural environments are similar all along this river, they can no be longer considered as the unique source of turtle stress. The processed waters discharged by the WTP,which contribute to watercourses degradation, could therefore considerably impact the biodiversity of the freshwater environments.

Altered development, oxidative stress and DNA damage in Leptodactylus chaquensis (Anura: Leptodactylidae) larvae exposed to poultry litter	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												Poultry litter (PL), which is usually used as organic fertilizer, is a source of nutrients, metals, veterinary pharmaceuticals and bacterial pathogens, which, through runoff, may end up in the nearest aquatic ecosystems. In this study, Leptodactylus chaquensis at different development stages (eggs, larval stages 28 and 31 here referred to as stages I, II and III respectively) were exposed to PL test sediments as follows: 6.25% (T1), 12.5% (T2); 25% (T3); 50% (T4); 75% (T5); 100% PL (T6) and to dechlorinated water as control. Larval survival, development endpoints (growth rate -GR-, development rate -DR-, abnormalities), antioxidant enzyme activities (Catalase -CAT- and Glutathione-S-Transferase -GST-), and genotoxic effect (DNA damage index by the Comet assay) were analyzed at different times. In stage I, no egg eclosion was observed in treatments T3-T6, and 50% of embryo mortality was recorded after 24 h of exposure to T2. In stages II and III, mortality in treatments T3-T6 reached 100% between 24 and 48 h. In the three development stages evaluated, the DR and GR were higher in controls than in PL treatments (T1, T2), except for those Tl-treated larvae of stage II. Larvae of stage I showed five types of morphological abnormalities, being diamond body shape and lateral displacement of the intestine the most prevalent in T1, whereas larvae of stages II and III presented lower prevalence of abnormalities. In stage I, CAT activity was similar to that of control (p > 0.05), whereas it was higher in T1- and T2-treated larvae of stages II and III than controls (p < 0.05). In stages I and III, GST activity was similar to that of controls (p > 0.05), whereas it was inhibited in Tl-treated larvae of stage II (p < 0.05). T1- and T2-treated larvae of stages II and III caused higher DNA damage respect to controls (p < 0.05), varying from medium to severe damage (comet types II, III and IV). These results showed that PL treatments altered development and growth and induced oxidative stress and DNA damage, resulting ecotoxic for L. chaquensis larvae.																	0147-6513	1090-2414				SEP	2017	143						62	71		10.1016/j.ecoenv.2017.05.007								WOS:000404095100009	28505481

Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and wastewater ponds, Part I: Mallard ducks overwintering at a northern wastewater treatment pond	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												In northern urban areas, wastewater treatment ponds (WWTPs) may provide a thermal refuge during winter (-10 degrees C) that is used by normally migratory mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). On the ponds, mallards may experience stress due to crowding, or through the ingestion of WWTP water, be exposed to a diverse array of synthetic chemicals, which may have adverse health effects. Photographic sampling was used to assess mallard sex ratios and behavioural patterns throughout the late winter on wastewater ponds in Edmonton, Canada. The WWTP mallard population was large ( > 1000 birds), but temporally variable and consistently male-dominated. Locomotion and dabbling were the primary behaviors observed; aggression was rarely observed, which suggests crowding stress was low or absent. Mallard abundance tended to be higher at lower air temperatures, suggesting that WWTP ponds acted as a thermal refuge. Stable isotope analysis of carbon and nitrogen from duck feces and potential food sources indicated that mallards were not feeding at the site, or on invertebrates or select waste grain from offsite. Rather, ducks either consumed an undetermined food source or were feeding very little. Taken together, the data suggest that winter use of northern WWTP ponds may serve as an alternative to migration, whether this strategy benefits or harms mallards likely depends on winter severity, and not on WWTP pond characteristics or water quality.

Fingerlings of rohu were cultured in indoor biofloc tanks in light-limited condition for 16 weeks with daily addition of molasses as carbon source to maintain the C/N ratio at 15. Different water quality parameters were measured at weekly interval. Growth, survival and welfare indices including stress and immunological status were measured after the end of the experimental period. Factor analysis using water quality variables indicated ammonia immobilization by heterotrophic bacteria, rather than nitrification, as the dominant mechanism influencing ammonia removal in the biofloc system. Ammonia immobilization was concomitant with microbial biomass production, as also revealed through factor analysis. The biofloc culture system enhanced the growth of rohu significantly than the control fish. As a measure of stress, the serum glucose content did not differ significantly between the fish cultured in biofloc and control system. Among the immunological parameters, respiratory burst and alkaline phosphatase activity showed significant enhancement in fish grown in biofloc system than the control. However, myeloperoxidase activity and total serum protein content did not show any statistically significant difference between biofloc and control system. The enhanced growth and welfare of the cultured fish may be attributed to in situ maintenance of water quality within the biofloc system and presence of microbial floc. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Ding, WJ; Cheng, SA; Yu, LL; Huang, HB				Ding, Weijun; Cheng, Shaoan; Yu, Liliang; Huang, Haobin			Effective swine wastewater treatment by combining microbial fuel cells with flocculation	CHEMOSPHERE												Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) provide a cost-effective method for treating swine wastewater treatment and simultaneously producing electricity, yet they need to be combined with other wastewater treatment processes to improve the effluent water quality. In this paper, we constructed single-chamber air-cathode MFCs with a compact configuration for nitrogen and COD removal and high electricity production and combined them with a low-cost flocculation process to discharge higher quality wastewater. We show that MFCs could remove ammonia at a rate of 269.2 +/- 0.5 g m(-3) d(-1) (99.1 +/- 0.1% ammonia removal efficiency) with a maximum power density of 37.5 W m(-3) and 21.6% of coulombic efficiency at a 40:60 ratio of raw swine wastewater to denitrification effluent of swine wastewater. Up to 82.5 +/- 0.5% COD could be removed with MFCs, from 2735 +/- 15 mg L-1 to 480 +/- 15 mg L-1, and flocculation further reduced levels to 90 1 mg L-1 for a 96.6 +/- 0.2% overall COD removal efficiency of the combination technology. Cost analysis of the combined MFC and flocculation process showed a net economic benefit of $ 0.026 m(-3). In summary, this novel combination wastewater treatment method provides an effective way to treat swine wastewater to low pollutant levels in the effluent at low cost (a net gain).

CHEMOSPHERE												The possible environmental impact of the recent increase in use of a group of technology-critical elements (Nb, Ta, Ga, In, Ge and Te) is analysed by reviewing published concentration profiles in environmental archives (ice cores, ombrotrophic peat bogs, freshwater sediments and moss surveys) and evaluating temporal trends in surface waters. No increase has so far been recorded. The low potential direct emissions of these elements, resulting from their absolute low production levels, make it unlikely that the increasing use of these elements in modern technology has any noticeable effect on their environmental concentrations on a global scale. This holds particularly true for those of these elements that are probably emitted in relatively high amounts from other human activities (i.e., coal combustion and non-ferrous smelting), such as In, the most studied element of the group.

This study describes a fast and efficient chemical hazard screening strategy for characterising trace levels of polar organic contaminants in water matrices, based on liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry with post-acquisition 'case-control' data processing. This method allowed for a rapid response time of less than 24 h for the screening of target, suspect and non-target unknown chemicals via direct injection analysis, and a second, more sensitive analysis option requiring sample pre-concentration. The method was validated by fortifying samples with a range of pesticides, pharmaceuticals and personal care products (n = 46); with >90% of target compounds positively screened in samples at 1 ng mL(-1), and 46% at 0.1 ng mL(-1) when analysed via direct injection. To simulate a contamination event samples were fortified with compounds not present in the commercial library (designated 'non-target compounds'; fipronil and fenitrothion), tentatively identified at 0.2 and 1 ng mL(-1), respectively; and a compound not included in any known commercial library or public database (designated 'unknown' compounds; 8C1(-) perfluorooctanesulfonic acid), at 0.8 ng mL(-1). The method was applied to two 'real-case' scenarios: (1) the assessment of drinking water safety during a high-profile event in Brisbane, Australia; and (2) to screen treated, re-circulated drinking water and pre-treated (raw) water. The validated workflow was effective for rapid prioritisation and screening of suspect and non-target potential hazards at trace levels, and could be applied to a wide range of matrices and investigations where comparison of organic contaminants between an affected and control site and or timeframe is warranted.

Measurement differences between turbidity instruments, and their implications for suspended sediment concentration and load calculations: A sensor inter-comparison study	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The use of turbidity for indicating environmentally detrimental levels of suspended and colloidal matter in freshwater systems, and for defining acceptable water quality standards in national and European drinking water regulations, is well established. Turbidity is therefore frequently adopted as a surrogate for suspended sediment concentrations (SSC), or as a relative and objective measure of water clarity in monitoring programmes. Through systematic, controlled experimentation, we tested the response of 12 commercially available turbidity sensors, of various designs, to gauge their measurement consistency when benchmarked against pre-prepared sediment suspensions of known SSC. Results showed that despite calibration to a Formazin standard, sensor responses to identical SSC solutions (in the range of 20 -1000 mg L-1) varied considerably. For a given SSC, up to five-fold differences in recorded turbidity were recorded across the tested instruments. Furthermore, inconsistent measurements were identified across instruments, regardless of whether they operated using backscatter or side-scatter optical principles. While the findings may have implications for compliance with turbidity-based water quality standards, they are less likely to be an issue when turbidity is being used as a surrogate for SSC, provided that instrument use remains constant and that instrument drift is not an issue. In this study, a field comparison of a subset of four study sensors showed that despite very different absolute turbidity readings for a given SSC, well correlated and reliable turbidity - SSC ratings were established (as evidenced by r(2) coefficients from 0.92 to 0.98). This led to reasonably consistent suspended sediment load estimates of between 64.7 and 70.8 tonnes for a rainfall event analysed. This study highlights the potential for issues to arise when interpreting water turbidity datasets that are often assumed to be comparable, in that measurement inconsistency of the type reported here may remain unknown to water resource decision makers and practitioners.

Allen			Reeling in the damages: Harmful algal blooms' impact on Lake Erie's recreational fishing industry	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Lake Erie is one of the most valuable natural resources in the United States, providing billions of dollars in benefits each year to recreationalists, homeowners and local governments. The ecosystem services provided by Lake Erie, however, are under threat due to harmful algal blooms. This paper provides recreational damage estimates using spatially and temporally varying algae measures and monthly fishing permit sales collected between 2011 and 2014. Results indicate that fishing license sales drop between 10% and 13% when algal conditions surpass the World Health's Organization's moderate health risk advisory threshold of 20,000 cyanobacteria cells/mL. For Lake Erie adjacent counties experiencing a large, summer-long algal bloom, this would result in approximately 3600 fewer fishing licenses issued and approximately $2.25 million to $5.58 million in lost fishing expenditures. Our results show a discrete jump in reduced angling activity upon crossing this threshold, with limited additional impacts associated with more severe algal blooms. This suggests that policies aimed at eliminating, rather than mitigating, algal levels are most beneficial to the Ohio angling industry. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A macrophyte bioassessment approach linking taxon-specific tolerance and abundance in north temperate lakes	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Bioassessment methods are critically needed to evaluate and monitor lake ecological condition. Aquatic macrophytes are good candidate indicators, but few lake bioassessment methods developed in North America use them. The few macrophyte bioassessment methods that do exist suffer from problems related to subjectivity and discernibility along disturbance gradients. We developed and tested a bioassessment approach for 462 north temperate lakes. The approach links macrophyte abundance to lake ecological condition via estimates of taxon-specific abundance-weighted tolerance to anthropogenic disturbance. Using variables related to eutrophication, urban development and agriculture, we calculated abundance-weighted tolerance ranges for 59 macrophyte taxa and clustered them according to their tolerance to anthropogenic disturbance. We also created a composite index of anthropogenic disturbance using 20 variables related to population density, land cover and water chemistry. We used a statistical approach to set ecological condition thresholds based on the observed abundance of sensitive, moderately tolerant and tolerant taxa in each lake. The resulting lake condition categories were usually stable across multiple survey events and largely agreed with condition rankings assigned using expert judgment. We suggest using, this macrophyte bioassessment method for federal water quality reports, restoration and management on north temperate lakes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Understanding the relationships between water quality, recreational fishing practices, and human health in Phoenix, Arizona	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Across the United States, recreational freshwater fisheries are not only an important leisure activity, but can also provide a relatively inexpensive source of protein in local diets. However, recreational freshwater fisheries are generally not well-monitored in terms of fish consumption vs. catch and release, nor are all recreational surface waters regularly monitored for the presence of potentially harmful contaminants in water or fishes. In six urban lakes that support recreational fisheries in Phoenix, Arizona, a majority of surveyed anglers reported eating recreationally caught fishes, even though they thought the water might be polluted. Surface water samples collected from the six urban recreational fishery lakes showed varying levels of organic contaminants, including pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, poly cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and phthalates. As many Phoenix urban recreational fisheries lakes and ponds are located in low income and high minority neighborhoods, the results of this pilot study could be used to inform urban fisheries management and other agencies of the potential need for fish consumption advisories, inform actions to improve water quality in urban lakes and ponds that support urban fisheries, and support further research and monitoring, in order to reduce potential risks to public health.

A major challenge is overcoming the associated costs to agricultural producers. We integrate spatially-explicit models of ecosystem processes with agricultural commodity production models to analyze the biophysical and economic consequences of alternative land use and land management patterns to achieve Total Maximum Daily Loads targets in a proto-typical agricultural watershed. We apply these models to find patterns that maximize water quality objectives for given levels of foregone agricultural profit. We find it is possible to reduce baseline watershed phosphorus loads by similar to 20% and sediment loads by similar to 18% without any reduction in agricultural profits. Our results indicate that meeting more stringent targets will result in substantial economic loss. However, when we add the social benefits from water quality improvement and carbon sequestration to private agricultural net returns we find that water quality improvements up to 50% can be obtained at no loss to societal returns. The cost of meeting water quality targets will vary over time as commodity and ecosystem service, prices fluctuate. If crop prices drop or the value of ecosystem services increase, then achieving higher water quality goals will be less costly. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Modelling of Escherichia coli concentrations in bathing water at microtidal coasts	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Monitoring of the quality of bathing water in line with the European Commission bathing water directive (Directive 2006/7/EC) is a significant economic expense for those countries with great lengths of coastline. In this study a numerical model based on finite elements is generated whose objective is partially substituting the microbiological analysis of the quality of coastal bathing waters. According to a study of the concentration of Escherichia coli in 299 Spanish Mediterranean beaches, it was established that the most important variables that influence the concentration are: monthly sunshine hours, mean monthly precipitation, number of goat cattle heads, population density, presence of Posidonia oceanica, UV, urbanization level, type of sediment, wastewater treatment ratio, salinity, distance to the nearest discharge, and wave height perpendicular to the coast. Using these variables, a model with an absolute error of 10.6 +/- 1.5 CFU/100 ml is achieved. With this model, if there are no significant changes in the beach environment and the variables remain more or less stable, the concentration of E. coli in bathing water can be determined, performing only specific microbiological analyses to verify the water quality.

Biofilm structures (EPS and bacterial communities) in drinking water distribution systems are conditioned by hydraulics and influence discolouration	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												High-quality drinking water from treatment works is degraded during transport to customer taps through the Drinking Water Distribution System (DWDS). Interactions occurring at the pipe wall-water interface are central to this degradation and are often dominated by complex microbial biofilms that are not well understood. This study uses novel application of confocal microscopy techniques to quantify the composition of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and cells of DWDS biofilms together with concurrent evaluation of the bacterial community. An internationally unique, full-scale, experimental DWDS facility was used to investigate the impact of three different hydraulic patterns upon biofilms and subsequently assess their response to increases in shear stress, linking biofilms to water quality impacts such as discolouration. Greater flow variation during growth was associated with increased cell quantity but was inversely related to EPS-to-cell volume ratios and bacterial diversity. Discolouration was caused and EPS was mobilised during flushing of all conditions. Ultimately, biofilms developed under low-varied flow conditions had lowest amounts of biomass, the greatest EPS volumes per cell and the lowest discolouration response. This research shows that the interactions between hydraulics and biofilm physical and community structures are complex but critical to managing biofilms within ageing DWDS infrastructure to limit water quality degradation and protect public health.

Remote sensing of CDOM and Chla concentrations for inland lakes is often limited by low spatial resolution. The newly launched Sentinel-2 satellite is equipped with high spatial resolution (10, 20, and 60 m). Empirical band ratio models were developed to derive CDOM and Chla concentrations in Lake Huron. The leave-one-out cross-validation method was used for model calibration and validation. The best CDOM retrieval algorithm is a B3/B5 model with accuracy coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.884, root-mean-squared error (RMSE) = 0.731 m(-1), relative root-meansquared error (RRMSE) = 28.02%, and bias = -0.1 m(-1). The best Chla retrieval algorithm is a B5/B4 model with accuracy R-2 = 0.49, RMSE = 9.972 mg/m(3), RRMSE = 48.47%, and bias = -0.116 mg/m(3). Neural network models were further implemented to improve inversion accuracy. The applications of the two best band ratio models to Sentinel-2 imagery with 10 m x 10 m pixel size presented the high potential of the sensor for monitoring water quality of inland lakes.

Climate Change Impacts on Harmful Algal Blooms in US Freshwaters: A Screening-Level Assessment	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CyanoHABs) have serious adverse effects on human and environmental health. Herein, we developed a modeling framework that predicts the effect of climate change on cyanobacteria concentrations in large reservoirs in the contiguous U.S. The framework, which uses climate change projections from five global circulation models, two greenhouse gas emission scenarios, and two cyanobacterial growth scenarios, is unique in coupling climate projections with a hydrologic/water quality network model of the contiguous United States. Thus, it generates both regional and nationwide projections useful as a screening-level assessment of climate impacts on CyanoHAB prevalence as well as potential lost recreation days and associated economic value. Our projections indicate that CyanoHAB concentrations are likely to increase primarily due to water temperature increases tempered by increased nutrient levels resulting from changing demographics and climatic impacts on hydrology that drive nutrient transport. The combination of these factors results in the mean number of days of CyanoHAB occurrence ranging from about 7 days per year per waterbody under current conditions, to 16-23 days in 2050 and 18-39 days in 2090. From a regional perspective, we find the largest increases in CyanoHAB occurrence in the Northeast U.S., while the greatest impacts to recreation, in terms of costs, are in the Southeast.

Quantitative CrAssphage PCR Assays for Human Fecal Pollution Measurement	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Environmental waters are monitored for fecal pollution to protect public health and water resources. Traditionally, general fecal-indicator bacteria are used; however, they cannot distinguish human fecal waste from other animal pollution sources. Recently, a novel bacteriophage, crAssphage, was discovered by metagenomic data mining and reported to be abundant in and closely associated with human fecal waste. To confirm bioinformatic predictions, 384 primer sets were designed along the length of the crAssphage genome. Based on initial screening, two novel crAssphage qPCR assays (CPQ_056 and CPQ_064) were designed and evaluated in reference fecal samples and water matrices. The assays exhibited high specificities (98.6%) when tested against an animal fecal reference library, and crAssphage genetic markers were highly abundant in raw sewage and sewage impacted water samples. In addition, CPQ_056 and CPQ_064 performance was compared to HF183/BacR287 and HumM2 assays in paired experiments. Findings confirm that viral crAssphage qPCR assays perform at a similar level to well-established bacterial human-associated fecal-source-identification approaches. These new viral-based assays could become important water quality management and research tools.

Organic Carbon Amendments for Enhanced Biological Attenuation of Trace Organic Contaminants in Biochar-Amended Stormwater Biofilters	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												This study sought to evaluate how dissolved organic carbon (DOC) affects attenuation of trace organic contaminants (TOrCs) in biochar-amended stormwater biofilters. It was hypothesized that (1) DOC-augmented runoff would demonstrate enhanced TOrC biodegradation and (2) biochar-amended sand bearing DOC-cultivated biofilms would achieve enhanced TOrC attenuation due to sorptive retention and biodegradation. Microcosm and column experiments were conducted utilizing actual runoff, DOC from straw and compost, and a suite of TOrCs. Biodegradation of TOrCs in runoff was more enhanced by compost DOC than straw DOC (particularly for atrazine, prometon, benzotriazole, and fipronil). 16S rRNA gene quantification and sequencing revealed that growth-induced microbial community changes were, among replicates, most consistent for compost-augmented microcosms and least consistent for raw runoff microcosms. Compost DOC most robustly enhanced utilization of TOrCs as carbon substrates, possibly due to higher residual nutrient levels upon TOrC exposure. Sand columns containing just 0.5 wt % biochar maintained sorptive TOrC retention in the presence of compost-DOC-cultivated biofilms, and TOrC removal was further enhanced by biological activity. Overall, these results suggest that coamendment with biochar and compost may robustly enhance TOrC attenuation in stormwater biofilters, a finding of significance for efforts to mitigate the impacts of runoff on water quality.

In vitro bioassays with limited key toxicological end points have been shown to be suitable to evaluate mixtures of organic pollutants in wastewater and recycled water. Omics approaches such as transcriptomics can monitor biological effects at the genome scale. However, few studies have applied omics approach in the assessment of mixtures of organic micropollutants. Here, an omics approach was developed for profiling bioactivity of 10 water samples ranging from wastewater to drinking water in human cells by a reduced human transcriptome (RHT) approach and dose-response modeling. Transcriptional expression of 1200 selected genes were measured by an Ampliseq technology in two cell lines, HepG2 and MCF7, that were exposed to eight serial dilutions of each sample. Concentration-effect models were used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and to calculate effect concentrations (ECs) of DEGs, which could be ranked to investigate low dose response. Furthermore, molecular pathways disrupted by different samples were evaluated by Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. The ability of RHT for representing bioactivity utilizing both HepG2 and MCF7 was shown to be comparable to the results of previous in vitro bioassays. Finally, the relative potencies of the mixtures indicated by RHT analysis were consistent with the chemical profiles of the samples. RHT analysis with human cells provides an efficient and cost-effective approach to benchmarking mixture of micropollutants and may offer novel insight into the assessment of mixture toxicity in water.

J	Packett, R				Packett, Robert			Rainfall contributes similar to 30% of the dissolved inorganic nitrogen exported from a southern Great Barrier Reef river basin	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												A study was conducted to estimate how much of the annual load of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) from Great Barrier Reef (GBR) river basins could come from rainfall. Results suggest rainfall contributed similar to 37% of the average annual DIN load from the Fitzroy Basin over three wet seasons. Rainfall DIN contribution at plot to sub-catchment scale ranged from 5 to > 100% for study sites in the Fitzroy and Pioneer Basins. An estimate using measured and modelled data indicates similar to 28% of the longer-term average annual DIN load from the entire GBR catchment may originate from rainfall. These estimates may affect current GBR management and water quality targets. Numerous studies predict increases in atmospheric nitrogen pollution from Asia via fossil fuel combustion and more frequent severe La Nina events via global warming. Future GBR rainfall chemistry data may be required for assessing catchment management outcomes and regional trends in atmospheric DIN deposition.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				AUG 15	2017	121	1-2					16	31		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.05.008								WOS:000407529200014	28521935

This is the fifth time that this study has been conducted as an initiative of the European Sea Ports Organisation (ESPO). The data and results are derived from the Self-Diagnosis Method (SDM), a concise checklist against which port managers can self-assess the environmental management of their port in relation to the performance of the EcoPorts membership. The SDM tool was developed in the framework of the ECOPORTS project (2002-2005) and it is managed by ESPO. A total number of 91 ports from 20 different European Maritime States contributed to this evaluation. The main results are that air quality remains as the top environmental priority of the respondent ports, followed by energy consumption and noise. In terms of environmental management, the study confirms that key components are commonly implemented in the majority of European ports. 94% of contributing ports have a designated environmental manager, 92% own an environmental policy and 82% implement an environmental monitoring program. Waste is identified as the most monitored issue in ports (80%), followed by energy consumption (73%) and water quality (70%).

Significance of beach geomorphology on fecal indicator bacteria levels	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Large databases of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) measurements are available for coastal waters. With the assistance of satellite imagery, we illustrated the power of assessing data for many sites by evaluating beach features such as geomorphology, distance from rivers and canals, presence of piers and causeways, and degree of urbanization coupled with the enterococci FIB database for the state of Florida. We found that beach geomorphology was the primary characteristic associated with enterococci levels that exceeded regulatory guidelines. Beaches in close proximity to marshes or within bays had higher enterococci exceedances in comparison to open coast beaches. For open coast beaches, greater enterococci exceedances were associated with nearby rivers and higher levels of urbanization. Piers and causeways had a minimal contribution, as their effect was often overwhelmed by beach geomorphology. Results can be used to understand the potential causes of elevated enterococci levels and to promote public health.

J	Karbassi, AR; Marefat, A				Karbassi, Abdolreza R.; Marefat, Ali			The impact of increased oxygen conditions on heavy metal flocculation in the Sefidrud estuary	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Similar to natural filters, estuaries are capable of removing considerable amounts of heavy metal from rivers that flow into saline water environments by turning the metal into flocs. The research objective was to investigate the self-purification potential of estuaries in removal of metal by flocculation processes. Hence, flocculation of metal was Studied experimentally in 5 aquaria with varying salinity levels. Subsequently, experiment was repeated while dissolved oxygen increased. Results indicated that at higher dissolved oxygen, the flocculation rates of Mn, Ni, and Pb increased by 9%, 20%, and 26%, respectively. However, Zn and Cu showed 23% and 26% of decrease in flocculation rate, respectively. In the analysis of the relationship between oxidation reduction potential and estuarine water quality it was found that ORP escalated with an increase in the dissolved oxygen. This finding suggests that ORP can be used to govern the potential of flocculation processes at estuarine zone.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				AUG 15	2017	121	1-2					168	175		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.06.011								WOS:000407529200030	28601438

Effect of nutrient pollution on dinoflagellate cyst assemblages across estuaries of the NW Atlantic	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												We analyzed surface sediments from 23 northeast USA estuaries, from Maine to Delaware, and nine estuaries from Prince Edward Island (PEI, Canada), to determine how dinoflagellate cyst assemblages varied with nutrient loading. Overall the abundance of cysts of heterotrophic dinoflagellates correlates with modeled nitrogen loading, but there were also regional signals. On PEI cysts of Gymnodiniwn microreticulatum characterized estuaries with high nitrogen loading while the sediments of eutrophic Boston Harbor were characterized by high abundances of Spinifentes spp. In Delaware Bay and the Delaware Inland Bays Polysphaeridiwn zohatyi correlated with higher temperatures and nutrient loading. This is the first study to document the dinoflagellate cyst eutrophication signal at such a large geographic scale in estuaries, thus confirming their value as indicators of water quality change and anthropogenic impact.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				AUG 15	2017	121	1-2					339	351		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.06.024								WOS:000407529200049	28633948

The heterogeneity of the tropic-functional pattern of protozoan communities and its environmental drivers were studied in coastal waters of the Yellow Sea during a 1-year cycle. Samples were collected using the glass slide method at four stations within a water pollution gradient. A second-stage matrix-based analysis was used to summarize spatial variation in the annual pattern of the functional structure. A clustering analysis revealed significant variability in the trophic-functional pattern among the four stations during the 1-year cycle. The heterogeneity in the trophic-functional pattern of the communities was significantly related to changes in environmental variables, particularly ammonium-nitrogen and nitrates, alone or in combination with dissolved oxygen. These results suggest that the heterogeneity in annual patterns of protozoan trophic-functional structure may reflect water quality status in coastal ecosystems.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				AUG 15	2017	121	1-2					400	403		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.06.012								WOS:000407529200056	28624358

In this study, ten areas located along the western coast of the Korean Peninsula are investigated with respect to remotely sensed water quality indicators derived from NASA MODIS aboard of the satellite Aqua. We found that there was a strong seasonal trend with spatial heterogeneity. In specific, a strong six-month phase-lag was found between chlorophyll-a and total suspended solid owing to their inversed seasonality, which could be explained by different dynamics and environmental settings. Chlorophyll-a concentration seemed to be dominantly influenced by temperature, while total suspended solid was largely governed by local tidal forcing and bottom topography. This study demonstrated the potential and applicability of satellite products in coastal management, and highlighted find that remote-sensing would be a promising tool in resolving orthogonality of large spatio-temporal scale variabilities when combining with proper time series analyses.

In that context, a key difference between urban and natural areas lies in recharge evaluation. A large number of studies have been published since the 1990s that evaluate recharge in urban areas, with no specific methodology. Most of these methods show that there are generally higher rates of recharge in urban settings than in natural settings. Methods such as mixing ratios or ground water modeling can be used to better estimate the relative importance of different sources of recharge and may prove to be a good tool for total recharge evaluation. However, accurate evaluation of this input is difficult. The objective is to present a methodology to help overcome those difficulties, and which will allow us to quantify the variability in space and time of the recharge into aquifers in urban areas. Recharge calculations have been initially performed by defining and applying some analytical equations, and validation has been assessed based on groundwater flow and solute transport modeling. This methodology is applicable to complex systems by considering temporal variability of allwater sources. This allows managers of urban groundwater to evaluate the relative contribution of different recharge sources at a city scale by considering quantity and quality factors. The methodology is applied to the assessment of recharge sources in the Barcelona city aquifers. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Wang, XO; Tian, YM; Zhao, XH				Wang, Xiaoou; Tian, Yimei; Zhao, Xinhua			The influence of dual-substrate-layer extensive green roofs on rainwater runoff quantity and quality	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												This study investigates the ability of dual-substrate-layer extensive green roofs to retain rainwater and reduce pollutant leaching. The substrates in dual-substrate-layer green roofs consist of an upper organic nutrition layer for plant growth and a lower inorganic adsorption layer for water retention and pollutant reduction. One traditional single-substrate-layer extensive green roof was built for comparison with dual-substrate-layer green roofs. During the experimental period, dual-substrate-layer green roofs supported better natural vegetation growth, with coverage exceeding 90%, while the coverage in single-substrate-layer green roof was over 80%. Based on the average retention value of the total rainfall for four types of simulated rains (the total rainfall depth (mm) was 43.2, 54.6, 76.2 and 86.4, respectively), the dual-substrate-layer green roofs, which used the mixture of activated charcoal with perlite and vermiculite as the adsorption substrate, possessed better rainfall retention performance (65.9% and 55.4%) than the single-substrate-layer green roof (52.5%). All of the dual-substrate-layer green roofs appeared to be sinks for organics, heavy metals and all forms of nitrogen in all cases, while acted as sources of phosphorus contaminants in the case of heavy rains. In consideration of the factors of water retention, pollution reduction and service life of the green roof, a mixture of activated charcoal and/or pumice with perlite and vermiculite is recommended as the adsorption substrate. The green roofs were able to mitigate mild acid rain, raising the pH from approximately 5.6 in rainfall to 6.5-7.6 in green roof runoff. No signs of a first flush effect for phosphate, total phosphorus, ammonia nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, total nitrogen, organics, zinc, lead, chromium, manganese, copper, pH or turbidity were found in the green roof runoff. Cost analysis further proved the practicability of dual-substrate-layer green roofs in retaining rainwater, and their long-term rainwater runoff quantity and quality performance in urban environments merit further investigation.

Alterations in stream morphology and hydrology, added to the effects of global climate change, are responsible for this phenomenon, that is particularly pernicious in mountainous lotic systems naturally characterized by coarse substrates. Among the studies investigating this issue some were descriptive, while others used artificial substrates to compare ongoing fine sediment accumulation and macro invertebrate assemblage recruitment. Other studies used from the outset artificial substrates arranged with different levels of clogging. Our study fits into this line, but adding an innovative element simulating different availability of coarse particulate organic matter, i.e. the main trophic input in low-order, mountainous stream. To investigate how clogging and CPOM can influence macroinvertebrate communities, we placed 135 artificial substrates in the upper Po river ( NW Italy). We set up a three way factorial design with three different levels of sedimentation and terrestrial leaf material. Artificial substrates were removed on three different dates. Benthic invertebrates were identified and classified according to their bio-ecological traits. We also measured macroinvertebrate dry mass and CPOM degradation in the different trap types. Our findings show that clogging acts as a selective filter influencing taxa richness, density, functional composition and biomass of benthic assemblage. Moreover, fine sediments affect the energetic dynamics in the river ecosystem, decreasing the mass loss rate of terrestrial leaves. Interestingly, our results clearly demonstrate that high availability of CPOM can buffer the negative effect of clogging, suggesting that an adequate input of allochthonous organic matter may lessen the impact of fine sediment deposition. Because land use transformation and removal of wooded riparian areas increase clogging and simultaneously reduces the input of CPOM, our findings stress the importance to include the management of river basins in the conservation strategies of mountainous streams.

J	Xiao, LW; Zhu, B; Kumwimba, MN; Jiang, SW				Xiao, Liwei; Zhu, Bo; Kumwimba, Mathieu Nsenga; Jiang, Shiwei			Plant soaking decomposition as well as nitrogen and phosphorous release in the water-level fluctuation zone of the Three Gorges Reservoir	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The operating scheme of the Three Gorges Reservoir results in a summer drought in the water-level fluctuation zone during which plants grow vigorously. In the winter inundation season, soaking plants may decompose and release nutrients resulting in water quality deterioration. This study quantifies the contributions of the underwater decomposition of nine dominant plant species in the water-level fluctuation zone to nutrient release. The insitu litterbag technique was used to study for soaking decomposition over 200 days. All soaking plant species decomposed rapidly at an average rate of 1.99 +/- 0.33% d(-1) in the early stage of soaking (0 to 30 days) and at an average rate of only 0.07 +/- 0.04% d-1 in the later stage (30 to 200 days). After 200 days of soaking, the nine plant species released an average of 312.40 (+/-) 39.97 g kg(-1) organic carbon, 6.71 +/- 4.29 g kg(-1) of nitrogen and 2.25 +/- 1.25 g kg(-1) of phosphorus. A positive relationship was found between soaking plant decomposition rates and initial C/N ratios of 25 to 50, and a negative relationship where the C/N ratios were between 50 and 100. The amounts of total nitrogen or total phosphorus released were significantly negatively correlated with the initial C/N or C/P ratios of the plants. Among the studied plant species, Xanthium sibiricum Patr ex Widder showed high level of nutrient release via soaking decomposition. In contrast, Cynodon dactylon (Linn.) Pers. and Polygonum hydropiper exhibited low levels of nutrient release and are recommended as suitable species for the ecological restoration of the water-level fluctuation zone. Our results demonstrate that after 200 days of soaking plant decomposition, the loadings of total organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in thewater-level fluctuation zone of the Three Gorges Reservoir were 2942.1, 81.1, and 24.7 kg ha(-1), respectively and therefore could potentially damage the aquatic environment of the reservoir.

Benthic invertebrates, such as the crustacean Gammarus fossarum, are key in the functioning of aquatic ecosystems, and are frequently used as sentinel species of water quality status. The aim of this work was to study the effects of amixture of themost frequently detected surfactants in the bioconcentration kinetics of two pharmaceuticals in G. fossarum, evaluating their potential enhancing or suppressing effects. Laboratory exposure experiments for both pharmaceuticals and surfactants (concentration ratio 1: 25) were set up for two individual compounds, the anxiolytic oxazepam and the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole. Gammarid samples were processed using microQuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe) extraction. Pharmaceuticals concentration in the organisms was followed-up by means of nanoliquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS). Results indicated a similar mode of action of the surfactants in the bioconcentration kinetics of both drugs, decreasing the accumulation rate in the organism. Oxazepam showed a higher accumulation potential than sulfamethoxazole in all cases. Depuration experiments for oxazepam also demonstrated the high depurative capacity of gammarids, eliminating N50% of the concentration of oxazepam in <6 h. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we investigated the spatio-temporal variabilities of inorganic N concentration (i. e., NO3-, NH4+) and total dissolved N (TDN) and identified their sources in waters and suspended matters using an isotopical approach in the Jinshui River, a river with a length of 87 km in the monsoon-climate region of China. The spatio-temporal inorganic N concentrations differed significantly along the longitudinal gradient in the river network. The NO3-, NH4+ and TDN concentrations ranged from 0.02 to 1.12 mg l(- 1), 0.03 to 4.28mg l(- 1), and 0.33 to 2.78 mg l(- 1), respectively. The N-15 tracing studies demonstrated that N in suspended organic matter was in the form of suspended particulate nitrogen (SPN) and was primarily from atmospheric deposition and agricultural fertilizer. In contrast, N in stream waters was mainly in the form of nitrate and was from atmospheric deposition, fertilizers, soil, and sewage. Meanwhile, both delta N-15- SPN and delta N-15-NO3- peaked in the rainy season (i. e., July) because of higher terrigenous sources via rain runoff, demonstrating the dominant diffusive N sources in the catchment. Thus, our results could provide critical information on N pollution control and sustainable watershed management of the riverine ecosystem in monsoon- climate region. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Monitoring water quality in Toronto's urban stormwater ponds: Assessing participation rates and data quality of water sampling by citizen scientists in the FreshWater Watch	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												From 2013 to 2015, citizen scientist volunteers in Toronto, Canada were trained to collect and analyze water quality in urban stormwater ponds. This volunteer sampling was part of the research program, FreshWater Watch (FWW), which aimed to standardize urban water sampling efforts from around the globe. We held training sessions for new volunteers twice yearly and trained a total of 111 volunteers. Over the course of project, similar to 30% of volunteers participated by collecting water quality data after the training session with 124 individual sampling events at 29 unique locations in Toronto, Canada. A few highly engaged volunteers were most active, with 50% of the samples collected by 5% of trainees. Stormwater ponds generally have poor water quality demonstrated by elevated phosphate concentrations (similar to 30 mu g/ L), nitrate (similar to 427 mu g/ L), and turbidity relative to Canadian water quality standards. Compared to other urban waterbodies in the global program, nutrient concentrations in Toronto's urban stormwater ponds were lower, while turbidity was not markedly different. Toronto FWW (FWW-TO) data was comparable to that measured by standard lab analyses and matched results from previous studies of stormwater ponds in Toronto. Combining observational and chemical data acquired by citizen scientists, macrophyte dominated ponds had lower phosphate concentrations while phytoplankton dominated ponds had lower nitrate concentrations, which indicates a potentially important and unstudied role of internal biogeochemical processes on pond nutrient dynamics. This experience in the FWW demonstrates the capabilities and constraints of citizen science when applied to water quality sampling. While analytical limits on in-field analyses produce higher uncertainty in water quality measurements of individual sites, rapid data collection is possible but depends on the motivation and engagement of the group of volunteers. Ongoing efforts in citizen sciencwill thus need to address sampling effort and analytical limits to fully realize the potential value of engaging citizen scientists in water quality sampling.

The purpose was to understand the reasons of water source contamination and re-contamination in the water supply chain, in order to define strategies to control source contamination and to suggest practical ways for reducing the risk of recontamination. A first phase of microbiological drinking water quality monitoring allowed identifying the most critical areas to be valued in a next sanitation assessment activity, carried out by means of interviews to stakeholders and by direct observation. The microbiological analysis carried out at the source showed that only in few cases there is compliance of water samples with the standard limit for all microbiological parameters. It was also found that the cases of compliance with the regulatory limit decrease moving from the source to the consumer, meaning improper hygiene habits in the supply chain. Microbiological contamination shows a potential danger for the health of consumers. As regards excreta and wastewater management, a prevalence of unimproved sanitation facilities with direct infiltration into the ground and a bad management of septic tanks were identified. In order to improve population's health conditions, a preventive approach should be implemented, including both the improvement of the structural characteristics of latrines and their management and the improvement of water supply infrastructures. Moreover, good practices at the household level resulted to be an important strategy to preserve water microbiological quality.																	1582-9596	1843-3707				AUG	2017	16	8					1701	1708										WOS:000415723000007						
J	Baumber, A				Baumber, Alex			Enhancing ecosystem services through targeted bioenergy support policies	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES												While policy-makers in the bioenergy sector have paid considerable attention over the past decade to the risks that energy cropping can pose to forests, soils and food security, there has been less focus on how bioenergy policies can be designed to enhance ecosystem services. Some perennial energy crops have demonstrated the potential to provide habitat for biodiversity, improve soil health, enhance water quality, mitigate dryland salinity and sequester carbon. While much uncertainty exists around which forms of energy cropping might deliver these benefits, opportunities exist to preferentially support beneficial energy crops through the adaptation of existing bioenergy policies. This article provides a global review of bioenergy policy instruments that identifies existing and potential mechanisms for promoting the enhancement of ecosystem services. While many existing bioenergy support policies promote fuel supply (a provisioning service) and climate change mitigation (a regulating service), it is less common for bioenergy policies to actively enhance ecosystem services such as habitat provision, soil improvement and water regulation. Further opportunities to promote these ecosystem services exist through structured tax concessions, sub-mandates, banding and renewable energy auctions, but careful consideration needs to be given to trade-offs between services, risks of disservices and the need for complementary nonenergy policies.

Building the bridge between ecosystem services research and practice	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES												There is growing demand for information regarding the impacts of decisions on ecosystem services and human benefits. Despite the large and growing quantity of published ecosystem services research, there remains a substantial gap between this research and the information required to support decisions. Research often provides models and tools that do not fully link social and ecological systems; are too complex, specialized, and costly to use; and are targeted to outcomes that differ from those needed by decision makers. Decision makers require cost-effective, straightforward, transferable, scalable, meaningful, and defensible methods that can be readily understood. We provide illustrative examples of these gaps between research and practice and describe how researchers can make their work relevant to decision makers by using Benefit Relevant Indicators ( BRIs) and choosing models appropriate for particular decision contexts. We use examples primarily from the United States, including cases that illustrate varying degrees of success in closing these gaps. We include a discussion of the challenges and opportunities researchers face in adapting their work to meet the needs of practitioners. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Review of Epidemiological Studies of Drinking-Water Turbidity in Relation to Acute Gastrointestinal Illness	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES												BACKGROUND: Turbidity has been used as an indicator of microbiological contamination of drinking water in time-series studies attempting to discern the presence of waterborne gastrointestinal illness; however, the utility of turbidity as a proxy exposure measure has been questioned. OBJECTIVES: We conducted a review of epidemiological studies of the association between turbidity of chinking-water supplies and incidence of acute gastrointestinal illness (AGI), including a synthesis of the overall weight of evidence. Our goal was to evaluate the potential for causal inference from the studies. METHODS: We identified 14 studies on the topic (distinct by region, time period and/or population). We evaluated each study with regard to modeling approaches, potential biases, and the strength of evidence. We also considered consistencies and differences in the collective results. DISCUSSION: Positive associations between drinking-water turbidity and AGI incidence were found in different cities and time periods, and with both unfiltered and filtered supplies. There was some evidence for a stronger association at higher turbidity levels. The studies appeared to adequately adjust for confounding. There was fair consistency in the notable lags between turbidity measurement and AGI identification, which fell between 6 and 10 d in many studies. CONCLUSIONS: The observed associations suggest a detectable incidence of waterborne AGI from drinking water in the systems and time periods studied. However, some discrepant results indicate that the association may be context specific. Combining turbidity with seasonal and climatic factors, additional water quality measures, and treatment data may enhance predictive modeling in future studies.																	0091-6765	1552-9924				AUG	2017	125	8							UNSP 086003	10.1289/EHP1090								WOS:000413790600009	28886603					
J	Zheng, Y; Flanagan, SV				Zheng, Yan; Flanagan, Sara V.			The Case for Universal Screening of Private Well Water Quality in the US and Testing Requirements to Achieve It: Evidence from Arsenic	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES												BACKGROUND: The 1974 Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) regulates >170,000 public water systems to protect health, but not >13 million private wells. State and local government requirements for private well water testing are rare and inconsistent; the responsibility to ensure water safety remains with individual households. Over the last two decades, geogenic arsenic has emerged as a significant public health concern clue to high prevalence in many rural American communities. OBJECTIVES: We build the case for universal screening of private well water quality around arsenic, the most toxic and widespread of common private water contaminants. We argue that achieving universal screening will require policy intervention, and that testing should be made easy, accessible, and in many cases free to all private well households in the United States, considering the invisible, tasteless, odorless, and thus silent nature of arsenic. DISCUSSION: Our research has identified behavioral, situational and financial barriers to households managing their own well water safety, resulting in far from universal screening despite traditional public health outreach efforts. We observe significant socioeconomic disparities in arsenic testing and treatment when private water is unregulated. Testing requirements can he a partial answer to these challenges. CONCLUSIONS: Universal screening, achieved through local testing requirements complemented by greater community engagement targeting biologically and socioeconomically vulnerable groups, would reduce population arsenic exposure greater than any promotional efforts to date. Universal screening of private well water will identify the dangers hidden in America's drinking water supply and redirect attention to ensure safe water among affected households.																	0091-6765	1552-9924				AUG	2017	125	8							UNSP 085002	10.1289/EHP629								WOS:000413790600002	28893720

Due to its fine spatial scale and focus on the rural environment, LUCI is well-placed to help both farm and catchment managers to explore and quantify spatially explicit solutions to improve water quality while also maintaining or enhancing other ecosystem service outcomes. LUCI water quality and agricultural productivity models were applied to a catchment in the Bay of Plenty, New Zealand. Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) sources, sinks and pathways in the landscape were identified and trade-offs and synergies between water quality and agricultural productivity were investigated. Results indicate that interventions to improve water quality are likely to come at the expense of agriculturally productive land. Nonetheless, loss of agriculturally productive land can be minimised by using LUCI to identify, at a fine spatial scale, the most appropriate locations for nutrient intervention. Spatially targeted and strategic nutrient source management and pathway interception can improve water quality, while minimising negative financial impacts on farms. Our results provide spatially explicit solutions to optimize agricultural productivity and water quality, which will inform better farm, land and catchment management as well as national and international policy.

Organic chloramines in chlorine-based disinfected water systems: A critical review	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES												This paper is a critical review of current knowledge of organic chloramines in water systems, including their formation, stability, toxicity, analytical methods for detection, and their impact on drinking water treatment and quality. The term organic chloramines may refer to any halogenated organic compounds measured as part of combined chlorine (the difference between the measured free and total chlorine concentrations), and may include N-chloramines, N-chloramino acids, N-chloraldimines and N-chloramides. Organic chloramines can form when dissolved organic nitrogen or dissolved organic carbon react with either free chlorine or inorganic chloramines. They are potentially harmful to humans and may exist as an intermediate for other disinfection by-products. However, little information is available on the formation or occurrence of organic chloramines in water due to a number of challenges. One of the biggest challenges for the identification and quantification of organic chloramines in water systems is the lack of appropriate analytical methods. In addition, many of the organic chloramines that form during disinfection are unstable, which results in difficulties in sampling and detection. To date research has focussed on the study of organic monochloramines. However, given that breakpoint chlorination is commonly undertaken in water treatment systems, the formation of organic dichloramines should also be considered. Organic chloramines can be formed from many different precursors and pathways. Therefore, studying the occurrence of their precursors in water systems would enable better prediction and management of their formation.

Occurrence and formation of disinfection by-products in the swimming pool environment: A critical review	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES												Disinfection of water for human use is essential to protect against microbial disease; however, disinfection also leads to formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs), some of which are of health concern. From a chemical perspective, swimming pools are a complex matrix, with continual addition of a wide range of natural and anthropogenic chemicals via filling waters, disinfectant addition, pharmaceuticals and personal care products and human body excretions. Natural organic matter, trace amounts of DBPs and chlorine or chloramines may be introduced by the filling water, which is commonly disinfected distributed drinking water. Chlorine and/or bromine is continually introduced via the addition of chemical disinfectants to the pool. Human body excretions (sweat, urine and saliva) and pharmaceuticals and personal care products (sunscreens, cosmetics, hair products and lotions) are introduced by swimmers. High addition of disinfectant leads to a high formation of DBPs from reaction of some of the chemicals with the disinfectant. Swimming pool air is also of concern as volatile DBPs partition into the air above the pool. The presence of bromine leads to the formation of a wide range of bromo- and bromo/chloro-DBPs, and Br-DBPs are more toxic than their chlorinated analogues. This is particularly important for seawater-filled pools or pools using a bromine-based disinfectant. This review summarises chemical contaminants and DBPs in swimming pool waters, as well as in the air above pools. Factors that have been found to affect DBP formation in pools are discussed. The impact of the swimming pool environment on human health is reviewed. (C) 2017 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

This study reviewed the formation and control strategies for DBPs and toxicity in reclaimed water during chlorination. Both regulated and emerging DBPs have been frequently detected in reclaimed water during chlorination at a higher level than those in drinking water, indicating they pose a greater risk to humans. Luminescent bacteria and Daphnia magna acute toxicity, anti-estrogenic activity and cytotoxicity generally increased after chlorination because of the formation of DBPs. Genotoxicity by umu-test and estrogenic activity were decreased after chlorination because of destruction of toxic chemicals. During chlorination, water quality significantly impacted changes in toxicity. Ammonium tended to attenuate toxicity changes by reacting with chlorine to form chloramine, while bromide tended to aggravate toxicity changes by forming hypobromous acid. During pretreatment by ozonation and coagulation, disinfection byproduct formation potential (DBPFP) and toxicity formation potential (TFP) occasionally increase, which is accompanied by DOC removal; thus, the decrease of DOC was limited to indicate the decrease of DBPFP and TFP. It is more important to eliminate the key fraction of precursors such as hydrophobic acid and hydrophilic neutrals. During chlorination, toxicities can increase with the increasing chlorine dose and contact time. To control the excessive toxicity formation, a relatively low chlorine dose and short contact time were required. Quenching chlorine residual with reductive reagents also effectively abated the formation of toxic compounds. (C) 2017 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Trihalomethane concentrations in tap water as determinant of bottled water use in the city of Barcelona	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES												Bottled water consumption is increasing worldwide, despite its huge economic and environmental cost. We aim to describe personal and tap water quality determinants of bottled water use in the city of Barcelona. This cross-sectional study used data from the Health Survey of Barcelona in 2006 (N = 5417 adults). The use of bottled water to drink and to cook was evaluated in relation to age, gender, educational level, district and levels of trihalomethanes (THMs), free chlorine, conductivity, chloride, sodium, pH, nitrate and aluminium in municipal tap water using Robust Poisson Regression. The prevalence of bottled water use to drink and cook was 53.9% and 6.7%, respectively. Chemical parameters in water had a large variability (interquartile range of THMs concentrations: 83.2-200.8 ag/L) and were correlated between them, except aluminium. Drinking bottled water increased with educational level, while cooking with bottled water was higher among men than among women and decreased with age. After adjusting by these personal determinants, a dose-response relationship was found between concentrations of all chemicals except aluminium in tap water and bottled water use. The highest association was found for THMs, with a Prevalence Ratio of 2.00 (95%CI = 1.86, 2.15) for drinking bottled water and 2.80 (95%CI = 1.72, 4.58) for cooking with bottled water, among those with >150 mu g/L vs. <100 mu g/L THMs in tap water. Conclusion: More than half of Barcelona residents regularly drank bottled water, and the main determinant was the chemical composition of tap water, particularly THM level.

Trihalomethanes (THMs), the most commonly measured and dominant class of DBPs in drinking water, served as a primary metric and surrogate for the full DBP mixture. Average THM exposure was calculated, based on rough estimates of past levels in Iowa. To reduce misclassification, a follow-up study was undertaken to improve estimates of past THM levels and to re-evaluate their association with cancer risk. In addition, the risk associated with haloacetic acids, another class of DBPs, was examined. In the original analysis, surface water treatment plants were assigned one of two possible THM levels depending on the point of chlorination. The re-assessment considered each utility treating surface or groundwater on a case-by-case basis. Multiple treatment/disinfection scenarios and water quality parameters were considered with actual DBP measurements to develop estimates of past levels. The highest annual average THM level in the re-analysis was 156 mu g/L compared to 74 mu g/L for the original analysis. This allowed the analysis of subjects exposed at higher levels (>96 mu g/L). The re-analysis established a new approach, based on case studies and an understanding of the water quality and operational parameters that impact DBP formation, for determining historical exposure.

Understanding and Managing the Effects of Climate Change on Ecosystem Services in the Rocky Mountains	MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT												Public lands in the US Rocky Mountains provide critical ecosystem services, especially to rural communities that rely on these lands for fuel, food, water, and recreation. Climate change will likely affect the ability of these lands to provide ecosystem services. We describe 2 efforts to assess climate change vulnerabilities and develop adaptation options on federal lands in the Rocky Mountains. We specifically focus on aspects that affect community economic security and livelihood security, including water quality and quantity, timber, livestock grazing, and recreation. Headwaters of the Rocky Mountains serve as the primary source of water for large populations, and these headwaters are located primarily on public land. Thus, federal agencies will play a key role in helping to protect water quantity and quality by promoting watershed function and water conservation. Although increased temperatures and atmospheric concentration of CO2 have the potential to increase timber and forage production in the Rocky Mountains, those gains may be offset by wildfires, droughts, insect outbreaks, non-native species, and altered species composition. Our assessment identified ways in which federal land managers can help sustain forest and range productivity, primarily by increasing ecosystem resilience and minimizing current stressors, such as invasive species. Climate change will likely increase recreation participation. However, recreation managers will need more flexibility to adjust practices, provide recreation opportunities, and sustain economic benefits to communities. Federal agencies are now transitioning from the planning phase of climate change adaptation to implementation to ensure that ecosystem services will continue to be provided from federal lands in a changing climate.																	0276-4741	1994-7151				AUG	2017	37	3					340	352		10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-16-00087.1								WOS:000411812900010						
J	Chang, CL; Li, MY				Chang, Chia-Ling; Li, Meng-Yuan			Predictions of Diffuse Pollution by the HSPF Model and the Back-Propagation Neural Network Model	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												Watershed models are important tools for predicting the possible change of watershed responses. Environmental models comprise the deterministic model and the probabilistic model. This study discusses the Hydrological Simulation Program Fortran (HSPF) and the Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPNN); these two models represent the deterministic model and the probabilistic model, respectively. As the properties of the two models are distinct, they have differing abilities to predict surface-runoff pollution. For the two models, the runoff simulation results are satisfactory. However, due to the limitation of the water quality monitoring records, pollution simulation is more difficult than runoff simulation. The results indicate that the prediction accuracy in the pollution simulation can be improved by adjusting the BPNN neurons. On the contrary, improving the prediction accuracy is limited by HSPF. Although the flexibility of BPNN is higher than HSPF, sufficient historical monitoring records are important for both of these models.																	1061-4303	1554-7531				AUG 1	2017	89	8					732	738		10.2175/106143017X14902968254665								WOS:000411925800007	28743327

It covers a region that is highly diverse, ranging from almost virgin mountain zones to densely urbanized areas and mining zones. These contrasts have a strong impact on rivers and their ecosystems. Based on two sampling campaigns (summer 2014, spring 2015), we investigated the longitudinal water quality pattern along the Selenga and its tributaries in Mongolia. While headwater regions typically had a very good water quality status, wastewater from urban areas and impacts from mining were found to be main pollution sources in the tributaries. The highest nutrient concentrations in the catchment were found in Tuul River, and severely elevated concentrations of trace elements (As, Cd, Cu, Cr, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn), nutrients (NH4+, NO2-, NO3-, PO43-), and selected major ions (SO42-) were found in main tributaries of Selenga River. Moreover, trace element concentrations during spring 2015 (a time when many mines had not yet started operation) were markedly lower than in summer 2014, indicating that the additional metal loads measured in summer 2014 were related to mining activities. Nevertheless, all taken water samples in 2014 and 2015 from the main channel of the Mongolian Selenga River complied with the Mongolian standard (MNS 1998) for the investigated parameters.

Interdisciplinary research over the last two decades has indicated that ecohydrological interfaces are often hot spots of ecological, biogeochemical, and hydrological processes and may provide refuge for biota during extreme events. Ecohydrological interfaces can have significant impact on global hydrological and biogeochemical cycles, biodiversity, pollutant removal, and ecosystem resilience to disturbance. The organizational principles (i.e., the drivers and controls) of spatially and temporally variable processes at ecohydrological interfaces are poorly understood and require the integrated analysis of hydrological, biogeochemical, and ecological processes. Our rudimentary understanding of the interactions between different drivers and controls critically limits our ability to predict complex system responses to change. In this paper, we explore similarities and contrasts in the functioning of diverse freshwater ecohydrological interfaces across spatial and temporal scales. We use this comparison to develop an integrated, interdisciplinary framework, including a roadmap for analyzing ecohydrological processes and their interactions in ecosystems. We argue that, in order to fully account for their nonlinear process dynamics, ecohydrological interfaces need to be conceptualized as unique, spatially and temporally dynamic entities, which represents a step change from their current representation as boundary conditions at investigated ecosystems. Plain Language Summary The movement of water, matter, organisms, and energy can be altered substantially at ecohydrological interfaces that we introduce here as a new concept to support the quantitative analysis of nonlinear system behavior stimulated by the complex and multifacetted interactions of hydrological, biogeochemical, and ecological processes across system boundaries. Ecohydrological interfaces are defined here as the dynamic transition zones that may develop at ecosystem (or subsystem) boundaries and control the movement and transformation of organisms, water, matter, and energy between adjacent systems. In this paper, we explore similarities and contrasts in the functioning of diverse freshwater ecohydrological interfaces across spatial and temporal scales. We use this comparison to develop an integrated, interdisciplinary framework, including a roadmap for analyzing ecohydrological processes and their interactions in ecosystems. We argue that, in order to fully account for their nonlinear process dynamics, ecohydrological interfaces need to be conceptualized as unique, spatially and temporally dynamic entities, which represents a step change from their current representation as boundary conditions at investigated ecosystems.

With mitigation of nutrients in inland waters and their discharges to the Baltic Sea being a common WFD and BSAP target, we use Sweden as a case study of observable effects, by compiling and analyzing all openly available water and nutrient monitoring data across Sweden since 2003. The data compilation reveals that nutrient monitoring covers only around 1% (down to 0.2% for nutrient loads) of the total number of WFD-classified stream and lake water bodies in Sweden. The data analysis further shows that the hydro-climatically driven water discharge dominates the determination of waterborne loads of both total phosphorus and total nitrogen across Sweden. Both water discharge and the related nutrient loads are in turn well correlated with the ecosystem status classification of Swedish water bodies. Nutrient concentrations do not exhibit such correlation and their changes over the study period are on average small, but concentration increases are found for moderate-to-bad status waters, for which both the WFD and the BSAP have instead targeted concentration decreases. In general, these results indicate insufficient distinction and mitigation of human-driven nutrient components in inland waters and their discharges to the sea by the internationally harmonized applications of the WFD and the BSAP. The results call for further comparative investigations of observable large-scale effects of such regulatory/management frameworks in different parts of the world.

Unlike other hedonic studies of water quality, we test whether housing market responds to average water quality or more to extreme events. We also test the spatial and temporal extent of effects of water quality on housing prices. We find that poor coastal water quality, measured in terms of the concentration of chlorophyll, has a negative impact on housing prices that diminishes with distance from the shoreline. Furthermore, our finding suggests that housing prices are most influenced by the extreme environmental conditions, which may be accompanied by unpleasant odors, discoloration, and even fish kills. We further predict potential increases in home values associated under water quality improvement scenarios and find an increase in the values of homes in coastal communities along Narragansett Bay of about $18 million up to $136 million.

Managed aquifer recharge through off-season irrigation in agricultural regions	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Options for increasing reservoir storage in developed regions are limited and prohibitively expensive. Projected increases in demand call for new long-term water storage to help sustain agriculture, municipalities, industry, and ecological services. Managed aquifer recharge (MAR) is becoming an integral component of water resources around the world. However, MAR faces challenges, including infrastructure costs, difficulty in enhancing recharge, water quality issues, and lack of available water supplies. Here we examine, through simulation modeling of a hypothetical agricultural subbasin in the western U.S., the potential of agricultural managed aquifer recharge (Ag-MAR) via canal seepage and off-season field irrigation. Weather phenomenon in many regions around the world exhibit decadal and other multiyear cycles of extreme precipitation. An ongoing challenge is to develop approaches to store greater amounts of water during these events. Simulations presented herein incorporate Ag-MAR programs and demonstrate that there is potential to enhance regional recharge by 7-13%, increase crop consumptive use by 9-12%, and increase natural vegetation consumption by 20-30%, where larger relative increases occur for lower aquifer hydraulic conductivity and higher specific yield values. Annual increases in groundwater levels were 7 m, and sustained levels following several years of drought were greater than 2 m. Results demonstrate that Ag-MAR has great potential to enhance long-term sustainability of water resources in agricultural basins.

Patrick			Temporal variability in the importance of hydrologic, biotic, and climatic descriptors of dissolved oxygen dynamics in a shallow tidal-marsh creek	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Due to strong abiotic forcing, dissolved oxygen (DO) in shallow tidal creeks often disobeys the conventional explanation of general aquatic DO cycling as biologically regulated. In the present work, we seek to quantify the relative importance of abiotic (hydrologic and climatic), and biotic (primary productivity as represented by chlorophyll-a) descriptors of tidal creek DO. By fitting multiple linear regression models of DO to hourly chlorophyll-a, water quality, hydrology, and weather data collected in a tidal creek of a Chesapeake Bay marsh (Maryland, USA), temporal shifts (summer-early winter) in the relative importance of tidal creek DO descriptors were uncovered. Moreover, this analysis identified an alternative approach to evaluating tidal stage as a driver of DO by dividing stage into two DO-relevant variables: stage above and below bankfull depth. Within the hydrologic variable class, stage below bankfull depth dominated as an important descriptor, thus highlighting the role of pore water drainage and mixing as influential processes forcing tidal creek DO. Study findings suggest that tidal creek DO dynamics are explained by a balance of hydrologic, climatic, and biotic descriptors during warmer seasons due to many of these variables (i.e., chlorophyll-a, water temperature) acting as tracers of estuarine-marsh water mixing; conversely, in early winter months when estuarine and marsh waters differ less distinctly, hydrologic variables increase in relative importance as descriptors of tidal creek DO. These findings underline important distinctions in the underlying mechanisms dictating DO variability in shallow tidal marsh-creek environments relative to open water estuarine systems.

Predicting redox-sensitive contaminant concentrations in groundwater using random forest classification	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Machine learning techniques were applied to a large (n>10,000) compliance monitoring database to predict the occurrence of several redox-active constituents in groundwater across a large watershed. Specifically, random forest classification was used to determine the probabilities of detecting elevated concentrations of nitrate, iron, and arsenic in the Fox, Wolf, Peshtigo, and surrounding watersheds in northeastern Wisconsin. Random forest classification is well suited to describe the nonlinear relationships observed among several explanatory variables and the predicted probabilities of elevated concentrations of nitrate, iron, and arsenic. Maps of the probability of elevated nitrate, iron, and arsenic can be used to assess groundwater vulnerability and the vulnerability of streams to contaminants derived from groundwater. Processes responsible for elevated concentrations are elucidated using partial dependence plots. For example, an increase in the probability of elevated iron and arsenic occurred when well depths coincided with the glacial/bedrock interface, suggesting a bedrock source for these constituents. Furthermore, groundwater in contact with Ordovician bedrock has a higher likelihood of elevated iron concentrations, which supports the hypothesis that groundwater liberates iron from a sulfide-bearing secondary cement horizon of Ordovician age.

A pilot project was conducted to evaluate the impact of rain gardens on the water quality and volume reduction of storm runoff from urban streets in a combined sewer area. The study took place in a six-block area on South Grand Boulevard in St. Louis, Missouri. The impact was assessed through a comparison between the pre-construction (2011/ 2012) and the post-construction (2014) phases. Shortly after the rain gardens were installed, the levels of total suspended solids, chloride, total nitrogen, total phosphorous, zinc, and copper increased. The level of mercury was lower than the detection level in both phases. E. coli was the only parameter that showed statistically significant decrease following the installation of rain gardens. The likely reason for initial increase in monitored water quality parameters is that the post-construction sampling began after the rain gardens were constructed but before planting, resulted from soil erosion and wash-out from the mulch. However, the levels of most of water quality parameters decreased in the following time period during the post-construction phase. The study found 76% volume reduction of stormwater runoff following the installation of rain gardens at one of studied sites. Statistical analysis is essential on collected data because of the encountered high variability of measured flows resulted from low flow conditions in studied sewers.

China's Sponge City construction: A discussion on technical approaches	FRONTIERS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & ENGINEERING					International Low Impact Development Conference	2016	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	Chinese Soc Civil Engineers, Water Ind Soc, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Water Environm Res Inst, Chinese Acad Engn, Tsinghua Univ, Peking Univ, Beijing Univ Civil Engn & Architecture				Since 2014, China has been implementing the Sponge City Construction initiative, which represents an enormous and unprecedented effort by any government in the world for achieving urban sustainability. According to preliminary estimates, the total investment on the Sponge City Plan is roughly 100 to 150 million Yuan (RMB) ($15 to $22.5 million) average per square kilometer or 10 Trillion Yuan (RMB) ($1.5 Trillion) for the 657 cities nationwide. The Sponge City Plan (SCP) calls for the use of natural processes such as soil and vegetation as part of the urban runoff control strategy, which is similar to that of low impact development (LID) and green infrastructure (GI) practices being promoted in many parts of the world. The SCP includes as its goals not only effective urban flood control, but also rainwater harvest, water quality improvement and ecological restoration. So far, the SCP implementation has encountered some barriers and challenges due to many factors. The present paper presents a review of those barriers and challenges, offers discussions and recommendations on several technical aspects such as control goals and objectives; planning/design and construction of LID/GI practices; performance evaluation. Several key recommendations are proposed on Sponge City implementation strategy, Site-specific regulatory framework and technical guidance, Product innovation and certification, LID/GI Project financing, LID/GI professional training and certification, public outreach and education. It is expected that the successful implementation of the SCP not only will bring about a sustainable, eco-friendly urbanization process in China, but also contribute enormously to the LID/GI research and development with the vast amount of relevant data and experiences generated from the Sponge City construction projects.

This is achieved by utilizing an engineered system containing a surface layer of mulch, a thick soil media often amended with a variety of materials to improve water quality, a variety of vegetation, and underdrains, depending on the surrounding soil characteristics. Bioretention systems have been studied quite extensively for warm climate applications, but data strongly supporting their long-term efficacy and application in cold climates is sparse. Although it is apparent that bioretention is an effective stormwater management system, its design in cold climate needs further research. Existing cold climate research has shown that coarser media is required to prevent concrete frost from forming. For spring, summer and fall seasons, if sufficient permeability exists to drain the system prior to freezing, peak flow and volume reduction can be maintained. Additionally, contaminants that are removed via filtration are also not impacted by cold climates. In contrary, dissolved contaminants, nutrients, and organics are significantly more variable in their ability to be removed or degraded via bioretention in colder temperatures. Winter road maintenance salts have been shown to negatively impact the removal of some contaminants and positively impact others, while their effects on properly selected vegetation or bacteria health are also not well understood. Research in these water quality aspects has been inconsistent and therefore requires further study.

The "sponge city" concept emphasizes that the runoff can permeate the soil or be stored temporarily, and rainwater could be used again when it is needed. Beijing is one of the earliest cities to study rainwater harvesting and LID techniques in China. Through long-term monitoring of rainfall, runoff flow, and water quality of a campus demonstration project in Beijing, the runoff quantity and pollutant concentration variations have been analyzed. Furthermore, the runoff reduction effects of single LID measure, such as green roof, filtration chamber, and permeable pavement, have been investigated. Additionally, the overall reduction effectiveness of the LID system on the average annual rainfall runoff and pollution load has been discussed. Preliminary studies suggest that runoff pollutant concentration is positively correlated with the rainfall interval time, and the longer rainfall interval time leads to higher runoff pollutant concentrations. The very good outflow quality of the rainwater harvesting system could satisfy the reclaimed water quality standard for scenic entertainment use. The non-point-source pollution reduction effects of the LID system are obvious because the pollutants could be removed by filtration on the one hand and the pollution load could be reduced because of the significantly reduced outflow on the other hand.

J	Amicarelli, A; Leuzzi, G; Monti, P; Alessandrini, S; Ferrero, E				Amicarelli, Andrea; Leuzzi, Giovanni; Monti, Paolo; Alessandrini, Stefano; Ferrero, Enrico			A stochastic Lagrangian micromixing model for the dispersion of reactive scalars in turbulent flows: role of concentration fluctuations and improvements to the conserved scalar theory under non-homogeneous conditions	ENVIRONMENTAL FLUID MECHANICS												Several reaction schemes, based on the conserved scalar theory, are implemented within a stochastic Lagrangian micromixing model to simulate the dispersion of reactive scalars in turbulent flows. In particular, the formulation of the reaction-dominated limit (RDL) reaction scheme is here extended to improve the model performance under non-homogeneous conditions (NHRDL scheme). The validation of the stochastic model is obtained by comparison with the available measurements of reactive pollutant concentrations in a grid-generated turbulent flow. This test case describes the dispersion of two atmospheric reactant species (NO and O-3) and their reaction product (NO2) in an unbounded turbulent flow. Model inter-comparisons are also assessed, by considering the results of state-of-the-art models for pollutant dispersion. The present validation shows that RDL reaction scheme provides a systematic overestimation (relative error of ca. 85% around the centreline) in computing the local reactant consumption/production rate, whereas the NHRDL scheme drastically reduces this gap (relative error lower than 5% around the centreline). In terms of NO2 production (or reactant consumption), neglecting concentration fluctuations determines overestimations of the product mean of around 100% and a NO2 local production of one order of magnitude higher than the reference simulation. In terms of standard deviations, the concentration fluctuations of both the passive and reactive scalars are generally of the same order of magnitude or up to 1 or 2 orders of magnitudes higher than the corresponding ensemble mean values, except for the background reactant close to the plume edges. The study highlights the importance of modelling pollutant reactions depending on the instantaneous instead of the mean concentrations of the reactants, thus quantifying the role of the turbulent fluctuations of concentration, in terms of scalar statistics (mean, standard deviation, intensity of fluctuations, skewness and kurtosis of concentration, segregation coefficient, simulated reaction rate). This stochastic particle method represents an efficient numerical technique to solve the convection-diffusion equation for reactive scalars and involves several application fields: micro-scale air quality (urban and street-canyon scales), accidental releases, impact of odours, water quality and fluid flow industrial processes (e.g. combustion).

Environmental impact of coal mining and coal seam gas production on surface water quality in the Sydney basin, Australia	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The extraction of coal and coal seamgas (CSG) will generate produced water that, if not adequately treated, will pollute surface and groundwater systems. InAustralia, the discharge of produced water from coal mining and related activities is regulated by the state environment agency through a pollution licence. This licence sets the discharge limits for a range of analytes to protect the environment into which the producedwater is discharged. This study reports on the impact of produced water from coal mine activities located within or discharging into high conservation environments, such as National Parks, in the outer region of Sydney, Australia. The water samples upstream and downstream from the discharge points from six mines were taken, and 110 parameters were tested. The results were assessed against a water quality index (WQI) which accounts for pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, total dissolved solids, total phosphorus, nitrate nitrogen and E. coli. The water quality assessment based on the trace metal contents against various national maximum admissible concentration (MAC) and their corresponding environmental impacts was also included in the study which also established a base value of water quality for further study. The study revealed that impacted water downstream of the mine discharge points contained higher metal content than the upstream reference locations. In many cases, the downstream water was above the Australia and New Zealand Environment Conservation Council and international water quality guidelines for freshwater stream. The major outliers to the guidelines were aluminium (Al), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni) and zinc (Zn). The WQI of surface water at and downstream of the discharge point was lower when compared to upstream or reference conditions in the majority of cases. Toxicology indices of metals present in industrial discharges were used as an additional tool to assess water quality, and the newly proposed environmental water quality index (EWQI) lead to better trend in the impact of coal and coal seam gas mining activities on surface water quality when compared to the upstream reference water samples. Metal content limits were based on the impact points assigned by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, USA. For environmental and health impact assessment, the approach used in this study can be applied as a model to provide a basis to assess the anthropogenic contribution from the industrial and mining activities on the environment.

A case study characterizing animal fecal sources in surface water using a mitochondrial DNA marker	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Water quality impairment by fecal waste in coastal watersheds is a public health issue. The present study provided evidence for the use of a mitochondrial (mtDNA) marker to detect animal fecal sources in surface water. The accurate identification of fecal pollution is based on the notion that fecal microorganisms preferentially inhabit a host animal's gut environment. In contrast, mtDNA host-specific markers are inherent to eukaryotic host cells, which offers the advantage by detecting DNA from the host rather than its fecal bacteria. The present study focused on sampling water presumably from non-point sources (NPS), which can increase bacterial and nitrogen concentrations to receiving water bodies. Stream sampling sites located within the Piscataqua River Watershed (PRW), New Hampshire, USA, were sampled from a range of sites that experienced nitrogen inputs such as sewer and septic systems and suburban runoff. Three mitochondrial (mtDNA) gene marker assays (human, bovine, and canine) were tested from surface water. Nineteen sites were sampled during an 18-month period. Analyses of the combined single andmultiplex assay results showed that the proportion of occurrence was highest for bovine (15.6%; n = 77) compared to canine (5.6%; n = 70) and human (5.7%; n = 107) mtDNA gene markers. For the human mtDNA marker, there was a statistically significant relationship between presence vs. absence and land use (Fisher's test p = 0.0031). This result was evident particularly for rural suburban septic, which showed the highest proportion of presence (19.2%) compared to the urban sewered (3.3%), suburban sewered (0%), and agricultural (0%) as well as forested septic (0%) sites. Although further testing across varied land use is needed, our study provides evidence for using the mtDNA marker in large watersheds.

J	Fraser, G; Rohde, K; Silburn, M				Fraser, Grant; Rohde, Ken; Silburn, Mark			Fertiliser management effects on dissolved inorganic nitrogen in runoff from Australian sugarcane farms	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) movement from Australian sugarcane farms is believed to be a major cause of crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks which have reduced the Great Barrier Reef coral cover by similar to 21% (1985-2012). We develop a daily model of DIN concentration in runoff based on >200 field monitored runoff events. Runoff DIN concentrations were related to nitrogen fertiliser application rates and decreased after application with time and cumulative rainfall. Runoff after liquid fertiliser applications had higher initial DIN concentrations, though these concentrations diminished more rapidly in comparison to granular fertiliser applications. The model was validated using an independent field dataset and provided reasonable estimates of runoff DIN concentrations based on a number of modelling efficiency score results. The runoff DIN concentration model was combined with a water balance cropping model to investigate temporal aspects of sugarcane fertiliser management. Nitrogen fertiliser application in December (start of wet season) had the highest risk of DIN movement, and this was further exacerbated in years with a climate forecast for 'wet' seasonal conditions. The potential utility of a climate forecasting system to predict forthcoming wet months and hence DIN loss risk is demonstrated. Earlier fertiliser application or reducing fertiliser application rates in seasons with a wet climate forecast may markedly reduce runoff DIN loads; however, it is recommended that these findings be tested at a broader scale.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				AUG	2017	189	8							409	10.1007/s10661-017-6115-z								WOS:000410241300013	28733785

Quality assessment and public health status of harvested rainwater in a peri-urban community in Edo State of Nigeria	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The harvested rainwater is an alternative water source in communities where there is limited or scarcity of water distribution system. However, contamination of roof-harvested rainwater is of immense concern to the general public health. Therefore, this study was initiated to assess the levels of physicochemical quality and heavy metal concentrations in the harvested rainwater from Oluku communities in Benin City, Edo State, Nigeria. The roof-harvested rainwater samples were collected from 20 independent different residential households in Oluku communities, between April 2015 and September 2015. Physicochemical analyses were carried out using standard analytical methods, and heavy metal concentrations were determined using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The evaluation of the rainwater harvesting shows that 60% (12/20) of the roofs were made of corrugated iron sheets; aluminum sheets, 20%(4/20); asbestos, 10%(2/20); and open space was 10% (2/20). Also, the storage systems used for the storage of harvested rainwater were as follows: PVC tanks, 20% (4/20); drums, 30% (6/20); buckets, 25% (5/20); and wells, 25% (5/20). The physicochemical indicators investigated (temperature, nitrate, chlorine content, electrical conductivity, phosphate, total dissolved solids, and sulfate) were within World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. However, some pH levels of the roof-harvested rainwater were acidic and below the WHO standard. Furthermore, a high value of turbidity was observed in some locations and exceeded the WHO guidelines. Though some heavy metal indicators (Zn, Na, K, and Ca) in this study were within the WHO guidelines, some locations revealed heavy metal (Cu, Fe, and Cd) concentrations slightly above the WHO guidelines. There is need for proper rainwater harvesting system and continuous monitoring of harvested rainwater for potable uses.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				AUG	2017	189	8							405	10.1007/s10661-017-6122-0								WOS:000410241300009	28726176

Changes in sub-soil river water quality upon its open storage-a case study	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												A study was carried out to investigate the changes in the physicochemical and biological properties of sub-soil river water upon its storage in a man-made reservoir. Palar sub-soil and reservoir water samples were collated fortnightly for a period of 5 years (2010-2014). The open reservoir is used as a reliable raw water source for condenser cooling systems and for the demineralizing (DM) plant input of Fast Breeder Test Reactor (FBTR), Madras Atomic Power Station (MAPS), and other laboratories at Kalpakkam, southeast coast of India. Relatively high nutrient concentration was observed in the Palar sub-soil water, and a significant reduction in average concentration (mu mol l(-1)) of phosphate (Palar 1.92; open reservoir 1.54) and nitrate (Palar 9.78; open reservoir 5.67) was observed from Palar to open reservoir. Substantial increase in pH (Palar 8.05; open reservoir 8.45), dissolved oxygen (mg l(-1)) (Palar 6.07; open reservoir 8.47), and chlorophyll-a (mg m(-3)) (Palar 1.66; open reservoir 8.43) values were noticed from the Palar sub-soil water to open reservoir water. It is concluded that sub-soil water with higher nutrient concentrations when stored openly, exposing to the sun, resulted in growth of plants, planktonic, and macrophytes, which led to substantial deterioration in water quality from its utility point of view as a condenser cooling medium and raw water input for DM plant.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				AUG	2017	189	8							399	10.1007/s10661-017-6095-z								WOS:000410241300003	28718095

More than four million people living in this megacity use groundwater for drinking, industrial and household purposes. Thus, major ion and trace element content were assessed in order to investigate the main hydrochemical properties of groundwater and determine if groundwater of the area poses a threat to the MMA population. Hierarchical cluster analysis using all the groundwater chemical data showed five groups of water. The first two groups were classified as recharge waters (Ca-HCO3) coming from the foothills of mountain belts. The third group was also of Ca-HCO3 water type flowing through lutites and limestones. Transition zone waters of group four (Ca-HCO3-SO4) flow through the valley of Monterrey, whereas discharge waters of group 5 (Ca-SO4) were found toward the north and northeast of the MMA. Principal component analysis performed in groundwater data indicates four principal components (PCs). PC1 included major ions Si, Co, Se, and Zn, suggesting that these are derived by rock weathering. Other trace elements such as As, Mo, Mn, and U are coupled in PC2 because they show redox sensitive properties. PC3 indicates that Pb and Cu could be the less mobile elements in groundwater. Although groundwater supplied to MMA showed a high-quality, high mineralized waters of group 5 have NO3- concentrations higher than the maximum value proposed by international guidelines and SO42-, NO3-, and total dissolved solid concentrations higher than the maximum levels allowed by the Mexican normative.

Comparative study of the effects of a small-scale trout farm on the macrozoobenthos, potamoplankton, and epilithic diatom communities	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Trout farms are one of the major sources of pollution of highland streams and rivers, which are very sensitive ecosystems otherwise scarcely influenced by human activities. A trout farm with low annual production was chosen for comparative monitoring of its effects on the macrozoobenthos, epilithic diatom, and potamoplankton communities in the receiving stream. Research was conducted every 2 months during a period of 1 year (one control point and three localities downstream from the farm). The fish farm discharge induced moderate alteration of environmental factors in the receiving watercourse, viz., significant increase of the ionized and un-ionized ammonia fraction, dissolved oxygen concentration, and biological oxygen demand. Species richness and Simpson's diversity index did not change in any of the communities. Correspondent analysis of potamoplankton community composition clearly showed trout farm effects, thereby indicating the need for reevaluation of saprobic valence values for potamoplankton species. The complete lack of influence of the trout farm discharge on the epilithic diatom community is probably due to absence of significant changes of phosphorus concentration in the receiving stream. Effects of the trout farm on the macrozoobenthos community were further characterized by 14 additional indices. The percentages of Chironomidae larvae, shredders, and total collectors; ratio of shredders to collectors; and the family biotic index are suggested as candidates for future multimetric index for measuring of trout farm influence.

Developing an environmental water quality monitoring program for Haraz River in Northern Iran	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Water quality management plans are an indispensable strategy for conservation and utilization of water resources in a sustainable manner. One common industrial use of water is aquaculture. The present study is an attempt to use statistical analyses in order to prepare an environmental water quality monitoring program for Haraz River, in Northern Iran. For this purpose, the analysis of a total number of 18 physicochemical parameters was performed at 15 stations during a 1-year sampling period. According to the results of the multivariate statistical methods, the optimal monitoring would be possible by only 3 stations and 12 parameters, including NH3, EC, BOD, TSS, DO, PO4, NO3, TDS, temperature, turbidity, coliform, and discharge. In other words, newly designed network, with a total number of 36 measurements (3 stations x 12 parameters = 36 parameters), could achieve exactly the same performance as the former network, designed based on 234 measurements (13 stations x 18 parameters = 234 parameters). Based on the results of cluster, principal component, and factor analyses, the stations were divided into three groups of high pollution (HP), medium pollution (MP), and low pollution (LP). By clustering the stations, it would be possible to track the water quality of Haraz River, only by one station at each cluster, which facilitates rapid assessment of the water quality in the river basin. Emphasizing on three main axes of monitoring program, including measurement parameters, sampling frequency, and spatial pattern of sampling points, the water quality monitoring program was optimized for the river basin based on natural conditions of the study area, monitoring objectives, and required financial resources (a total annual cost of about US $2625, excluding the overhead costs).																	0167-6369	1573-2959				AUG	2017	189	8							410	10.1007/s10661-017-6125-x								WOS:000410241300014	28733786

Quality assessment of groundwater from the south-eastern Arabian Peninsula	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Assessment of groundwater quality plays a significant role in the utilization of the scarce water resources globally and especially in arid regions. The increasing abstraction together with man-made contamination and seawater intrusion have strongly affected groundwater quality in the Arabia Peninsula, exemplified by the investigation given here from the United Arab Emirates, where the groundwater is seldom reviewed and assessed. In the aim of assessing current groundwater quality, we here present a comparison of chemical data linked to aquifers types. The results reveal that most of the investigated groundwater is not suitable for drinking, household, and agricultural purposes following the WHO permissible limits. Aquifer composition and climate have vital control on the water quality, with the carbonate aquifers contain the least potable water compared to the ophiolites and Quaternary clastics. Seawater intrusion along coastal regions has deteriorated the water quality and the phenomenon may become more intensive with future warming climate and rising sea level.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				AUG	2017	189	8							411	10.1007/s10661-017-6092-2								WOS:000410241300015	28735434

Spatial patterns of DOC concentration and DOM optical properties in a Brazilian tropical river-wetland system	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												The Cerrado (savanna) and Pantanal (wetland) biomes of Central Western Brazil have experienced significant development activity in recent decades, including extensive land cover conversion from natural ecosystems to agriculture and urban expansion. The Cuiaba River transects the Cerrado biome prior to inundating large areas of the Pantanal, creating one of the largest biodiversity hot spots in the world. We measured dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and the optical absorbance and fluorescence properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from 40 sampling locations spanning Cerrado and Pantanal biomes during wet and dry seasons. In the upper, more agricultural region of the basin, DOC concentrations were highest in the rainy season with more aromatic and humified DOM. In contrast, DOC concentrations and DOM optical properties were more uniform for the more urbanized middle region of the basin between wet and dry seasons, as well as across sample locations. In the lower region of the basin, wet season connectivity between the river and the Pantanal floodplain led to high DOC concentrations, a fourfold increase in humification index (HIX) (an indicator of DOM humification), and a 50% reduction in the spectral slope (S-R). Basin-wide, wet season values for S-R, HIX, and FI (fluorescence index) indicated an increasing representation of terrestrially derived DOM that was more humified. Parallel factor analysis identified two terrestrially derived components (C1 and C2) representing 77% of total fluorescing DOM (fDOM). A third, protein-like fDOM component increased markedly during the wet season within the more urban-impacted region.

A Greener UV and Peroxide-Based Chemical Oxygen Demand Test	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Water quality assessment typically includes the determination of chemical oxygen demand (COD) by oxidation of organic matter with Cr(VI) in an acidic medium followed by digestion. Unfortunately, the required reagents are harmful and the reaction times are rather long. We investigated earlier the use of H2O2 as a more environmentally friendly oxidizing agent to replace the hazardous chromates. In the present study, we have furthered this possibility by incorporating the use of H2O2 in the presence of UV light. A protocol has been devised and tested with standards and real samples that replaces toxic Cr(VI), halves the amount of silver sulfate required, and greatly reduces the necessary reaction time, thus yielding a faster and more environmentally sound method.

J	Chen, RS; Tsai, CM				Chen, Rong-Song; Tsai, Chan-Ming			Development of an Evaluation System for Sustaining Reservoir Functions-A Case Study of Shiwen Reservoir in Taiwan	SUSTAINABILITY												Reservoirs serve as important facilities, providing a stable source of public water in Taiwan. As construction of new reservoirs becomes more difficult, it is essential to ensure sustainable functionality of reservoirs in the future. To this end, this study proposes a system for reservoir sustainability evaluation. The evaluation system consists of social justice, environmental protection, and economic development containing 12 indicators which are grouped into six categories: flood control, sediment management, water resources allocation, river ecology, water quality, and benefit and fairness. Moreover, evaluation system operational procedures to supplement planning and decision-making processes are proposed, and applied in a case study of the Shiwen reservoir planning in Taiwan. The planned reservoir in this case study is rated as "Good", nearly "Excellent", in sustainability as evaluated with the Sustainability Confidence Index (SCI). Additionally, Analytic Network Process (ANP) results indicate that the flood control capacity and sediment management are the first and second most important indicators for the reservoir. If desilting operations had been conducted, the SCI values would have increased from 3.3 to 3.7, warranting an "Excellent" rating for the reservoir. The case study demonstrates that decision-makers can apply the proposed system when managing reservoir evaluations.																	2071-1050					AUG	2017	9	8							1387	10.3390/su9081387								WOS:000408861800102

The method can effectively connect the natural characteristics of watershed water sources, three-level zoning of water resources, and comprehensively consider the pollution distribution, socio-economics and many other factors. The zoning process includes four steps: (1) Generate the multi-level hydrological unit; (2) Identify the multi-element water catchment units; (3) Obtain the control unit with the administrative boundary as the boundary; (4) Check and adjust the results to meet the actual needs. Based on this method, the Yangtze River Basin was divided into 568 control units with a total area of 1.91 million km(2). These control units were used as the basic unit to analyze the water quality status and the results show that the upper reaches have good water quality, while the lower reaches have poor water quality and more serious water pollution. Our study helps the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China develop the list of control units that are needed to improve water quality during the 13th Five-Year Plan, with a goal to provide technical support for control-unit-based water pollution prevention and control in the future.

These systems are found to retain brackish characteristics until total desalination is achieved. To evaluate the effects of salinity on the organic substances released from the sediment, a laboratory water-sediment column experiment was conducted to assess associated changes in water quality variables such as the sediment oxygen demand (SOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and concentrations of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). Under high salinity conditions, the release of N from the sediment was promoted with the enhancement of SOD and COD. This trend was accounted for by the response of the microorganisms (cell breakdown of algae and suppression of metabolic activity). Our results suggest that chemicals (N, P, and COD) released from sediment and its overall impact on the water quality of a brackish lake should vary depending on the temporal and spatial dynamics of the salinity.

J	Liyanage, CP; Yamada, K				Liyanage, Chamara P.; Yamada, Koichi			Impact of Population Growth on the Water Quality of Natural Water Bodies	SUSTAINABILITY												Human activities pose a significant threat to the water quality of rivers when pollution exceeds the threshold limit. Urban activities in particular are highlighted as one of the major causes of contamination in surface water bodies in Asian countries. Evaluation of sustainable human population capacities in river watersheds is necessary to maintain better freshwater ecosystems in a country while achieving its development goals as a nation. We evaluated the correlation between the growth rate of the population in a watershed area and water quality parameters of a river ecosystem. The Kelani River in Sri Lanka was selected for the study. The highest correlation coefficients of 0.7, 0.69, 0.69 (p < 0.01) corresponding to biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), dissolved oxygen (DO) and total coliform (TC) were obtained with the population in watersheds of the Kelani river in Sri Lanka. Thus, we propose a quantitative approach to estimating the population capacity of watersheds based on water quality classification standards (WQCS), employing the Bayesian network (BN) classification model. The optimum population ranges were obtained from the probability distribution table of the population node in the BN. The results showed that the population density should be approximately less than 2375 to keep the water quality in the watershed for bathing and drinking purposes and approximately less than 2672 for fish and other aquatic organisms. This research will offer a means that can used to understand the impact of population on water quality in river basins and confer direct influence on natural water bodies.																	2071-1050					AUG	2017	9	8							1405	10.3390/su9081405								WOS:000408861800120

Some of these initiatives were direct responses to the evolving challenges in the water sector, and put forest hydrological services into perspective. To a certain extent, water was managed within a wider environmental context through the combination of forest and water management. However, the efforts to enhance forest hydrological services did not correspond to the immense potential of forests for the achievement of sustainable water management. We present a comprehensive and current view of the major challenges and opportunities related to forest hydrological services in South Korea. We identify key forest hydrological services in view of the major biophysical, environmental, and economic challenges in the water sector. We propose guidelines for the enhancement of forest hydrological services and for a better inclusion of these services in South Korea's sustainable development strategy. An increased contribution of forests to the provision of high-quality water in sufficient, regulated amounts, and to the preservation of a safe environment in regards to natural hazards is imperative for the long-term development of South Korea.

J	Shen, MH; Yang, YL				Shen, Manhong; Yang, Yongliang			The Water Pollution Policy Regime Shift and Boundary Pollution: Evidence from the Change of Water Pollution Levels in China	SUSTAINABILITY												Boundary environmental pollution and pollution spillovers are important issues for improving the water quality of trans-boundary rivers. This paper explores the empirical effects of the evolution of the pollution reduction mandates on boundary pollution by studying the change of water pollution levels (as proxied by pH, BOD, COD and NH3-N) of key state monitoring stations from 2004 to 2014. The empirical findings support the existence of boundary pollution and indicate the association between environmental policy and boundary pollution levels using propensity score matching, although the relation is conditional on which water pollution measure is considered. The pollution levels of monitoring stations on provincial borders are significantly higher than those of interior monitoring stations. The pollution of tributaries is more serious than that of the main stream, which was quickly reversed after the pollution reduction mandates changed. The improvement of the water environment showed great differences with the change of policy when we compare the water quality of monitoring stations in the upper reaches of provincial borders with the water quality downstream of provincial borders. Our empirical analysis finds strong evidence of strategic polluting across provincial borders. Local officials may manipulate pollution within their jurisdictions, and the overall pollution reduction target will exacerbate border pollution, whereas water quality inspection can reduce marginal pollution. Finally, we further validate the net impact of the policies on boundary pollution using a difference in difference (DID) approach.

This paper tracks the change trajectories of rural household livelihoods and regional ecological footprints in four water source areas of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project where various ecological and environmental protection projects and measures are being proposed to protect water quality. As a result, some concerns regarding rural livelihood have arisen. The sustainable livelihood approach developed by DFID (Department for International Development in UK) was used to measure the natural, physical, financial, human, and social capitals of rural livelihoods, while the ecological footprint accounting approach was used to calculate the amount of bio-productive spaces that produce the yearly resource flows for human consumption. The study period is 2000-2014 and data was obtained from the Statistical Yearbooks. The results show that the change trend of natural capitals of rural households, which have increased by 72.5% (SY), 98.8% (NY), 69.3% (TA), and 120.3% (JN) within 15 years, determine the overall change track of rural livelihoods and that rural household livelihood grows with the expansion of regional ecological footprints. Sensitivity of regional eco-footprints to rural livelihood varies from 5.8 to 0.5 in case areas. It is recommended that in the "post South-to-North Water Diversion era", four policy instruments-population transfer and relocation, industrial restructuring and updating, rural infrastructure and community reconstruction, and cross-ecological compensation-should be adopted to improve sustainable livelihoods in these four water source areas.

Srinivasa			Correlation between corrosion indices and corrosiveness of groundwater: a study with reference to selected areas of Krishna District, Andhra Pradesh, India	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The aim of the present study was to determine the aggressiveness of groundwater samples towards corrosion of various commercially important metals and to study the correlation between theoretical and experimental values of corrosiveness. For this purpose, 20 groundwater samples were collected in different mandals of Krishna District, Andhra Pradesh, India, and the metals selected were carbon steel, aluminium, copper and cupronickel alloy. The corrosiveness was determined by using gravimetric measurements. Further, corrosion and scaling indices, namely Langelier index (LI), aggressive index (AI), Ryznar index (RI), Puckorius index (PI) and Larson-Skold index (LS), were calculated with the help of various water quality parameters of all the samples to estimate their corrosivity. The experimental values of corrosion rates were attempted to correlate with various indices calculated and quality parameters determined in case of all the samples. It is observed that there is a significant lack of correlation between the indices and corrosion rates. Among the five indices taken into account, LI, AI and RI indicate scaling tendency of water samples, as inferred by their mean values, 0.657, 12.576 and 6.612, respectively, while the other two indices, PI and LS with the mean values of 8.141 and 1.188, respectively, suggest the corrosive behaviour. Further, the mean values of correlation coefficients, 0.18 and 0.27 for PI and LS, respectively, are higher compared with those for LI, AI and RI. The mean values of correlation coefficients of dissolved oxygen, chlorides and electrolytic conductivity are 0.33, 0.25 and 0.25, respectively, which are relatively higher compared with those of other quality parameters. The probable reasons for low correlation coefficients are explored based on the statistical data. Also, it was concluded that one of the significant factors, namely dissolved oxygen which has strong influence on corrosion of metals, was considered in none of the indices, leading to very low correlation between the theoretical and experimental values of corrosiveness.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				AUG	2017	76	16							568	10.1007/s12665-017-6908-y								WOS:000408499100022

This thematic issue, which was initiated by four water- related research associations (German Hydrological Society; German Limnological Society; Hydrological Sciences Commission within German Water Association; Working Group Hydrology within German Geographical Society), is a testimony of both the quality and diversity of the water research currently undertaken by Germany's scientific community. Key topics include hydrology and hydromorphology; water quality; aquatic and riparian ecosystems; water in agriculture and forestry; and water management and supply. The manuscripts contained in this thematic issue do not only cover a period of more than two millennia, but also address all types of water resources and a multitude of both established and newly developed methods that help us to better understand the processes governing the hydrological cycle, aquatic ecosystems and the management and operation of various water infrastructures.

In order to assess this, groundwater, river water and mine water samples were collected from Korba Coalfield and analysed for potentially toxic trace elements (PTEs) along with in situ parameters. Thereby, an integrated approach of pollution evaluation indices [heavy metal pollution index (HPI), heavy metal evaluation index (HEI) and contamination index (Cd)] and statistical techniques are applied to the results. Paired-sample t tests reveal that the PTE concentrations of the pre-monsoon samples are higher than those of the post-monsoon samples. At a few locations, the concentration of Fe (56%), As (56%), Al (26%), Mn (19%) in pre-monsoon and Mn (46%), Ni (15%), Ba (15%), Pb (8%) in post-monsoon seasons exceeds the acceptable limit of Indian drinking standards. However, HPI values are below the critical pollution index value of 100 in both seasons in spite of an excess of these elements. The pollution indices evaluated by the multiple of the mean values approach reveal that 100, 94, 87% of the pre-monsoon and 92, 92, 85% of the post-monsoon samples belong to the "low-to-medium'' category with respect to the HPI, HEI and Cd indices. The thematic map depicting the spatial distribution of the contamination index (Cd) testifies the role of a `` dilution effect'' that results in lower pollution loads in the post-monsoon samples than the pre-monsoon ones. The results of cluster analysis confirm that the quality of the water is mainly controlled by geogenic processes and anthropogenic inputs, besides dilution effects.

Major ions and water isotopes were measured. Results show that hydrological processes and hydrogeochemical evolution of shallow groundwater were greatly disturbed by human activities. Excessive pumping resulted in significant declines of groundwater levels over the study area. This also induced infiltration of surface water into groundwater. A groundwater depression cone was the conflux center of groundwater surrounded by recharge zones including alluvial fans and surface water in alluvial plain. Pumping almost was the only way to discharge groundwater. Emission of SOx and NOx contributed at least 11% of rock weathering by dissolving into infiltrating precipitation. Surface waters containing sewage replenished ambient groundwater with an average mixing ratio of 74 +/- 17% due to groundwater level drawdown. As a result, groundwater had elevated concentrations of Na+ and SO42- with Na+ exchanged into aquifer sediments. About 29 +/- 16% of Na+ was exchanged from groundwater into soil matrix. Agriculture nitrate was high only in the recharge zones. The most important result is that the transformation of the study area from a place rich in water resource into an area lack of water just took several decades with the joint action of the heavily human activities. Our study also indicates that shallow groundwater could sensitively respond to and record environmental changes.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				AUG	2017	76	16							571	10.1007/s12665-017-6918-9								WOS:000408499100025

Groundwater appraisal of Dhekiajuli, Assam, India: an insight of agricultural suitability and arsenic enrichment	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The present work is an effort to develop an appraisal of the hydrogeochemical regime for the aquifers of Dhekiajuli, Sonitpur district, Assam, which is imperative considering: (i) excessive use of groundwater for irrigation; (ii) reported high arsenic (As) contamination; (iii) application of fertilizer is an inevitable process undergoing in this region to achieve higher yield owing to deteriorating water quality; and (iv) study area being the location of many tea estates of Assam, that export tea in many foreign countries. The highest As concentration of 44.39 mu g/L was detected in this study (Bachasimalu and Sitalmari region), implying high As-contaminated aquifers being used for drinking and irrigation purposes in the area. The relative abundance pattern of major cations and anions was in the order of Na+ > Mg2+ > Ca2+ > K+ and HCO3- > Cl- > SO42-, respectively. Majority of the samples belong to Na+-K+-Cl--HCO3- and mixed water type. Closer inspection of Piper plot reveals that a higher As value ( > 40 mu g/L) was prevalent in HCO3- water type. Results of hydrogeochemical plots suggest silicate and carbonate weathering, ion exchange and anthropogenic activities to be the dominant processes governing groundwater contamination, including As which is further supported from PCA loadings. The Singri area to the east of the affected areas and adjacent to the Brahmaputra River has oxic aquifers owing to the absence of mass deposition of younger sediments, while reducing conditions prevails in the Bachasimalu and Sitalmari region. High positive correlation between As and Fe (r = 0.83**) and a negative correlation between ORP and Fe (r = -0.68**) further add that Fe (hydr)oxides are the direct source of As release in the affected region, the mechanism being reductive hydrolysis of such (hydr) oxides. The study implies that although groundwater is suitable for irrigation use, there is a high probability of As getting into the food chain through tea and other edible plants irrigated with As-contaminated water; thus, the area has a maximum probability of facing health hazards caused by As-contaminated groundwater.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				AUG	2017	76	15							530	10.1007/s12665-017-6841-0								WOS:000407545200023

The model was calibrated and validated for hydrology, sediment and water quality for the period 2003-2012. The model was run under two climate changes, two land use changes and four combined change scenarios for near-future period (2020-2049). The results revealed that projected climate change impacts include an increase in streamflow (maximum increases of 52% under RCP 2.6 in December and 170% under RCP 8.5). Projected sediment concentrations under climate change scenarios showed a monthly average decrease of 10%. For land use change scenarios, agricultural development scenario indicated an opposite direction of changes in orthophosphate (increases in all months with an average increase of 6% under agricultural development scenario), leading to the conclusion that land use change is the dominant factor in nutrient concentration changes. Combined impacts results indicated that streamflows in late fall and winter months increased while in summer and early fall decreased. Suspended sediment and orthophosphate concentrations were decreased in all months except for increases in suspended sediment concentrations in September and October and orthophosphate concentrations in late winter and early spring due to the impact of land use change scenarios.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				AUG	2017	76	15							543	10.1007/s12665-017-6880-6								WOS:000407545200036

As part of the waterway for the South-to-North Water Diversion Project of China, the water quality and trophic status of Lake Dongping are crucial for the successful operation of this project. In order to better understand the controlling factors of water quality and trophic status of Lake Dongping and to provide data for studying ecological baseline of lake restoration, the distribution and the controlling factors of subfossil chironomids were studied here. Our results show that a total of 41 taxa of subfossil chironomids are present in Lake Dongping. The dominant taxa consist of Stempellinella-Zavrelia (30.88%), Propsilocerus akamusi-type (26.79%), Paratanytarsus (13.15%), Cricotopus sylvestris-type (9.12%), and Hydrobaenus conformis-type (6.67%). Among them, the nutrient-tolerant taxa of Stempellinella-Zavrelia and eutrophic taxa of Propsilocerus akamusi-type are widely present in the lake, indicating that Lake Dongping is in a transition from mesotrophication to eutrophication. Redundancy analysis reveals that total phosphorus, water depth, and sulfate (SO42-) concentrations are dominant factors controlling the spatial distribution of subfossil chironomids, which explain 12, 9, and 8.5% of the variance, respectively. Therefore, in order to secure the water quality for the South-to-North Water Diversion Project, it is crucial to regulate the input of nutrient and sulfate to Lake Dongping.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				AUG	2017	76	15							524	10.1007/s12665-017-6858-4								WOS:000407545200017

Here, we present a regional assessment of human marker prevalence among drainages that discharge to the U.S. southern California coast. Approximately 50 samples were analyzed for the HF183 human marker from each of 22 southern California coastal drainages under summer dry weather conditions, and another 50 samples were targeted from each of 23 drainages during wet weather. The HF183 marker was ubiquitous, detected in all but two sites in dry weather and at all sites during wet weather. However, there was considerable difference in the extent of human fecal contamination among sites. Similar site ranking was produced regardless of whether the assessment was based on frequency of HF183 detection or site average HF183 concentration. However, site ranking differed greatly between dry and wet weather. Site ranking also differed greatly when based on enterococci, which do not distinguish between pollution sources, vs. HF183, which distinguishes higher risk human fecal sources from other sources, indicating the additional value of the human-associated marker as a routine monitoring tool.																	1660-4601					AUG	2017	14	8							874	10.3390/ijerph14080874								WOS:000408684300044

The total PAH concentrations were 554.3 to 723.2 ng/L in the influent and 189.6 to 262.7 ng/L in the effluent. The removal efficiencies of Sigma PAHs in the dissolved phase ranged from 63 to 69%, with the highest observed in naphthalene (80% removal). Concentration and distribution of PAHs revealed that the higher molecular weight PAHs became more concentrated with treatment in both the dissolved phase and the dewatered sludge. The sharpest reduction was observed during the pretreatment and the biological phase. Noncarcinogenic risk, carcinogenic risk, and total health risk of PAHs found in the effluent and sewage sludge were also assessed. The effluent BaP toxic equivalent quantities (TEQ(BaP)) were above, or far above, standards in countries. The potential toxicities of PAHs in sewage effluent were approximately 10 to 15 times higher than the acceptable risk level in China. The health risk associated with the sewage sludge also exceeded international recommended levels and was mainly contributed from seven carcinogenic PAHs. Given that WWTP effluent is a major PAH contributor to surface water bodies in China and better reduction efficiencies are achievable, the present study highlights the possibility of utilizing WWTPs for restoring water quality in riverine and coastal regions heavily impacted by PAHs contamination.

Within the protected area of the red line area, the Qilihai wetland is an important ecotope with complex ecological functions, although the ecosystem is seriously disturbed due to anthropogenic activities in the surrounding areas. This study assesses the water quality status of the Qilihai wetlands to identify the pollution sources and potential improvements based on the ecological red line policy, to improve and protect the waters of the Qilihai wetlands. An indicator system was established to assess water quality status using single factor evaluation and a comprehensive evaluation method, supported by data from 2010 to 2013. Assessment results show that not all indicators met the requirement of the Environmental Quality Standards for Surface Water (GB3838-2002) and that overall, waters in the Qilihai wetland were seriously polluted. Based on these findings we propose restrictions on all polluting anthropogenic activities in the red line area and implementation of restoration projects to improve water quality.

The objectives were to: reveal changes in the flow regime, assess anomalies in summer river flows, estimate the natural and wastewater effluent contribution and provide an ecological context for the in-stream conditions. The mean annual flow rate in the period 1996-2015 increased by 0.61 m(3)/s as compared to 1951-1970. The mean annual wastewater inflow rate to the river in 2015 was approximately 0.770 m(3)/s, constituting 39% of the observed flow. Almost the entire period of August this contribution approached 100%. The optimum river water temperature threshold for warm-water fish species was exceeded. Streamflow modifications are attributed to an increase of wastewater discharge, urban impact through an increase in imperviousness, and the variability of climatic driving forces.																	1747-6585	1747-6593				AUG	2017	31	3					345	352		10.1111/wej.12249								WOS:000408947500006

Timing of organic carbon release from mountain pine beetle impacted ponderosa pine forests in South Dakota	WATER AND ENVIRONMENT JOURNAL												The decay of mountain pine beetle (MPB) (Dendroctonus ponderosae) affected ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests has increased organic carbon (OC) loading within the Rapid Creek watershed in the Black Hills of South Dakota, with total OC (TOC) concentrations up to 6.2 mgL(-1) observed in 2015. The impacts of large-scale tree mortality on water quality were delayed. OC concentrations in the watershed correlated with recent MPB impact stage progression. Regional ponderosa pine forests that were 3 and 6 years after MPB infection (grey and snagfall phases) exhibited increased OC loading within the Rapid Creek watershed. A better understanding of regional watershed response patterns for MPB tree mortality may assist with mitigating ancillary water quality impacts.																	1747-6585	1747-6593				AUG	2017	31	3					375	379		10.1111/wej.12253								WOS:000408947500010

This study investigated the responses of streamflow and NPS pollutant loads to climate change in the 3S River Basin, a trans-boundary basin of the Mekong River, using Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Firstly, the SWAT model in simulations of streamflow and NPS pollutant loads was calibrated and validated against observed data to prove the reliability of the simulation results. Then, the calibrated SWAT model was used to simulate changes in streamflow and NPS pollutants under the impact of climate change. The simulation results indicated that the streamflow and NPS pollutant loads are predicted to increase in the future. Moreover, water shortage in the dry season and soil degradation in the wet season are emphasized to occur in the future.

J	Shoemaker, C; Kroger, R				Shoemaker, Cory; Kroger, Robert			Frequentist and Bayesian Approaches to Understanding Changes in Redox Potential Due to Hydrology and Vegetation in Agricultural Drainage Ditches	WETLANDS												Excess nutrient loading from agricultural landscapes contributes to downstream water quality degradation. To mitigate these issues, agricultural drainage ditches have recently gained attention as potential sites for nutrient reduction. We examined the effects of vegetation and hydrology on oxidation-reduction (redox) potential. Testing occurred in an agricultural drainage ditch fitted with weirs in the summer of 2012. Redox potential was recorded using continuous automated data loggers and analyzed using both frequentist and Bayesian methods. Significant difference was found when analyzing redox potential response to vegetation (t = -1.75, P = 0.08, df = 9754) and hydrology treatments (t = 7.51, P < 0.001, df = 9754) in a frequentist manner. Vegetation and hydrologic treatments were significant when analyzed using Bayesian methods; however, the interactions of the two terms had the greatest posterior weights. This study suggests that the innovative use of vegetation and controlled drainage can affect Eh, in particular Eh heterogeneity within ditch systems. Results obtained by analyzing these data in both a frequentist and Bayesian methods were similar in terms significance and magnitude. However, Bayesian methods, and their ability to incorporate prior information into a management framework, may be better suited for systems where previous information can be incorporated into analyses.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				AUG	2017	37	4					705	714		10.1007/s13157-017-0901-9								WOS:000408670000009

Mine drainage is a significant problem for riverine ecosystems, it is commonly acidic (AMD), but neutral mine drainage (NMD) can also occur. A representative environment for studying metal pollution from NMD is provided by carboniferous catchments characterised by a circumneutral pH and high concentrations of carbonates, supporting the formation of secondary metal-minerals as potential sinks of metals. The present study focuses on understanding the mobility of metal pollution associated with historical mining in a carboniferous upland catchment. In the uplands of the UK, river water, sediments and spoil wastes were collected over a period of fourteen months, samples were chemically analysed to identify the main metal sources and their relationships with geological and hydrological factors. Correlation tests and principal component analysis suggest that the underlying limestone bedrock controls pH and weathering reactions. Significant metal concentrations from mining activities were measured for zinc (4.3 mg l(-1)), and lead (0.3 mg l(-1)), attributed to processes such as oxidation of mined ores (e.g. sphalerite, galena) or dissolution of precipitated secondary metal-minerals (e.g. cerussite, smithsonite). Zinc and lead mobility indicated strong dependence on biogeochemistry and hydrological conditions (e.g. pH and flow) at specific locations in the catchment. Annual loads of zinc and lead (2.9 and 0.2 tonnes per year) demonstrate a significant source of both metals to downstream river reaches. Metal pollution results in a large area of catchment having a depleted chemical status with likely effects on the aquatic ecology. This study provides an improved understanding of geological and hydrological processes controlling water chemistry, which is critical to assessing metal sources and mobilization, especially in neutral mine drainage areas.

Twenty-four extensive green roofs representing all combinations of the following four design factors were used: native meadow species versus Sedum; mineral-based versus biologically derived planting medium; 10-cm versus 15-cm depth; and irrigation provided daily, sensor controlled, or not at all. From events covering the period May-October in 2013 and 2014, mean values were determined for the seasonal volumetric runoff coefficient (C-vol = 0.4), peak runoff coefficient (C-peak = 0.12), and U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) curve number (CN = 94). Irrigation had the largest overall impact: daily irrigation increased C-vol to 0.5 compared to 0.3 for systems with sensor-controlled or no irrigation. The biologically derived planting medium, composed of a high proportion of aged wood compost, made a significant improvement, maintaining C-vol of 0.3 compared to 0.4 for the mineral-based product in the modules without irrigation. A similar pattern was found in the NRCS curve numbers. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Small, off-channel dams are generally ignored in impact assessments owing to limited information and spatial resolution issues. Previous research on South African rivers showed correlative links between high density of small dams and associated reductions in low flows, poorer water quality, and impoverished aquatic macroinvertebrate communities that were dominated by opportunistic taxa instead of specialist groups. 2 .Since small dams are usually associated with catchment transformation (for example, vineyards, stock farming and exotic timber plantations), they are convenient surrogates of the impacts of catchment transformation on river functionality. Here, an index of cumulative small dams for South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland is presented and evaluated. 3.Fifty-two per cent of the water management catchments in the study region exceeded the threshold for the cumulative small dams density (SDD) index above which river functionality is compromised. This estimate of potentially affected catchments is considered to be conservative for reasons discussed. 4.The index results are compared with a recent systematic biodiversity planning exercise for setting biodiversity targets for freshwater areas of South Africa. Although the systematic planning included in-stream small dams within 50m of a river, analysis showed that 36% of all quaternaries that have high SDD score overlap with river reaches classified as natural' or largely natural'. 5.Disregarding dams outside the 50m buffer area equates to ignoring the majority of small dams (94%) in South Africa, and it is recommended that aquatic conservation assessments include the SDD index as a cost layer for prioritizing rivers for rehabilitation and conservation.

The results show that 69.2 +/- 28.6% of ammonium and 23.1 +/- 11.6% of the dissolved organic carbon were removed by the biologically enhanced activated carbon (BEAC) reactor. It is shown that higher biodegradable dissolved organic carbon enhances ammonium removal, even at low temperatures. The C/N ratio consumed by the BEAC reactor reached a steady value (i.e., 3.3) after 2 months of operation. Despite seasonal fluctuations and competition of the indigenous community, the heterotrophic nitrifying bacteria (Acinetobacter sp. HRBLi 16 and Acinetobacter harbinensis strain HITLi 7) remained relatively stable. The amount of carbon source was the most significant environmental parameter and dramatically affected the microbial community compositions in the BEAC reactor. The present study provides new insights into the application of a BEAC reactor for ammonium removal from drinking water, resisting strong seasonal changes.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				AUG	2017	24	24					19569	19582		10.1007/s11356-017-9522-3								WOS:000408363200010	28681296

It was calibrated by using measured turbidity data from stations along the reservoir and satellite images based on a flood event in 2013. In June 2013, there was heavy rainfall for two consecutive days on the frozen and snow-covered ground in the higher elevations of western Alberta, Canada. The runoff from the rainfall and the melted snow caused one of the largest recorded inflows to the headwaters of the South Saskatchewan River and Lake Diefenbaker downstream. An estimated discharge peak of over 5200 m(3)/s arrived at the reservoir inlet with a thick sediment front within a few days. The sediment plume moved quickly through the entire reservoir and remained visible from satellite images for over 2 weeks along most of the reservoir, leading to concerns regarding water quality. The aims of this study are to compare, quantitatively and qualitatively, the efficacy of using turbidity data and satellite images for sediment transport model calibration and to determine how accurately a sediment transport model can simulate sediment transport based on each of them. Both turbidity data and satellite images were very useful for calibrating the sediment transport model quantitatively and qualitatively. Model predictions and turbidity measurements show that the flood water and suspended sediments entered upstream fairly well mixed and moved downstream as overflow with a sharp gradient at the plume front. The model results suggest that the settling and resuspension rates of sediment are directly proportional to flow characteristics and that the use of constant coefficients leads to model underestimation or overestimation unless more data on sediment formation become available. Hence, this study reiterates the significance of the availability of data on sediment distribution and characteristics for building a robust and reliable sediment transport model.

Aquatic ecotoxicity of ashes from Brazilian savanna wildfires	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												In a global scenario of climate change, several studies have predicted an increase in fires in different parts of the world. With the occurrence of rains following the fires in the Brazilian savanna (Cerrado biome), the compounds present in ashes may enter aquatic environments and cause adverse effects to these ecosystems. In this context, this study evaluated the potential toxicity of ashes from two areas of Cerrado and an area of pasture, through ecotoxicological bioassays and using three aquatic species from distinct trophic levels, which were exposed to different dilutions of ashes: the microcrustacean Ceriodaphnia dubia, the fish Danio rerio and the mollusc Biomphalaria glabrata. The ashes from the three sampled areas showed higher concentrations of some elements in relation to the soil samples (B, Ca, K, Mg, Mn, P, S, Si, Sr, Zn), but only a small quantity of these compounds was solubilised. Our data showed that all ash samples caused acute toxicity to C. dubia (48hs-LC50 = 13.4 g L-1; 48hs-LC50 = 6.33 g L-1; 48hs-LC50 = 9.73 g L-1 respectively for transition area, pasture, typical cerrado areas), while in relation to D. rerio and B. glabrata, no acute toxicity was observed when they were exposed to ashes from native Cerrado vegetation and pasture areas. Ashes from a transition area showed toxicity for D. rerio (48hs-LC50 = 25.0 g L-1); possibly, this was due to the combination of multiple preponderant inorganic elements of ashes with other organic compounds not analysed, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). In summary, these results suggest that wildfires may pose risks to zooplankton communities and emphasize the need for more studies to better understand the complexity of the ecological effects of fire on aquatic ecosystems.

As it is biocompatible, widely available, and economically feasible, chitosan mushroom has high potential to be a suitable replacement for alum. Also, it can be a promising alternative to chitosan obtained traditionally from Crustaceans due to its higher zeta potential and homogeneity based on the raw material required for its production. A wide range of coagulant dose (5-60 mg l(-1)) and wastewater pH (2-12) were taken into account to find the optimal conditions of coagulation. The optimal doses are 10 and 20 mg l(-1) at best pH (11 and 3) when treated with kaolin and palm oil mill effluent, respectively, while 1200 mg l(-1) of alum was not enough to reach the efficiency of chitosan mushroom. On the other hand, the optimum dose of chitosan mushroom (20 mg l(-1)) at pH 3 of pome produced (75, 73, and 98%) removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), and total suspended solids (TSS), respectively. The significant potential of chitosan mushroom was proved by zeta potential measurement. Indeed, it possesses the highest zeta potential (+70 mV) as compared to the traditional chitosan produced from crustaceans. In short, chitosan mushroom as a biocoagulant is eco-friendly and it enhances water quality that meets the requirements of environmental conservatives.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				AUG	2017	24	24					20104	20112		10.1007/s11356-017-9560-x								WOS:000408363200059	28702910

Hepatic transcriptomic profiles from barramundi, Lates calcarifer, as a means of assessing organism health and identifying stressors in rivers in northern Queensland	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Resource managers need to differentiate between sites with and without contaminants and those where contaminants cause impacts. Potentially, transcriptomes could be used to evaluate sites where contaminant-induced effects may occur, to identify causative stressors of effects and potential adverse outcomes. To test this hypothesis, the hepatic transcriptomes in Barramundi, a perciforme teleost fish, (Lates calcarifer) from two reference sites, two agriculturally impacted sites sampled during the dry season, and an impacted site sampled during the wet season were compared. The hepatic transcriptome was profiled using RNA-Seq. Multivariate analysis showed that transcriptomes were clustered based on site and by inference water quality, but not sampling time. The largest differences in transcriptomic profile were between reference sites and a site sampled during high run-off, showing that impacted sites can be identified via RNA-Seq. Transcripts with altered abundance were linked to xenobiotic metabolism, peroxisome proliferation and stress responses, indicating putative stressors with the potential for adverse outcomes in barramundi.

Efficacy and residual toxicity of a sodium hydroxide based ballast water treatment system for freshwater bulk freighters	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The efficacy and residual toxicity of a sodium hydroxide (NaOH) based ballast water treatment system (BWTS) were tested aboard the Great Lakes carrier M/V American Spirit in 1000 L mesocosms containing water from the ship's ballast tanks. NaOH was added to elevate the pH to 11.5 or 11.7 for 48 h, after which pH was reduced to <9 before discharge by sparging with carbon dioxide to form sodium bicarbonate. In 4 trials, pH 11.7 NaOH BW was highly effective in reducing the densities of organisms relative to uptake water and met the ballast water discharge standards of the US Coast Guard (USCG), the US Environmental Protection Agency vessel general permit (USEPA VGP) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) G8 for the classes of regulated organisms: >= 50 mu m, >= 10 mu m to <50 mu m and indicator bacteria <10 mu m. In addition, densities of heterotrophic bacteria were reduced >96% in pH 11.7 treated discharge water relative to uptake densities. Seven day whole effluent toxicity tests indicated pH 11.7 NaOH BW met the USEPA VGP daily maximum criteria for residual toxicity. Organism densities in uptake water did not meet the minimum densities for IMO G8 shipboard test validity in 2 of 4 trials for organisms >= 10 mu m to <50 mu m or in any trials for the <10 mu m size class. The high efficacy and low residual toxicity observed indicates that a NaOH BWTS has great potential for successfully treating large volumes of ballast water released into freshwater systems.

However, the development of these mineral resources has significant environmental impacts that often go unnoticed. This paper presents an overview of the Liberian mining sector from historical, current development, and economic perspectives. The efforts made by government to address issues of environmental management and sustainable development expressed in national and international frameworks, as well as some of the environmental challenges in the mining sector are analyzed. A case study was conducted on one of the iron ore mines (China Union Bong Mines Investment) to analyze the effects of the water quality on the local water environment. The results show that the analyzed water sample concentrations were all above the WHO and Liberia water standard Class I guidelines for drinking water. Finally the paper examines the application of water footprint from a life cycle perspective in the Liberian mining sector and suggests some policy options for water resources management.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				AUG	2017	24	23					18711	18720		10.1007/s11356-017-9647-4								WOS:000407723100001

The quality of natural freshwater systems is easily disrupted by the introduction of pollutants from urban, industrial and agricultural processes. To assess the extent of chemical perturbation and associated environmental degradation, physico-chemical parameters have been monitored in conjunction with biota in numerous biological monitoring protocols. Most studies incorporating organisms into such approaches have focussed on fish and macroinvertebrates. More recently, interest in the ecology of parasites in relation to environmental monitoring has indicated that these organisms are sensitive towards the quality of the macroenvironment. Variable responses towards exposure to pollution have been identified at the population and component community level of a number of parasites. Furthermore, such responses have been found to differ with the type of pollutant and the lifestyle of the parasite. Generally, endoparasite infection levels have been shown to become elevated in relation to poorer water quality conditions, while ectoparasites are more sensitive, and exposure to contaminated environments resulted in a decline in ectoparasite infections. Furthermore, endoparasites have been found to be suitable accumulation indicators for monitoring levels of several trace elements and metals in the environment. The ability of these organisms to accumulate metals has further been observed to be of benefit to the host, resulting in decreased somatic metal levels in infected hosts. These trends have similarly been found for host-parasite models in African freshwater environments, but such analyses are comparatively sparse compared to other countries. Recently, studies on diplozoids from two freshwater systems have indicated that exposure to poorer water quality resulted in decreased infections. In the Vaal River, the poor water quality resulted in the extinction of the parasite from a site below the Vaal River Barrage. Laboratory exposures have further indicated that oncomiracidia of Paradiplozoon ichthyoxanthon are sensitive to exposure to dissolved aluminium. Overall, parasites from African freshwater and marine ecosystems have merit as effect and accumulation indicators; however, more research is required to detail the effects of exposure on sensitive biological processes within these organisms.

Knowledge on the spatial-temporal distribution of cyanobacterial blooms is therefore crucial for public health organizations and environmental agencies. In this study, field data and charge coupled device (CCD) image were collected in Lakes Gaoyang and Hanfeng of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR), China. We conducted the risky grade index (RGI) and coverage area index to develop a feasible estimation framework of cyanobacterial blooms. First, the close relationships between CCD reflectance spectral indices and water quality parameters were constructed based on water optical classification. Then, a regional algorithm for the RGI classification was established by density peaks. Finally, our proposed algorithm was applied to investigate dynamics of cyanobacterial blooms in the two lakes from 6-year series of CCD images. Encouraging results demonstrated that satellite remote sensing in conjunction with field observation can aid in the estimation of cyanobacterial blooms in the TGR.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				AUG	2017	24	23					19044	19056		10.1007/s11356-017-9544-x								WOS:000407723100027	28660506					
J	Li, B; Yang, GS; Wan, RR; Hormann, G				Li, Bing; Yang, Guishan; Wan, Rongrong; Hoermann, Georg			Dynamic water quality evaluation based on fuzzy matter-element model and functional data analysis, a case study in Poyang Lake	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Comprehensively evaluating water quality with a single method alone is challenging because water quality evaluation involves complex, uncertain, and fuzzy processes. Moreover, water quality evaluation is limited by finite water quality monitoring that can only represent water quality conditions at certain time points. Thus, the present study proposed a dynamic fuzzy matter-element model (D-FME) to comprehensively and continuously evaluate water quality status. D-FME was first constructed by introducing functional data analysis (FDA) theory into a fuzzy matter-element model and then validated using monthly water quality data for the Poyang Lake outlet (Hukou) from 2011 to 2012. Results showed that the finite water quality indicators were represented as dynamic functional curves despite missing values and irregular sampling time. The water quality rank feature curve was integrated by the D-FME model and revealed comprehensive and continuous variations in water quality. The water quality in Hukou showed remarkable seasonal variations, with the best water quality in summer and worst water quality in winter. These trends were significantly correlated with water level fluctuations (R = -0.71, p < 0.01). Moreover, the extension weight curves of key indicators indicated that total nitrogen and total phosphorus were the most important pollutants that influence the water quality of the Poyang Lake outlet. The proposed D-FME model can obtain scientific and intuitive results. Moreover, the D-FME model is not restricted to water quality evaluation and can be readily applied to other areas with similar problems.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				AUG	2017	24	23					19138	19148		10.1007/s11356-017-9371-0								WOS:000407723100036	28660517

Spectral absorption of non-algal particles [a (NAP)(lambda)] was similar to that of total particles for most samples, suggesting that the absorption of the total particles [a (p)(lambda)] was dominated by a (NAP)(lambda). The CDOM absorption spectra [a (CDOM)(lambda)] of West Liaohe and Taizihe rivers were easily distinguished from those of Hunhe, Liaohe, and East Liaohe rivers. Redundancy analysis indicated that absorption by optically active substances and anthropogenic nutrient disturbances probably resulted in the diversity of water quality parameters. The environmental variables including dissolved organic carbon, total alkalinity (TAlk), and total nitrogen (TN) had a significant correlation with CDOM absorption at 440 nm [a (CDOM)(440)]. There was almost no correlation between a (p)(lambda) and chlorophyll a, TN, total phosphorus, and TAlk. Moreover, total copper ion concentration and mercury ion concentration had a strong correlation with a (p)(440), a (p)(675), a (NAP)(440), and a (NAP)(675). The concentration of total aluminum ions exhibited a positive correlation with a (p)(675) and a (NAP)(675) (p < 0.05), and a significant correlation was observed between total arsenic concentration and a (CDOM)(440). Furthermore, the interaction between metal ions and optically active substances provided an insight into particulates and CDOM properties linked to water quality characteristics for rivers in semiarid areas.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				AUG	2017	24	23					19322	19337		10.1007/s11356-017-9480-9								WOS:000407723100053	28669093

Uncertainties in vegetated buffer strip function in controlling phosphorus export from agricultural land in the Canadian prairies	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Vegetated buffer strips (VBSs) are widely encouraged as a cost-effective strategy to address phosphorus (P) pollution associated with agricultural production. However, there is a lack of evidence in the effectiveness of these measures for tackling diffuse P pollution in cold-climate regions under concentrated runoff flow conditions. This research aimed to investigate the effects of VBSs on reducing P concentrations in surface runoff at three different watersheds in Manitoba, Canada. Surface runoff samples were collected in four sub-catchments from each watershed by installing paired weirs at 0.5-m and at 5-m into the VBSs along the expected runoff flow path. In addition, P concentrations were measured in soil samples collected within and outside of the runoff flow path to gain further insight into P dynamics within VBSs at each study site. The results indicate that VBSs had little or no significant effect on reducing the concentration of P forms in surface runoff in the majority of situations, resulting in reduced runoff losses of total, dissolved and particulate P concentrations in only 23, 12 and 12% of the situations, respectively. In addition, Olsen extractable P concentrations in VBS soils were not significantly different from field soils both within and outside of the flow path. The ineffective P retention by VBSs in this region is likely associated with the fact that the majority of the runoff flow is concentrated through small portions of VBSs and occurs during snowmelt when biogeochemical processes responsible for P retention in VBSs are limited. Further research is needed to develop alternative management practices that enhance P retention during concentrated snowmelt runoff events in such cold-climate regions.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				AUG	2017	24	22					18372	18382		10.1007/s11356-017-9406-6								WOS:000407577800037

Human adenovirus 41 (HAdV-41) is the most common serotype detected and is a leading cause of acute diarrheal disease. The focus of this study is to determine the prevalence of HAdVs in hot springs. Of 57 samples collected from four different geological sites, 16 samples have shown evidence of HAdVs (28.1%). HAdV-41 and porcine adenovirus 5 (PAdV-5) were the two types isolated, with a greater frequency of HAdV-41, which in other settings has been associated with acute diarrhea. The highest occurrence was found in private hot tubs/Yuya (37.5%), followed by an outlet of hot springs (30.8%); public pools and foot pools shared the same detection rate of 21.4% (3/14). However, there was no evidence supporting a link between water quality indicators and HAdV detection rate. From a phylogenic analysis and BLAST against the NCBI database, it was concluded that HAdV-41 obtained from hot spring areas are closely related to global environmental genotypes.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				AUG	2017	24	22					18392	18399		10.1007/s11356-017-9513-4								WOS:000407577800039						
J	Ji, NN; Wang, SR; Zhang, L; Ni, ZK				Ji, Ningning; Wang, Shengrui; Zhang, Li; Ni, Zhaokui			Characteristics and effects of dissolved organic phosphorus from different sources on the water quality of Erhai Lake in Southwest China	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												To establish the influence of dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) from different sources on the water quality of Erhai Lake in August 2014, enzymatic hydrolysis technology was used to characterize enzymatically hydrolyzable phosphorus (EHP). The results indicate that the DOP represents a significant source of the bioavailable P in the lake water and its different sources of Erhai Lake, and the bioavailability of the P pool may be underestimated by up to 55% if DOP is ignored and only the soluble-reactive phosphorus (SRP) is considered. The significant differences in DOP characteristics from the different sources may be related to the origin of the DOP, regional pollution, and environmental factors. The DOP from the sediment porewater can act as an important source of DOP in the lake water based on its high DOP content and high DOP loads from the sediment release. In addition, the highest EHP loads from the sediment release can threaten the water quality of Erhai Lake and sustain the algal blooms when they occur. Therefore, for the protection of Erhai Lake, the contributions of not only the SRP but also the DOP to the bioavailable P pool should be considered, emphasizing the eutrophication risk caused by DOP from sediments, especially in the middle section of Erhai Lake. The effects of DOP from the inflowing rivers on the water quality should also not be ignored, due to its high bioavailability.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				AUG	2017	24	22					18605	18618		10.1007/s11356-017-9474-7								WOS:000407577800057	28647876

In this work, we encapsulated electroactive biofilms with biocompatible polydopamine (PDA) to protect against extreme acid shock. The bacterial cells were completely encapsulated in similar to 50 nm films formed by PDA spheres, which protected their viability and current recoverability even after pH 0.5 and 1.5 shocks. The limiting current density of the PDA-encapsulated anode was 0.20 +/- 0.05 A/m(2), which was 1900% higher than that of the unprotected control (0.01 +/- 0.01 A/m(2)) after strong acid shock (pH 0.5, 30 min). Without PDA encapsulation, the biofilm partly disintegrated with a thickness decreased by 68% from 72 to 23 mu m, where 92% of the cells were dead. Our findings reported a novel and effective method for protecting electroactive biofilm under extreme conditions, which will greatly extend the use of BESs in the future.

An optical method for characterizing carbon content in ceramic pot filters	JOURNAL OF WATER AND HEALTH												Ceramic pot filter (CPF) technology is a relatively common means of household water treatment in developing areas, and performance characteristics of CPFs have been characterized using production CPFs, experimental CPFs fabricated in research laboratories, and ceramic disks intended to be CPF surrogates. There is evidence that CPF manufacturers do not always fire their products according to best practices and the result is incomplete combustion of the pore forming material and the creation of a carbon core in the final CPFs. Researchers seldom acknowledge the existence of potential existence of carbon cores, and at least one CPF producer has postulated that the carbon may be beneficial in terms of final water quality because of the presence of activated carbon in consumer filters marketed in the Western world. An initial step in characterizing the presence and impact of carbon cores is the characterization of those cores. An optical method which may be more viable to producers relative to off-site laboratory analysis of carbon content has been developed and verified. The use of the optical method is demonstrated via preliminary disinfection and flowrate studies, and the results of these studies indicate that the method may be of use in studying production kiln operation.																	1477-8920					AUG	2017	15	4					536	544		10.2166/wh.2017.049								WOS:000407037100007	28771151

Modeling effect of cover condition and soil type on rotavirus transport in surface flow	JOURNAL OF WATER AND HEALTH												Runoff from animal production facilities contains various microbial pathogens which pose a health hazard to both humans and animals. Rotavirus is a frequently detected pathogen in agricultural runoff and the leading cause of death among children around the world. Diarrheal infection caused by rotavirus causes more than two million hospitalizations and death of more than 500,000 children every year. Very little information is available on the environmental factors governing rotavirus transport in surface runoff. The objective of this study is to model rotavirus transport in overland flow and to compare the model results with experimental observations. A physically based model, which incorporates the transport of infective rotavirus particles in both liquid (suspension or free-floating) and solid phase (adsorbed to soil particles), has been used in this study. Comparison of the model results with experimental results showed that the model could reproduce the recovery kinetics satisfactorily but under-predicted the virus recovery in a few cases when multiple peaks were observed during experiments. Similarly, the calibrated model had a good agreement between observed and modeled total virus recovery. The model may prove to be a promising tool for developing effective management practices for controlling microbial pathogens in surface runoff.																	1477-8920					AUG	2017	15	4					545	554		10.2166/wh.2017.240								WOS:000407037100008	28771152

Modelling spatio-temporal heterogeneities in groundwater quality in Ghana: a multivariate chemometric approach	JOURNAL OF WATER AND HEALTH												Chemometric techniques were applied to evaluate the spatial and temporal heterogeneities in groundwater quality data for approximately 740 goldmining and agriculture-intensive locations in Ghana. The strongest linear and monotonic relationships occurred between Mn and Fe. Sixty-nine per cent of total variance in the dataset was explained by four variance factors: physicochemical properties, bacteriological quality, natural geologic attributes and anthropogenic factors (artisanal goldmining). There was evidence of significant differences in means of all trace metals and physicochemical parameters (p < 0.001) between goldmining and non-goldmining locations. Arsenic and turbidity produced very high value F's demonstrating that 'physical properties and chalcophilic elements' was the function that most discriminated between non-goldmining and goldmining locations. Variations in Escherichia coli and total coliforms were observed between the dry and wet seasons. The overall predictive accuracy of the discriminant function showed that non-goldmining locations were classified with slightly better accuracy (89%) than goldmining areas (69.6%). There were significant differences between the underlying distributions of Cd, Mn and Pb in the wet and dry seasons. This study emphasizes the practicality of chemometrics in the assessment and elucidation of complex water quality datasets to promote effective management of groundwater resources for sustaining human health.																	1477-8920					AUG	2017	15	4					658	672		10.2166/wh.2017.244								WOS:000407037100018	28771162

Ecological and hydrodynamic models are developed in parallel regarding their complexity, uncertainty, and computational power. Ecological models have been used to assess ecosystem processes and interactions, simulate future scenarios, evaluate remedial practices in response to eutrophication etc. This review paper deals with the progress in ecological modeling related to eutrophication processes, specifically in models that describe the trophic state dynamics of hypoxic/anoxic aquatic ecosystems. Nine dynamic ecological models coupled or noncoupled with hydrodynamic models have been discussed based upon their history, complexity, limitations, recent detailed modeling applications, and their important results. The advantages and disadvantages of these models are presented along with their application areas. Recommendations for Resource Managers Authorities and stakeholders need modeling systems adjusted to their territory/country characteristics to meet their own criteria (different physical and ecological forces from country to country). There are today a wide variety of available models for planning ecosystems' management and restoration projects. The choice of the appropriate model depends on application area and the geographical region, the ecosystem's size, the available data, and of course the modeled processes. This review can be used from researchers and managers as a guide for a comprehensive understanding of a eutrophication ecosystem, designing the water quality monitoring and modeling as well as the restoration plan.

Time lags in watershed-scale nutrient transport: an exploration of dominant controls	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Unprecedented decreases in atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition together with increases in agricultural N-use efficiency have led to decreases in net anthropogenic N inputs in many eastern US and Canadian watersheds as well as in Europe. Despite such decreases, N concentrations in streams and rivers continue to increase, and problems of coastal eutrophication remain acute. Such a mismatch between N inputs and outputs can arise due to legacy N accumulation and subsequent lag times between implementation of conservation measures and improvements in water quality. In the present study, we quantified such lag times by pairing long-term N input trajectories with stream nitrate concentration data for 16 nested subwatersheds in a 6800 km(2), Southern Ontario watershed. Our results show significant nonlinearity between N inputs and outputs, with a strong hysteresis effect indicative of decadal-scale lag times. The mean annual lag time was found to be 24.5 years, with lags varying seasonally, likely due to differences in N-delivery pathways. Lag times were found to be negatively correlated with both tile drainage and watershed slope, with tile drainage being a dominant control in fall and watershed slope being significant during the spring snowmelt period. Quantification of such lags will be crucial to policy-makers as they struggle to set appropriate goals for water quality improvement in human-impacted watersheds.

A heavy pollution index (HPI) model was used to evaluate the metal contamination status in the groundwater of the study area. Spatial distribution maps of the HPI values were prepared using a geographic information system (GIS) technique so that the groundwater quality status of the area could easily be recognized. The concentrations of As, Ba, Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn did not exceed the drinking water permissible limits for years considered. However, the concentrations of Al, Cr, Fe, Mn, Ni, and Se were above the drinking water permissible limits established by the World Health Organization (WHO 2006). The HPI values were above the critical pollution index of 100 during the years 2011 and 2012.

Rather, the mix of urban hubs surrounded by undeveloped expanses creates a ratchet process whereby anthropogenic activity is sufficient to introduce and spread invaders, but for which the costs of monitoring and managing remote ecosystems is prohibitive. Elodea spp. is the first aquatic invasive plant to become established in Alaska and has potential for widespread deleterious ecological and economic impacts. A rapid eradication response with herbicides has been identified as a priority invasion control strategy. We conducted a multi-lake monitoring effort to assess collateral impacts from herbicide treatment for Elodea in high latitude systems. Variability in data was driven by seasonal dynamics and natural lake-to-lake differences typical of high latitude waterbodies, indicating lack of evidence for systematic impacts to water quality or plankton communities associated with herbicide treatment of Modal. Impacts on native macrophytes were benign with the exception of some evidence for earlier onset of leaf senescence for lily pads (Nuphar spp.) in treated lakes. We observed a substantial increase in detected native flora richness after Elodea was eradicated from the most heavily infested lake, indicating potential for retention of native macrophyte communities if infestations are addressed quickly. While avoiding introductions through prevention may be the most desirable outcome, these applications indicated low risks of non-target impacts associated with herbicide treatment as a rapid response option for Elodea in high latitude systems.																	0006-3207	1873-2917				AUG	2017	212		A				300	309		10.1016/j.biocon.2017.06.015								WOS:000407186000033

Experiments with feedwater containing clays (kaolinite) and natural organic matter (humic acid) revealed that the combined effect of coagulation and electric field mitigated membrane fouling in the ECMR, resulting in higher water flux than the conventional combination of electrocoagulation and UF in separate units (EC-UF). Higher current densities and weakly acidic pH in the EMCR favored faster generation of large flocs and effectively reduced membrane pore blocking. The hydraulic resistance of the formed cake layers on the membrane surface in ECMR was reduced due to an increase in cake layer porosity and polarity, induced by both coagulation and the applied electric field. The formation of a polarized cake layer was controlled by the applied current density and voltage, with cake layers formed under higher electric field strengths showing higher porosity and hydrophilicity. Compared to EC-UF, ECMR has a smaller footprint and could achieve significant energy savings due to improved fouling resistance and a more compact reactor design.

Because sulfate in surface waters is reduced to sulfide by anaerobic bacteria in sediments and historical information indicated that 10 mg/L sulfate in Minnesota (USA) surface water reduced Z. palustris abundance, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency established 10 mg/L sulfate as a water quality criterion in 1973. A 21-d daily-renewal hydroponic study was conducted to evaluate sulfide toxicity to wild rice and the potential mitigation of sulfide toxicity by iron (Fe). The hydroponic design used hypoxic test media for seed and root exposure and aerobic headspace for the vegetative portion of the plant. Test concentrations were 0.3, 1.6, 3.1, 7.8, and 12.5 mg/L sulfide in test media with 0.8, 2.8, and 10.8 mg/L total Fe used to evaluate the impact of iron on sulfide toxicity. Visual assessments (i.e., no plants harvested) of seed activation, mesocotyl emergence, seedling survival, and phytoxicity were conducted 10 d after dark-phase exposure. Each treatment was also evaluated for time to 30% emergence (ET30), total plant biomass, root and shoot lengths, and signs of phytotoxicity at study conclusion (21 d). The results indicate that exposure of developing wild rice to sulfide at >= 3.1 mg sulfide/L in the presence of 0.8 mg/L Fe reduced mesocotyl emergence. Sulfide toxicity was mitigated by the addition of Fe at 2.8 mg/L and 10.8 mg/L relative to the control value of 0.8 mg Fe/L, demonstrating the importance of iron in mitigating sulfide toxicity to wild rice. Ultimately, determination of site-specific sulfate criteria taking into account factors that alter toxicity, including sediment Fe and organic carbon, are necessary.

J	Tomas, D; Curlin, M; Maric, AS				Tomas, Damir; Curlin, Mirjana; Maric, Ankica Senta			Assessing the surface water status in Pannonian ecoregion by the water quality index model	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The results of a 3-year monitoring study of surface water status in the Pannonian ecoregion for three different water types (4, 5B, 5C) are presented and evaluated statistically with descriptive and multivariable analyses. A modified water quality index (WQI(M)) for the Pannonian ecoregion is performed based on 7 indicators of water quality (pH, dissolved oxygen, biological oxygen demand (BOD), total organic carbon (TOC), nitrate, total nitrogen and total phosphorus). The applied analysis indicates correlation between individual variables with particularly strong correlation between BOD and TOC. Two linear prediction models (multivariable linear regression model (MLR) and piecevise linear regression model (PLR)) of WQI for assesment of water status in the Pannonian ecoregion were developed. In these linear models, indicator BOD was replaced with indicator TOC. In predicting WQI for the three different water types in the Pannonian ecoregion, better results were obtained with a correlation coefficients R-(4)(2) = 0.88, R-(513)(2) = 0.76 and R-(5c)(2) = 0.79 by piecevise linear regression model.																	1470-160X	1872-7034				AUG	2017	79						182	190		10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.04.033								WOS:000406436000021						
J	Nelson, WG				Nelson, Walter G.			Development of an epiphyte indicator of nutrient enrichment: A critical evaluation of observational and experimental studies	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												An extensive review of the literature describing epiphytes on submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), especially seagrasses, was conducted in order to evaluate the evidence for response of epiphyte metrics to increased nutrients. Evidence from field observational studies, together with laboratory and field mesocosm experiments, was assembled from the literature and evaluated for a hypothesized positive response to nutrient addition. There was general consistency in the results to confirm that elevated nutrients tended to increase the load of epiphytes on the surface of SAV, in the absence of other limiting factors. In spite of multiple sources of uncontrolled variation, positive relationships of epiphyte load to nutrient concentration or load (either nitrogen or phosphorus) often were observed along strong anthropogenic or natural nutrient gradients in coastal regions. Such response patterns may only be evident for parts of the year. Results from both mesocosm and field experiments also generally support the increase of epiphytes with increased nutrients, although outcomes from field experiments tended to be more variable. Relatively few studies with nutrient addition in mesocosms have been done with tropical or subtropical species, and more such controlled experiments would be helpful. Experimental duration influenced results, with more positive responses of epiphytes to nutrients at shorter durations in mesocosm experiments versus more positive responses at longer durations in field experiments. In the field, response of epiphyte biomass to nutrient additions was independent of climate zone. Mesograzer activity was a critical covariate for epiphyte response under experimental nutrient elevation, but the epiphyte response was highly dependent on factors such as grazer identity and density, as well as nutrient and ambient light levels. The balance of evidence suggests that epiphytes on SAV will be a useful indicator of persistent nutrient enhancement in many situations. Careful selection of appropriate temporal and spatial constraints for data collection, and concurrent evaluation of confounding factors will help increase the signal to noise ratio for this indicator.																	1470-160X	1872-7034				AUG	2017	79						207	227		10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.04.034								WOS:000406436000024						
J	Peterson, EE; Cunningham, SA; Thomas, M; Collings, S; Bonnett, GD; Harch, B				Peterson, Erin E.; Cunningham, Saul A.; Thomas, Mark; Collings, Simon; Bonnett, Graham D.; Harch, Bronwyn			An assessment framework for measuring agroecosystem health	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												There are inherent social, environmental, and economic trade-offs in agricultural systems, which by definition have been altered from their natural state by humans for food and fibre production. Consumers are increasingly concerned about the environmental and social impacts of agriculture, and with the increasing influence of social media, agribusinesses and industries can be held accountable for their actions in the public domain. Thus, environmental sustainability reporting is increasingly being viewed as a cost of doing business in agriculture. There are a number of approaches used to measure agroecosystem health (AEH) around the world, but they are generally designed to make comparisons at coarse spatial scales (i.e. nations) or report on specific management actions implemented at the local scale (i.e. farm, catchment, or sub-region). Here we present a simple, yet scientifically robust assessment framework that can be used to benchmark and monitor the specific impacts of agricultural management practices on the environment. The general principles are drawn from environmental monitoring and experiences gained in environmental assessments that are not necessarily agriculturally focussed. However, many commonly used environmental indicators are not suitable for AEH assessment because they do not explicitly link environmental outcomes to management actions; or they fail to separate specific agricultural impacts from broader cumulative impacts resulting from other industries or land uses. We recommend using a combination of diagnostic, outcome-based indicators, in addition to practice- and product-based measures to communicate efforts to improve agroecosystem health outcomes. The framework presented here enables assessments at local scales, but can be aggregated or disaggregated to report at finer or coarser scales. This flexibility ensures that the assessment is relevant to the proponent and stakeholders, while also providing a way to make comparisons between producers, industries, or regions as part of an adaptive monitoring and assessment framework. This also opens the door for industry-based AEH monitoring program to provide, or make use of information from government-funded environmental monitoring programs, with benefits to both.

The applied database consisted of measurements from seven different sampling sites in the protected area over the study period 2007-2008. The cover percentage of the exotic fern was modelled based on various wetland characteristics. The predictive performances of the both data-driven methods were assessed based on the percentage of Correctly Classified Instances and Cohen's kappa statistics. The results of the Paired Student's t-test (p < 0.01) showed that SVMs outperformed the CTs and thus yielded more reliable prediction than the CTs. All data mining and multivariate techniques showed that both physical-habitat and water quality variables (in particular some nutrients) might affect the habitat requirements of A. filiculoides in the wetland.

A Novel Formulation for Designing a Monitoring Strategy: Application to the Design of a River Quality Monitoring System	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELING & ASSESSMENT												In this work, we propose a technique to automatically optimize the monitoring of any distributed indicator (concentration of a substance along a river, blood pressure of a patient over time, etc.) for which a reliable estimate is previously available. From a mathematical point of view, the problem is based on obtaining a reliable estimate of the chosen indicator (e.g., by numerical simulation), and then solving a multi-objective optimization problem (with mixed real and integer variables) whose solution must provide an efficient and satisfactory monitoring strategy. As an illustrative case, we show the steps to follow in order to implement that strategy when designing a system for monitoring water quality in a river. Finally, we present and analyze the results when applying the proposed technique to study a real case in the Neuse River (North Carolina, USA).

The goal of this study is to investigate the sensitivity of nutrient transformation processes on surface water quality, especially rivers in cold regions where ice-covered conditions persist for a substantial part of the year. We established a sensitivity analysis framework for water quality modelling and monitoring of rivers in cold regions using the Water Quality Analysis Program WASP7. The lower South Saskatchewan River in the interior of western Canada, from the Gardiner Dam at Lake Diefenbaker to the confluence of the North and South Saskatchewan rivers, is used as a test case for this purpose. The study reveals that parameter sensitivities differ between ice-covered and ice-free periods and biological model parameters related to nutrient-phytoplankton dynamics can still be sensitive during the ice-covered season. For example, sediment oxygen demand is an important parameter during the ice-on period, whereas parameters related to nitrification are more sensitive in the ice-off period. These results provide insight into important water quality monitoring aspects in cold regions during different seasons.																	1420-2026	1573-2967				AUG	2017	22	4					291	307		10.1007/s10666-016-9541-3								WOS:000406289700002

Balancing lake ecological condition and agriculture irrigation needs in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												The Mississippi Alluvial Valley includes hundreds of floodplain lakes that support unique fish assemblages and high biodiversity. Irrigation practices in the valley have lowered the water table, increasing the cost of pumping water, and necessitating the use of floodplain lakes as a source of water for irrigation. This development has prompted the need to regulate water withdrawals to protect aquatic resources, but it is unknown how much water can be withdrawn from lakes before ecological integrity is compromised. To estimate withdrawal limits, we examined descriptors of lake water quality (i.e., total nitrogen, total phosphorus, turbidity, Secchi visibility, chlorophyll-a) and fish assemblages (species richness, diversity, composition) relative to maximum depth in 59 floodplain lakes. Change-point regression analysis was applied to identify critical depths at which the relationships between depth and lake descriptors exhibited a rapid shift in slope, suggesting possible thresholds. All our water quality and fish assemblage descriptors showed rapid changes relative to depth near 1.2-2.0 m maximum depth. This threshold span may help inform regulatory decisions about water withdrawal limits. Alternatives to explain the triggers of the observed threshold span are considered.																	0167-8809	1873-2305				AUG 1	2017	246						354	360		10.1016/j.agee.2017.06.022								WOS:000405973000036						
J	Safa, M; Soltani-Mohammadi, S; Kurdi, M				Safa, Mohammad; Soltani-Mohammadi, Saeed; Kurdi, Milad			Optimal design of additional sampling pattern for drinking-water quality control	ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY												A crucial step in complementary studies of the water quality determination is to design the additional sampling pattern or, in other words, to determine the number and location of the additional samples. Since location and number of samples highly affect decisions' uncertainties, and because sampling process is quite costly and time-consuming, optimization of the sampling pattern will enhance the efficiency and productivity. Solution of such an optimization problem requires defining an objective function and constraints. There exist many previous studies regarding locating additional samples in other environmental problems wherein the objective function is defined as the minimization of the kriging variance (based on the problem nature), but the point is that kriging variance is not sensitive to local variability. Since manner and extent of small-scale variations are both important and necessary in water quality studies, it is required to resolve this shortcoming of the traditional objective function. Solution is to make use of the combined variance consisting of kriging and local variances. In this study, the applicability and efficiency of the minimization of combined variance as the objective function of the additional sampling was adopted and proved for a salt marsh (east of Iran) on the basis of a simulated annealing-based algorithm. It was shown, practically, that the locational distribution of additional sampling points is quite logical and more compatible with experts' proposed methods using this objective function (compared to the traditional one).

These external nutrient load reductions interact with retention and removal processes (ecosystem services) in coastal and marine waters. Beside sedimentation, denitrification is the most important regulation ecosystem service provided by the sea, because it removes nitrogen (N) to the atmosphere and controls eutrophication. Denitrification is a spatially and temporally highly variable process and largely depends on temperature and N concentrations in the water. Climate change will have strong effects on denitrification. Increasing temperatures favour denitrification and changes in precipitation and discharge will alter the availability of N, with strong differences between river basins. We combine a 3D-ecosystem model of the Baltic Sea with economic marginal cost functions for three major Baltic river basins: Odra, Vistula and Neva. Objective is to calculate the monetary consequences of climate change (scenario A1B) for the implementation of water quality objectives, taking into account both, spatial changes in N loads and denitrification. In all regions over 90% of the entering N loads are subject to denitrification mainly in coastal waters. For the climate change scenario (A1B), our approach suggests reduced riverine N-loads of 7690 t/a (Odra), 6410 t/a (Vistula) and increased loads of 3200 t/a for the Neva. At the same time our model results suggest an increased denitrification of N-loads by 9.1% (Odra) and 9.9% (Neva) and minor changes with respect to the Vistula loads. In combination, in all three regions climate change helps to reach policy targets (lower N concentrations in the sea) at lower costs. The monetary benefit of load reduction measures that do not have to be implemented because of climate change are 11,270 million (sic)/a (Odra), 2000 million (sic)/a (Vistula) and 92 million (sic)/a (Neva). The valuations strongly depend on the assumed climate change scenario and the economic approach, but indicate that climate change effects differ much between river basins and should be taken into account in nutrient load reduction management plans.

Pollutant loading from low-density residential neighborhoods in California	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												This paper presents a comparison of pollutant load estimations for runoff from two geographically distinct residential suburban neighborhoods in northern and southern California. The two neighborhoods represent a single urban land use type: low-density residential in small catchments (<0.3 km(2)) under differing regional climates and irrigation practices. Pollutant loads of pesticides, nutrients, and drinking water constituents of concern are estimated for both storm and non-storm runoff. From continuous flow monitoring, it was found that a daily cycle of persistent runoff that peaks mid-morning occurs at both sites. These load estimations indicate that many residential neighborhoods in California produce significant non-storm pollutant loads year-round. Results suggest that non-storm flow accounted for 47-69% of total annual runoff and significantly contributed to annual loading rates of most nutrients and pesticides at both sites. At the Southern California site, annual non-storm loads are 1.2-10 times higher than storm loads of all conventional constituents and nutrients with one exception (total suspended solids). At the Northern California site, annual storm loads range from 51 to 76% of total loads for all conventional constituents and nutrients with one exception (total dissolved solids). Non-storm yields of pesticides at the Southern California site range from 1.3-65 times higher than those at the Northern California site. The disparity in estimated pollutant loads between the two sites indicates large potential variation from site-to-site within the state and suggests neighborhoods in drier and milder climates may produce significantly larger non-storm loads due to persistent dry season runoff and year-round pest control.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				AUG	2017	189	8							386	10.1007/s10661-017-6104-2								WOS:000405440300025	28689320					
J	Batabyal, AK; Gupta, S				Batabyal, Asit Kumar; Gupta, Srimanta			Fluoride-contaminated groundwater of Birbhum district, West Bengal, India: Interpretation of drinking and irrigation suitability and major geochemical processes using principal component analysis	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The present research work is confined to a rural tract located in the north-western part of Birbhum district, West Bengal, India. Chemical analysis of the groundwater shows the cations is in the order of Na+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ while for anions it is HCO3- > Cl- > SO42- > NO3-. The F- concentration was found to vary from 0.01 to 18 mg/L in the pre-monsoon and 0.023 to 19 mg/L in post-monsoon period. 86% of samples show low F- content (<0.60 mg/L) whereas, 8% exhibit elevated concentration of F- (> 1.2 mg/L) mainly in the central and north-central parts of the study area at a depth of 46 to 98 m. The prime water type is CaHCO3 succeeded by F--rich NaHCO3 and NaCl waters. The suitability analysis reveals that the water at about 81% of the sampling sites is unsuitable for drinking and at 16% of sites unsuitable for irrigation. The alkaline nature of the water and/or elevated concentration of Fe, Mn and F- make the water unsuitable for potable purposes while the high F- and Na+ contents delimit the groundwater for irrigation uses. Multivariate statistical analysis suggests that chemical weathering along with ion exchange is the key process, responsible for mobilization of fluoride in groundwater of the study area.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				AUG	2017	189	8							369	10.1007/s10661-017-6041-0								WOS:000405440300001	28676931

This degradation has led to concerns for the populations of the major cities of Nepal, including those of the Kathmandu Valley. The deterioration of the rivers in the valley is directly linked to the prevalence of poor sanitary conditions, as well as the presence of industries that discharge their effluents into the river. This study aims to investigate the water quality aspect for the aquatic ecosystems and recreation of the major rivers in the Kathmandu Valley using the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment water quality index (CCME WQI). Ten physicochemical parameters were used to determine the CCME WQI at 20 different sampling locations. Analysis of the data indicated that the water quality in rural areas ranges from excellent to good, whereas in denser settlements and core urban areas, the water quality is poor.

J	Qian, C; Chen, W; Li, WH; Yu, HQ				Qian, Chen; Chen, Wei; Li, Wei-Hua; Yu, Han-Qing			A chemometric analysis on the fluorescent dissolved organic matter in a full-scale sequencing batch reactor for municipal wastewater treatment	FRONTIERS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & ENGINEERING												Rapid monitoring of water quality is crucial to the operation of municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) in combination with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) has been used as a powerful tool for the characterization of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in WWTPs. However, a recent work has revealed the drawback of PARAFAC analysis, i.e., overestimating the component number. A novel method, parallel factor framework-clustering analysis (PFFCA), has been developed in our earlier work to resolve this drawback of PARAFAC. In the present work, both PARAFAC and PFFCA were used to analyze the EEMs of water samples from a full-scale WWTP from a practical application point of view. The component number and goodness-offit from these two methods were compared and the relationship between the relative score change of component and the actual concentration was investigated to evaluate the estimation error introduced by both methods. PFFCA score and actual concentration exhibited a higher correlation coefficient (R-2 - 0.870) compared with PARAFAC (R-2 < 0.771), indicating that PFFCA provided a more accurate relative change estimation than PARAFAC. The results suggest that use of PARAFAC may cause confusion in selecting the component number, while EEM-PFFCA is a more reliable alternative approach for monitoring water quality in WWTPs.

J	Radcliffe, JC; Page, D; Naumann, B; Dillon, P				Radcliffe, John C.; Page, Declan; Naumann, Bruce; Dillon, Peter			Fifty Years of Water Sensitive Urban Design, Salisbury, South Australia	FRONTIERS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & ENGINEERING												Australia has developed extensive policies and guidelines for the management of its water. The City of Salisbury, located within metropolitan Adelaide, South Australia, developed rapidly through urbanisation from the 1970s. Water sensitive urban design principles were adopted to maximise the use of the increased run-off generated by urbanisation and ameliorate flood risk. Managed aquifer recharge was introduced for storing remediated low-salinity stormwater by aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) in a brackish aquifer for subsequent irrigation. This paper outlines how a municipal government has progressively adopted principles of Water Sensitive Urban Design during its development within a framework of evolving national water policies. Salisbury's success with stormwater harvesting led to the formation of a pioneering water business that includes linking projects from nine sites to provide a non-potable supply of 5 x 10(6) m(3) . year (-1). These installations hosted a number of applied research projects addressing well configuration, water quality, reliability and economics and facilitated the evaluation of its system as a potential potable water source. The evaluation showed that while untreated stormwater contained contaminants, subsurface storage and end-use controls were sufficient to make recovered water safe for public open space irrigation, and with chlorination, acceptable for third pipe supplies. Drinking water quality could be achieved by adding microfiltration, disinfection with UV and chlorination. The costs that would need to be expended to achieve drinking water safety standards were found to be considerably less than the cost of establishing dual pipe distribution systems. The full cost of supply was determined to be AUD$1.57 m (-3) for non-potable water for public open space irrigation, much cheaper than mains water, AUD $3.45 m (-3) at that time. Producing and storing potable water was found to cost AUD$1.96 to $2.24 m (-3).

J	Zhang, J; Wei, Z; Jia, HF; Huang, X				Zhang, Jiao; Wei, Zhen; Jia, Haifeng; Huang, Xia			Factors influencing water quality indices in a typical urban river originated with reclaimed water	FRONTIERS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & ENGINEERING												The water quality in a typical urban river segment originated with reclaimed water in Beijing was monitored for two years to investigate the evolution of water quality along the river, and statistical analysis was applied to determine factors influencing water quality of such river recharged by reclaimed water. It was found that no significant change in pollutant concentrations (including COD, NH4 +-N, TN and TP) was observed during this time, and their average values were close to those of the original reclaimed water. However, turbidity and algal contents fluctuated temporally in the direction of river flow. Statistical analysis showed that turbidity was strongly positively correlated with algal contents for flow rate < 0.1 m . s (-1), whereas it was strongly positively correlated with both algal contents and TOC for flow rate > 0.1 m . s (-1). It was observed that diatom was the absolute predominant phyla with Melosira as the major species. In terms of algal bloom control, the specific growth rate of algae was strongly correlated to temperature, and was influenced by flow rate as well. Compared with two other rivers originated with reclaimed water and one originated with natural water, the ShannonWiener index in the objective river was the lowest, with values between 0.7 and 1.6, indicating a high risk for algal bloom.

Especially, the labile and bioaccessible fractions of heavy metal(loid) s in the sediments are posing serious risks to the biota and the overlaying water quality. This study aimed at developing a potentialmethod tomanage the activity of the labile fractions of heavy metal(loid) s in surface sediments. Materials and methods This study assessed the feasibility of adding iron powder, a low-cost industrial by-product, to sediments containing high levels of Pb, As, and Cd to adsorb labile fractions of heavy metal(loid) s onto the sorbent surfaces and to retrieve the heavy metal(loid) laden powders by applying external magnetic field. In addition, the redistribution of Pb, Cd, and As in different sediment fractions, the dissolved fraction and the sorbent-adsorbed fraction, was also investigated and characterized. Results and discussion The results indicate that the bioactive labile fractions (exchangeable and carbonate-bound fractions) of heavy metal(loid) s are prone to concentrating onto iron powders and can be selectively removed from the sediments by magnetic retrieval. In addition, iron addition induces conversion of labile fractions of heavy metal(loid) s into more stabilized fractions. Conclusions Overall, the process can effectively minimize the activity of labile fractions of heavy metal(loid) s in surface sediments.																	1439-0108	1614-7480				AUG	2017	17	8					2202	2213		10.1007/s11368-017-1670-z								WOS:000405581200018						
J	Chen, WY; Liekens, I; Broekx, S				Chen, Wendy Y.; Liekens, Inge; Broekx, Steven			Identifying Societal Preferences for River Restoration in a Densely Populated Urban Environment: Evidence from a Discrete Choice Experiment in Central Brussels	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												One of the major challenges facing river restoration in densely populated urban areas has been the disparity between the expectations of policy-makers and societal preferences. This study aimed to elicit public preferences and elucidate underlying sources of preference heterogeneity, using the Zenne River in central Brussels, Belgium, as a case study. A discrete choice experiment was administered to a representative sample of the Brussels population. Five attributes were specified, including water quality, ecological status, hydromorphological features of channels, recreational opportunities, and monetary cost. Our econometric analysis based on mixed logit models revealed that overall public would like to have a more natural river (open and naturalized channel, good water quality, and with rich species diversity), while achieving good water quality was the most preferred attribute. Respondents categorized as male, non-Belgian citizen, or not being a member of an environmental organization constituted an inclination to prefer the status quo. Belgian citizens showed a pronounced preference for good biodiversity, and being a member of an environmental organization could moderate the strong preference for good water quality. This study provided insights into the relative attractiveness of key attributes pertaining to river restoration, in general, and served as a useful input to the ongoing discussion concerning the future plan for the Zenne River in Brussels, specifically. Possible implications also exist for other urban river restorations in the rest of Europe, where the Water Framework Directive has become a major impetus for the expansion of freshwater ecosystem restoration from rural and peri-urban areas to densely populated urban areas. Particularly, the cultural heterogeneity of societal preferences should be tested and accounted for to compare the welfare impacts of river restoration and to facilitate benefit transfer, within and between river basins, in the Water Framework Directive implementation.																	0364-152X	1432-1009				AUG	2017	60	2					263	279		10.1007/s00267-017-0885-5								WOS:000404922800008	28477238

Satellite Remote Sensing for Coastal Management: A Review of Successful Applications	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Management of coastal and marine natural resources presents a number of challenges as a growing global population and a changing climate require us to find better strategies to conserve the resources on which our health, economy, and overall well-being depend. To evaluate the status and trends in changing coastal resources over larger areas, managers in government agencies and private stakeholders around the world have increasingly turned to remote sensing technologies. A surge in collaborative and innovative efforts between resource managers, academic researchers, and industry partners is becoming increasingly vital to keep pace with evolving changes of our natural resources. Synoptic capabilities of remote sensing techniques allow assessments that are impossible to do with traditional methods. Sixty years of remote sensing research have paved the way for resource management applications, but uncertainties regarding the use of this technology have hampered its use in management fields. Here we review examples of remote sensing applications in the sectors of coral reefs, wetlands, water quality, public health, and fisheries and aquaculture that have successfully contributed to management and decision-making goals.

Environmental Impact of Offshore Gas Activities on the Benthic Environment: A Case Study	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Multidisciplinary monitoring of the impact of offshore gas platforms on northern and central Adriatic marine ecosystems has been conducted since 1998. Beginning in 2006, 4-5 year investigations spanning the period before, during, and after rig installation have explored the effects of its construction and presence on macrozoobenthic communities, sediment, water quality, pollutant bioaccumulation, and fish assemblages. In this study, sediment samples collected at increasing distance from an offshore gas platform before, during and after its construction were subjected to chemical analysis and assessment of benthic communities. Ecological indices were calculated to evaluate the ecological status of the area. Ecotoxicological analysis of sediment was performed to establish whether pollutants are transferred to biota. The study applied a before-after control-impact design to assess the effects of rig construction and presence and provide reference data on the possible impacts of any further expansion of the gas extraction industry in the already heavily exploited Adriatic Sea. Only some of the metals investigated (barium, chromium, cadmium, and zinc) showed a different spatial and/or temporal distribution that may be platform-related. In the early phases, the sediment concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were below the detection limit at all sites; they then became detectable, but without significant spatial differences. The present findings suggest that the environmental effects of offshore gas platforms may be difficult to quantify, interpret, and generalize, because they are influenced by numerous, often local, abiotic, and biotic variables in different and unpredictable ways.

Pairing paleolimnological inference models with mechanistic water column models enhances assessment of lake water quality	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Reconciliation of paleolimnology inference models with hindcasts from mechanistic water column models aided the reconstruction of past relationships for total phosphorus/dissolved oxygen and acid neutralizing capacity/pH in highly polluted lake ecosystems in New York State. Pre-disturbance Onondaga Lake, Syracuse, NY, was shown to have experienced seasonal hypolimnetic anoxia even under oligotrophic (< 10 ug l(-1)) phosphorus levels. In the Adirondack Mountains of New York State the paired modeling confirmed that, while many lakes have the potential to eventually recover from acidification by atmospheric deposition, approximately 30% likely experienced naturally acidic conditions (pH < 6) prior to increases in industrial emissions. Comparison between the model results illuminated areas of individual model inadequacy, improved understanding of lake ecology, and increased confidence in the ability of predictive water column models to accurately develop restoration scenarios representing improved conditions. The work presented here is the first such comparison modeling for total phosphorus, dissolved oxygen, and acid neutralizing capacity. The technique remains to be more widely applied geographically and extended to less heavily stressed lake systems. Because a fossil inference and mechanistic hindcast should independently lead to similar results, comparison modeling is a potentially powerful tool for examining past interactions between ecosystem structure and ecosystem functioning.

Arsenic concentrations (mu g/L) were ranged from 12 to 448.5 and which exceeded the WHO recommended limit (10 mu g/L) in all cases. The calculated average daily dose (3.3 x 10(-0.4) to 1.2 x 10(-0.2) mg/kg day) and hazard quotient (1.1-40) reflected the potential health risk to local population due to tube well water consumption as drinking purpose. Sodium percent (Na%), sodium absorption ratio, residual sodium carbonate, Kelly's index and magnesium absorption ratio were also determined to assess the suitability of tube well water for irrigation purpose. The resulting piper plot revealed the Na-Ca-HCO3 type water chemistry of the area and generally alkaline environment. The spatial distribution of arsenic in the tube well waters pinpoints the significant contribution of anthropogenic activities to arsenic pollution. Nevertheless, different statistical tools, including principal component analysis, hierarchical cluster analysis and correlation matrices, revealed the contribution of both natural and anthropogenic activities and alkaline type of aquifers toward the high level of arsenic contamination.

The results showed that the removal rates for chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) reached 14.56%-30.49%, 38.21%-67.96%, and 24.22%-41.14% respectively, in the TEC treatment, and 51.22%-57.90%, 64.61%-81.95%, and 40.29%-53.45% respectively, in the IMAEC treatment, suggesting that the IMAEC revetment treatment showed higher water purification performance than the TEC revetment treatment. The results of SUVA254, a250/a365 and a253/a203 indicated that the IMAEC treatment showed relatively high removal efficiencies of refractory aromatic compounds. Parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis indicated that the removal rates for three fluorescent components (humic-like Components 1 and 2, and protein-like Component 3) reached 27.94%, 9.69% and 27.86 respectively, in the TEC treatment, and 51.35%, 30.10%, and 52.97% respectively, in the IMAEC treatment. 2D-COS mapping suggested that protein-like materials were more susceptible than humic-like substances, to the addition of metal ions. Protein-like materials can preferentially interact with metal ions, resulting in the effective removal of DOM-metal complexes, and can further influence the migration and transformation of metal ions.

ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Wading birds have declined across Europe as the intensification of lowland agriculture has resulted in the loss and degradation of wetland areas. Lowland aggregate extraction sites that incorporate areas of fine, waste sediments deposited in silt lagoons have the potential to be restored for wader conservation. We set out to determine the potential value of silt lagoons to wading birds by comparing the water quality, sediment profiles, aquatic invertebrate abundance and diversity (prey availability) and wader site use at five sites representing various stages of active aggregate extraction and restoration for conservation purposes. Wader counts were conducted monthly over a twelve month period using replicated scan samples, and the invertebrate communities studied during the breeding and autumn migration season (June-September). Water quality variables were similar between sites, but sediments from active quarries were dominated by moderately sorted fine sands in comparison to the coarser sediment profiles of restored areas. June and September there was no significant difference in invertebrate diversity between sites, however richness was significantly lower on quarry sites and total abundance a factor of ten higher at restored sites than on silt lagoons, with the dominant taxa similar across all sites. Waders used all sites; albeit at lower abundance and richness on silt lagoons and two species were recorded breeding on active silting sites. We conclude that the fine, uniform sediments of modern silt lagoons limited invertebrate diversity and abundance, diminishing the value of silt lagoons to waders. Simple low-cost intervention measures increasing substrate heterogeneity and creating temporary ponds could increase invertebrate richness and abundance, and enhance the conservation potential of these sites.

Water quality before and after watershed-scale implementation of stormwater wet ponds in the coastal plain	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Wet ponds have been used extensively for stormwater control throughout the US, including coastal areas. Despite the widespread application of these water control structures, few studies have investigated how watershed-scale implementation of wet ponds affects downstream water quality or how the pollutant removal efficacy of wet ponds changes over time in a coastal setting. This study utilizes a seven year data set of nutrient, total suspended solid, and chlorophyll-a concentration data collected during baseflow and stormflow from two coastal headwater streams draining a developed (28% impervious) and an undeveloped (1.2% impervious) watershed. The seven year record encompasses before, during, and after a large construction project and concurrent implementation of wet ponds in the developed watershed that drain 97% of the watershed area. Additional nutrient, total suspended solid, and chlorophyll-a concentration data were collected from within a wet pond in the developed watershed during baseflow over a single spring and summer. A comparison of stream water quality before and after the construction project and wet pond implementation in the developed watershed showed that mean chlorophyll-a, nitrate-nitrite (NOx-), organic nitrogen, and total suspended solid concentrations significantly increased, the mean orthophosphate (PO43-) concentration significantly decreased, and the mean ammonium (NH4+) concentration did not change. Over a three year time period after construction and pond implementation, developed stream chlorophyll-a, ammonium, and organic nitrogen concentrations decreased, and nitrate-nitrite, orthophosphate, and total suspended solid concentrations increased compared to the reference stream during the same period, indicating changes in pollutant removal capacity. A comparison of baseflow and stormflow samples during the Post period and samples from a wet pond in the developed watershed indicated that ponds were functioning as sources of chlorophyll-a and total suspended solids to the stream and sinks for nitrate-nitrite. Overall, watershed-scale implementation of wet ponds in the developed watershed failed to mitigate many negative water quality impacts caused by increased development. This study suggests that centralized stormwater management may not be optimal for maintaining water quality in coastal environments, and that pond retrofits combined with frequent excavation could improve pollutant removal by wet ponds. Further research on the effects of nutrient cycling in coastal wet ponds and wet pond maintenance is needed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Etheridge, JR; Burchell, MR; Birgand, F				Etheridge, J. Randall; Burchell, Michael R., II; Birgand, Francois			Can created tidal marshes reduce nitrate export to downstream estuaries?	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Constructed marshes have the potential to serve as a buffer between anthropogenic sources of nitrogen and nutrient sensitive estuaries. Yet, there is little information available on the reduction of nitrogen loads that created tidal marshes might provide. A 5.6 ha brackish marsh was constructed between row crop agricultural production and an estuary in North Carolina. Nitrate-N fluxes in and out of the marsh were monitored multiple times per hour for over a year to capture tidal and storm dynamics. Out of the five storms when most of the fluxes occurred, nitrate was retained in four (up to 42%), and released in the fifth, such that over the monitoring period the marsh retained 9% (40 kg) of the nitrate that entered. Nutrient addition tracer studies confirmed the potential nitrate retention (up to 45%) of the marsh. The residence time of water in the constructed brackish marsh was identified as the primary factor limiting nitrate retention through an examination of the factors that were related to percent nitrate retention. A retention model based on a mass transfer coefficient was applied during the storm events and tracer studies to further evaluate the marsh N retention capacity. The model adequately simulated the nitrate retention with calibrated mass transfer coefficients (0.1-0.56 m day(-1)) that fell within the range of those reported in literature for other systems. These results indicate that constructed tidal marshes can serve as substantial nitrate sinks and can be an integral part of overall plans to reduce the nutrient export to estuaries.

Effectiveness of water diversion and erosion control structures on skid trails following timber harvesting	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Sediment in forested watersheds is produced primarily from highly disturbed areas such as skid trails. Forestry best management practices (BMPs) have been developed to minimize erosion and water quality problems, but the efficacies of various BMP options such as water bars are not well documented. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of different distances (slope lengths) between water diversion structures (water bars) on runoff volume and soil loss on different skid trail gradients on two soils with different textures. The treatments were located in an Iranian temperate forest and included combinations of three levels of trail gradient (<10%, 10-20% and >20%), four different distances between water bars (25, 50, 75, and 100 m), and two soil textures (clay loam and silt loam). Results showed that runoff volume increased curvilinearly and soil loss linearly with distances between water bars regardless of the soil texture and trail gradient. The greater distances on trail gradients >20% resulted in the highest amounts of runoff and soil loss; shorter distances on trail gradients <10% resulted in the lowest runoff and soil loss amount for the two tested soil textures. On the clay loam soil, 50 and 75 m were the most effective distances between water bars for trail gradients >20 and <20%, respectively. On the silt loam soil, 25 m and 50 m were the most effective distances between water bars for trail gradients >20 and <20%, respectively. The results of our study confirm that slope angle is a primary factor in controlling surface runoff and soil loss on skid trails and that soil texture becomes increasingly important as slope gradients become steeper. Therefore, reducing skid trail slope during construction skid trails is recommended to decrease surface runoff and soil loss in forest operations. Further, BMPs should consider soil texture in addition to slope gradient when recommending spacing between water bars. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The role of algae and cyanobacteria in the production and release of odorants in water	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												This review covers literatures pertaining to algal and cyanobacterial odor problems that have been published over the last five decades. Proper evaluation of algal and cyanobacterial odors may help establish removal strategies for hazardous metabolites while enhancing the recyclability of water. A bloom of microalgae is a sign of an anthropogenic disturbance in aquatic systems and can lead to diverse changes in ecosystems along with increased production of odorants. In general, because algal and cyanobacterial odors vary in chemistry and intensity according to blooining pattern, it is necessary to learn more about the related factors and processes (e.g., changes due to differences in taxa). This necessitates systematic and transdisciplinary approaches that require the cooperation of chemists, biologists, engineers, and policy makers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Concentrations of 22 target PFASs and general water quality parameters were determined monthly for a year in filtered water samples from five tributaries and three sampling stations of an urban water body. Of the 22 target PFASs, 17 PFASs were detected with a frequency >93% including PFCAs: C4-C12 perfluoroalkyl carboxylates, C4, C6, C8, and C10 perfluoroalkane sulfonates, perfluorooctane sulfonamides and perfluorooctane sulfonamide substances (FOSAMs), C10 perfluoroalkyl phosphonic acid (C10 PFPA), 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid (6:2 FTSA) and C8/C8 perfluoroalkyl phosphinic acid (C8/C8-PFPIA). The most abundant PFASs in water were PFBS (1.4-55 ng/L), PFBA (1.0-23 ng/L), PFOS (1.5-24 ng/L) and PFOA (2.0-21 ng/L). In the tributaries, PFNA concentrations ranged from 1.2 to 87.1 ng/L except in the May 2013 samples of two tributaries, which reached 520 and 260 ng/L. Total PFAS concentrations in the sediment samples ranged from 1.6 to 15 ng/g d.w. with EtFOSAA, PFDoA, PFOS and PFDA being the dominant species. Based on water and sediment data, two types of sources were inferred: one-time or intermittent point sources and continuous non-point sources. FOSAMs and PFOS released continually from non-point sources, C8/C8 PFPIA, PFDoA and PFUnA was released from point sources. The highly water soluble short-chain PFASs including PFBA, PFPeA and PFBS remained predominantly in the water column. The factors governing solution phase concentrations appear to be compound hydrophobicity and sorption to suspended particles. Correlation of the dissolved phase concentrations with precipitation data suggested stormwater was a significant source of PFBA, PFBS, PFUnA and PFDoA. Negative correlations with precipitation indicated sources feeding FOSAA and FOSA directly into the tributaries. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Metal toxicity affects predatory stream invertebrates less than other functional feeding groups	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Ecosystem effects of heavy metals need to be identified for a retrospective risk assessment, and potential impacts need to be predicted for a prospective risk assessment. In this study, we established a strong correlation between the toxic pressure of dissolved metals and invertebrate species. We compiled available data from a wide geographical range of Australian streams that were contaminated with heavy metals [mainly copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn)] and the corresponding invertebrate communities. Heavy metal toxicity is positively related to the proportion of predators within the invertebrate community, represented by the predator(ratio), with an effect threshold range of 2.6 mu g/L - 26 a for Cu and 62 mu g/L - 617 mu g/L for Zn. These effect concentrations are in the ranges of the concentrations identified in model ecosystems and other field investigations and are just above the existing guideline limits. Heavy metals also affects the taxa richness negatively. Other community measures, such as the evenness, number of EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera) taxa, SPEcies At Risk (SPEAR)(pesticides) or SPEAR(salinity) were relatively poorly correlated with heavy metal toxicity in the streams. Therefore, we suggest applying the predator(ratio) within the community as a starting point for an indicator of the dissolved metal toxicity, the SPEAR(metals). (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Work, K; Codner, K; Gibbs, M				Work, Kirsten; Codner, Keneil; Gibbs, Melissa			How could discharge management affect Florida spring fish assemblage structure?	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Freshwater bodies are increasingly affected by reductions in water quantity and quality and by invasions of exotic species. To protect water quantity and maintain the ecological integrity of many water bodies in central Florida, a program of adopting Minimum Flows and Levels (MFLs) has begun for both lentic and lotic waters. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there were relationships between discharge and stage, water quality, and biological parameters for Volusia Blue Spring, a first magnitude spring (discharge > 380,000 m(3) day(-1) or 100 mgd) for which an MFL program was adopted in 2006. Over the course of fourteen years, we assessed fish density and diversity weekly, monthly, or seasonally with seine and snorkel counts. We evaluated annual changes in the assemblages for relationships with water quantity and quality. Low discharge and dissolved oxygen combined with high stage and conductivity produced a fish population with a lower density and diversity in 2014 than in previous years. Densities of fish taxonomic/functional groups also were low in 2014 and measures of water quantity were significant predictors of fish assemblage structure. As a result of the strong relationships between variation in discharge and an array of chemical and biological characteristics of the spring, we conclude that maintaining the historical discharge rate is important for preserving the ecological integrity of Volusia Blue Spring.

The impact of influent water quality including chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonium and orthophosphate concentrations on the reactor performance was evaluated. The results showed the system was very effective at removing both COD (>88%) and NH4+-N (>96%) despite varying influent concentrations of COD, NH4+-N, and total PO43-P. In contrast, it was found that the removal of P was sensitive to influent NFIt-N and PO43-P concentrations. The maximum POlc-P removal of 79% was achieved with the lowest influent NH4+-N and PO43-P concentration. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays showed a high abundance and diversity of phosphate accumulating organisms (PAO), nitrifiers and denitriflers. The MiSeq microbial community structure analysis showed that the Proteobacteria (especially beta-Proteobacteria, and gamma-Proteobacteria) were the dominant in all reactors. Further analysis of the bacteria indicated the presence of diverse PAO genera including Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis, Tetrasphaera, and Rhodocyclus, and the denitrifying PAO (DPAO) genus Dechloromonas. Interestingly, no glycogen accumulating organisms (GAOs) were detected in any of the reactors, suggesting the advantage of proposed process in term of PAO selection for enhanced P removal compared with conventional main-stream processes.

To improve the water quality, the restoration of lake by three methods: aeration, phosphorus inactivation using small doses of iron sulphate and magnesium chloride (FeSO4 and MgCl2) and biomanipulation was initiated at the end of 2011. The aim of the present study was to determine whether sustainable restoration has a significant impact on phytoplankton, especially cyanobacterial blooms in a shallow, urban, degraded lake. Therefore, phytoplankton and the physico-chemical parameters of water at the summer thermal stratification and autumn water mixing before (2011) and during restoration (2012-2014) was studied. Samples were collected at the deepest place of the lake in depth profile, every 1 m. Phytoplankton samples were preserved with Lugol's solution. The phytoplankton was counted using a Sedgewick-Rafter chamber with a volume of 0.46 ml. Measurements of water temperature were made in the field with a YSI multiparameter meter, transparency using a Secchi disk. Concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus and chlorophyll a were analysed in the laboratory according to Polish standards. As a result of restoration the water quality of the lake has improved. Cyanobacteria had almost disappeared during the first year of restoration, however, a short bloom was observed (dominated by Pseudanabeana limnetica) in the second year. The main reason for this reappearance was a higher water temperature stimulating cyanobacteria growth, but an increased supply of phosphorus from the bottom sediments also contributed. A decrease in the temperature in the third year of restoration limited the growth of cyanobacteria again. Although the decrease in the phosphorus concentration as a result of restoration proved to be sufficient for average climatic conditions, it is highly likely to be more intense in the case of increased water temperature caused by global warming.

On-line detection of Escherichia coli intrusion in a pilot-scale drinking water distribution system	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Improvements in microbial drinking water quality monitoring are needed for the better control of drinking water distribution systems and for public health protection. Conventional water quality monitoring programmes are not always able to detect a microbial contamination of drinking water. In the drinking water production chain, in addition to the vulnerability of source waters, the distribution networks are prone to contamination. In this study, a pilot-scale drinking-water distribution network with an on-line monitoring system was utilized for detecting bacterial intrusion. During the experimental Escherichia coli intrusions, the contaminant was measured by applying a set of on-line sensors for electric conductivity (EC), pH, temperature (T), turbidity,UV-absorbance at 254 nm (UVAS SC) and with a device for particle counting. Monitored parameters were compared with the measured E. coli counts using the integral calculations of the detected peaks. EC measurement gave the strongest signal compared with the measured baseline during the E. coli intrusion. Integral calculations showed that the peaks in the EC, pH, T, turbidity and UVAS SC data were detected corresponding to the time predicted. However, the pH and temperature peaks detected were barely above the measured baseline and could easily be mixed with the background noise. The results indicate that on-line monitoring can be utilized for the rapid detection of microbial contaminants in the drinking water distribution system although the peak interpretation has to be performed carefully to avoid being mixed up with normal variations in the measurement data.

It is reported toxic to aquatic organisms, and frequently occurs at relatively high concentrations. Currently, ATZ has been proved to affect reproduction of aquatic species at much lower levels. So it is controversial to perform ecological risk assessment using predicted no-effect concentrations (PENCs) derived from traditional endpoints, which fail to provide adequate protection to aquatic organisms. In this study, PNECs of ATZ were derived based on six endpoints of survival, growth, behavior, biochemistry, genetics and reproduction. The PNEC derived from reproductive lesion was 0.044 mu g ATZ L-1, which was obviously lower than that derived from other endpoints. In addition, a tiered ecological risk assessment was conducted in the Taizi River based on six PNECs derived from six categories of toxicity endpoints. Results of these two methods of ecological risk assessment were consistent with each other, and the risk level of ATZ to aquatic organisms reached highest as taking reproductive fitness into account. The joint probability indicated that severe ecological risk rooting in reproduction might exist 93.9% and 99.9% of surface water in the Taizi River, while 5% threshold (HC5) and 1% threshold (HC1) were set up to protect aquatic organisms, respectively. We hope the present work could provide valuable information to manage and control ATZ pollution.																	0147-6513	1090-2414				AUG	2017	142						464	470		10.1016/j.ecoenv.2017.04.006								WOS:000403384300056	28458230

The EFA results showed the monitoring stations to be distinguished by two main factors. The representative stations of which the variance was almost explained by the specific factor were selected. We applied PCA to the monitoring data of representative stations, and then analyzed the EOF-patterns that indicate the characteristics of water-quality variation for each factor. With the interpretation of main factors and EOF-patterns causing dominant water quality variations, the monitoring network of Nakdong River could be spatially and seasonally evaluated according to the contribution of each factor.

While previous efforts have shown the advantage of using the short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands instead of near-infrared (NIR) bands for atmospheric correction, such an approach could only be applied to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Aqua satellite (MODISA). This is because MODIS data from the Terra satellite (MODIST) contain more noise and other sensor artifacts, thus this sensor has been generally regarded by the ocean color research community as not being able to provide science quality data. Here, we address this technical challenge through noise reduction and regional vicarious calibration adjustment, and demonstrate preliminary success using turbid Taihu Lake as an example. The noise in the three SWIR bands was evaluated first, and then reduced through a noise reduction method. The SWIR bands were adjusted over open-ocean waters using the well-calibrated NIR ocean bands (1-km resolution) and radiative transfer, which were then used to adjust the land bands (250-m and 500-m resolution) in the visible and NIR over turbid waters where concurrent field-measured reflectance spectra are available. Of all three combinations of SWIR bands, the combination of 1240 and 1640-nm bands was found to perform the best, showing significantly improved retrieval accuracy for Taihu Lake, leading to recovery of low-quality MODIST data to higher-quality data comparable to MODISA, and thus doubling valid data coverage. Testing of this approach on another highly turbid lake (Chaohu Lake, China) showed similar results. While the general application of this approach to turbid lakes still needs to be tested as local tuning of the calibration coefficients may be required, these results suggest that MODIST may be used as effectively as MODISA for monitoring Taihu Lake water quality.

Through the integration of remotely sensed data and FVC estimation models, FVC can be routinely and periodically monitored using remote sensing images over large areas. However, due to frequent cloud contamination and trade-offs in satellite sensor design, the FVC estimates from remote sensing data are not continuous, either spatially or temporally, and cannot simultaneously depict details in spatio-temporal variation. Taking the seasonally inundated Zoige alpine wetland in China as a case area, the objective of this paper is to develop a practical and effective approach to quantifying the explicit vegetation FVC details with both high spatial and temporal resolution. In this approach, 30-m multi-spectral images from the Chinese HJ-1A/B (HuanJing (HJ), which means environment in Chinese) satellite constellation with a 2-day revisit time were first composited at 16-day intervals to improve spatio-temporal continuity. Then, a new adaptive endmember selection linear spectral mixture model (ASLSMM) was proposed to improve the accuracy of FVC estimation by considering the endmember dynamics for each pixel. FVC time series were finally estimated by applying the ASLSMM to the cloudless HJ composites. The performance of the model and the spatio-temporal representational capability of the FVC estimation results were comprehensively evaluated using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) reference images and ground measurements from an integrated, multi-scale remote sensing experiment. A traditional LSMM with fixed endmembers and the Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) model were also used for model performance comparison. The results showed that the R-2 and RMSE values between the FVC estimated from the proposed model and the UAV reference were 0.7315 and 0.1016 (unitless) respectively, which was better than the results from the linear spectral mixture model with a fixed number of endmembers, with R-2 of 0.5924 and RMSE of 0.3821. The R-2 and RMSE values between the FVC estimated from MESMA and the UAV reference were 0.6327 and 0.1578, which was comparable with the ASLSMM. The accuracy evaluation usingmulti-temporal in situ measurements indicated the consistently high performance of the ASLSMM. This study highlights the feasibility of using HJ satellite constellation images to generate the temporally dense and fine spatial resolution FVC estimations for wetland and wetland-like heterogeneous landscape monitoring. The proposed approach can be viewed as a reference for generating FVC datasets from the on-going HJ constellation and similar constellation missions such as Sentinel-2A/B. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

As niche innovation, new ways of monitoring face systemic barriers. The present article examines how barriers to change manifest in discursive practices with differing normative attachments and implications. A frame analysis revealed two competing frames: (1) the dominant 'norm water' frame in which thresholds of chemical compounds are used to set policy targets; and (2) the contesting 'living water' frame, which entails innovative continuous monitoring tools that take into account the ecological effects of chemical compounds. We introduce the concept of interactive reflectivity, as a discursive tool, to collaboratively visualize, scrutinize and overcome discursive barriers to innovations. The stakeholder dialogue shows how systemic barriers are uttered discursively in niches or other forms of responsible research and innovation and may hinder change even at the niche-level.

In particular, inadequate sanitation resulting in high contamination of surface water with pathogens of fecal origin is a serious issue in developing countries such as Lao P.D.R. Despite the health implications of the consumption of contaminated surface water, the environmental fate and transport of pathogens of fecal origin and their indicators (Fecal Indicator Bacteria or FIB) are still poorly known in tropical areas. In this study, we used measurements of flow rates, suspended sediments and of the FIB Escherichia coli (E. coli) in a 60-ha catchment in Northern Laos to explore the ability of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to simulate watershed-scale FIB fate and transport. We assessed the influences of 3 in-stream processes, namely bacteria deposition and resuspension, bacterial regrowth, and hyporheic exchange (i.e. transient storage) on predicted FIB numbers. We showed that the SWAT model in its original version does not correctly simulate small E. coli numbers during the dry season. We showed that model's performance could be improved when considering the release of E. coli together with sediment resuspension. We demonstrated that the hyporheic exchange of bacteria across the Sediment-Water Interface (SWI) should be considered when simulating FIB concentration not only during wet weather, but also during the dry season, or baseflow period. In contrast, the implementation of the regrowth process did not improve the model during the dry season without inducing an overestimation during the wet season. This work thus underlines the importance of taking into account in-stream processes, such as deposition and resuspension, regrowth and hyporheic exchange, when using SWAT to simulate FIB dynamics in surface waters.

Currently used methods within EU allow at least a 2.2 day period for obtaining the analytical results, making outdated the information forwarded to the public. Obtained results and beach assessment are influenced by the temporal and spatial characteristics of sample collection, and numerous environmental parameters, as well as by differences of official water standards. This paper examines the temporal variation of microbiological parameters during the day, as well as the influence of the sampling hour, on decision processes in the management of the beach. Apart from the fecal indicators stipulated by the EU Bathing Water Directive (E. coli and enterococci), additional fecal (C. perfringens) and non-fecal (S. aureus and P. aeriginosa) parameters were analyzed. Moreover, the effects of applying different evaluation criteria (national, EU and U.S. EPA) to beach ranking were studied, and the most common reasons for exceeding water-quality standards were investigated. In order to upgrade routine monitoring, a predictive statistical model was developed. The highest concentrations of fecal indicators were recorded early in the morning (6 AM) due to the lack of solar radiation during the night period. When compared to enterococci, E. coli criteria appears to be more stringent for the detection of fecal pollution. In comparison to EU and U.S. EPA criteria, Croatian national evaluation criteria provide stricter public health standards. Solar radiation and precipitation were the predominant environmental parameters affecting beach water quality, and these parameters were included in the predictive model setup. Predictive models revealed great potential for the monitoring of recreational water bodies, and with further development can become a useful tool for the improvement of public health protection.

A novel concept in ground water quality management: Towards function specific screening values	WATER RESEARCH												This paper is meant to initiate and feed the discussion on a more sophisticated procedure for the derivation and use of groundwater screening values (GSVs). To this purpose, the possibilities and tools for the derivation of function specific GSVs, i.e., GSVs that depend on the actual contact of humans and ecosystems with groundwater and groundwater-related mediums, are elaborated in this study. Application of GSVs geared to the specific use and function of specific groundwater volumes could result in a more effective and cost-efficient groundwater quality management, without compromising the protection of human health and the ecosystem. Therefore, a procedure to derive function specific GSVs was developed. For illustrative purposes, risk limits have been derived for human health and ecological protection targets, for arsenic, benzene, methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and vinylchloride. Agriculture and Nature reserves (combined), Residential and Industrial land uses have been considered and two different groundwater management purposes, i.e., curative and sustainable groundwater management. For each of the four contaminants, this results in a series of risks limits for each function and land use combination. It is shown that for all four contaminants higher groundwater screening values are considered appropriate for less sensitive combinations of function and land use. In the process towards (policy) implementation of these function specific GSV, it is recommended to evaluate the selection of protection targets; the scientific basis of the risk assessment procedures applied and the methodology to assess the time factor for groundwater quality assessment, given the fact that groundwater is a dynamic medium. Moreover, protection levels must be harmonized with national or regional groundwater quality standards and correspond with the requirements of the Groundwater Daughter Directive of the European Union Water Framework Directive. Groundwater plumes that are judged as 'no need for remediation' are not compatible with the Water Framework Directive requirement to take actions to prevent or limit inputs of contaminants, even when no receptor is present. However, the European Commission formulated a series of exemptions, to avoid that the "prevent" requirement would imply an onerous and sometimes unfeasible task. The function specific GSVs derived in this study could be used to identify the groundwater volumes that do not result in an unacceptable risk. 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Spatial identification of critical nutrient loads of large shallow lakes: Implications for Lake Taihu (China)	WATER RESEARCH												Ongoing eutrophication frequently causes toxic phytoplankton blooms. This induces huge worldwide challenges for drinking water quality, food security and public health. Of crucial importance in avoiding and reducing blooms is to determine the maximum nutrient load ecosystems can absorb, while remaining in a good ecological state. These so called critical nutrient loads for lakes depend on the shape of the load-response curve. Due to spatial variation within lakes, load-response curves and therefore critical nutrient loads could vary throughout the lake. In this study we determine spatial patterns in critical nutrient loads for Lake Taihu (China) with a novel modelling approach called Spatial Ecosystem Bifurcation Analysis (SEBA). SEBA evaluates the impact of the lake's total external nutrient load on the local lake dynamics, resulting in a map of critical nutrient loads for different locations throughout the lake. Our analysis shows that the largest part of Lake Taihu follows a nonlinear load-response curve without hysteresis. The corresponding critical nutrient loads vary within the lake and depend on management goals, i.e. the maximum allowable chlorophyll concentration. According to our model, total nutrient loads need to be more than halved to reach chlorophyll-a concentrations of 30-40 mu g L-1 in most sections of the lake. To prevent phytoplankton blooms with 20 mu g L-1 chlorophyll-a throughout Lake Taihu, both phosphorus and nitrogen loads need a nearly 90% reduction. We conclude that our approach is of great value to determine critical nutrient loads of lake ecosystems such as Taihu and likely of spatially heterogeneous ecosystems in general.

The concentrations of dissolved organic matter and ammonia decreased downstream the reservoir, while the specific UV absorbance (SUVA: the ratio of UV254 to dissolved organic carbon), increased [from 0.67 L/(mg*m) upstream to 3.58 L/(mg*m) downstream]. The raw water quality played an important role in the formation of DBPs. During chlorination, haloacetic acids (HAAs) were the major DBPs formed in most of the water samples, followed by trihalotnethanes (THMs). CHCl3 and CHCl2Br were the major THM species, while trichloroacetic acid (TCAA) and dichloroacetic acid (DCAA) were the major HAA species. Chloramination, on the other hand, generally resulted in lower concentrations of THMs (CHCl3), HAM (TCAA and DCAA), and haloacetonitriles (HANs). All the species of DBPs formed had positive correlations with the SUVA values, and HANs had the highest one (R-2 = 0.8). The correlation coefficients between the analogous DBP yields and the SUVA values in chlorinated samples were close to those in chloraminated samples. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Results show that most of nutrients loading are trapped in the lake and higher concentrations of nutrients and organic matters (OM) are present only inside of the artificial sea dike. There exist episodial discharges at the dam, which coincide mostly with rainfall events during summer monsoon periods. During this discharge event, lower salinity and higher suspended solids, nutrients, and OM are observed in surface layer of the estuarine section. Hydrodynamic model results show that circulation in the estuarine section is governed by freshwater discharge from the lake, resulting in an enhanced two-layer estuarine circulation being dominated, during and after the freshwater is discharged. Such two-layer estuarine circulation combined with higher concentration of nutrients in the surface layer results in that outfluxes of nutrients in the surface layer dominate over the influxes in the bottom layer during summer high precipitation periods. Meanwhile, numerical dye experiment results show that the discharged water with elevated nutrients levels have a short residence time (similar to 5-10 days) in the estuarine section. Due to this fast flushing rate, excessive nutrient loadings are not used to produce biological matters in the estuarine section. This limited biological productivity, characterized by seaward side of the artificial sea dike, makes Yeongsan estuarine system excluded from acting as an active carbon sink. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The formation of reactive Fe and Al oxyhydroxides during the neutralization of AD at river confluences is a natural attenuation process. Although it is known that organic matter (OM) can affect the aggregation of Fe and Al oxyhydroxides and the sorption of As onto their surfaces, the role of OM during the neutralization of AD at river confluences has not been studied. Field and experimental approaches were used to understand this role, using the Azufre River (pH 2) - Caracarani River (pH 8.6) confluence (northern Chile) as model system. Field measurements of organic carbon revealed a 10-15% loss of OM downstream the confluence, which was attributed to associations with Fe and Al oxyhydroxides that settle in the river bed. Laboratory mixtures of AD water with synthetic Caracarani waters under varying conditions of pH, concentration and type of OM revealed that OM promoted the aggregation of Fe oxyhydroxides without reducing As sorption, enhancing the removal of As at slightly acidic conditions (pH similar to 4.5). At acidic conditions (pH 3), aggregation of OM - metal complexes at high OM concentrations could become the main removal mechanism. One type of OM promoted bimodal particle size distributions with larger mean sizes, possibly increasing the settling velocity of aggregates. This work contributes to a better understanding of the role of OM in AD affected basins, showing that the presence of OM during processes of neutralization of AD can enhance the removal of toxic elements.

Observed Po-210 levels were: 1) 0.56-3.75 mBq/L in the dissolved phase (<0.45 mu m) in the seawater column and local rivers, 2) 0.35-3.11 mBq/L (400-2300 Bq/kg, dry weight, dw) in suspended particulate matter (SPM, 0.45-20 mu m) in the seawater column and local rivers, 3) 40 (Isonzo River) -158 Bq/kg (in a surface sediment cores collected in a NS transect in the gulf and sectioned to the depth of 20 cm) and 4) 239 (autumn) - 415 to 1800 (spring) Bq/kg (dw) in meso(zoo)plankton (>200 mu m). In seawater and tributaries, up to 80% (mean 49%) of total 210Po was found in particulate form. In sediments, slightly higher levels were encountered in the Isonzo prodelta and in the central (depocenter) part of the gulf. K-D (L/kg) calculated between seawater and SPM, and seawater and sediment amounted to about 5 x 10(6) and 6 x 10(4), respectively. Lower autumn Po-210 levels can be a consequence of biological dilution by higher mesozooplankton biomass in the autumn compared to spring. Plankton fractionation revealed in general the highest levels in the >200 mu m mesoplankton fraction (239-1800 Bq/kg) followed by 50-200 mu m (388-996 Bq/kg) and 20-50 mu m (318-810 Bq/kg) microplankton fractions. Obtained data show higher Po-210 levels in all matrices analyzed in the Gulf of Trieste compared to other Adriatic (central Adriatic) and western Mediterranean areas. The Po-210/Pb-210 ratios in water, plankton and sediments were mostly below or around 1, while this ratio was much higher at higher trophic levels (up to about 50), reflecting a preferential bioaccumulation of Po-210 over Pb-210. Po-210 accumulation between seawater and SPM and seawater and mesozooplankton amounted to 3.7 x 10(4) and 1.1 x 10(4), respectively, similar to other Adriatic areas. Comparison of the relative importance of pelagic and benthic bioaccumulation pathways, excluding the filter feeder bivalves, suggests greater accumulation in pelagic-feeding species.

It was found that Mn2+ adsorbs on the MnM sediment, and under aerobic conditions, rapid Mn(II) oxidation takes place. The MnM exhibited superior Mn(II) adsorption capacity compared to other commercially available manganese oxide catalysts. A filter loaded with anthracite-supported MnM was developed and used as a highly efficient, reagentless catalyst for the continuous oxidative removal of dissolved Mn. A 10-13m3<bold>h</bold>-1 pilot plant was constructed for Mn removal from Mn-rich effluent by atmospheric oxygen oxidation. The system operated continuously for more than two years with minimal maintenance, without oxidative regeneration. No ripening period was required, and the fixed bed exhibits exceptionally high catalytic efficiency. The proposed filter is superior to synthetic supported manganese oxide reactors because it does not require periodic regeneration by strong oxidizers; it is superior to filtration units for manganese removal because it does not require ripening time. A possible explanation for the superior catalytic activity based on the delicate, two-dimensional structure of MnM is presented.

Integration of energy audits in the Life Cycle Assessment methodology to improve the environmental performance assessment of Recirculating Aquaculture Systems	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												In Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS), water is continuously treated and recirculated as opposed to being discharged untreated into the environment as in other type of fish production systems; the design and production parameters will determine the overall energy consumption. This energy-intensive nature hampers their sustainability and cost-effectiveness. This paper proposes a combination of two methods (i.e. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) with energy audits) to: improve environmental performance of RAS, identify energy consumption and thus, its environmental and monetary effects in order to seek cost reduction. The proposed methodology was proved with a case study focused in a pilot-scale RAS unit used in codfish (Gadus morhua) production, located in the Basque coastal area (northern Spain). Feed and juvenile production transportation, oxygen transportation and energy consumed during the whole experiment were considered as inputs for the assessment. Energy consumption was measured both continuously by an energy meter embedded in the RAE unit as well as with a portable energy analyzer to measure each of the energy-consuming devices independently. Although the system required an average of 29.40 kWh/kg fish for successful system operation, the energy consumption varied by season presenting maximum and minimum periods of 40.57 and 18.43 kWh/kg fish, respectively. Main consumers included the heat pump, followed by the main and secondary pumps, respectively. Energy audit's results show the success in identifying the devices that consumed the largest amount of energy, and recorded data served to feed the Life Cycle Inventory and perform a more complete and precise LCA. Fossil fuel based on-farm electricity for the on-growing of fish was shown to be the most environmentally unfriendly input; it was the major impact producer in the assessed impact categories. It showed a temporal variability depending on the water temperature, which resulted to be the main factor linked to the energy use. This aided performing a precise assessment including system-specific scenarios. The combination of LCA and on-farm energy audit represents a useful tool to secure a more complete assessment with a periodic assessment to design a less energy intensive, profitable and sustainable system; likewise, it increases the speed and transparency of governance and decision-making, taking into account the time-based fluctuation of the energy consumption throughout the production cycle.

Data suggested FIB exceedances could be traced to gulls based on gull marker prevalence and correlations with FIB concentrations in seawater, sand, and eelgrass. In contrast, human marker concentrations and a tracer dye test did not indicate prevalent human sources. Exponential decay of gull marker in sand amended with live Catellicoccus marimammalium suggested that measured marker reflected fecal inputs versus growth outside the host. Improved water quality was coincident with a 2013 bird exclusion structure, consistent with NSE. However, load allocation needed for TMDL reconsideration was hampered by variable ratios of FIB, MST markers, and pathogens measured in seawater and in gull, cat, and raccoon feces Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment is a suggested path forward because such models can incorporate distributions from a combination of FIB sources and communicate criteria in terns of human health risk.

Life and death of a sewage treatment plant recorded in a coral skeleton delta N-15 record	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												We investigated the potential of coral skeleton delta N-15 (CS-delta N-15) records for tracking anthropogenic-N sources in coral reef ecosystems. We produced a 56 yr-long CS-delta N-15 record (1958-2014) from a reef flat in Guam that has been exposed to varying 1) levels of sewage treatment 2) population density, and 3) land use. Increasing population density (from < 30 to 300 ind.km(-2)) and land use changes in the watershed resulted in a similar to 1 parts per thousand enrichment of the CS-delta N-15 record until a sewage treatment plant (STP) started operation in 1975. Then, CS-delta N-15 stabilized, despite continued population density and land use changes. Based on population and other considerations, a continued increase in the sewage footprint might have been expected over this time. The stability of CS-delta N-15, either contradicts this expectation, or indicates that the impacts on the outer reef at the coring site were buffered by the mixing of reef water with the open ocean.

The oil spills are recovered from various water areas of Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah (East Malaysia). The study approach used six sigma methodologies that effectively serve as the problem solving in oil classification extracted from the complex mixtures of oil spilled dataset. The analysis of six sigma link with the quality engineering improved the organizational performance to achieve its objectivity of the environmental forensics. The study reveals that oil spills are discriminated into four groups' viz. diesel, hydrocarbon fuel oil (HFO), mixture oil lubricant and fuel oil (MOLFO) and waste oil (WO) according to the similarity of the intrinsic chemical properties. Through the validation, it confirmed that four discriminant component, diesel, hydrocarbon fuel oil (HFO), mixture oil lubricant and fuel oil (MOLFO) and waste oil (WO) dominate the oil types with a total variance of 99.51% with ANOVA giving F-stat > F-critical at 95% confidence level and a Chi Square goodness test of 74.87. Results obtained from this study reveals that by employing six-sigma approach in a data-driven problem such as in the case of oil spill classification, good decision making can be expedited.

However, in Europe, only the microbiological parameters are to be accomplished. Recent research has focused on chemical indicators that can determine human fecal contaminants in water. Therefore, the suitability of caffeine as a chemical marker of seawater pollution in the north Portuguese coastal area in the Atlantic Ocean during the bathing season was assessed in this study. The quality of water from the coasts of five cities was monitored. 101 seawater samples were collected from 14 beaches, and their water quality was classified as sufficient, good, and excellent. Caffeine was detected in all samples in concentration range of 18 to 525 ng/L. The highest average concentration of caffeine was found in seawater samples collected in July from beaches classified as having sufficient water quality, which were located in cities with high population density and high tourist affluence.

Legal ecotones: A comparative analysis of riparian policy protection in the Oregon Coast Range, USA	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Waterways of the USA are protected under the public trust doctrine, placing responsibility on the state to safeguard public resources for the benefit of current and future generations. This responsibility has led to the development of management standards for lands adjacent to streams. In the state of Oregon, policy protection for riparian areas varies by ownership (e.g., federal, state, or private), land use (e.g., forest, agriculture, rural residential, or urban) and stream attributes, creating varying standards for riparian land-management practices along the stream corridor. Here, we compare state and federal riparian land management standards in four major policies that apply to private and public lands in the Oregon Coast Range. We use a standard template to categorize elements of policy protection: (1) the regulatory approach, (2) policy goals, (3) stream attributes, and (4) management standards. All four policies have similar goals for achieving water-quality standards, but differ in their regulatory approach. Plans for agricultural lands rely on outcome-based standards to treat pollution, in contrast with the prescriptive policy approaches for federal, state, and private forest lands, which set specific standards with the intent of preventing pollution. Policies also differ regarding the stream attributes considered when specifying management standards. Across all policies, 25 categories of unique standards are identified. Buffer widths vary from 0 to similar to 152 m, with no buffer requirements for streams in agricultural areas or small, non-fish-bearing, seasonal streams on private forest land; narrow buffer requirements for small, non fish-bearing perennial streams on private forest land (3 m); and the widest buffer requirements for fish-bearing streams on federal land (two site-potential tree-heights, up to an estimated 152 m). Results provide insight into how ecosystem concerns are addressed by variable policy approaches in multi ownership landscapes, an important consideration to recovery-planning efforts for threatened species.

In Quebec, rural residents played an important role in the setting of stricter environmental regulations. Unlike most stated choice experiments about the valuation of improvements in water quality, this study explicitly accounts for risk in the design and analysis of choice experiments. Risk in phosphorus and coliform reductions is introduced through a three-point uniform distribution in the choice sets. The results show greater support for constant absolute risk aversion preferences than for constant relative risk aversion. Rural residents value coliform and phosphorus reductions and the more educated ones are particularly willing to see the government tax farmers and taxpayers to secure such reductions. As the science improves and risk in water quality outcomes decrease and as the political weight of non-farm rural residents increase, it should be easier for governments to replace voluntary cost-share programs by polluter-payer programs.

J	Leveque, JG; Burns, RC				Leveque, Jonas G.; Burns, Robert C.			A Structural Equation Modeling approach to water quality perceptions	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Researches on water quality perceptions have used various techniques and models to explain relationships between specific variables. Surprisingly, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) has received little attention in water quality perceptions studies, and reporting has been inconsistent among existing studies. One objective of this article is to provide readers with a methodological example for conducting and reporting SEM. Another objective is to build a model that explains the different relationships among the diverse factors highlighted by previous studies on water quality perceptions. Our study focuses on the factors influencing people's perceptions of water quality in the Appalachian region. As such, researchers have conducted a survey in a mid-sized city in northcentral West Virginia to assess residents' perceptions of water quality for drinking and recreational purposes. Specifically, we aimed to understand the relationships between perceived water quality, health risk perceptions, organoleptic perceptions, environmental concern, area satisfaction and perceptions of surface water quality. Our model provided a good fit that explained about 50% of the variance in health risk perceptions and 43% of the variance in organoleptic perceptions. Environmental concern, area satisfaction and perceived surface water quality are important factors in explaining these variances. Perceived water quality was dismissed in our analysis due to multicollinearity. Our study demonstrates that risk communication needs to be better addressed by local decision-makers and water managers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Denitrification potential in the subsurface environment in the Manawatu River catchment, New Zealand: Indications from oxidation-reduction conditions, hydrogeological factors, and implications for nutrient management	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												A sound understanding of the effects of hydrogeological factors on loss, transport and transformation of farm nutrients is essential for predicting their impacts on ecosystem health of receiving waters. We assessed the potential of groundwater to attenuate nitrate through denitrification, and the distribution of this potential across the Tararua Groundwater Management Zone (GWMZ) in the Manawatu River catchment, New Zealand. We combined a number of methods in an unprecedented manner to confirm findings and obtain supporting evidence for the features that determine the subsurface denitrification characteristics. Our results showed that the denitrification characteristics of groundwater varied considerably in the Tararua GWMZ. The southern part of the Tararua GWMZ contained mainly oxic groundwater with low potential to denitrify, whereas the middle and northern parts of the Tararua GWMZ contained reduced groundwater with high denitrification potential. The hydrogeological features that influence denitrification potential in groundwater were identified as soil texture and drainage class, and the aquifer material or rock type. Low dissolved oxygen levels and nitrate concentrations were found in groundwater where the combinations of soil and rock types had poor drainage characteristics as opposed to higher concentrations in groundwater under well -drained soils and rocks (e.g. gravels). Intensive pastoral farming over well -drained soils and rocks showed high nitrate concentration in groundwater. This spatial variability in denitrification potential of groundwater offers a targeted management of nutrients runoff and leaching from pastoral lands to reduce their impacts on receiving surface waters.

Dissolved oxygen, stream temperature, and fish habitat response to environmental water purchases	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Environmental water purchases are increasingly used for ecological protection. In Nevada's Walker Basin (western USA), environmental water purchases augment streamflow in the Walker River and increase lake elevation of terminal Walker Lake. However, water quality impairments like elevated stream temperatures and low dissolved oxygen concentrations also limit ecosystems and species, including federally-threatened Lahontan cutthroat trout. In this paper, we prioritize water volumes and locations that most enhance water quality for riverine habitat from potential environmental water rights purchases. We monitored and modeled streamflows, stream temperatures, and dissolved oxygen concentrations using River Modeling System, an hourly, physically-based hydrodynamic and water quality model. Modeled environmental water purchases ranged from average daily increases of 0.11-1.41 cubic meters per second (m(3)/s) during 2014 and 2015, two critically dry years. Results suggest that water purchases consistently cooled maximum daily stream temperatures and warmed nightly minimum temperatures. This prevented extremely low dissolved oxygen concentrations below 5.0 mg/L, but increased the duration of moderate conditions between 5.5 and 6.0 mg/L. Small water purchases less than approximately 0.71 m(3)/s per day had little benefit for Walker River habitat. Dissolved oxygen concentrations were affected by upstream environmental conditions, where suitable upstream water quality improved downstream conditions and vice versa. Overall, this study showed that critically dry water years degrade environmental water quality and habitat, but environmental water purchases of at least 0.71 m(3)/s were promising for river restoration.

Plans to meet water needs are faced by uprising challenges to improve water quality and to ensure the sustainability of hydro-projects. Environmental isotopes coupled to water physicochemical characteristics were investigated over a biennial cycle to assess both geomorphological and environmental impacts on the water quality of a reservoir situated in an intensively used agricultural watershed under a Mediterranean semi-arid climate. The particularity of the semi-arid climate and the diverse topography generate a continental and orographic rain effect on the isotopic composition of precipitation and the water recharged sources. The studied reservoir responds quickly to land-use activities and climatic changes as reflected by temporal and spatial variations of water chemistry and isotopic composition. Increasing changes in precipitation rate and dry periods significantly modified the water isotopic composition in the reservoir. During the first year, hydrogen (delta D) and oxygen (delta O-18) isotopes are depleted by 6 and 2%(0) between dry and wet season, respectively. While a shift of -2%(0) for delta D and -1%(0) for delta O-18 was detected during the second annual cycle. Environmental isotopic compositions demonstrate for the first time the occurrence of groundwater inflow to the central (Cz) and dam (Dz) zones of the Qaraaoun reservoir. The Cz and Dz can be considered as open water bodies subjected to dilution by groundwater inflow, which induces vertical mixing and reverse isotopic stratification of the water column. In the contrary, the river mouth zone acts as a closed system without groundwater intrusion, where heavy water accumulates and may act as a sink for contaminants during dry season. Groundwater influx acts as a dilution factor that renews the hypolimnion, and minimizes the perturbations induced by both internal biogeochemical reactions and external hydrological variations. Attention should be devoted to the hydrogeological location of planned reservoirs, which should take into account the vicinity of shallow water table to insure good water quality and water sustainability.

Evaluating the impact of ambient benzene vapor concentrations on product water from Condensation Water From Air technology	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Globally, drinking water resources are diminishing in both quantity and quality. This situation has renewed interest in Condensation Water From Air (CWFA) technology, which utilizes water vapor in the air to produce water for both potable and non-potable purposes. However, there are currently insufficient data available to determine the relationship between air contaminants and the rate at which they are transferred from the air into CWFA untreated product water. This study implemented a novel experimental method utilizing an environmental test chamber to evaluate how air quality and temperature affects CWFA untreated product water quality in order to collect data that will inform the type of water treatment required to protect human health. This study found that temperature and benzene air concentration affected the untreated product water from a CWFA system. Benzene vapor concentrations representing a polluted outdoor environment resulted in benzene product water concentrations between 15% and 23% of the USEPA drinking water limit of 5 mu g/l. In contrast, product water benzene concentrations representing an indoor industrial environment were between 1.4 and 2.4 times higher than the drinking water limit. Lower condenser coil temperatures were correlated with an increased concentration of benzene in the product water. Environmental health professionals and engineers can integrate the results of this assessment to predict benzene concentrations in the product water and take appropriate health protective measures.

J	Nazeer, M; Wong, MS; Nichol, JE				Nazeer, Majid; Wong, Man Sing; Nichol, Janet Elizabeth			A new approach for the estimation of phytoplankton cell counts associated with algal blooms	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												This study proposes a method for estimating phytoplankton cell counts associated with an algal bloom, using satellite images coincident with in situ and meteorological parameters. Satellite images from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +), Operational Land Imager (OLD and Hj-1 A/B Charge Couple Device (CCD) sensors were integrated with the meteorological observations to provide an estimate of phytoplankton cell counts. All images were atmospherically corrected using the Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S) atmospheric correction method with a possible error of 1.2%, 2.6%, 1.4% and 23% for blue (450-520 nm), green (520-600 nm), red (630-690 nm) and near infrared (NIR 760-900 nm) wavelengths, respectively. Results showed that the developed Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model yields a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.95 with the in situ validation data with Sum of Squared Error (SSE) of 034 cell/ml, Mean Relative Error (MRE) of 0.154 cells/ml and a bias of -504.87. The integration of the meteorological parameters with remote sensing observations provided a promising estimation of the algal scum as compared to previous studies. The applicability of the ANN model was tested over Hong Kong as well as over Lake Kasumigaura, Japan and Lake Okeechobee, Florida USA, where algal blooms were also reported. Further, a 40-year (1975-2014) red tide occurrence map was developed and revealed that the eastern and southern waters of Hong Kong are more vulnerable to red tides. Over the 40 years, 66% of red tide incidents were associated with the Dinoflagellates group, while the remainder were associated with the Diatom group (14%) and several other minor groups (20%). The developed technology can be applied to other similar environments in an efficient and cost saving manner. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Goovaerts, P				Goovaerts, Pierre			Monitoring the aftermath of Flint drinking water contamination crisis: Another case of sampling bias?	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The delay in reporting high levels of lead in Flint drinking water, following the city's switch to the Flint River as its water supply, was partially caused by the biased selection of sampling sites away from the lead pipe network. Since Flint returned to its pre-crisis source of drinking water, the State has been monitoring water lead levels (WLL) at selected "sentinel" sites. In a first phase that lasted two months, 739 residences were sampled, most of them bi-weekly, to determine the general health of the distribution system and to track temporal changes in lead levels. During the same period, water samples were also collected through a voluntary program whereby concerned citizens received free testing kits and conducted sampling on their own. State officials relied on the former data to demonstrate the steady improvement in water quality. A recent analysis of data collected by voluntary sampling revealed, however, an opposite trend with lead levels increasing over time. This paper looks at potential sampling bias to explain such differences. Although houses with higher WLL were more likely to be sampled repeatedly, voluntary sampling turned out to reproduce fairly well the main characteristics (i.e. presence of lead service lines (LSL), construction year) of Flint housing stock. State-controlled sampling was less representative; e.g., sentinel sites with LSL were mostly built between 1935 and 1950 in lower poverty areas, which might hamper our ability to disentangle the effects of LSL and premise plumbing (lead fixtures and pipes present within old houses) on WLL. Also, there was no sentinel site with LSL in two of the most impoverished wards, including where the percentage of children with elevated blood lead levels tripled following the switch in water supply. Correcting for sampling bias narrowed the gap between sampling programs, yet overall temporal trends are still opposite. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Quantification of catchment response under future changes is particularly crucial for better water resources management. This study assessed the combined effects of future climate and land use changes on water yield, total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) loads of the Mediterranean Onkaparinga catchment in South Australia by means of the eco-hydrological model SWAT. Six different global climate models (GCMs) under two representative concentration pathways (RCPs) and a hypothetical land use change were used for future simulations. The climate models suggested a high degree of uncertainty, varying seasonally, in both flow and nutrient loads: however, a decreasing trend was observed. Average monthly TN and TP load decreased up to -55% and -56% respectively and were found to be dependent on flow magnitude. The annual and seasonal water yield and nutrient loads may only slightly be affected by envisaged land uses, but significantly altered by intermediate and high emission scenarios, predominantly during the spring season. The combined scenarios indicated the possibility of declining flow in future but nutrient enrichment in summer months, originating mainly from the land use scenario, that may elevate the risk of algal blooms in downstream drinking water reservoir. Hence, careful planning of future water resources in a Mediterranean catchment requires the assessment of combined effects of multiple climate models and land use scenarios on both water quantity and quality.

Data and observations were made by trained citizen scientists and professional researchers. Our study shows that all monitored water bodies, with the exception of Qiandeng Lake and Fengjiang River, had elevated NO(3) over bar -N concentrations, which ranged from 0.10 to 6.83 mg/L and peaked in late winter and early spring and reached a minimum in summer and mid-autumn. Po43-P concentrations ranged from 0.01 to 025 mg/L and peaked during the winter, late-summer and late autumn. Turbidity values were highest at sites with agricultural activities, with maximums in the late winter and autumn, and the highest frequency (16% and 25%) of algae presence occurred in the spring and autumn. To better understand the characteristics and drivers of the algae occurrences, measurements of phytoplankton composition and physicochemical characteristics were conducted in three key seasons in the agricultural process, fallow, sowing and rainy season in 2016. Our focused study found that the occurrence of Bacillariophyta, Euglenophyta, Xanthophyta, Cryptophyta, Chrysophyta were positively correlated with dissolved oxygen and phosphorus concentrations, while Chlorophyta and Cyanophyta had positive correlations with turbidity, oxygen demand and nitrogen concentrations. Bacillariophyceae counted for the highest proportion of phytoplankton during the fallow season, comprising up to 60 +% of the phytoplankton among the sites. During the rainy season, Chlorophyceae species were the majority, comprising up to 90 +% of phytoplankton among the sampled sites. Our results pointed to the complexity of nutrient and phytoplankton dynamics in water bodies under multiple pressures, and to the value of using citizen scientists to determine contextual information to benefit more focused studies.

Therefore, a study on the occurrence patterns and spatiotemporal variability of 105 PPCPs in an Alpine river basin located in the Trentino-Alto Adige region (North-Eastern Italy) has been conducted. We observed that the total concentration of analyzed PPCPs was generally higher in all sampling sites during winter than in the summer. The analysis of tourist data revealed that during both sampling campaigns the number of tourists was lower in the downstream sites in comparison with the upstream area of the basin (Val di Sole). Particularly, sampling sites located near important tourist resorts have shown the highest abundance of the PPCPs during winter, being analgesics/anti-inflammatories, antihypertensives and antibiotics the most abundant pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs). Diclofenac showed the highest concentration amongst PhACs, reaching concentrations up to 675 ng L-' in the sampling site situated downstream of the Tonale wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Antihypertensives were found at concentrations >300 ng L-1, while antibiotics were quantified up to 196 ng L-1, respectively. Amongst personal care products (PCPs), the most abundant compound was octyl-dimethyl-p-aminobenzoic acid (ODPABA) with concentrations reaching up to 748 ng L-1 in the sampling site situated within the Rotaliana district In general, concentrations and detection frequencies were higher in water than in the sediment samples. The most frequently detected PhACs in sediments from both sampling campaigns were antibiotics, while amongst PCPs in sediments, octocrylene (OC) showed the highest concentration in both sampling campaigns. As a result, this study highlights the potential impact of tourism on the water quality of the Alpine aquatic ecosystems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Dynamic response of land use and river nutrient concentration to long-term climatic changes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The combined indirect and direct impacts of land use change and climate change on river water quality were assessed. A land use allocation model was used to evaluate the response of the catchment land use to long-term climatic changes. Its results were used to drive a water quality model and assess the impact of climatic alterations on freshwater nitrate and phosphorus concentrations. Climatic projections were employed to estimate the likelihood of such response. The River Thames catchment (UK) was used as a case-study. If land use is considered as static parameter, according to the model results, climate change alone should reduce the average nitrate concentration, although just by a small amount, by the 2050s in the Lower Thames, due to reduced runoff (and lower export of nitrate from agricultural soils) and increased instream denitrification, and should increase the average phosphorus concentration by 12% by the 2050s in the Lower Thames, due to a reduction of the effluent dilution capacity of the river flow. However, the results of this study also show that these long-term climatic alterations are likely to lead to a reduction in the arable land in the Thames, replaced by improved grassland, due to a decrease in agriculture profitability in the UK. Taking into account the dynamic co-evolution of land use with climate, the average nitrate concentration is expected to be decreased by around 6% by the 2050s in both the upper and the lower Thames, following the model results, and the average phosphorus concentration increased by 13% in the upper Thames and 5% in the lower Thames. On the long term (2080s), nitrate is expected to decrease by 9% and 8% (upper and lower Thames respectively) and phosphorus not to change in the upper thames and increase by 5% in the lower Thames.

A discussion about public health, lead and Legionella pneumophila in drinking water supplies in the United States	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Lead (Pb) in public drinking water supplies has garnered much attention since the outset of the Flint water crisis. Pb is a known hazard in multiple environmental matrices, exposure from which results in long-term deleterious health effects in humans. This discussion paper aims to provide a succinct account of environmental Pb exposures with a focus on water Pb levels (WLLs) in the United States. It is understood that there is a strong correlation between WLLs and blood Pb levels (BLLs), and the associated health effects. However, within the Flint water crisis, more than water chemistry and Pb exposure occurred. A cascade of regulatory and bureaucratic failures culminated in the Flint water crisis. This paper will discuss pertinent regulations and responses including their limitations after an overview of the public health effects from Pb exposure as well as discussion on our limitations on monitoring and mitigating Pb in tap water. As the Flint water crisis also included increased Legionnares' disease, caused by Legionella pneumophila, this paper will discuss factors influencing L. pneumophila growth. This will highlight the systemic nature of changes to water chemistry and public health impacts. As we critically analyze these important aspects of water research, we offer discussions to stimulate future water quality research from a new and systemic perspective to inform and guide public health decision-making.

J	Zhang, XL; Huang, M				Zhang, Xiaole; Huang, Meng			Ensemble-based release estimation for accidental river pollution with known source position	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS												Dispersion model is an important tool for decision makers to accurately assess risks and effectively plan countermeasures during river pollution accidents, but their applications suffer from significant modeling uncertainties, primarily due to the scarce information of the source. A fully sequential inverse estimation method is proposed to reconstruct the temporal release for accidental river pollution. The method is based on a one-dimensional advection-dispersion model in conjunction with the augmented ensemble Kalman filter method. Detailed analysis of the ensemble background error covariance (BEC) matrix is conducted to elucidate the "flow-dependent" mechanism, which enables the inversion method to simultaneously take into account the uncertainties in the hydrological parameters (mean flow velocity and longitudinal dispersion coefficient). The method is evaluated with six field tracer experiments with various mean flow velocities, ranging from 0.085 to 0.889 m s(-1), and also compared with the commonly used Tikhonov regularization inverse estimation method to demonstrate its performance improvement. The results indicate that it successfully reconstructs the temporal release and reduces the relative errors of the total release estimation by about 12.4% on average compared with the Tikhonov method, since the errors caused by the uncertainties in mean flow velocity and longitudinal dispersion coefficient are effectively alleviated.

Viral Aggregation: Impact on Virus Behavior in the Environment	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Aggregates of viruses can have a significant impact on quantification' and behavior of viruses in the environment. Viral aggregates may be formed in numerous ways. Viruses may form crystallike structures and aggregates in the host cell during replication or may form due to changes in environmental conditions after virus particles are released from the host cells. Aggregates tend to form mear the isoelectric point of the virus, under the influence of certain salts and salt concentrations in solutiOn, cationic polymers, and suspended organic matter. The given conditions under which aggregates form in the environment are highly dependent on the type of virus, type of salts in solution (cation, anion, monovalent, divalent) and pH. However, virus typo greatly influences the conditions when aggregation/disaggregation will occur, making predictions difficult under any given set of water quality conditions. Most studies have shown that viral aggregates increase the survival of viruses in the environment and resistance to disinfectants, especially with more reactive disinfectants. The presence of viral aggregates may also result in overestimation of removal by filtration processes. Virus aggregation-disaggregation is a complex process and predicting the behavior of any individual virus is difficult under a given set of environmental circumstances without actual experiniental data.

Prior to the growing environmental awareness, flow rate and regime are critical components of water supply, water quality, and the ecological integrity of river systems. Environmental flow may be described as the required stream flow quantity to support the ecological activity in a river system. While environmental flow assessment provides protection and use balance over the water resources and it also reduces the natural and artificial effects that caused of deterioration of the natural condition of the rivers. There are only a few environmental flow assessment studies in Turkey. In this paper, daily flow data has been used to determine the flow regimes in order to have some idea about the environmental flow. For this purpose, common methods such as original Tennant method, modified Tennant method, wetted perimeter method, 7Q10 and Q95 have been examined. Daily flow data has been obtained from three gauging stations located in Great Menderes Basin. The first one (07-30) is unregulated, the second is regulated (07-04) and the third one is indirectly regulated (07-71) gauging stations. As a result of this study, particular methods have more reliability and might be more appropriate for each case. The modified Tennant method could be selected as the most practical method for the measured data of flow rates in unregulated gauging station. Q95 method can be used for the other two stations.																	2224-4980					JUL	2017	7	3					499	510										WOS:000417183100011

We argue that piped water and bottled water cannot be easily compared in the Indonesian context. Drinking from tap water has never been accepted as the norm as piped water has no guarantee of purity and safety. The substantial marketing efforts of the bottled water industry highlight the appeal of bottled water in regard to, not only good water quality and physical health, but also taste, convenience, mental health, and social and environmental values. Despite many negative social and environmental issues associated with bottled water, this enigmatic commodity is becoming 'the' drinking water in Indonesia and is inseparable from modern life.

Strategies to Improve Private-Well Water Quality: A North Carolina Perspective	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES												BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that the 44.5 million U.S. residents drawing their drinking water from private wells face higher risks of waterborne contaminant exposure than those served by regulated community water supplies. Among U.S. states, North Carolina (N.C.) has the second-largest population relying on private wells, making it a useful microcosm to study challenges to maintaining private-well water quality. OBJECTIVES: This paper summarizes recommendations from a two-day summit to identify options to improve drinking-water quality for N.C. residents served by private wells. METHODS: The Research Triangle Environmental Health Collaborative invited 111 participants with knowledge of private-well water challenges to attend the Summit. Participants worked in small groups that focused on specific aspects and reconvened in plenary sessions to formulate consensus recommendations. DISCUSSION: Summit participants highlighted four main barriers to ensuring safe water for residents currently relying on private wells: (1) a database of private well locations is unavailable; (2) racial disparities have perpetuated reliance on private wells in some urbanized areas; (3) many private well users lack information or resources to monitor and maintain their wells; and (4) private-well support programs are fragmented and lack sufficient resources. The Summit produced 10 consensus recommendations for ways to overcome these barriers. CONCLUSIONS: The Summit recommendations, if undertaken, could improve the health of North Carolinians facing elevated risks of exposure to waterborne contaminants because of their reliance on inadequately monitored and maintained private wells. Because many of the challenges in N.C. are common nationwide, these recommendations could serve as models for other states.																	0091-6765	1552-9924				JUL	2017	125	7							UNSP 076001	10.1289/EHP890								WOS:000413791300007

However, integrating participant feedback into current science, research, and decision-making processes is challenging. This paper presents a novel approach that marries a rigorous Delphi method, borrowed from policy and organizational sciences, with contemporary "crowdsourcing" to address the complex problems of water pollution exacerbated by climate change in the Lake Champlain Basin. In an online Delphi forum that occurred over a six-week period during the Spring of 2014, fifty-three participants proposed and commented on adaptive solutions to address water quality in the context of climate change. In a follow up Multi-Stakeholder workshop, thirty-eight stakeholders participated in refining and synthesizing the results from the forum. To inform modeling and policy dialogue, the resulting list of interventions was analyzed by time horizon, domain, type of adaptation action, and priority level. The interventions suggested by stakeholders within the crowdsourcing forum have contributed to the current policy dialogue in Vermont including legislation to address phosphorus loading to Lake Champlain. This stakeholder approach strengthens traditional modeling scenario development to include solutions and priorities that have been collectively refined and vetted.																	0959-3780	1872-9495				JUL	2017	45						111	123		10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2017.05.005								WOS:000411912800010

Ehsan			Stakeholder engagement in multi-objective optimization of water quality monitoring network, case study: Karkheh Dam reservoir	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												Reservoir water quality is important for water quality management downstream. A hierarchical approach is developed to present the monitoring locations within a format that satisfies the objectives of social stakeholders for making final decisions. First, a CE-QUAL-W2 model is applied to simulate water quality variables in the reservoir for a long time using a set of historic data. Second, transinformation entropy theory is used to quantify mutual information among a set of monitoring stations for each water quality variable. Then, a non-dominating sorting genetic algorithm-based model is developed for multi-objective optimization of the water quality monitoring network. Finally, a social choice method is applied to the identified non-dominated solutions to achieve a strategy that is compromised among stakeholders. The variations of the water quality variables at different depths and different seasons are investigated. The proposed approach is illustrated for Karkheh Reservoir in Iran. The number of optimized monitoring stations is the same for all seasons (three out of 22 potential stations) using different social choice methods. The results show the appropriate performance of the proposed methodology for optimization of reservoir water quality monitoring stations.																	1606-9749					JUL	2017	17	4					966	974		10.2166/ws.2016.196								WOS:000408713700007						
J	Gavriletea, MD				Gavriletea, Marius Dan			Environmental Impacts of Sand Exploitation. Analysis of Sand Market	SUSTAINABILITY												Sand is an indispensable natural resource for any society. Despite society's increasing dependence on sand, there are major challenges that this industry needs to deal with: limited sand resources, illegal mining, and environmental impact of sand mining. The purpose of this paper is twofold: to present an overview of the sand market, highlighting the main trends and actors for production, export and import, and to review the main environmental impacts associated with sand exploitation process. Based on these findings, we recommend different measures to be followed to reduce negative impacts. Sand mining should be done in a way that limits environmental damage during exploitation and restores the land after mining operations are completed.

Despite significant uncertainty in most flow data, the flow series for these applications are often communicated and used without uncertainty information. In this commentary, we argue that proper analysis of uncertainty in river flow data can reduce costs and promote robust conclusions in water management applications. We substantiate our argument by providing case studies from Norway and New Zealand where streamflow uncertainty analysis has uncovered economic costs in the hydropower industry, improved public acceptance of a controversial water management policy, and tested the accuracy of water quality trends. We discuss the need for practical uncertainty assessment tools that generate multiple flow series realizations rather than simple error bounds. Although examples of such tools are in development, considerable barriers for uncertainty analysis and communication still exist for practitioners, and future research must aim to provide easier access and usability of uncertainty estimates. We conclude that flow uncertainty analysis is critical for good water management decisions. Plain Language Summary In this commentary, we show how analyzing uncertainty in river flow data can reduce costs and promote robust conclusions in water management applications. River flow data can contain large uncertainties but are often communicated and used without uncertainty information. We give case studies from Norway and New Zealand where flow uncertainty analysis has uncovered economic costs in the hydropower industry, improved public acceptance of a controversial watermanagement policy, and tested the accuracy of water quality trends. We conclude that flow uncertainty analysis is critical for goodwater management decisions.

Therefore, monitoring of agricultural water use and hydrologic connections between crop lands and Bay tributaries has received increasing attention. Remote sensing retrievals of actual evapotranspiration (ET) can provide valuable information in support of these hydrologic modeling efforts, spatially and temporally describing consumptive water use by crops and natural vegetation and quantifying response to expansion of irrigated area occurring with Bay watershed. In this study, a multisensor satellite data fusion methodology, combined with a multiscale ET retrieval algorithm, was applied over the Choptank River watershed located within the Lower Chesapeake Bay region on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, USA to produce daily 30 m resolution ET maps. ET estimates directly retrieved on Landsat satellite overpass dates have high accuracy with relative error (RE) of 9%, as evaluated using flux tower measurements. The fused daily ET time series have reasonable errors of 18% at the daily time step - an improvement from 27% errors using standard Landsat-only interpolation techniques. Annual water consumption by different land cover types was assessed, showing reasonable distributions of water use with cover class. Seasonal patterns in modeled crop transpiration and soil evaporation for dominant crop types were analyzed, and agree well with crop phenology at field scale. Additionally, effects of irrigation occurring during a period of rainfall shortage were captured by the fusion program. These results suggest that the ET fusion system will have utility for water management at field and regional scales over the Eastern Shore. Further efforts are underway to integrate these detailed water use data sets into watershed-scale hydrologic models to improve assessments of water quality and inform best management practices to reduce nutrient and sediment loads to the Chesapeake Bay.

Are our dynamic water quality models too complex? A comparison of a new parsimonious phosphorus model, SimplyP, and INCA-P	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Catchment-scale water quality models are increasingly popular tools for exploring the potential effects of land management, land use change and climate change on water quality. However, the dynamic, catchment-scale nutrient models in common usage are complex, with many uncertain parameters requiring calibration, limiting their usability and robustness. A key question is whether this complexity is justified. To explore this, we developed a parsimonious phosphorus model, SimplyP, incorporating a rainfall-runoff model and a biogeochemical model able to simulate daily streamflow, suspended sediment, and particulate and dissolved phosphorus dynamics. The model's complexity was compared to one popular nutrient model, INCA-P, and the performance of the two models was compared in a small rural catchment in northeast Scotland. For three land use classes, less than six SimplyP parameters must be determined through calibration, the rest may be based on measurements, while INCA-P has around 40 unmeasurable parameters. Despite substantially simpler process-representation, SimplyP performed comparably to INCA-P in both calibration and validation and produced similar long-term projections in response to changes in land management. Results support the hypothesis that INCA-P is overly complex for the study catchment. We hope our findings will help prompt wider model comparison exercises, as well as debate among the water quality modeling community as to whether today's models are fit for purpose. Simpler models such as SimplyP have the potential to be useful management and research tools, building blocks for future model development (prototype code is freely available), or benchmarks against which more complex models could be evaluated. Plain Language Summary Catchment models may be useful tools for managing water quality, for example for exploring how water quality may change in the future under different land management, land use or climate. However, models are only useful if they capture the right processes, otherwise there is a risk of management decisions being based on unreliable information. There is now a growing awareness that many catchment water quality models used today are too complex. This makes it difficult, time-consuming and expensive to set models up, and reduces the reliability of their predictions. We have therefore developed a new, simple model to predict phosphorus concentrations in rivers, one of the biggest causes of troublesome algal blooms in fresh waters. The simple model was compared with one of the standard models in common use and was found to perform as well, despite being substantially simpler to set up and use. This supports the idea that current water quality models are too complex, and that modelers need to put more effort into assessing whether they are using appropriate tools.

Predicting organic matter, nitrogen, and phosphorus concentrations in runoff from peat extraction sites using partial least squares regression	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Organic matter and nutrient export from drained peatlands is affected by complex hydrological and biogeochemical interactions. Here partial least squares regression (PLSR) was used to relate various soil and catchment characteristics to variations in chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in runoff. Peat core samples and water quality data were collected from 15 peat extraction sites in Finland. PLSR models constructed by cross-validation and variable selection routines predicted 92, 88, and 95% of the variation in mean COD, TN, and TP concentration in runoff, respectively. The results showed that variations in COD were mainly related to net production (temperature and water-extractable dissolved organic carbon (DOC)), hydrology (topographical relief), and solubility of dissolved organic matter (peat sulfur (S) and calcium (Ca) concentrations). Negative correlations for peat S and runoff COD indicated that acidity from oxidation of organic S stored in peat may be an important mechanism suppressing organic matter leaching. Moreover, runoff COD was associated with peat aluminum (Al), P, and sodium (Na) concentrations. Hydrological controls on TN and COD were similar (i.e., related to topography), whereas degree of humification, bulk density, and water-extractable COD and Al provided additional explanations for TN concentration. Variations in runoff TP concentration were attributed to erosion of particulate P, as indicated by a positive correlation with suspended sediment concentration (SSC), and factors associated with metal-humic complexation and P adsorption (peat Al, water-extractable P, and water-extractable iron (Fe)).

Complex networks of functional connectivity in a wetland reconnected to its floodplain	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Disturbances such as fire or flood, in addition to changing the local magnitude of ecological, hydrological, or biogeochemical processes, can also change their functional connectivity-how those processes interact in space. Complex networks offer promise for quantifying functional connectivity in watersheds. The approach resolves connections between nodes in space based on statistical similarities in perturbation signals (derived from solute time series) and is sensitive to a wider range of timescales than traditional mass-balance modeling. We use this approach to test hypotheses about how fire and flood impact ecological and biogeochemical dynamics in a wetland (Everglades, FL, USA) that was reconnected to its floodplain. Reintroduction of flow pulses after decades of separation by levees fundamentally reconfigured functional connectivity networks. The most pronounced expansion was that of the calcium network, which reflects periphyton dynamics and may represent an indirect influence of elevated nutrients, despite the comparatively smaller observed expansion of phosphorus networks. With respect to several solutes, periphyton acted as a "biotic filter,'' shifting perturbations in water-quality signals to different timescales through slow but persistent transformations of the biotic community. The complex-networks approach also revealed portions of the landscape that operate in fundamentally different regimes with respect to dissolved oxygen, separated by a threshold in flow velocity of 1.2 cm/s, and suggested that complete removal of canals may be needed to restore connectivity with respect to biogeochemical processes. Fire reconfigured functional connectivity networks in a manner that reflected localized burn severity, but had a larger effect on the magnitude of solute concentrations. Plain Language Summary A big part of the plan to restore the Everglades involves the removal of levees and canals that are currently serving as barriers to flow. However, doing so at a large scale prompts some concerns and questions: (1) Will phosphorus, a limiting nutrient that has the capability to vastly change vegetation communities, be mobilized and transported to downstream ecosystems? And (2) Do the barriers to flow need to be completely removed (an expensive proposition), or will partial removal suffice? To address these uncertainties, a team of scientists and engineers conducted a multi-year experiment involving controlled flow releases into a 2 km x 2 km part of the wetland that was formerly isolated from flow. In this paper the authors use a new functional connectivity network approach to visualize how those flow releases change the way constituents in the flood waters move through the downstream ecosystem. They found that flow reconnection causes a shift in how calcium is processed by microorganisms near the flow inlet, which likely reflects a transition to species that thrive under slight phosphorus enrichment. They also found that only across portions of the landscape where barriers to flow have been completely removed does the landscape regain functional connectivity.

Mean concentrations of toxic metals in groundwater decreased in the order of Cr > Zn > Cu > Cd > Ni > Pb > Hg > As. Concentration of Cr6+ in groundwater was detected to further study chromium contamination. Cr6+ and Cd in groundwater were recommended as the priority pollutants because they were generally 1399-fold and 12-foldgreater than permissible limits, respectively. Owing to the fact that a waterproof curtain (WPC) in the brownfield is about to pass the warranty period, a steady two-dimensional water quality model and health risk assessment were applied to simulate and evaluate adverse effects of Cr6+ and Cd on the water quality of Xiangjiang River and the drinking-water intake of Wangcheng Waterworks. The results indicated that when groundwater in the brownfield leaked with valid curtain prevention, the water quality in Xiangjiang River and drinking-water intake downstream were temporarily unaffected. However, if there was no curtain prevention, groundwater leakage would have adverse impact on water quality of Xiangjiang River. Under the requirements of Class III surface water quality, the pollution belt for Cr6+ was 7500 m and 200 m for Cd. The non-carcinogenic risk of toxic metals in Xiangjiang River exceeded the threshold in a limited area, but did not threaten Wangcheng Waterworks. By contrast, the carcinogenic risk area for adults was at a transverse distance of 200 m and a longitudinal distance of 18,000 m, which was close to the Wangcheng Waterworks (23,000 m). Therefore, it was essential to reconstruct the WPC in the brownfield for preventing pollution diffusion.

To combat this issue, the country needs to establish water quality targets, monitoring systems, and intelligent watershed management. This study explores a new watershed management method. Water quality is first assessed using a single factor index method. Then, changes in total nitrogen/total phosphorus (TN/TP) are analyzed to determine the limiting factor. Next, the study compares the eutrophication status of two water function districts, using a comprehensive nutritional state index method and geographic information system (GIS) visualization. Finally, nutrient sources are qualitatively analyzed. Two functional water areas in Tianjin, China were selected and analyzed: Qilihai National Wetland Nature Reserve and Yuqiao Reservoir. The reservoir is a drinking water source. Results indicate that total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) pollution are the main factors driving eutrophication in the Qilihai Wetland and Yuqiao Reservoir. Phosphorus was the limiting factor in the Yuqiao Reservoir; nitrogen was the limiting factor in the Qilihai Wetland. Pollution in Qilihai Wetland is more serious than in Yuqiao Reservoir. The study found that external sources are the main source of pollution. These two functional water areas are vital for Tianjin; as such, the study proposes targeted management measures.																	1660-4601					JUL	2017	14	7							695	10.3390/ijerph14070695								WOS:000407370700027

The Limpopo Non-Metropolitan Drinking Water Supplier Response to a Diagnostic Tool for Technical Compliance	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH												Water services providers should supply water that is fit for human consumption, taking into account multi-barrier approaches and technical aspects such as design aspects, operation monitoring, final water quality compliance monitoring, plant monitoring practices, maintenance, and risk management practices. Against this background, this study focused on applying the diagnostic tool for technical compliance as well as assessing the compliance of water treatment plants with management norms. Six plants in the Vhembe District Municipality were selected; the Vondo, Malamulele, Mutshedzi, and Mutale plants (conventional), and the Dzingahe and Tshedza package plants. During the first assessment, four (Malamulele, Mutshedzi, Mutale and Dzingahe) plants scored between 44% and 49% and achieved Class 3 certification, revealing serious challenges requiring immediate intervention. Two water plants (Vondo and Tshedza, scoring 53% and 63%, respectively) were in the Class 2 category, revealing serious challenges requiring attention and improvement. During the second assessment, all plants scored between 63% and 87% (Class 2 category). The greatest improvement (30%) was noted for the Dzingahe and Tshedza plants, followed by the Malamulele plant, while the Mutale, Vondo, and Mutshedzi plants improved their scores by 20%, 17% and 14%, respectively. After corrective actions and re-measurement, no plant complied. It is recommended that Water Services Providers (WSPs) regularly apply the diagnostic tools and water safety plans as developed in order to comply with applicable standards.																	1660-4601					JUL	2017	14	7							810	10.3390/ijerph14070810								WOS:000407370700142

Compared with groundwater, surface water is generally used more widely and has characteristics that make ammonium removal more difficult. In this study, MeOx was used to remove ammonium from surface water. It indicated that the average ammonium removal efficiency of MeOx was greater than 90%, even though the water quality changed dramatically and the water temperature was reduced to about 6-8 degrees C. Then, through inactivating microorganisms, it showed that the removal capability of MeOx included both biological (accounted for about 41.05%) and chemical catalytic oxidation and chemical catalytic oxidation (accounted for about 58.95%). The investigation of the characterizations suggested that MeOx was formed by abiotic ways and the main elements on the surface of MeOx were distributed homogenously. The analysis of the catalytic oxidation process indicated that ammonia nitrogen may interact with MeOx as both ammonia molecules and ammonium ions and the active species of O-2 were possibly O-center dot and O-2(-).																	1660-4601					JUL	2017	14	7							807	10.3390/ijerph14070807								WOS:000407370700139

However, most current (empirical) erodibility indices are based on only a few soil properties. A feasible soil characterization of interrill erosion (IE) prediction at large scale should be based on simple, quick and inexpensive tests to perform. The objective of this work was to identify and assess those soil properties that best reflect soil vulnerability to IE. Twenty-three agricultural soil samples located in Spain and Italy were studied. Forty-nine different physical and chemical soil properties that presumably underpin IE were defined. Experiments were carried out in the field (in microplots using simulated rainfall) and in the lab. The most relevant variables were detected using multivariate analysis. Six key variables were finally identified: RUSLE K factor, a granulometric/organic matter content index, exchangeable sodium percentage, shear strength, penetration resistance and permeability of soil seal. The latter is proposed as a useful technique to evaluate soil susceptibility to crusting even when the crust is not present at the time of the field survey. The selected variables represented a wide range of soil properties, and they could also be successfully applied to different soils with different characteristics than those evaluated in our experiments.

SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL TRENDS OF RECENT DISSOLVED PHOSPHORUS CONCENTRATIONS IN LAKE TANA AND ITS FOUR MAIN TRIBUTARIES	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												Rapid population growth and agricultural intensification have been directly associated with land degradation and with visible deterioration in water quality in the Ethiopian lakes. Assessing the extent and origin of pollution is cumbersome because of the lack of measurements for water quality parameters. This paper reports on the dissolved phosphorus (DP) concentrations in Lake Tana and its tributaries during 3 years from 2010 to 2012 and the four rainy months in 2014. Concentrations in the headwaters, at the gaging station, at the river mouth, near shore (littoral), and in the open lake (pelagic) were measured for the four major rivers. DP concentration in the rivers was on the average 0.32 mg l(-1), and DP in the lake was much lower with an average concentration of 0.10 mg l(-1). Temporally, DP concentrations were greater in the rainy phase of the monsoon than in the dry phase from November through March. Moreover, an upward trend in DP concentrations is coinciding with the area expansion of water hyacinths in the lake. Copyright (C) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Effect of cassava waste on bioremediation of nitrogenous metabolites and shrimp growth	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												Aim: Locally available cheap carbon sources, cassava waste and cassava starch, were tested for their efficiency in decreasing the nitrogenous metabolites, resulting due to accumulation of uneaten feed and excreta at the pond bottom during intensive shrimp aquaculture. Methodology: Yard experiment was carried out in 5001 Fibre reinforced plastic (FRP) tanks fora period of 105 days with four treatments viz., cassava waste, cassava starch, cassava waste+cassava starch and control, replicated thrice and statistically randomized with Tiger shrimp, Penaeus monodon (1.71 g). The following water quality parameters - pH, salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO), total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), nitrite nitrogen (NO2-N); microbial parameters in water and sediment - total heterotrophic bacteria count (THBC) and total vibrio count (TVC); proximate composition, fibre fractionation, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and sulphur content in cassava waste and cassava starch were analyzed. The growth of shrimp was also studied. Results: Shrimp growth was significantly high (p <= 0.05) in cassava waste (11.12 g) treatment followed by cassava starch (10.4 g), cassava waste + cassava starch (9.8 g) and control (8.02 g) at the end of the experiment. Cassava waste, cassava starch and combination of both significantly decreased the concentration of metabolites and had high heterotrophic bacterial population and low total vibrio count compared to control. Interpretation: It was concluded that addition of cassava waste had positive effect on bioremediation of nitrogenous metabolites, enhancing the growth of shrimp.																	0254-8704					JUL	2017	38	4					611	616		10.22438/jeb/38/4/MS-158								WOS:000404828800011

The average contents of nitrate nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen, total phosphorus, and total nitrogen in the four lakes are 0.195-0.0 mg/L, 0.038-0.143 mg/L, 0.004-0.168 mg/L, 0.006-0.740 mg/L, and 0.050-0.547 mg/L, respectively. The total phosphorus contents in Eling Lake, Longbao Lake and Sea Star were higher than Class I water quality standards, and the total nitrogen contents in Eling Lake, Sea Star and Zhaling Lake were higher than Class I water quality standards as well. The concentration contour maps of the nitrate nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen, total phosphorus and total nitrogen showed that the indicators of the four lakes in the east, the west, and the center of the lake did not have the same trend. From 2012 to 2015, each of the measured nutrients showed a rising trend year by year.

Samples from reservoirs in Taiwan with a wide range of water quality were directly used to develop this methodology. Factors that potentially affect the measurement were tested. The results showed that characteristics of the particles measured instantaneously after staining samples with Alcian blue differed significantly from those measured at steady states, as a result of particle aggregation. Compared to traditional microscopic methods, this proposed method provides a simple, rapid, and less labor-intensive analysis with particle morphological conservation and a large number of particle attributes. By overcoming the limitations from the former, this technique would offer routine monitoring of these transparent particles from various freshwater sources and feed water in membrane filtration, hence facilitating the use of TEP as a critical parameter for biofouling investigation in water treatment. Application of the method for Taiwan reservoirs showed a wide variety of morphological forms of TEP and its abundance, up to 25,000 ppm.

The water samples were collected from first aquifer (AQ(1)), second aquifer (AQ(2)), and third aquifer (AQ(3)) at three depths, 50-60, 100-120, and 200-250 m, respectively. The results of aquifer water of three depths were interpreted by using different multivariate statistical techniques. Validation of desired method was checked by spiking standard addition method in studied aquifer water samples. The content of Hg in aquifer water samples was measured by cold vapor atomic absorption spectrometer (CV-AAS). These determined values illustrate that the levels of Hg were higher than WHO recommended values for drinking water. All physicochemical parameters were higher than WHO permissible limits for drinking water except pH and SO42- in aquifer water. The positive correlation of Hg with other metals in aquifer water samples of AQ(1), AQ(2), and AQ(3) of Thar coalfield except HCO3- was observed which might be caused by geochemical minerals. The interpretation of determined values by the cluster technique point out the variations within the water quality parameter as well as sampling location of studied field. The aquifer water AQ(2) was more contaminated with Hg as compared to AQ(1) and AQ(3); it may be due to leaching of Hg from coal zone. The concentration of Hg in aquifer water obtained from different depths was found in the following decreasing order: AQ(2) < AQ(1) < AQ(3).																	0944-1344	1614-7499				JUL	2017	24	21					17731	17740		10.1007/s11356-017-9291-z								WOS:000406479200040	28601999					
J	Wang, JJ; Zhao, QH; Pang, Y; Hu, KM				Wang, Jianjian; Zhao, Qiaohua; Pang, Yong; Hu, Kaiming			Research on nutrient pollution load in Lake Taihu, China	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												The eutrophication of Lake Taihu is the joint result of internal and external pollution. Research on the sources and flux loads of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) has great significance for the control and management of the eutrophication issues facing Lake Taihu. We used hydrologic and water quality surveys of the surrounding rivers, precipitation investigations, and an experimental simulation of suspended sediment to analyze the sources of TN and TP to Lake Taihu and to estimate the flux loads of TN and TP. Our results indicate that (1) surrounding rivers, atmospheric deposition, and sediment suspension were the three main sources of TN and TP, with annual flux loads of 29.6 thousand t and 2.8 thousand t, respectively; (2) for the flux load of TN, influxes from surrounding rivers accounted for 61.1%, while atmospheric deposition contributed 23.5%, with both of these sources varying seasonally. Total nitrogen released from sediments contributed 15.4% of the TN load of Lake Taihu; (3) for TP flux load, surrounding rivers accounted for 42.8% and also showed seasonal variation. Atmospheric deposition and sediment release accounted for 17.9 and 39.3% with no significant seasonal variation. This article quantitatively analyzed the sources and loads of TN and TP and provided a basis for pollution control in Lake Taihu.

Wind-induced flow velocity effects on nutrient suspension were investigated at a long narrow bay of large shallow Lake Taihu, the third largest freshwater lake in China. Wind-induced reverse/compensation flow and consistent flow field probabilities at vertical column of the water were measured. The probabilities between the wind field and the flow velocities provided a strong correlation at the surface (80.6%) and the bottom (65.1%) layers of water profile. Vertical flow velocity profile analysis provided the evidence of delay response time to wind field at the bottom layer of lake water. Strong wind field generated by the west (W) and west-north-west (WNW) winds produced displaced water movements in opposite directions to the prevailing flow field. An exponential correlation was observed between the current velocities of the surface and the bottom layers while considering wind speed as a control factor. A linear model was developed to correlate the wind field-induced flow velocity impacts on nutrient concentration at the surface and bottom layers. Results showed that dominant wind directions (ENE, E, and ESE) had a maximum nutrient resuspension contribution (nutrient resuspension potential) of 34.7 and 43.6% at the surface and the bottom profile layers, respectively. Total suspended solids (TSS), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) average concentrations were 6.38, 1.5, and 0.03 mg/L during our field experiment at Eastern Bay of Lake Taihu. Overall, wind-induced low-to-moderate hydrodynamic disturbances contributed more in nutrient resuspension at Eastern Bay of Lake Taihu. The present study can be used to understand the linkage between wind-induced flow velocities and nutrient concentrations for shallow lakes (with uniform morphology and deep margins) water quality management and to develop further models.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				JUL	2017	24	21					17900	17911		10.1007/s11356-017-9374-x								WOS:000406479200057	28616742

The production of bioenergy crops in specific landscape positions within a grain-crop field can serve the dual purpose of producing cellulosic biomass (nutrient recovery) while also providing regulating ecosystem services to improve water quality (nutrient reduction). The effectiveness of such a landscape design was evaluated by the strategic placement of a 0.8-ha short-rotation shrub willow (Salix miyabeana Seemen) bioenergy buffer along marginal soils in a 6.5-ha corn (Zea mays L.) field in a 6-yr field study in central Illinois. The impact of willow integration on water quality (soil water, shallow groundwater leaching, and crop nutrient uptake) and quantity (soil moisture and transpiration) was monitored in comparison with corn in the willow's first cycle of growth. Willows significantly reduced nitrate leachate in shallow subsurface water by 88% while maintaining adequate nutrient and water usage. Results suggest that willows offer an efficient nutrient-reduction strategy and may provide additional ecosystem services and benefits, including enhanced soil health. However, low values for calculated willow biomass will need to be readdressed in the future as harvest data become available to understand contributing factors that affected productivity beyond nutrient availability.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				JUL-AUG	2017	46	4					811	818		10.2134/jeq2017.02.0082								WOS:000406860800013	28783783

In particular, there is a risk to the microbial quality of water, as high quantities of suspended sediment and fecal bacteria can enter into water systems. The feces of farmed red deer (Cervus elaphus, n = 206) from Canterbury and Southland, New Zealand, were analyzed with regard to the presence of Campylobacter spp., Escherichia coli, enterococci, and Yersinia spp. Enterococci and E. coli were isolated from all samples, with mean concentrations of 4.5 x 105 (95% CI 3.5 x 10(3), 5.6 10(7)) and 1.3 x 10(8) (95% CI 1.1 x 10(6), 1.5 x 10(10)) per gram of dry feces, respectively. Campylobacter spp. were isolated from 27 fecal samples, giving an overall prevalence of 13.1%. Campylobacter isolation rates were variable within and between regions (Canterbury 7.95% [95% CI 2-14%], Southland 16.95% [95% CI 10-24%]). Five out of 42 composite samples were positive for Yersinia enterocolitica, and one sample for Y. pseudotuberculosis. The overall prevalence ranges on a per-animal basis were therefore 2.43 to 11.17% and 0.49 to 2.91%, respectively. This study is the first to quantify the concentration of Campylobacter spp. present in healthy deer farmed in New Zealand. Deer feces are a potential source of human campylobacteriosis, with all genotypes isolated also previously observed among human cases. The fecal outputs from deer should be regarded as potentially pathogenic to humans and therefore be appropriately managed.

Application of Polyacrylamide (PAM) through Lay-Flat Polyethylene Tubing: Effects on Infiltration, Erosion, N and P Transport, and Corn Yield	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Polyacrylamides (PAMs), when applied as a soil amendment, purportedly improve soil infiltration, decrease erosion, and reduce offsite agrochemical transport. The effect of PAM on infiltration, erosion, agrochemical transport, and crop yield when applied in furrow to mid-southern US production systems has not been evaluated. The objective of this study was to assess PAM effects on infiltration, erosion, corn (Zea mays L.) grain yield, and nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) transport when applied at 10 mg L-1 through lay-flat polyethylene tubing. A 2-yr field study was conducted at the Mississippi State Delta Research and Extension Center in Stoneville, MS, on a Dundee silt loam and a Forestdale silty clay loam. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with four replications of each treatment: irrigated plus no PAM (control) and irrigated plus PAM at 10 mg L-1. Each irrigation event delivered 102 mm of water at 18.9 L m(-1) per furrow, and runoff was captured in a holding tank on the lower end of each plot. Pooled over year and soil texture, PAM increased infiltration and corn grain yield by 6% (P <= 0.0398). Polyacrylamide effects on the offsite transport of sediment and N and P were inconsistent, varying across year and soil texture. Results indicate that PAM improves infiltration and corn grain yield on silt loam and silty clay loam textured soils; however, further research is required before PAM can be recommended as a best management practice for mitigating erosion and offsite agrochemical transport in mid-southern production systems.

Robustness of the models and compliance of their sensitivity with current quality limits are investigated. The following indicators are studied: total suspended solids (TSS), turbidity, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and nitrate. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) is used to find linear correlations between absorbances and indicators of interest. Artificial samples are made by simulating a sludge leak on the wastewater treatment plant and added to the original dataset, then divided into calibration and prediction datasets. The models are built on the calibration set, and then tested on the prediction set. The best models are developed with: PLSR for COD (R-pred(2) = 0.80), TSS (R-pred(2) = 0.86) and turbidity (R-pred(2) = 0.96), and with a simple linear regression from absorbance at 208 nm (R-pred(2) = 0.95) for nitrate concentration. The input of artificial data significantly enhances the robustness of the models. The sensitivity of the UV/Vis spectrometry monitoring system developed is compatible with quality requirements of reclaimed water production processes.

J	Hao, Z; Gao, Y; Yang, TT				Hao, Zhuo; Gao, Yang; Yang, Tiantian			Seasonal variation of DOM and associated stoichiometry for freshwater ecosystem in the subtropical watershed: Indicating the optimal C: N: P ratio	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are three of the most important elements for estimating ecosystem biogenic elements status and algal growth. Therefore, the C:N:P ecological stoichiometry serves as an important reference to guide water quality management and helps elucidate the aquatic ecosystems mechanism. This study firstly provides the information on the seasonal changes of dissolved organic matter (DOM) pool (dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP)) under base-flow and rainfall-runoff scenarios, and then analyzes the optimal variation of C, N and P stoichiometry for freshwater ecosystem. Comparing the element contents under the two different scenarios, the results show that rainfall and runoff volumes are the major causes of the C: N: P ratios changes. We find out that the value of DOC is significantly higher than the value of DON and DOP. In addition, the DOC is the one of the major causes for trapping DOM, which accounts for 95% of the total DOM in freshwater ecosystem. And the change of DOP is the smallest as it compares to the changes of DOC and DON. It is discovered that the DOC: DON: DOP molar ratios in the watershed have an exponential distribution. The optimal DOC: DON: DOP ratio is 170-985:17-34:1 for the freshwater ecosystem. Moreover, the results suggest that the DTN: DTP (dissolved total nitrogen: dissolved organic phosphorus) ratio that equals to 10-64:1 will be the most beneficial for Xiangxi River basin in freshwater ecosystem. This result also indicates that the element of phytoplankton, which plays an important role in determining the trophic structures and community, is limited in the freshwater ecosystems.

J	Zahedi, S; Azarnivand, A; Chitsaz, N				Zahedi, Sina; Azarnivand, Ali; Chitsaz, Nastaran			Groundwater quality classification derivation using Multi-Criteria-Decision-Making techniques	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The paper introduces a novel framework of evaluating and validating the groundwater quality index (GWQI) by employing two Multi-Criteria-Decision-Making models (MCDMs) such as Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and Compromise Programming (CP). GWQIs are plagued by discrete values which are attributed to excellent, good, poor, very poor, and unsuitable for drinking purpose classes. Furthermore, the existence of chemical parameters with low weights but high concentration values (or vice versa) reduces equilibrium of evaluations. Based on the literature review, MCDMs have not been applied so far to validate groundwater quality indexes. This simple yet practical structure assists the analysts to investigate robustness of a water quality index. In order to validate the classes, the intervals of classic GWQI were modified to figure out what changes were made to the classes of samples in the ranking table considering quality of 92 wells in the Varamin plain, Iran. After employment of the MCDMs, the results revealed that WQI could rarely evaluate water quality classes accurately. Several wells which were classified as "excellent quality" were belonged to the lower quality class. It also came true for other classes. The results demonstrated that TOPSIS could present a more precise analysis for the classes with a low number of wells. Moreover, increases in value of the sensitivity parameter of CP technique reduced the accuracy of results. Owing to proper application of MCDMs, one can suggest the use and development of MCDM-based water quality assessment models for future researches. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, in cases where measurements are lacking, its estimation is of the essence. In the present study, Morlet wavelet spectrum (periodicity) and multiple regression analyses were conducted on 15 chemical, biological and physical water quality variables sampled at 14 sites along the Hungarian section of the River Tisza and 4 sites from artificial tributary channels for 1993-2005. Results show that annual periodicity was not always to be found in the water quality parameters, at least at certain sampling sites. Periodicity was found to vary over space and time, but in general, an increase was observed in the company of higher trophic states of the river heading downstream. Based on the spatial distribution of the periodic behavior of the water quality parameters (runoff, ions, and nutrients given in so-called periodicity indices), an improved model was constructed which was capable of explaining about half (adjusted R-2 = 0.5) of the phytoplankton variance in the study area.

However, the evaluation of good status is based on the way the WFD is implemented, which differs in each country. In this article, we analyze how the WFD is implemented in France, how the water agencies divide up the water bodies, the areas covered by their monitoring networks, and the modalities of obtaining data to provide the EU with the percentage of water bodies at good status. This analysis reveals that it is this hyperindicator itself that is at stake, obtained by successively aggregating values measured in time and space, from the monitoring station to the River Basin District (RBD), reducing vast amounts of information to a single measure per RBD, while long-term monitoring of the major European rivers and their sedimentary budgets, which show improvements in certain quality aspects, are largely overlooked by the WFD. When drawing up the indicator, the agencies identify certain biases but not others. This raises the question of its use and relevance for manager's and politicians, at both national and European level. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Our goal was to develop a realistic integrated conceptual model to analyze and envisage the consequence of fluctuating environmental parameters on the stress physiology of these fishes and their adaptive responses to thrive in such environment. Fishes were collected monthly throughout the year from 3 different study sites and various anti-oxidant (enzymatic and non-enzymatic) and detoxification enzymes were measured. Levels of the stress hormone cortisol and reproductive hormone 17 beta-estradiol were also measured as indicators of stress accumulation and reproductive status of the selected fish species. The study sites showed variations in physical factors such as pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature and salinity, which may be related to environmental fluctuation and/or pollution level. Such panel of multiple enzyme and hormone biomarkers in fish might be a useful tool to develop an assessment model. This study demonstrated a sharp indication of variation in the antioxidant enzyme profiles depending on the physical environment but the changes is exclusively site as well as species specific. To justify our assumptions cluster and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis have been done to investigate the ordination of physiological parameters and water quality parameters; if it varies for each species or not. Levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidise (GPx), malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) showed variations depending on the physical environment but the changes is exclusively site as well as species specific. Finally, the prediction model and NMDS scaling confirmed MDA, GST and GSH as decisive factor to envisage steroid hormone, whereas organic carbon, temperature, ammonia and alkalinity as the major contributor of its prediction.

J	Luo, J; Huai, WX; Gao, M				Luo, Jing; Huai, Wenxin; Gao, Meng			Indicators for environmental dispersion in a two-layer wetland flow with effect of wind	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												For typical two-layer wetland flows where wind occurs frequently, indicators for flow and contaminant dispersion with wind effect are considered in this paper. Based on the general formulation for porous media flows, the velocity distribution of a fully developed flow through a wetland is illustrated, with that for a single-layer wetland flow under wind recovered as a special case. And the contrary wind of high speed might result in the appearance of an inverse-flow layer. For the more complex case of a two-layer wetland flow under wind, the more simplified method of asymptotic analysis is adopted instead of Aris's method of concentration moments to determine the dispersivity in terms of the longitudinal evolution of the depth-averaged concentration. And it is illustrated with the effect of dimensionless parameters. The velocity profile and environmental dispersivity for the two-layer wetland flow in the absence of wind can be included as a limiting case. Both the direction and the strength of the wind can affect the environmental dispersivity considerably under long-term evolution. Analytical solutions for the mean concentration and the region influenced by the contaminant cloud are derived. And for the instantaneous emission of typical contaminant constituents, the related indicators for water quality assessment, such as the critical length and duration of the influenced region are illustrated. The results show that the critical length and duration of the concentration cloud can change considerably because of the wind and vegetation heterogeneity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) potentially process extra ammonium, so their abundance and diversity are of great ecological significance. This study aimed to reveal variations in communities of AOA and AOB as affected by aquaculture activities. Materials and methods From June to September 2012, water and sediments were sampled monthly in three ponds feeding Mandarin fish in a suburb of Wuhan City, China. Molecular methods based on ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) gene were used to determine abundance and diversity of AOA and AOB in the sediments. Results and discussion The pond with the highest fish stock had the highest nutrient loadings in terms of different forms of N and carbon (C) in both sediment and water. The abundance and diversity of AOB were significantly higher than those of AOA in the sediment. The AOB abundance showed a significantly positive relationship to concentration of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) in interstitial water, and both abundance and diversity of AOA were significantly negative to concentration of ammonium in interstitial water. Furthermore, AOA species affiliated to Nitrososphaera-like and Nitrosophaera Cluster was distinguishable from those observed in other aquaculture environments. Conclusions Nutrients in sediment were enriched by intensive aquaculture activity, among which organic N and C, together with ammonium and SRP, shaped the communities of ammonia oxidizers, with AOB dominating over AOA in terms of abundance and diversity.																	1439-0108	1614-7480				JUL	2017	17	7			SI		1928	1938		10.1007/s11368-017-1651-2								WOS:000405668700011

The usefulness of these techniques lies in the automated extraction of novel knowledge from the data to improve decision-making. The popular classification techniques, namely k-nearest neighbor, decision trees, Naive Bayes, artificial neural networks, rule-based and support vector machines were used to develop the predictive environment to classify water quality into understandable terms based on the Overall Index of Pollution. Experimentation was conducted on two types of data sets: synthetic and real. A repeated k-fold cross-validation procedure was followed to design the learning and testing frameworks of the predictive environment. Based on the validation results, it was found that the error rate in defining the true water quality class was 20 and 28%, 11 and 24%, 1 and 38% and 10 and 20% for the k-nearest neighbor, Naive Bayes, artificial neural network and rule-based classifiers for synthetic and real data sets, respectively. The decision tree and support vector machines classifiers were found to be the best predictive models with 0% error rates during automated extraction of the water quality class. This study reveals that data mining techniques have the potential to quickly predict water quality class, provided data given are a true representation of the domain knowledge.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JUL	2017	76	14							504	10.1007/s12665-017-6845-9								WOS:000406241000037

In the study area, the majority of the groundwater and surface water samples belong to the calcium-magnesium-bicarbonate type (Ca-Mg-HCO3) or magnesium-calcium-bicarbonate type (Mg-Ca-HCO3). Chemical analysis of all water samples shows that the mean cation concentrations (in mg/L) were in the order Ca2+ > Mg2+ > Na+ > K+ and that of anions are in the order HCO3- > SO42- > Cl- > CO3- for all groundwater and surface water samples. The Mg (2+)/Ca2+ ratio ranges from 0.21 to 1.30 with most of the values greater than 0.5, indicating that weathering of dolomites is dominant in groundwater. The analysis reveals that all of the samples are neutral to slightly alkaline (pH 7.0-8.7). Groundwater and surface water suitability for drinking usage was evaluated according to the World Health Organization and Turkish Standards (TSE-266) and suggests that most of the samples are suitable for drinking. Various determinants such as sodium absorption ratio, percent sodium (Na %), residual sodium carbonate and soluble sodium percentage revealed that most of the samples are suitable for irrigation. According to MH values, all of the well water samples were suitable for irrigation purposes, but 80 and 81.82% of Zillek springs and surface water samples were unsuitable. As per the PI values, the water samples from the study area are classified as Class I and Class II and are considered to be suitable for irrigation.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JUL	2017	76	14							500	10.1007/s12665-017-6820-5								WOS:000406241000033

Quality of this water is generally very poor owing to high salt content, and discharge of such water to the land surface frequently results in serious deterioration of the soil health through expansion of salinity and alkalinity problems. Use of reverse osmosis (RO) technology has appeared to be an effective proposition for bringing down the ionic concentrations of coal bed water (CBW) and facilitating their safe release. However, reclaiming the large volume of CBW through RO is expensive and is difficult to be afforded by many CBM producers from developing countries. In this study, we assessed the possibility of releasing an intermediate-quality RO-treated CBW which will not affect the health of the flooded soils and also will involve lesser cost of RO operation. The study showed that the quality of RO-treated CBW below 2 mmho/cm did not affect the incubated soil very adversely with regard to the major soil health attributes. However, exchangeable sodium percentage of the RO water-treated soil exhibited sharp increments when the EC value of the RO water increased to 2.0 mmho/cm resulting in development of high alkalinity. It is, therefore, suggested that while treating CBW with RO technology for discharging the resultant water to adjacent areas, it is not necessary to produce highly purified reclaimed water. Instead of going for high level of reclamation, discharge of a moderate-quality treated water may be an effective proposition for improving the economy of CBW reclamation without affecting the health of the CBW-influenced soils.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JUL	2017	76	14							474	10.1007/s12665-017-6809-0								WOS:000406241000007

D.; Chaturvedi, Aaditya			Hydrogeochemistry of coal mine water of North Karanpura coalfields, India: implication for solute acquisition processes, dissolved fluxes and water quality assessment	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Mine water samples collected from different mines of the North Karanpura coalfields were analysed for pH, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids (TDS), total hardness (TH), major anions, cations and trace metals to evaluate mine water geochemistry and assess solute acquisition processes, dissolved fluxes and its suitability for domestic, industrial and irrigation uses. Mine water samples are mildly acidic to alkaline in nature. The TDS ranged from 185 to 1343 mg L-1 with an average of 601 mg L-1. Ca2+ and Mg2+ are the dominant cations, while SO42- and HCO3- are the dominant anions. A high concentration of SO42- and a low HCO3(-)/(HCO3- + SO42-) ratio (< 0.50) in the majority of the water samples suggest that either sulphide oxidation or reactions involving both carbonic acid weathering and sulphide oxidation control solute acquisition processes. The mine water is undersaturated with respect to gypsum, halite, anhydrite, fluorite, aluminium hydroxide, alunite, amorphous silica and oversaturated with respect to goethite, ferrihydrite, quartz. About 40% of the mine water samples are oversaturated with respect to calcite, dolomite and jarosite. The water quality assessment shows that the coal mine water is not suitable for direct use for drinking and domestic purposes and needs treatment before such utilization. TDS, TH, F-, SO42-, Fe, Mn, Ni and Al are identified as the major objectionable parameters in these waters for drinking. The coal mine water is of good to suitable category for irrigation use. The mines of North Karanpura coalfield annually discharge 22.35 x 10(6) m(3) of water and 18.50 x 10(3) tonnes of solute loads into nearby waterways.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JUL	2017	76	14							489	10.1007/s12665-017-6813-4								WOS:000406241000022

Uncertainty assessment of the multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network model with implementation of the novel hybrid MLP-FFA method for prediction of biochemical oxygen demand and dissolved oxygen: a case study of Langat River	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Accurate prediction of the chemical constituents in major river systems is a necessary task for water quality management, aquatic life well-being and the overall healthcare planning of river systems. In this study, the capability of a newly proposed hybrid forecasting model based on the firefly algorithm (FFA) as a metaheuristic optimizer, integrated with the multilayer perceptron (MLP-FFA), is investigated for the prediction of monthly water quality in Langat River basin, Malaysia. The predictive ability of the MLP-FFA model is assessed against the MLP-based model. To validate the proposed MLP-FFA model, monthly water quality data over a 10-year duration (2001-2010) for two different hydrological stations (1L04 and 1L05) provided by the Irrigation and Drainage Ministry of Malaysia are used to predict the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and dissolved oxygen (DO). The input variables are the chemical oxygen demand (COD), total phosphate (PO4), total solids, potassium (K), sodium (Na), chloride (Cl), electrical conductivity (EC), pH and ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N). The proposed hybrid model is then evaluated in accordance with statistical metrics such as the correlation coefficient (r), root-mean-square error, % root-mean-square error and Willmott's index of agreement. Analysis of the results shows that MLP-FFA outperforms the equivalent MLP model. Also, in this research, the uncertainty of a MLP neural network model is analyzed in relation to the predictive ability of the MLP model. To assess the uncertainties within the MLP model, the percentage of observed data bracketed by 95 percent predicted uncertainties (95PPU) and the band width of 95 percent confidence intervals (d-factors) are selected. The effect of input variables on BOD and DO prediction is also investigated through sensitivity analysis. The obtained values bracketed by 95PPU show about 77.7%, 72.2% of data for BOD and 72.2%, 91.6% of data for DO related to the 1L04 and 1L05 stations, respectively. The d-factors have a value of 1.648, 2.269 for BOD and 1.892, 3.480 for DO related to the 1L04 and 1L05 stations, respectively. Based on the values in both stations for the 95PPU and d-factor, it is concluded that the neural network model has an acceptably low degree of uncertainty applied for BOD and DO simulations. The findings of this study can have important implications for error assessment in artificial intelligence-based predictive models applied for water resources management and the assessment of the overall health in major river systems.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JUL	2017	76	14							503	10.1007/s12665-017-6842-z								WOS:000406241000036						
J	Thapa, R; Gupta, S; Reddy, DV; Kaur, H				Thapa, Raju; Gupta, Srimanta; Reddy, D. V.; Kaur, Harjeet			An evaluation of irrigation water suitability in the Dwarka river basin through the use of GIS-based modelling	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												A GIS-based irrigation water quality (IWQ) assessment of the Dwarka river basin was undertaken using water suitability indicators including determinations of values of: soluble sodium percentage, exchangeable sodium ratio or Kelly ratio, residual sodium carbonate, magnesium adsorption ratios, total hardness, sodium adsorption ratio and permeability indices, electrical conductivity, and fluoride concentrations (F-). Inverse distance weighted algorithms and weighted overlays were used to categorise irrigation water quality into a number of zones. The IWQ zonation analysis revealed that about 10% (42.15 km(2)) of the total area had water quality unsuitable for irrigation thereby potentially exposing a population of 35744 people from 110 villages to health risks, whereas the remaining 91.31% (393 km(2)) of the study area is considered to have suitable irrigation water. The villages of Nawapara, Sehara and Deucha have been particularly affected by poor water quality, potentially exposing 294 (100%), 114 (97%) and 1556 (87.76%) of the total village population, respectively, to health effects. Combined efforts of government agencies and NGOs in educating the local communities regarding artificial groundwater recharge, rainwater harvesting, watershed management can play a crucial role in the long run in minimising the potential impacts of poor water quality in these areas.

Quantifying flow interval-pollutant loading relationships in a rapidly urbanizing mixed-land-use watershed of the Central USA	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Rapid urbanization and agricultural development have altered flow and pollutant loading regimes resulting in poorly understood pollutant transport regimes and inadequately conceived management practices. Four years of hydrologic and water quality data (i.e., stream flow, suspended sediment, nitrate, nitrite, total ammonium, total inorganic nitrogen, and total phosphorus) were collected using a five-site nested-scale study design in a representative mixed-land-use watershed. Cumulative nested sub-basin drainage areas ranged from 79 to 208 km(2). Daily flow and load duration analyses were used to quantify land use impacts to flow-mediated pollutant loading at multiple flow intervals including high flows (0-10%), moist conditions (10-40%), mid-range flows (40-60%), dry conditions (60-90%), and low flows (90-100%). Pollutant loads ranged across four orders of magnitude for suspended sediments, and three orders of magnitude for nutrient loads during the high flow interval when nearly all of the total pollutant loads were transported (e.g., 99% of suspended sediments, 92% of total inorganic nitrogen, and 95% of total phosphorus loads). Results from stepwise multiple linear regression analyses showed significant relationships between land use, flow, and pollutant load at high flows, moist conditions, and mid-range flow intervals (R-2 < 75.7; p < 0.035). No significant relationships (p < 0.05) were detected during dry conditions, or low flow intervals. Results highlight the need for consideration of combined flow and pollutant loading targets appropriate for watersheds modified by current and ongoing land use and point to a need for long-term and broad-scale efforts to develop achievable hydrologic and water quality recommendations especially in rapidly urbanizing mixed-land-use watersheds.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JUL	2017	76	14							484	10.1007/s12665-017-6819-y								WOS:000406241000017

The model is based on organic character (specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA)) of the water samples and a laboratory measure of the microbiological (F-m) decay of chloramine. The applicability of the model for estimation of chloramine residual (and hence chloramine demand) was tested on several waters from different water treatment plants in Australia through statistical test analysis between the experimental and predicted data. Results showed that the model was able to simulate and estimate chloramine demand at various times in real drinking water systems. To elucidate the loss of chloramine over the wide variation of water quality used in this study, the model incorporates both the fast and slow chloramine decay pathways. The significance of estimated fast and slow decay rate constants as the kinetic parameters of the model for three water sources in Australia was discussed. It was found that with the same water source, the kinetic parameters remain the same. This modelling approach has the potential to be used by water treatment operators as a decision support tool in order to manage chloramine disinfection.

Determination of water environment standards based on water quality criteria in China: Limitations and feasibilities	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES												There is a need to formulate water environment standards (WESs) from the current water quality criteria (WQC) in China. To this end, we briefly summarize typical mechanisms applied in several countries with longer histories of developing WESs, and three limitations to formulating WESs in China were identified. After analyzing the feasibility factors including economic development, scientific support capability and environmental policies, we realized that China is still not ready for a complete change from its current nation-wide unified WES system to a local-standard-based system. Thus, we proposed a framework for transformation from WQC to WESs in China. The framework consists of three parts, including responsibilities, processes and policies. The responsibilities include research authorization, development of guidelines, and collection of information, at both national and local levels; the processes include four steps and an impact factor system to establish water quality standards; and the policies include seven specific proposals.

The media filtration process, as the last step of the solid liquid separation process, is largely influenced by the characteristics of flocs, which are formed and controlled within the coagulation process. In a laboratory-based study, the impacts of the physical characteristics of flocs formed using aluminum sulfate on the filtration treatment of two comparative water samples were investigated using a photometric dispersion analyzer and a filterability apparatus. In general, the optimum dosage for maximizing filterability was higher than that for minimizing turbidity under neutral pH conditions. For a monomeric aluminum-based coagulant, the charge neutralization mechanism produced better floc characteristics, including floc growth speed and size, than the sweep flocculation mechanism. In addition, the charge neutralization mechanism showed better performance compared to sweep flocculation in terms of DOC removal and floc filterability improvement for both waters, and showed superiority in turbidity removal only when the raw water had high turbidity. For the different mechanisms, the ways that floc characteristics impacted on floc filterability also differed. The low variation in floc size distribution obtained under the charge neutralization mechanism resulted in the flocs being amenable to removal by filtration processes. For the sweep flocculation mechanism, increasing the floc size improved the settling ability of flocs, resulting in higher filter efficiency.

We investigated the effect of sediment resuspension on benthic fluxes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), metals (Fe, Mn), and nutrients (N, P) in three drinking water reservoirs using sediment core incubations. Measurement of Fe and Mn fluxes, and of microbial potentials to degrade organic substrates (Biolog EcoPlates T) were employed to understand mechanisms regulating DOC exchange after sediment resuspension. Single sediment resuspension events resulted in DOC fluxes [-104 (into sediment) to 46 (release) mmol m(-2) event(-1)] equal to 9-17 days of diffusive fluxes, making them a relevant process. Shallow reservoir sites were more likely to immobilize DOC after resuspension than deep sites. Sediment resuspension under anoxia always led to increases of DOC and metals in the overlying water. Resuspension did not necessarily mobilize nitrate or phosphorus even under anoxia, while ammonium was released after resuspension. Sediment resuspension increased hypolimnetic microbial potentials to utilize organic substrates in both spring and summer. However microbial cells counts and biomass either remained constant or decreased in summer. Adsorption to Fe minerals seemed to play a role in DOC immobilization as evidenced by a decrease in DOC: Fe molar ratios after resuspension in Fe limited sites and constant ratios in Fe rich sites. The results demonstrate a potential for DOC immobilization mainly by Fe minerals and to some extent by benthic microbes. Therefore, sediment resuspension can be beneficial for water quality in low nutrient, iron rich systems.

Effort-based predictors of headwater stream conditions: comparing the proximity of land use pressures and instream stressors on macroinvertebrate assemblages	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Environmental agencies are often faced with resource and time constraints in assessing waterbody health. We compared the strengths of varying levels of effort (field measures, laboratory chemistry, land use, and multiple combinations of these) to explain macroinvertebrate assemblage response along a gradient of urban land use intensity among 30 headwater streams in northern West Virginia. Because the spatial arrangement of human disturbance can govern biotic response, land use effects were analyzed at five spatial scales (whole catchment, and 100 m buffer zone at three fixed upstream distances and total stream network upstream of site); instream ecological measures included physical habitat, algal concentrations and water chemistry. Of the five spatial scales, we predicted that riparian land use nearest the site would explain the most variation but that instream measures would be the overall driver of the macroinvertebrate assemblages. Regression analysis evaluated the strength of single and multiple variables in explaining macroinvertebrate multimetric index (MMI) and ordination patterns, and revealed that assemblages were highly responsive to numerous stressors. In contrast to predictions, total upstream network riparian forest cover explained the most variation overall (83%) while specific conductance was the single best instream measure (64%). Stepwise regression models using combinations of field, laboratory, and land use variables all performed reasonably well but we found that a 3-variable model [% forest (catchment), road density, and specific conductance] that minimized colinearity and cost/effort explained 90% of the variation in the MMI. Validation and spatial autocorrelation results suggest that this model could potentially be used to forecast stream condition for prioritizing conservation and remediation efforts in headwaters within the ecoregion, and our general approach would be broadly applicable in other settings.																	1015-1621	1420-9055				JUL	2017	79	3					765	781		10.1007/s00027-017-0534-3								WOS:000405798900025

Demineralization is a critical process, since the quality and the stability of the PVC resins are highly influenced by the water quality used in the process. The main target values for water parameters are the following: conductivity < 10 mu Scm(-1), TOC < 10 mg L-1, and Al < 0.1 mg L-1. To achieve this quality, several reverse osmosis membranes from different materials and suppliers were tested and compared in the demineralization treatment. Polyamide membranes showed higher salt rejection compared to cellulose acetate membranes yielding both types similar flux and permeability. Two-pass reverse osmosis treatment was necessary to reach conductivities lower than 10 mu S cm(-1). On the other hand, a good quality effluent for reuse was obtained by combining RO and ionic exchange resins. Results showed that good quality PVC resins in terms of color, granulometry, porosity, and bulk density were obtained when demineralized water from two-pass reverse osmosis was used as fresh water, proving the feasibility of the effluent reuse in the PVC industry.

In this study, groundwater quality was monitored during December 2014 at 115 sites in the Hutuo River alluvial-pluvial fan region of northern China. Results showed that 21.7% of NO3- and 51.3% of total hardness samples exceeded grade III of the national quality standards for Chinese groundwater. In addition, results of gray relationship analysis (GRA) show that 64.3, 10.4, 21.7, and 3.6% of samples were within the I, II, IV, and V grades of groundwater in the Hutuo River region, respectively. The poor water quality in the study region is due to intense anthropogenic activities as well as aquifer vulnerability to contamination. Results of principal component analysis (PCA) revealed three major factors: (1) domestic wastewater and agricultural runoff pollution (anthropogenic activities), (2) water-rock interactions (natural processes), and (3) industrial wastewater pollution (anthropogenic activities). Using PCA and absolute principal component scores-multivariate linear regression (APCS-MLR), results show that domestic wastewater and agricultural runoff are the main sources of groundwater pollution in the Hutuo River alluvial-pluvial fan area. Thus, the most appropriate methods to prevent groundwater quality degradation are to improve capacities for wastewater treatment and to optimize fertilization strategies.

J	Heddam, S; Kisi, O				Heddam, Salim; Kisi, Ozgur			Extreme learning machines: a new approach for modeling dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration with and without water quality variables as predictors	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												In this paper, several extreme learning machine (ELM) models, including standard extreme learning machine with sigmoid activation function (S-ELM), extreme learning machine with radial basis activation function (R-ELM), online sequential extreme learning machine (OS-ELM), and optimally pruned extreme learning machine (OP-ELM), are newly applied for predicting dissolved oxygen concentration with and without water quality variables as predictors. Firstly, using data from eight United States Geological Survey (USGS) stations located in different rivers basins, USA, the S-ELM, R-ELM, OS-ELM, and OP-ELM were compared against the measured dissolved oxygen (DO) using four water quality variables, water temperature, specific conductance, turbidity, and pH, as predictors. For each station, we used data measured at an hourly time step for a period of 4 years. The dataset was divided into a training set (70%) and a validation set (30%). We selected several combinations of the water quality variables as inputs for each ELM model and six different scenarios were compared. Secondly, an attempt was made to predict DO concentration without water quality variables. To achieve this goal, we used the year numbers, 2008, 2009, etc., month numbers from (1) to (12), day numbers from (1) to (31) and hour numbers from (00:00) to (24:00) as predictors. Thirdly, the best ELM models were trained using validation dataset and tested with the training dataset. The performances of the four ELM models were evaluated using four statistical indices: the coefficient of correlation (R), the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), the root mean squared error (RMSE), and the mean absolute error (MAE). Results obtained from the eight stations indicated that: (i) the best results were obtained by the S-ELM, R-ELM, OS-ELM, and OP-ELM models having four water quality variables as predictors; (ii) out of eight stations, the OP-ELM performed better than the other three ELM models at seven stations while the R-ELM performed the best at one station. The OS-ELM models performed the worst and provided the lowest accuracy; (iii) for predicting DO without water quality variables, the R-ELM performed the best at seven stations followed by the S-ELM in the second place and the OP-ELM performed the worst with low accuracy; (iv) for the final application where training ELM models with validation dataset and testing with training dataset, the OP-ELM provided the best accuracy using water quality variables and the R-ELM performed the best at all eight stations without water quality variables. Fourthly, and finally, we compared the results obtained from different ELM models with those obtained using multiple linear regression (MLR) and multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN). Results obtained using MLPNN and MLR models reveal that: (i) using water quality variables as predictors, the MLR performed the worst and provided the lowest accuracy in all stations; (ii) MLPNN was ranked in the second place at two stations, in the third place at four stations, and finally, in the fourth place at two stations, (iii) for predicting DO without water quality variables, MLPNN is ranked in the second place at five stations, and ranked in the third, fourth, and fifth places in the remaining three stations, while MLR was ranked in the last place with very low accuracy at all stations. Overall, the results suggest that the ELM is more effective than the MLPNN and MLR for modelling DO concentration in river ecosystems.

J	Ragunathan, MG				Ragunathan, Manickavalli Gurunadhan			Acute toxic effect of sewage effluent on the early life phase of an estuarine crab Scylla serrata	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												The biological quality of secondary treated sewage effluent was evaluated using a toolbox approach, which combined a larval developmental bioassay and measurement of fecal indicator organisms. The zoea developmental toxicity of Scylla serrata from stage I to stage II was determined by exposing to a range of secondary treated sewage concentrations. Results indicated that the relative progress of zoea stage I to zoea stage II negatively correlated with increasing sewage concentrations. Data was analyzed statistically to determine lethal, median lethal, sublethal, low observed effect, and no observed effect concentrations. Water samples collected along the Buckingham canal discharge zone were also analyzed for its toxicity to the larval development. Fecal indicator organisms chosen to determine the water quality were E. coli, enterococci, C. perfrigens, and F+ coliphages. Concentrations of these fecal markers were determined in the raw influent, primary treated effluent, secondary treated effluent, and in four discharge zone sites. Data showed that this biological toolbox is helpful for providing baseline information on the effectiveness of the wastewater treatment and environmental health of the discharge zone.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				JUL	2017	24	20					16927	16932		10.1007/s11356-017-9196-x								WOS:000405580000033	28577142					
J	Li, X; Nan, RQ				Li, Xia; Nan, Ruiqi			A bibliometric analysis of eutrophication literatures: an expanding and shifting focus	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												This paper examined the eutrophication literatures from 1998 to 2015 using bibliometric techniques basing on the database of Science Citation Index. Bibliometric techniques, social network analysis, and mapping knowledge domains in this paper were used. The results revealed that article was the most used document type accounting for 94.79% (14,006) of the records. With the rapid development of eutrophication domain after 2004, the annual article publishing amount also grew notably in each country, with the list of US tops. International cooperation was not enough to compare with that between institutions. An author keyword analysis showed that "phosphorus," "nutrients," "nitrogen," "water quality," "phytoplankton," and "sediment" were the most popular keywords. And it was also found that climate change, life cycle assessment, and chlorophyll a appear with high frequency in recent years, indicating that the eutrophication mechanism analysis might turn from uni-factor microresearch to multi-factor macroresearch, and the eutrophication management research tends to be whole-process management research. In addition, the future focuses of research directions, including (1) eutrophication and its ecosystem response, (2) eutrophication management, (3) eutrophication and climate change interactions, (4) eutrophication monitoring and forecast, and (5) ecological restoration of eutrophication. These findings are useful for the future endeavor of eutrophication academic research.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				JUL	2017	24	20					17103	17115		10.1007/s11356-017-9294-9								WOS:000405580000048	28585009					
J	Byrne, P; Runkel, RL; Walton-Day, K				Byrne, Patrick; Runkel, Robert L.; Walton-Day, Katherine			Synoptic sampling and principal components analysis to identify sources of water and metals to an acid mine drainage stream	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Combining the synoptic mass balance approach with principal components analysis (PCA) can be an effective method for discretising the chemistry of inflows and source areas in watersheds where contamination is diffuse in nature and/or complicated by groundwater interactions. This paper presents a field-scale study in which synoptic sampling and PCA are employed in a mineralized watershed (Lion Creek, Colorado, USA) under low flow conditions to (i) quantify the impacts of mining activity on stream water quality; (ii) quantify the spatial pattern of constituent loading; and (iii) identify inflow sources most responsible for observed changes in stream chemistry and constituent loading. Several of the constituents investigated (Al, Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn) fail to meet chronic aquatic life standards along most of the study reach. The spatial pattern of constituent loading suggests four primary sources of contamination under low flow conditions. Three of these sources are associated with acidic (pH < 3.1) seeps that enter along the left bank of Lion Creek. Investigation of inflow water (trace metal and major ion) chemistry using PCA suggests a hydraulic connection between many of the left bank inflows and mine water in the Minnesota Mine shaft located to the north-east of the river channel. In addition, water chemistry data during a rainfall-runoff event suggests the spatial pattern of constituent loading may be modified during rainfall due to dissolution of efflorescent salts or erosion of streamside tailings. These data point to the complexity of contaminant mobilisation processes and constituent loading in mining-affected watersheds but the combined synoptic sampling and PCA approach enables a conceptual model of contaminant dynamics to be developed to inform remediation.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				JUL	2017	24	20					17220	17240		10.1007/s11356-017-9038-x								WOS:000405580000058	28589273

The objectives were to assess the water quality outflow parameters, the potential of L. minor concerning the removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and four azo dyes (Acid blue 113, reactive blue 198, Direct Orange 46 and Basic Red 46) and the plants' growth rate. Findings show that all mean outflow values of COD, total dissolved solids (TDS) and electrical conductivity (EC) were significantly (p < 0.05) lower within the outdoor compared to the indoor experiment except the dissolved oxygen (DO). The COD removal was low for both experiments. The outflow TDS values were acceptable for all ponds. The pond systems were able to reduce only BR46 significantly (p < 0.05) for the tested boundary conditions. Removals under laboratory conditions were better than those for semi-natural environments, indicating the suitability of operating the pond system as a polishing step in warmer regions. The mean outflow values of zinc and copper were below the thresholds set for drinking and irrigation waters and acceptable for L. minor. The dyes inhibited the growth of the L. minor.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				JUL	2017	24	19			SI		16031	16040		10.1007/s11356-017-9245-5								WOS:000405561200014	28537020

Artificial intelligence (AI) models have been successfully applied for modeling DO content in aquatic ecosystems with limited data. However, the efficacy of these AI models in predicting DO levels in the hypoxic river systems having multiple pollution sources and complicated pollutants behaviors is unclear. Given this dilemma, we developed a promising AI model, known as support vector machine (SVM), to predict the DO concentration in a hypoxic river in southeastern China. Four different calibration models, specifically, multiple linear regression, back propagation neural network, general regression neural network, and SVM, were established, and their prediction accuracy was systemically investigated and compared. A total of 11 hydro-chemical variables were used as model inputs. These variables were measured bimonthly at eight sampling sites along the rural-suburban-urban portion of Wen-Rui Tang River from 2004 to 2008. The performances of the established models were assessed through the mean square error (MSE), determination coefficient (R-2), and Nash-Sutcliffe (NS) model efficiency. The results indicated that the SVM model was superior to other models in predicting DO concentration in Wen-Rui Tang River. For SVM, the MSE, R-2, and NS values for the testing subset were 0.9416 mg/L, 0.8646, and 0.8763, respectively. Sensitivity analysis showed that ammonium-nitrogen was the most significant input variable of the proposal SVM model. Overall, these results demonstrated that the proposed SVM model can efficiently predict water quality, especially for highly impaired and hypoxic river systems.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				JUL	2017	24	19			SI		16062	16076		10.1007/s11356-017-9243-7								WOS:000405561200017	28537025

Some physicochemical parameters as well as somatic indexes, gills and liver histopathology, genotoxicity, and biochemical biomarkers were evaluated. The highest gonadosomatic index (GSI) and antioxidant parameters (catalase and glutathione S-transferase activities, non-protein thiols), as well as the lowest damage to biomolecules (lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, DNA damage) were observed in site 0 (Piava River), which is located at an environmental protected area. Site 1, located in the same river, but downstream site 0 and outside the protection area, presents some level of impact. Fish from site 2 (Antas River), which lack of riparian forest and suffer from silting, presented the highest micronucleus incidence and no melanomacrophages. Differently, individuals from site 3 (Xambr River) and site 4 (Pinhalzinho River) which receive surface runoff from Umuarama city, urban and industrial sewage, have the highest incidences of liver and gill histopathological alterations, including neoplasia, which indicated the worst health conditions of all sites. In particular, site 4 had high levels of total nitrogen and ammonia, high turbidity, and very low oxygen levels, which indicate important chemical impact. Comparison of the biomarkers in fish allowed classification of the five sites in terms of environmental impact and revealed that sites 3 and 4 had particular poor water quality.

However, the low nitrogen utilization efficiency (NUE) restricted its widely application. To date, many attempts have been conducted to improve its NUE. In the present study, effect of micro- and macro-nutrient addition on performance of tilapia-pak choi aquaponics was investigated. Results showed that the addition of micro- and macro-nutrients improved the growth of plant directly and facilitated fish physiology indirectly, which subsequently increased NUE of aquaponics from 40.42 to 50.64%. In addition, remarkable lower total phosphorus concentration was obtained in aquaponics with micro- and macro-nutrient addition, which was attributed to the formation of struvite. Most of the added micro-nutrients were enriched in plant root, while macro-nutrients mainly existed in water. Moreover, no enrichment of micro- and macro-nutrients in aquaponic products (i.e., fish and plant leaves) was observed, indicating that it had no influence on food safety. The findings here reported manifest that appropriate addition of micro- and macro-nutrients to aquaponics is necessary, and would improve its economic feasibility.

The Biological Flora of Coastal Dunes and Wetlands: Halodule wrightii Ascherson	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Information on the seagrass Halodule wrightii was assembled describing its taxonomy, phylogeny, and geographic distribution and its plant communities, ecology, population biology, reproduction, and biotic interactions. The objective was to review the current understanding of its role as a pioneer species that thrives in nutrient-rich waters and has a broad tolerance range to abiotic factors, such as salinity, temperature, depth, and light. Its short life cycle, high degree of vegetative reproduction, and rapid growth allow it to colonize areas that have undergone disturbances, e.g., those affected by hurricanes. It occurs in monospecific stands or mixed with other seagrasses (Ruppia maritima, Thalassia testudinum, Syringodium filiforme, Zostera marina) and exhibits both vegetative and sexual reproduction but does not flower often. Worsening water quality is the main cause of seagrass decline in the world, along with other human activities, such as fishing, dredging, boating, and tourism. Given its usefulness, it is important to establish programs for the restoration and management of this species.

In this study, hydrogeochemical and isotope methods were employed to determine regional and local hydrogeology and characteristics of the basin. Optical, thermal and radar remote sensing products were used to update geological and structural maps of the basin and determine sampling points using the judgment sampling method. A total of 363 samples from wells, springs, rivers, lakes, swamps and rain were collected for this study, and an additional 270 water quality data sets were added from previous studies. These data were analyzed for their hydrogeochemical characteristics and isotope signatures. Analysis of the oxygen, deuterium and tritium isotopes shows the groundwater of the basin is modern water. Among all basins in Ethiopia, the Baro-Akobo Basin shows the highest enrichment. This indicates the proximity of the rainfall sources, which presumably are the Sudd and other wetlands in South Sudan. The hydrochemical properties of the waters show evapotranspiration is the dominant hydrologic process in the basin and explains the large amount of water that is lost in the lowland plain. Analysis of radon-222 shows no significant groundwater flux over the wetlands, which are part of Machar Marshes. This shows evaporation to be dominant hydrologic process in this zone. Results from all analyses help explain the limited holding capacity of the aquifers in the recharge zone and their vulnerability to anthropogenic impacts and climate variability. There is a trend of decreasing surface flow and rainfall and increasing water soil erosion.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JUL	2017	76	13							466	10.1007/s12665-017-6773-8								WOS:000405283600021						
J	Sheikh, MA; Azad, C; Mukherjee, S; Rina, K				Sheikh, Muzzafar Ahmad; Azad, C.; Mukherjee, S.; Rina, Kumari			An assessment of groundwater salinization in Haryana state in India using hydrochemical tools in association with GIS	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Unplanned abstraction of groundwater due to various land use land cover activities and variations in monsoonal rainfall have greatly affected the availability and quality of groundwater resources in semi-arid regions of India. In the present study, a study of the hydrogeochemical characteristics of groundwater was undertaken in the Sonipat district of Haryana in India together with the use of stable isotope (delta O-18 and delta D) measurements and GIS analysis. A total of 53 groundwater samples were collected from seven blocks of the district, and 14 water quality parameters and stable isotopes (delta O-18 and delta D) were analysed to infer hydrogeochemical processes taking place in the area. The integration of hydrochemistry with GIS is very helpful to understand the factors governing in the area. The majority of the samples showed Na-Cl type of hydrochemical facies. The trilinear plot for major cations and anions in groundwater indicates dominance of sodium, calcium, chloride and bicarbonate ions. Nitrate plumes in the groundwater appear to be migrating in groundwater from the central and south-western parts of the area towards the urbanized areas. A total of 64% of the samples exceed the maximum permissible limit of 1.5 mg/L given by WHO for fluoride. Besides natural sources such as silicate and carbonate weathering, ion exchange, and reverse ion exchange, the leaching of surficial salts and untreated industrial wastes along with unregulated abstraction are contributing to poor groundwater quality in the study area. An assessment of saturation indices has shown that groundwater in the area is unsaturated with respect to anhydrite, halite and gypsum suggesting significant contribution of Ca2+, Mg2+ and other ions in the groundwater. A scatter plot of delta O-18 versus Cl also suggests mixing of saline water with fresh groundwater.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JUL	2017	76	13							465	10.1007/s12665-017-6789-0								WOS:000405283600020						
J	Su, H; Kang, WD; Xu, YJ; Wang, JD				Su, He; Kang, Weidong; Xu, Yuanjun; Wang, Jiading			Evaluation of groundwater quality and health risks from contamination in the north edge of the Loess Plateau, Yulin City, Northwest China	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Groundwater is a vital source for domestic and irrigation purposes in the loess area of Northwest China where climate is arid. However, the quality of groundwater in this area is deteriorating due to intensive industrial and agricultural activities, and this has a great adverse impact on human health. In order to better understand the pollution status of groundwater and the health risks to local residents, comprehensive water quality index was applied to assess the quality of drinking water in Yulin City, Northwest China, and sodium adsorption ratio, sodium percentage, residual sodium carbonate and permeability index were used to evaluate the quality of irrigation water. Moreover, the health risks caused by ingestion of groundwater were evaluated using the model proposed by the Ministry of Environmental Protection of the PR China. The results show that all groundwater samples for irrigation will not induce soil salinization, but more than half of them are not suitable for drinking, and Fe, Mn, TH, Mg2+ and NO3-N are the common contaminants which are mainly from natural processes, industrial and agricultural activities. The health risk assessment indicates that children face greater non-carcinogenic risk than adults. The order of contribution of contaminants to non-carcinogenic risk is NO3- > As > F- > Fe > Mn > Ba2+ > Cr6+ > Zn > NO2-. The average carcinogenic risk of carcinogens (Cr6+ and As) is 1.17 x 10(-4) and 1.37 x 10(-4) for adults and children, respectively, which surpasses the permissible level (1 x 10(-6)) stipulated by the Ministry of Environmental Protection of the PR China. Hence, effective measures are highly demanded to manage groundwater pollution and reduce the risks to human health.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JUL	2017	76	13							467	10.1007/s12665-017-6781-8								WOS:000405283600022

Interrelationship between geochemical elements of sediment and groundwater at Samrak Park Delta of Nakdong River Basin in Korea: multivariate statistical analyses and artificial neural network approaches	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												This research was conducted at Samrak Park Delta of Nakdong River Basin in Busan Metropolitan City, Korea. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the interrelationship of geochemical elements in sediments and groundwater through multivariate statistical analyses and a multilayer perceptron artificial neural network model. The mean concentrations of chemical elements were Si (46%), Fe (16.9%), Al (15.7%), K (7.5%) and Ca (4.5%) in sediments, and Na (8650 mg/L), Mg (999 mg/L), Ca (432 mg/L), K (293 mg/L) and Cl (17,640 mg/L) in groundwater, respectively. The principal component analysis produced 3 kinds of factors with the variances of 63.37, 27.02 and 9.62%, respectively. It is suggested that the chemical components of sediments and groundwater were mainly originated from source rocks and seawater intrusion, with the minor impacts of irrigation and industry. Cluster analysis also showed that chemical elements were mainly controlled by the natural geogenic sources and seawater intrusion. Multilayer perceptron of artificial neural network (ANN) presented the good interrelationship between sediment and groundwater. The determination coefficients (R-2) between ANN predicted values and observed values in groundwater showed the high values of 0.61-0.97 except Mg, Mn and Sr. It is revealed that the chemical components of sediment and groundwater were derived from local geological origin and from the minor impact of anthropogenic sources. Multivariate analyses and ANN contributed to the identification of the mutual relationship between the geochemical elements of sediment and those of groundwater.

However, human activities significantly decreased groundwater quality. In this study, the spatiotemporal variation of groundwater quality was evaluated in an arid area where long-term paper wastewater irrigation has been implemented. For this study, seven wells were regularly monitored for physicochemical parameters over a period of 1 year. Statistical and graphical approaches were applied to interpret the spatiotemporal variation of groundwater quality parameters in the wastewater irrigation zone. Correlation analysis was also carried out to reveal the sources of some major ions. The results indicate that the groundwater type in the study area is dominated by the Cl-Na, followed by the HCO3-Na, the HCO3-Ca center dot Mg, and the SO4 center dot Cl-Ca center dot Mg types. Groundwater in the area is significantly contaminated locally with fluoride, nitrite and ammonia, and the chemical oxygen demand levels were increased in some groundwater monitoring wells. Most contaminants showed an increasing trend from the Yellow River water irrigation zone toward the wastewater irrigation zone. Rock weathering, mineral dissolution, and cation exchange are important processes controlling groundwater quality, but human activities, such as wastewater irrigation, play an undeniable role in affecting groundwater quality in this area. The results of this study contribute to the understanding of the formation and circulation of groundwater under human activities and provide a scientific basis for regional water quality evaluation, water quality improvement, and protection.

A Comparison of Main and Side Channel Physical and Water Quality Metrics and Habitat Complexity in the Middle Mississippi River	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Worldwide large rivers have been severely modified by human intervention. Many modifications result in disconnection of the river from floodplain and off-channel habitats generally characterized by lower velocities and Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. shallower depths relative to the main channel, conditions vital to many organisms. Extensive levees on the Middle Mississippi River (MMR) have cut off backwater systems and disconnected the river from 80% of its floodplain. However, the system is characterized by large side channels associated with islands. We examined a long term data set for differences in physical (e.g. depth and velocity) and water quality metrics (e.g. temperature, suspended solids, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll, % organic matter) between the main and side channels of a 128-km reach of the MMR. We compared variability between main and side channels using the coefficient of variation (COV). All metrics differed between habitats. Side channels were shallower with lower velocities and had greater mean and COV of % organic matter and more variable dissolved oxygen concentrations. Velocity, temperature, and suspended solids were similar in the spring. COVs were lowest in both habitats during the spring for all metrics except temperature and DO. Resource management in the MMR tends to focus on maintaining existing side channels because of the difficulty of working in the heavily used navigation channel. This study shows that these actions protect areas that function differently than the main channel for most of the year. However, our results also highlight the need for restoration activities aimed at restoring floodplain connectivity, especially during the spring.

Effects of Urban Sprawl on Riparian Vegetation: Is Compact or Dispersed Urbanization Better for Biodiversity?	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Compact urbanization is the main strategy for sustainable urban development. However, it is yet unclear whether compact urban forms are ecologically more favourable than dispersed ones. In this paper, we studied the effects of urban sprawl on the riparian vegetation condition in one of the most degraded watersheds in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area, Argentina. We conducted random sampling of the riparian vegetation at sites along streams in the basin and assessed urban indicators at the reach and sub-watershed scales for each of those sites in a geographic information system: urban area, impervious surface, population density and two landscape metrics of dispersion. The indicators assessed explained a high proportion of the variability of the vegetation response variables, thereby confirming the importance of urban sprawl pressure in shaping riparian communities in fluvial ecosystems. Dispersed urbanization had more positive than negative effects on the vegetation in the study area. Riverbanks associated with dispersed urbanization had more plant species, including exotics, when urban sprawl was assessed at the local scale. At the sub-watershed scale, dispersed urbanized areas were richer in native plants and most of the functional groups, and poorer in exotic species. The model of the compact city, including bio-corridors along watercourses, has been proposed for the Buenos Aires conurbation process for the next decades. Our results showed that the quality of existing river corridors across the compact matrix was not desirable and best practices for redesigning a more sustainable landscape structure are necessary, including the restoration of habitats for wetland species.

We used a framework to present the effect of the two fundamental social, political and economic changes on the biodiversity and ecosystems of Hungary from 1989 until recently. First, following the democratic transformation in 1989 social, political, economic and institutional drivers led to the increase in farmland biodiversity, improvement of water quality due to less chemical use and decrease of habitat loss within protected areas. At the same time, land privatisation and uncertain ownership led to habitat degradation, abandonment and fragmentation. These changes were coupled with the spread of alien species and re-ploughing. The second change was joining the European Union in 2004. This resulted in the establishment of the Natura 2000 network, the application of the relevant EU policies, and access to conservation related EU funds, which contributed to successful habitat restorations increasing of some charismatic species' populations. Meanwhile, however, disappearance of extensive farming practices, agricultural intensification and infrastructural developments driven by some increasing EU funds led to a net habitat loss, degradation and decline in biodiversity, with more than half of the species of European importance having unfavourable conservation status. Increased support for conservation institutions, adaptive and extended agri-environment schemes and further research and monitoring to establish, refine and supervise sustainable management practices, including water management, are needed to prevent further biodiversity loss in the coming years.

However, the production of brine, which is known to be a concentrated solution, is an integral part of the operation of the desalination plant, which faces critical environmental challenges because of its high salinity. Therefore, a cost-effective and environmentally benign brine management system is required prior to its proper disposal. Currently, several disposal options including surface water discharge, deep well injection, and evaporation ponds have been used. However, these processes are unsustainable and their use is limited by a high capital cost and limited applications. Various conventional treatments including physicochemical, oxidation and biological processes with varying extents of organics removal have been reported. Nowadays, membrane-based technologies appear to be cost-effective methods for managing brine concentrate as they can recover valuable resources and produce clean water with high recovery. This paper critically reviews current technologies for concentrate management, including disposal practices and treatment processes. The characteristics of the brine in terms of water quality and its impact on open water bodies are discussed. This paper examines emerging membrane processes such as forward osmosis, membrane distillation, and electrodialysis that show promise for minimizing brine volume, in recovering valuable resources and improvement of water recovery. This paper also discusses the fact that integrated membrane processes are better for brine management for resource recovery together with water purification in wastewater treatment facilities and can achieve a zero liquid discharge.																	2053-1400	2053-1419				JUL 1	2017	3	4					625	658		10.1039/c6ew00339g								WOS:000404718800004

Emerging investigators series: hydrogen sulfide production in municipal stormwater retention ponds under ice covered conditions: a study of water quality and SRB populations	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY												Stormwater retention ponds have become an integral component of stormwater management across the world. Under prolonged hypoxia, these ponds are capable of releasing large quantities of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas. In this study, water quality constituents and bacterial communities in sediment were analyzed in two stormwater retention ponds, RSP1 (reference pond) and RSP2 (problematic pond) over a period of two years, to identify the factors driving H2S production and understand the microbial community associated with H2S production in stormwater ponds. It was found that the background total sulfide concentrations were not statistically different between the two ponds during summer (RSP2: 0.012 +/- 0.001 mg L-S-1; RSP1: 0.010 +/- 0.001 mg L-S-1) and were statistically different during ice covered winter operation (RSP2: 6.375 +/- 1.135 mg L-S-1; RSP1: 0.016 +/- 0.009 mg L-S-1). The study showed a lack of correlation between total sulfide concentrations in RSP2 and soluble chemical oxygen demand, sulfate, soluble total phosphorus, total ammonia nitrogen, nitrate, nitrite and pH. However, DO concentrations demonstrated a strong negative correlation with total sulfides concentrations in RSP2 (p < 0.006, r = -0.58, n = 26), which confirmed DO as the critical water quality parameter linked to H2S production in stormwater ponds. Finally, it was found that seasonal change, ice covered versus non-ice covered operation and a comparison between a H2S emitting pond and non-emitting pond all did not promote a measurable proliferation of sulfatereducing bacteria nor a community shift in the sulfate-reducing bacterial population. Hence, the study demonstrates that sulfide production is a result of increased ubiquitous SRB activity in stormwater retention ponds and the emission of H2S gas is not indicative of SRB proliferation or a population shift towards specific SRB taxa.

Improved contaminant removal in vegetated stormwater biofilters amended with biochar	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY												The potential for carbonaceous sorbents to improve contaminant removal (particularly for trace organic contaminants, TOrCs) in stormwater biofilters was evaluated in intermittently dosed, vegetated columns simulating scaled-down treatment systems. Columns amended with biochar or granular activated carbon (GAC) were evaluated relative to performance benchmarks set by columns representing unamended treatment systems (i.e., sand filters and vegetated biofilters). Biochar amendment (6.7 wt%, 33 vol%) strongly improved TOrC removal, despite potential fouling due to the presence of an upper compost-amended layer. Biochar-amended biofilter columns maintained greater than 99% TOrC removal throughout five months of dosing with TOrC-spiked creek water (equivalent to approximately 1.3 years of runoff volume), relative to less than 50% removal of most TOrCs by unamended biofilter columns. GAC amendment (6.7 wt%, 12.5 vol%) also improved TOrC removal, though less effectively than biochar (>70% removal), because the bio-char's lower density (i.e., higher volume composition) and smaller particles improved performance. These results indicate that full-scale biochar-amended biofilters could potentially remove TOrCs effectively for several years, as treatment depths up to five times greater than the 10 cm experimental depth may be feasible for full-scale systems. Further, contaminant removal survey experiments conducted after 6 months of operation revealed that biochar amendment improved removal of total organic carbon, total nitrogen, nitrate, and total dissolved phosphorus in biofilters by greater than 60%. The findings of this study demonstrate the potential of biochar amendment to broadly improve contaminant removal in biofilters, motivating and informing the application of full-scale biochar-amended biofilters for improved water quality.																	2053-1400	2053-1419				JUL 1	2017	3	4					726	734		10.1039/c7ew00070g								WOS:000404718800011

A global, spatially-explicit assessment of irrigated croplands influenced by urban wastewater flows	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												When urban areas expand without concomitant increases in wastewater treatment capacity, vast quantities of wastewater are released to surface waters with little or no treatment. Downstream of many urban areas are large areas of irrigated croplands reliant on these same surface water sources. Case studies document the widespread use of untreated wastewater in irrigated agriculture, but due to the practical and political challenges of conducting a true census of this practice, its global extent is not well known except where reuse has been planned. This study used GIS-based modeling methods to develop the first spatially-explicit estimate of the global extent of irrigated croplands influenced by urban wastewater flows, including indirect wastewater use. These croplands were further classified by their likelihood of using poor quality water based on the spatial proximity of croplands to urban areas, urban wastewater return flow ratios, and proportion of wastewater treated. This study found that 65% (35.9 Mha) of downstream irrigated croplands were located in catchments with high levels of dependence on urban wastewater flows. These same catchments were home to 1.37 billion urban residents. Of these croplands, 29.3 Mha were located in countries with low levels of wastewater treatment and home to 885 million urban residents. These figures provide insight into the key role that water reuse plays in meeting the water and food needs of people around the world, and the need to invest in wastewater treatment to protect public health.																	1748-9326					JUL	2017	12	7							074008	10.1088/1748-326/aa75d1								WOS:000404943700001						
J	Kim, H; Kim, S				Kim, Hyunjun; Kim, Sanghyun			Evaluation of chlorine decay models under transient conditions in a water distribution system	JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS												Residual chlorine concentration decreases along distribution networks because of factors such as water quality, physical properties of the pipeline, and hydraulic conditions. Hydraulic conditions are primarily governed by transient events generated by valve modulation or pumping action. We investigate the impact of transient events on the rate of chlorine decay under various flow conditions. To comprehensively compare the performance of existing chlorine models, 14 candidate models for chlorine concentration were used under various transient conditions. Two-dimensional (2D) transient flow analysis was conducted to investigate the unknown processes of chlorine decay under transient conditions. General formulations for modeling chlorine decay were used to comprehensively study the decay under unsteady conditions and to effectively incorporate the impact of transients into generic model structures. The chlorine decay patterns in the constructed water distribution system were analyzed in the context of transient events. Linear relationships between the model parameters and the frequency of transient events were determined under unsteady conditions, and the impact of turbulence intensity was successfully incorporated into model parameter evaluations. The modeling results from 2D transient analysis exhibit similar predictability as those obtained from calibration using the genetic algorithm.																	1464-7141	1465-1734				JUL	2017	19	4					522	537		10.2166/hydro.2017.082								WOS:000404905000003

Previous studies have developed many numeric modeling methods and data driven approaches for water quality assessment. The cluster analysis, an approach widely used for grouping data, has also been employed. However, there are complex correlations between water quality variables, which play important roles in water quality assessment but have always been overlooked. In this paper, we analyze correlations between water quality variables and propose an alternative method for water quality assessment with hierarchical cluster analysis based on Mahalanobis distance. Further, we cluster water quality data collected form coastal water of Bohai Sea and North Yellow Sea of China, and apply clustering results to evaluate its water quality. To evaluate the validity, we also cluster the water quality data with cluster analysis based on Euclidean distance, which are widely adopted by previous studies. The results show that our method is more suitable for water quality assessment with many correlated water quality variables. To our knowledge, it is the first attempt to apply Mahalanobis distance for coastal water quality assessment.

J	Hayat, E; Baba, A				Hayat, Ehsanullah; Baba, Alper			Quality of groundwater resources in Afghanistan	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Water is the main source of energy production and economy in Afghanistan where agriculture accounts for more than 50% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP). Access to safe drinking water is still a problem in the country, which has caused different health issues and even child mortality especially in rural areas. Groundwater is the main source of drinking water in the country. However, little knowledge is available about the quality of groundwater throughout the entire country, and its quality has not been investigated extensively yet like in other countries in the world. While most people think that consuming groundwater is a reliable and safe source of drinking water for health, the United Nations (UN) agencies report various kinds of waterborne diseases and even child mortalities due to drinking water quality in the country. In this article, significant geogenic and anthropogenic factors that play a vital role in groundwater contamination of the country are identified and explained. Different geogenic contaminations such as arsenic, fluoride, sulfate, and boron occur in several areas of Afghanistan that have a direct effect on human health. The water quality mapping for Afghanistan is completed for half of the country, which shows that groundwater is plagued by high levels of fluoride and arsenic in some areas. The water quality mapping of the other half of the country cannot be completed due to security concerns currently. Also, there are different kinds of waterborne diseases such as diarrhea, cholera, and dysentery that can be seen in different parts of the country because of anthropogenic activities which continuously deteriorate groundwater.

Discharge permit market and farm management nexus: an approach for eutrophication control in small basins with low-income farmers	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The economic concerns of low-income farmers are barriers to nutrient abatement policies for eutrophication control in surface waters. This study brings up a perspective that focuses on integrating multiple-pollutant discharge permit markets with farm management practices. This aims to identify a more economically motivated waste load allocation (WLA) for non-point sources (NPS). For this purpose, we chose the small basin of Zrebar Lake in western Iran and used the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) for modeling. The export coefficients (ECs), effectiveness of best management practices (BMPs), and crop yields were calculated by using this software. These variables show that low-income farmers can hardly afford to invest in BMPs in a typical WLA. Conversely, a discharge permit market presents a more cost-effective solution. This method saves 64% in total abatement costs and motivates farmers by offering economic benefits. A market analysis revealed that nitrogen permits mostly cover the trades with the optimal price ranging from $6 to $30 per kilogram. However, phosphorous permits are limited for trading, and their price exceeds $60 per kilogram. This approach also emphasizes the establishment of a regional institution for market monitoring, dynamic pricing, fair fund reallocation, giving information to participants, and ensuring their income. By these sets of strategies, a WLA on the brink of failure can turn into a cost-effective and sustainable policy for eutrophication control in small basins.

J	Liu, A; Carroll, S; Dawes, L; Goonetilleke, A				Liu, An; Carroll, Steven; Dawes, Les; Goonetilleke, Ashantha			Monitoring of a mixed land use catchment for pollutant source characterisation	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Protection of surface water quality is a key driver in catchment management, particularly for areas undergoing land use change. Changing land use can result in the input of a range of pollutants to surface waters, resulting in water quality impairment, leading to eutrophication and the appearance of algae blooms. This study investigated a mixed land use coastal catchment by undertaking extensive field sampling and data analysis for pollutant source characterisation. The objective was to contribute to a greater understanding of pollutant inputs to surface water resources and for effective catchment management. Based on data analysis results, a diversity of pollutant sources was noted, including both natural areas and areas subject to anthropogenic activities such as agriculture and urban developments, with agricultural areas being comparatively more significant in exporting nutrients. Additionally, pollutant inputs into estuarine and freshwater areas were found to have specific characteristics influenced by land use. The pollutant inputs from these sources were found to be significantly affected by seasonal factors, with the dominant pollutant sources differing between the wet and dry seasons. This underlines the importance of taking seasonal factors into account in the development of effective catchment management strategies. Based on the study outcomes, a critical point monitoring program was developed with a focus on preventing algae blooms. This will allow the development of a decentralised catchment management strategy where resource-efficient monitoring of critical pollutant parameters at key locations can be undertaken for minimising the risk from algae blooms, rather than implementing a whole of catchment and resource-demanding large-scale monitoring program.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				JUL	2017	189	7							336	10.1007/s10661-017-6047-7								WOS:000404652900033	28612335

Monitoring data were collected from sites approximately 35 m upstream and downstream of dams and reference sites located approximately 5 km upstream of all dams. Results indicate that oxygen levels, macroinvertebrate diversity, and proportion of sensitive taxa were significantly lower upstream and downstream of dams in comparison with upstream reference reaches. The strong correlation between water quality and macroinvertebrates in this system implies that removal of the lower three dams would lead to improvements in water quality, biotic integrity, and resilience in lower Bushkill Creek. Sediment analyses and toxicity assays suggest that dam removal and sediment mobilization may route contaminated sediments downstream at concentrations that may harm more sensitive biota. However, macroinvertebrate mortality and behavior were not significantly different from clean water controls for the large majority of toxicity assays. All together, these results suggest that dams 1-3 are good candidates for successful stream restoration but that the removals would best be planned in a way that mitigates potential impacts of contaminated legacy sediment.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				JUL	2017	189	7							344	10.1007/s10661-017-6060-x								WOS:000404652900041	28634867

Resulting data set is statistically analyzed to discriminate between the natural or anthropic origin of the elements. Analyses indicate that in all cases, the main source of most major and trace elements is geological weathering, being thus individual bedrock composition the main driver of differences between lakes. Several anthropogenic sources of airborne Cu, Sc, Co, and Cr must be also considered. The shallowness of the lake is also a factor that may influence element cycling and concentration levels in its water mass. Concentrations of anthropogenic elements were low, comparable to those reported in other glacial lakes, way below the WHO, US EPA, EC, and Spanish legal limits for drinking water quality, indicating the absence of serious pollution. Toxic heavy metals Cd, Pb, Hg, and Zn were not detected in any of the tarns.

S.; Doledec, Sylvain; Feio, Maria Joao			Chironomidae traits and life history strategies as indicators of anthropogenic disturbance	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												In freshwater ecosystems, Chironomidae are currently considered indicators of poor water quality because the family is often abundant in degraded sites. However, it incorporates taxa with a large ecological and physiological diversity and different sensitivity to impairment. Yet, the usual identification of Chironomidae at coarse taxonomic levels (family or subfamily) masks genus and species sensitivities. In this study, we investigate the potential of taxonomic and functional (traits) composition of Chironomidae to detect anthropogenic disturbance. In this context, we tested some a priori hypotheses regarding the ability of Chironomidae taxonomic and trait compositions to discriminate Mediterranean streams affected by multiple stressors from least-disturbed streams. Both taxonomic and Eltonian trait composition discriminated sites according to their disturbance level. Disturbance resulted in the predicted increase of Chironomidae with higher number of stages with hibernation/diapause and of taxa with resistance forms and unpredicted increase of the proportion of taxa with longer life cycles and few generations per year. Life history strategies (LHS), corresponding to multivoltine Chironomidae that do not invest in hemoglobin and lack strong spring synchronization, were well adapted to all our Mediterranean sites with highly changeable environmental conditions. Medium-size animals favored in disturbed sites where the Mediterranean hydrological regime is altered, but the reduced number of larger-size/carnivore Chironomids suggests a limitation to secondary production. Results indicate that Chironomidae genus and respective traits could be a useful tool in the structural and functional assessment of Mediterranean streams. The ubiquitous nature of Chironomidae should be also especially relevant in the assessment of water bodies naturally poor in other groups such as the Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera, such as the lowland rivers with sandy substrates, lakes, or reservoirs.

In this research, a novel risk-based framework is developed and implemented in a distribution network spanning over 64 km(2) for supplying water to the city of Al-Khobar (Saudi Arabia) through 473-km-long water mains. The framework integrates the planning of linear assets (i.e., pipes) and placement of booster stations to optimize residual chlorine in the WDS. Failure mode and effect analysis are integrated with the fuzzy set theory to perform risk analysis. A vulnerability regarding the probability of failure of pipes is estimated from historical records of water main breaks. The consequence regarding residual chlorine availability has been associated with the exposed population depending on the land use characteristics (i.e., defined through zoning). EPANET simulations have been conducted to predict residual chlorine at each node of the network. A water quality index is used to assess the effectiveness of chlorine practice. Scenario analysis is also performed to evaluate the impact of changing locations and number of booster stations, and rehabilitation and/or replacement of vulnerable water mains. The results revealed that the proposed methodology could facilitate the utility managers to optimize residual chlorine effectively in large WDS.

The basic principle in photometric measurements is the incident light at a given wavelength that is either reflected, scattered, or transmitted in the body of water. Here, we discuss the transmittance measurements. The amount of transmittance is inversely proportional to the concentration of the substance measured. However, the transmittance is subject to interference, because it can be affected by factors other than the substance targeted in the water. In this study, interference with the UV/Vis sensor nitrate plus nitrite measurements caused by organic carbon was evaluated. Total or dissolved organic carbon as well as nitrate plus nitrite concentrations were measured in various boreal waters with two UV/Vis sensors (5-mm and 35-mm pathlengths), using conventional laboratory analysis results as references. Organic carbon increased the sensor nitrate plus nitrite results, not only in waters with high organic carbon concentrations, but also at the lower concentrations (<10 mg C L-1) typical of boreal stream, river, and lake waters. Our results demonstrated that local calibration with multiple linear regression, including both nitrate plus nitrite and dissolved organic carbon, can correct the error caused by organic carbon. However, high-frequency optical sensors continue to be excellent tools for environmental monitoring when they are properly calibrated for the local water matrix.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				JUL	2017	189	7							357	10.1007/s10661-017-6056-6								WOS:000404652900054	28656558

In addition, quality parameters such as temperature, pH, and total alkalinity (TA) in 44 swimming pools located in the city center and districts of Canakkale, Turkey, were examined in the summer period. While FC and RC amounts were analyzed using tablet tests with N-N-diethyl phenylenediamine (DPD 1) and potassium iodine (DPD 3) using the colorimetric method in the comparator, TA and CyA levels were measured with a photometric method. Temperature and pH were measured using YSI 556 MPS. Levels of CyA, FC, RC, pH, temperature, and TA varied between 0.00 and 725.0 mg L-1 (108.0 +/- 111.4 mg L-1), 0.00 and 5.00 mg L-1 (1.60 +/- 0.962 mg L-1), 0 and 0.55 mg L-1 (0.087 +/- 0.059), 6.40 and 8.20 mg L-1 (7.30 +/- 0.038 mg L-1), 22.0 and 32.0 degrees C (27.6 +/- 1.45 degrees C), and 0.00 and 391.0 mg L-1 129.3 +/- 89.0), respectively. The findings were compared to standard limit values of the Ministry of Health of the Turkish Republic and other countries. Not only maximum concentrations of CyA but also the average concentrations exceeded the standard limit values of different countries in July and August with high tourism activity in Turkey. Although there is no problem in view of average values of other quality parameters, there are some problems in view of the maximum values in pool waters compared to standard limit values.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				JUL	2017	189	7							338	10.1007/s10661-017-6031-2								WOS:000404652900035	28620710

Brady			Evaluating expected outcomes of acid remediation in an intensively mined Appalachian watershed	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Assessments of watershed-based restoration efforts are rare but are essential for the science of stream restoration to advance. We conducted a watershed scale assessment of Abram Creek before and after implementation of a watershed-based plan designed to maximize ecological recovery from acid mine drainage (AMD) impairment. We surveyed water chemistry, physical habitat, benthic macroinvertebrates, and fish community structure in three stream types: AMD-impacted(14 streams), AMD-treated (13 streams), and unimpaired reference (4 streams). We used in-stream measurements to quantify ecological loss from AMD, the amount of ecological recovery expected through remediation, and the observed degree of post-treatment recovery. Sites impaired by AMD improved in water quality with AMD treatment. Dissolved metals and acidity declined significantly in treated streams, but sulfate and specific conductance did not. Likewise, sites impaired by AMD improved in bio-condition scores with AMD treatment. EPT genera increased significantly but were lower compared to unimpaired streams. We found fish at nine treated sites that had none before treatment. Community-level analyses indicated improved but altered assemblages with AMD treatment. Analysis of pretreatment conditions indicated that only 30% of the historic fishery remained. Remediation was expected to recover 66% of the historic fishery value, and assessment of posttreatment conditions indicates that 52% of the historic fishery has been recovered after 3 years. Developing expected endpoints for restoration outcomes provides a tool to objectively evaluate successes and can guide adaptive management strategies.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				JUL	2017	189	7							339	10.1007/s10661-017-6036-x								WOS:000404652900036	28620711

Soil temperature responses to climate change along a gradient of upland-riparian transect in boreal forest	CLIMATIC CHANGE												There is growing evidence of climate change impacts on northern ecosystems. While most climate change studies base their assessments on air temperature, spatial variation of soil temperature responses have not been fully examined as a metric of climate change. Here we examined spatial variations of soil temperature responses to an ensemble of regional climate model (RCM) projections at multiple depths in upland and riparian zones in the Swedish boreal forest. Modeling showed a stronger influence of air temperature on riparian soil temperature than was simulated for upland soils. The RCM ensemble projected a warming range of 4.7-6.0 degrees C in riparian and 4.3-5.7 degrees C in upland soils. However, soils were slightly colder in the riparian zone during winter. While the historical record showed that upland soils are about 0.4 degrees C warmer than the riparian soils, this may be reversed in the future as model projections showed that on an annual basis, riparian soils might be slightly warmer by 0.2 to 0.4 degrees C than upland soils. However, upland soils could warm up earlier (April) compared to riparian soils (May).

VARIATION IN MALATHION SENSITIVITY AMONG POPULATIONS OF BLANCHARD'S CRICKET FROGS (ACRIS BLANCHARDI) AND IMPLICATIONS FOR RISK ASSESSMENT	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Intraspecific variability in contaminant sensitivity could undermine risk assessments for nontarget organisms such as amphibians. To test how amphibian populations vary in tolerance to anticipated lethal and sublethal exposures to a pesticide, we exposed Blanchard's cricket frogs (Acris blanchardi) from 3 populations across a broad portion of their range to the insecticide malathion. Exposure in mesocosms to a nominal concentration of 1 mg/L (measured concentrations at 1 h and 24 h postaddition of 0.160 mg/L and 0.062 mg/L, respectively), a realistic direct-overspray scenario, reduced survival to metamorphosis by 43% relative to controls and revealed variation in tolerance among populations. Survival ranged from 74% for the most tolerant population to 18% for the least tolerant population, a 4.1-fold difference. Mass at metamorphosis and time to metamorphosis were unaffected. Although malathion reduced zooplankton abundance, it did not alter food resources (periphyton or phytoplankton relative abundance), or a suite of water-quality variables (pH, temperature, and dissolved oxygen). A 96-h time-to-death assay designed to isolate direct, lethal effects also revealed variation in tolerance among populations. Time to death (mean +/- standard error) ranged from 2.4 +/- 0.18 h for the least tolerant population to 17.8 +/- 4.72 h for the most tolerant population, a 7.4-fold difference. However, relative sensitivities of populations differed in the mesocosm and laboratory studies, which differed in exposure concentrations, suggesting that populations tolerant of high concentrations can be more sensitive to lower concentrations. We suggest that direct overspray could reduce larval survival in the field for this species. Studies assessing the role of contaminants in declines or extrapolating to untested populations, especially across large geographical regions, should quantify the range of intraspecific variation. Risk assessors could address intraspecific variability directly by using an intraspecific uncertainty factor.

Approaches for evaluating subsurface phosphorus loss potential from soil profiles	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												The importance of subsurface phosphorus (P) transport in deterioration of surface water quality is well documented. Practices and treatments have been identified and modeling approaches have been implemented to decrease the subsurface P load to surface waters. Soil phosphorus storage capacity (SPSC) is a site-assessment tool that predicts the potential for P loss from soils. We examined the use of SPSC to assess soil profile P distributions and loss potentials for two contrasting soil types: manure-impacted Spodosols and Ultisols. Our specific objectives were to (i) validate prediction of the Langmuir P bonding strength, K-L, the Freundlich adsorption coefficient, K-F, or the linear adsorption coefficient, K-D of Spodosols (Ap, E and Bh horizons) and Ultisols (Ap, E and Bt horizons) using SPSC-based equations developed for surface and sub-surface horizons (Ap, E and Bt) of Ultisols and (ii) identify factors affecting retention and release of P. Results showed that SPSC derived from oxalate-extractions data can effectively predict P isotherm parameters used in P transport models. The SPSC also captured differences between soil horizons within a profile pertinent to P loss. Magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) concentrations related to negative SPSC, likely due to the presence of these components in dairy manure. The initial sorbed P in the solid phase (So) of both soil types was related to soil components such as Mg, Ca and total P when SPSC was positive. The equations developed from A, E and Bt horizons of Ultisol relating isotherm parameters to the PSR and SPSC made successful predictions for all horizons of Ultisols sampled from locations different from those in the current study and Spodosols suggesting that such equations might be applicable across a wide range of soils.																	0167-8809	1873-2305				JUL 1	2017	245						92	99		10.1016/j.agee.2017.05.006								WOS:000403988600010

However, relatively little research has been conducted on managing P in rice (Oryza sativa L.) production systems, where fanning practices differ from those of upland cropping systems due to water ponding on the soil surface (field ponding water; FPW). Because FPW is a direct source of surface runoff, identifying the main source of P and the critical period of high P concentrations in the FPW provide important insights to mitigating P runoff losses. In this study, field monitoring and laboratory incubation experiments were combined to evaluate how soil P content and conventional P fertilizer application affected FPW P concentrations in rice-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rotation systems of five Chinese rice producing regions. All soils had Olsen-P concentrations (10.1-20.5 mg kg(-1)) well below the critical levels (30-172 mg kg(-1)) for promoted risks of P loss. However, conventional P application rate significantly elevated FPW P concentrations compared to no P application, and P fertilizer contributed 47-92% of total P (TP) and 59-97% of total dissolved P (TDP) in the FPW. Temporarily, both TP and TDP concentrations peaked one day after P application (0.15-8.90 mg TP L-1 and 0.16-4.49 mg TDP L-1), then decreased rapidly and stabilized five days later. We conclude that fertilizer is the major source of P loss in Chinese rice production systems, and that P fertilizer rate should be optimized to reduce P concentrations in the effluent water in the first week following P application.

Mansoor			Influence of sludge characteristics on coagulant recovery from water treatment sludge: a preliminary study	JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CYCLES AND WASTE MANAGEMENT												This study investigated the effect of raw water quality and coagulant type and dosage on the efficiency of aluminium recovery from water treatment sludge by acidification process. One of the features of this study is to prioritise several factors affecting aluminium recovery using demonstrating experiments and analysing the result using model. The previous studies comparing the aluminium recovery from PACl and alum sludge had collected the sludge from treatment plants treating different source water. However, this study compares aluminium recovery from PACl and alum sludge obtained from treating same source water. Water treatment sludge was prepared in laboratory by coagulating raw water with different inorganic and organic contents using aluminium sulphate (alum) and polyaluminium chloride (PACl) as coagulants. The effect of the different factors on the aluminium recovery efficiency was evaluated using a 2(3) full factorial experimental design. The aluminium recovery efficiency was higher for PACl sludge compared to alum sludge with recovery ranging from 62.5 to 74.5 % for alum sludge and from 70.7 to 84.0 % for PACl sludge. At higher concentrations of organic matter and turbidity in the raw water, lower aluminium recovery efficiency was observed for both the sludges. The study thus shows the important effects of raw water quality and coagulant type and dose on the recovery process.

Chemical, biological, and DNA markers for tracing slaughterhouse effluent	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Agricultural practices, if not managed correctly, can have a negative impact on receiving environments via waste disposal and discharge. In this study, a chicken slaughter facility on the rural outskirts of Sydney, Australia, has been identified as a possible source of persistent effluent discharge into a peri-urban catchment. Questions surrounding the facility's environmental management practices go back more than four decades. Despite there having never been a definitive determination of the facility's impact on local stream water quality, the New South Wales Environment Protection Authority (NSW EPA) has implemented numerous pollution reduction requirements to manage noise and water pollution at the slaughter facility. However, assessment of compliance remains complicated by potential additional sources of pollution in the catchment. To unravel this long-standing conundrum related to water pollution we apply a forensic, multiple lines of evidence approach to delineate the origin of the likely pollution source(s). Water samples collected between 2014 and 2016 from irrigation pipes and a watercourse exiting the slaughter facility had elevated concentrations of ammonia (max: 63,000 mu g/L), nitrogen (max: 67,000 mu g/L) and phosphorus (max: 39,000 mu g/L), which were significantly higher than samples from adjacent streams that did not receive direct runoff from the facility. Arsenic, sometimes utilised in growth promoting compounds, was detected in water discharging from the facility up to 4 times (max 3.84 mu g/L) local background values (< 0.5 mu g/L), with inorganic As(Sigma V+III) being the dominant species. The spatial association of elevated water pollution to the facility could not unequivocally distinguish a source and consequently DNA analysis of a suspected pollution discharge event was undertaken. Analysis of catchment runoff from several local streams showed that only water sampled at the downstream boundary of the facility tested positive for chicken DNA, with traces of duck DNA being absent, which was a potential confounder given that wild ducks are present in the area. Further, PCR analysis showed that only the discharge water emanating from the slaughter facility tested positive for a generalized marker of anthropogenic pollution, the clinical class 1 integron-integrase gene. The environmental data collected over a three-year period demonstrates that the slaughter facility is indisputably the primary source of water-borne pollution in the catchment. Moreover, application of DNA and PCR for confirming pollution sources demonstrates its potential for application by regulators in fingerprinting pollution sources.

The concentrations of Fe, Mn, Cu, Pb, Zn, Ni, As, Se, Al, Cd and Cr were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry for the assessment of spatio-temporal variations, source apportionment and heavy metal pollution indexing. The results demonstrated that concentrations of the metals showed significant seasonality and most variables exhibited higher levels in the pre-monsoon season. The principle component analysis for ionic source identification was synthesized into three factors with eigen values cut off at greater than unity and explained about 64.8% of the total variance. The extracted factors seemed to be associated to the geogenic, extensive mining and allied transportation sources of the elements. The heavy metal pollution index (HPI) of the mine water calculated for the individual locations varied from 7.1 to 49.5. Most of the locations fall under low to medium classes of HPI except few locations which are under the influence of surface mining and associated transportation.

Productivity variables (chlorophyll a, gross primary productivity, biogenic silica and autotrophic index) and heterotrophy (respiration, substrate induced respiration, biological oxygen demand and fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis) showed positive relationships with these inputs. Alkaline phosphatase (AP), however, showed an opposite trend. Because AP is negatively influenced by available P, and eutrophy generates a feedback on P fertilization, the study implies that the alkaline phosphatase can be used as a high quality criterion for assessing river health.																	0007-4861	1432-0800				JUL	2017	99	1					75	82		10.1007/s00128-017-2108-4								WOS:000403502200012	28516255

Persistent toxic pollutants representing three classes: organochlorinated pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), were studied in grab water samples, in passive samplers/SemiPermeable Membrane Devices (SPMDs) and in fish tissues collected along the Strymonas River, northern Greece at three sampling campaigns during the year 2013. Almost all the target compounds were detected in the study river of Strymonas, northern Greece at the periods of high rainfall intensity and/or low flow-rate. The most frequently detected compounds were 1,2-benzanthracene, benzo(a)pyrene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, endosulfan I, endosulfan II, endosulfan sulfate, endrin aldehyde, fluorene, methoxychlor, polychlorinated biphenyl PCB 28, PCB 180 and pyrene. The family of DDT compounds and aldrin were also occasionally detected. Agricultural run-off and waste effluents are the main sources of hydrophobic organic compounds in the river basin. The use of SPMDs allowed the detection of more micropollutants than active sampling (31 vs. 16, respectively). Results showed relatively low risk however the potential risk associated with micropollutants such as 1,2-benzanthracene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, p,p-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD), endosulfan II, methoxychlor, PCB 180 and pyrene should not be neglected. Performing risk assessment based on passive sampling, more information was obtained about temporal and spatial variation.

Impact of ammonium nitrate and sodium nitrate on tadpoles of Alytes obstetricans	ECOTOXICOLOGY												The presence of pesticides, herbicides and fertilisers negatively affect aquatic communities in general, and particularly amphibians in their larval phase, even though sensitivity to pollutants is highly variable among species. The Llobregat Delta (Barcelona, Spain) has experienced a decline of amphibian populations, possibly related to the reduction in water quality due to the high levels of farming activity, but also to habitat loss and alteration. We studied the effects of increasing ammonium nitrate and sodium nitrate levels on the survival and growth rate of Alytes obstetricans tadpoles under experimental conditions. We exposed larvae to increasing concentrations of nitrate and ammonium for 14 days and then exposed them to water without pollutants for a further 14 days. Only the higher concentrations of ammonium (> 33.75 mg/L) caused larval mortality. The growth rate of larvae was reduced at a22.5 mg/L NH4 (+), although individuals recovered and even increased their growth rate once exposure to the pollutant ended. The effect of nitrate on growth rate was detected at a80 mg/L concentrations, and the growth rate reduction in tadpoles was even observed during the post-exposure phase. The concentrations of ammonium with adverse effects on larvae are within the range levels found in the study area, while the nitrate concentrations with some adverse effect are close to the upper range limit of current concentrations in the study area. Therefore, only the presence of ammonium in the study area is likely to be considered of concern for the population of this species, even though the presence of nitrate could cause some sublethal effects. These negative effects could have an impact on population dynamics, which in this species is highly sensitive to larval mortality due to its small clutch size and prolonged larval period compared to other anuran amphibians.																	0963-9292	1573-3017				JUL	2017	26	5					667	674		10.1007/s10646-017-1799-y								WOS:000403461400009	28409413

A model library for simulation and benchmarking of integrated urban wastewater systems	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												This paper presents a freely distributed, open-source toolbox to predict the behaviour of urban wastewater systems (UWS). The proposed library is used to develop a system-wide Benchmark Simulation Model (BSM-UWS) for evaluating (local/global) control strategies in urban wastewater systems (UWS). The set of models describe the dynamics of flow rates and major pollutants (COD, TSS, N and P) within the catchment (CT), sewer network (SN), wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and river water system (RW) for a hypothetical, though realistic, UWS. Evaluation criteria are developed to allow for direct assessment of the river water quality instead of the traditional emission based metrics (for sewer overflows and WWTP discharge). Three case studies are included to illustrate the applicability of the proposed toolbox and also demonstrate the potential benefits of implementing integrated control in the BSM-UWS platform. Simulation results show that the integrated control strategy developed to maximize the utilization of the WWTP's capacity represents a balanced choice in comparison to other options. It also improves the river water quality criteria for unionized ammonia and dissolved oxygen by 62% and 6%, respectively. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Pilot scale experiments were performed in a distribution system simulator by injecting arsenic and measuring both adsorption onto iron pipe material and the oxidation of arsenite by hypochlorite in tap water to form arsenate. A mathematical model describing these processes was developed and simulated using EPANET-MSX, a hydraulic and multi-species water quality software for pipe networks. Model parameters were derived from the pilot-scale experiments. The model was applied to both the distribution system simulator and EPANET example network #3, a real-world model of a drinking water system serving approximately 78,000 customers. The model can be applied to systems-level studies of arsenic fate and transport in drinking water resulting from natural occurrences, accidental spills, or intentional introduction into water.

This study assessed the suitability of marginal lands in Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB) for three promising biofeedstocic crops, switchgrass, Miscanthus and hybrid poplar. The land suitability was categorized into 5 suitability classes (not-, poorly-, moderately-, good-and highly-suitable) based on a fuzzy logic based land suitability evaluation procedure. The results showed that 60% of marginal lands in UMRB were moderately to highly suitable for growth of the targeted biofeedstock crops. Predicted bioethanol production from marginal land in the UMRB with consideration of suitability level was two thirds of the production predicted without consideration of suitability level. Our results better constrain the potential of marginal land for biofuel production as well as the importance of land suitability evaluation for policy analysis targeting biofuel development on marginal lands.

Phosphate Removal from Agricultural Drainage Water Using an Iron Oxyhydroxide Filter Material	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Phosphate discharged in agricultural drainage causes water quality degradation on local, regional, and national scales. Iron oxyhydroxide filter materials can potentially remove the soluble phosphate present in drainage waters. Laboratory saturated column experiments and preliminary small-scale field tests were carried out to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of a synthetic goethite iron oxyhydroxide (alpha-FeOOH) filter material for phosphate treatment. Original iron oxyhydroxide filter material (SG-IOH-O) and the same filter material regenerated with sodium hydroxide (SGIOH- R) were assessed. Results of replicated laboratory experiments showed that columns packed with SGIOH- O or SG-IOH-R almost totally removed phosphate (>98%) from drainage waters spiked with an additional 1 or 10 ppm phosphate-P (PO4-P). The column experiments with SG-IOH-O or SG-IOH-R additionally indicated that contact times of only 10 to 15 s were sufficient for near complete removal of phosphate from drainage water spiked with 1 ppm PO4-P. In an initial small-scale filter treatment system field test with SG-IOH-O, percent phosphate removal averaged 89% in the first 200 days, which then decreased to an average 40% phosphate removal in the last 80 days. Following this initial field test, two field tests, one with SG-IOH-O and the other with SG-IOH-R, were conducted concurrently over a period of 193 days, with the SG-IOH-O system phosphate removal averaging 75%, while the SG-IOHR system phosphate removal averaged 34%. This study's findings support possible goethite iron oxyhydroxide filter material use for drainage water phosphate treatment; however, larger-scale field investigations are needed, particularly with modified regeneration procedures.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				JUL	2017	228	7							240	10.1007/s11270-017-3410-9								WOS:000403574400008

Pipeline segments were separated by waterbars which served as drainage features. Six segments were northwest-facing, and six were southeast-facing. Three segments on each aspect were seeded with warm season native herbaceous species at rates used by the Forest Service (1x). All remaining segments received seeding at three times that rate (3x). Forest Service-established rates of fertilizer, lime, and straw mulch were applied to all segments. Sediment concentrations and yields generally were highest at the start of the study, respectively, averaging approximately 1660 mg L-1 and 340 kg ha(-1) during the first 3 months following completion of corridor reclamation, but they were less than from nearby less-steep forest road corridors. Concentrations and yields fell significantly after the first 3 months; declines were attributed to revegetation on the ROW. At the end of the first growing season, vegetative cover on all segments ranged from 55 to 79%, with no differences between seeding rates. Mean runoff was significantly higher on the northwest-facing segments than on the southeast-facing segments, but runoff volumes did not decrease on either aspect in concert with loadings or concentrations. Higher runoff on the northwest-facing segments may have been due to clay-skinned peds in subsurface soil that limited vertical drainage. Even with a heavy straw mulch cover on the right-of-way, the timing of the highest sediment losses immediately following pipeline construction suggests that implementation of additional surface-protection best management practices could be beneficial until vegetation is reestablished.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				JUL	2017	228	7							232	10.1007/s11270-017-3374-9								WOS:000403574400001

Influence of Sewered Versus Septic Systems on Watershed Exports of E-coli	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Elevated bacteria concentrations have led to the impairment (e.g., closures of shellfisheries and recreational beaches) of coastal waters. Although many previous studies have suggested that wastewater inputs can lead to elevated fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) concentrations in surface waters, few studies have quantified wastewater-associated FIB exports at the watershed scale. The goal of this study was to estimate bacterial exports at the watershed scale based on wastewater management approach (septic vs. sewer). Six watersheds (three exclusively on septic and three exclusively served by a sewer system) were selected for water quality assessment and comparison. Streams were monitored approximately monthly from August 2011 to June 2012 during baseflow conditions. Additionally, three storms were monitored. Samples were collected in sterile 100-mL bottles and analyzed for Escherichia coli concentrations. Discharge from streams was measured and bacterial exports were estimated by multiplying discharge by E. coli concentration. The results revealed that (1) during baseflow conditions, septic watersheds contained elevated stream discharge and E. coli concentrations and exports as compared to sewer watersheds; (2) warmer months had elevated E. coli watershed exports compared to colder months in both septic and sewer watersheds; and (3) storms significantly increased watershed E. coli exports in both septic and sewer watersheds. Storms significantly increased watershed E. coli exports in both septic and sewered watersheds, but E. coli counts in sewered watersheds were considerably greater likely due to greater impervious surface coverage and or leaky sewer infrastructure. These findings in conjunction with previous studies suggest that septic systems may play a pivotal role in the delivery of FIB to receiving waters, particularly during baseflow conditions.

In 2003, the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) concluded that atrazine poses potential risks to sensitive aquatic species. Consequently, a surface water monitoring program was developed to assess whether measured levels of atrazine could impact aquatic plants in vulnerable watersheds. To facilitate evaluation of the monitoring data, the Agency needed to establish a level of concern (LOC) below which atrazine would not cause unacceptable adverse effects to aquatic plant communities. Several attempts at developing a community-level LOC have followed from USEPA but none have been formally accepted or endorsed by independent Scientific Advisory Panels. As part of registration review, the USEPA needs to revisit development of a community-level LOC for atrazine that will be protective of aquatic plant communities. This article reviews 4 methods that can or have been used for this purpose. Collectively, the methods take advantage of the large number of single species and mesocosm studies that have been conducted for aquatic plants exposed to atrazine. The Plant Assemblage Toxicity Index (PATI) and the Comprehensive Aquatic Systems Model for atrazine (CASM(ATZ2)) incorporate single-species toxicity data but are calibrated with micro- and mesocosm study results to calculate community-level LOCs. The Brock et al. scoring system relies exclusively on mesocosm studies. Single-species toxicity data were used in a modified version of the USEPA's Water Quality Criteria (WQC) method. The 60-day LOCs calculated using the 4 methods ranged from 19.6 to 26 mu g/L. A weight-of-evidence assessment indicated that the CASM(ATZ2) method was the most environmentally relevant and statistically reliable method. Using all 4 methods with weights based on method reliability, the weighted 60-day LOC was 23.6 mu g/L. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2017;13:686-701.

An improved method for calculating toxicity-based pollutant loads: Part 1. Method development	INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT												Pollutant loads are a means for assessing regulatory compliance and setting targets to reduce pollution entering receiving waterbodies. However, a pollutant load is often comprised of multiple chemicals, which may exert joint toxicity on biota. When the ultimate goal for assessing pollutant loads is to protect ecosystems from adverse effects of toxicants, then the total pollutant load needs to be calculated based on the principles of mixture toxicology. In this article, an improved method is proposed to convert a pollutant load to a toxicity-based load (toxic load) using a modified toxic equivalency factor (TEF) derivation method. The method uses the relative potencies (RePs) of multiple species to represent the response of the ecological community. The TEF is calculated from a percentile of a cumulative distribution function (CDF) fitted to the RePs. The improvements permit the determination of which percentile of the CDF generates the most environmentally relevant and robust toxic loads. That is, environmental relevance ensures that a reduction in the toxic load is likely to result in a corresponding improvement in ecosystem health and robustness ensures that the calculation of the toxic loads is not biased by the reference chemical used. The improved methodology will therefore ensure that correct management decisions will be made and ultimately, a reduction in the toxic load will lead to a commensurate improvement in water quality.

Development and implementation of a site-specific water quality limit for uranium in a high conservation value ecosystem	INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT												Water quality guideline values (GVs) are a key tool for water quality assessments. Site-specific GVs, which incorporate data relevant to local conditions and organisms, provide a higher level of confidence that the GV will protect the aquatic ecosystem at a site compared to generic GVs. Site-specific GVs are, therefore, considered particularly suitable for sites of high sociopolitical or ecological importance. The present paper provides an example of the refinement of a site-specific GV for high ecological value aquatic ecosystems in Kakadu National Park, Northern Territory, Australia, to improve its site specificity and statistical robustness, thereby increasing confidence in its application. Uranium is a contaminant of concern for Ranger U mine, which releases water into Magela Creek and Gulungul Creek in Kakadu National Park. A site-specific GV for U has been applied, as a statutory limit, to Magela Creek since 2004 and to Gulungul Creek since 2015. The GV of 6g/LU was derived from toxicity data for 5 local species tested under local conditions. The acquisition of additional U data, including new information on the effect of DOC on U toxicity, enabled a revision of the site-specific U GV to 2.8g/LU and an ability to adjust the value on the basis of environmental concentrations of DOC. The revised GV has been adopted as the statutory limit, with the regulatory framework structured so the GV requires adjustment based on DOC concentration only when an exceedance occurs. Monitoring data for Magela Creek (2001-2013) and Gulungul Creek (2003-2013) downstream of the mine show that dissolved U has not exceeded 1g/L. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2017;13:765-777.
