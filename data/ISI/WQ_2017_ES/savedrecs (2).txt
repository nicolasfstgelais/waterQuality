J	Grochowska, J; Augustyniak, R; Lopata, M				Grochowska, Jolanta; Augustyniak, Renata; Lopata, Michal			How durable is the improvement of environmental conditions in a lake after the termination of restoration treatments	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												The study was conducted on Lake Dlugie,a water body lying in Olsztyn, a town situated in northeastern Poland. From 1956 to 1976raw wastewater was discharged into Lake Dlugie and therefore heavy pollution was the reason for the total degradation of this lake. The concentrations of nutrients were very high in the bottom water layer (TN 22.89 mg L-1, TP 3.50 mg L-1). The mean concentration of chlorophyll an exceeded 60 mu g L-1 on average and Secchi disc visibility was less than 1 m. The discontinuation of sewage discharge into the lake caused the saprotrophic state to transform into hypertrophy. Further improvement of the environmental conditions in the lake was possible only after the implementation of an appropriate restoration method. The restoration procedure of this lake began in 1987. The first stage involved an artificial aeration method, and the second stage consisted of a phosphorus inactivation method. The applied restoration methods led to the improvement of Lake Dlugie's water quality. Even ten years after the restoration oscillated in the range of 5-10 mu g L-1, Chlorophyll a contents oscillated in the range of 5-10 mu g L-1, and Secchi disc visibility amounted to c.a. 4.5 m.

They are affected by nutrient and light availability and seasonal changes. In this study, we investigated the changes of C/N metabolism and growth of three natural submersed macrophyte populations (i.e., each in a different site), Potamogeton maackianus, in response to water depth gradients with 0.5 m interval in a freshwater lake for four seasons. Changes were identified by measuring the biomass of the sampled macrophytes and metabolite contents of soluble carbohydrate (SC), starch, and free amino acid (FAA) in their organs. Results showed that no significant and consistent changes were found in the SC and FAA contents in leaves and stems from 1.0 m to 5.5 m water depth, as compared to previous results of controlled studies, suggesting a relative stable C/N metabolism in response to the depth gradients in studied natural populations of P. maackianus. The metabolite contents with the most variations appeared mainly because of seasonal changes. The metabolite contents of the macrophyte populations were more closely correlated with the chemical parameters than with the light parameters in water columns. No significant correlations were found between the metabolite contents with the light attenuation coefficient ($K$) and Secchi depth (SD) in water columns. The NO3-N and total phosphorus (TP) contents in water columns were positively correlated with the SC and starch contents in leaves, respectively. The NH4-N content in water columns was negatively related to the FAA content in leaves. Metabolite contents had weak correlations with depth gradients and light parameters, probably because of the physiological integration among individuals by developed stolons and the canopy-forming characteristic of this species. Our results highlighted the importance of water quality to the C/N metabolism in natural population of submersed macrophyte. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Relationships Between Land Use and Stream Nutrient Concentrations in a Highly Urbanized Tropical Region of Brazil: Thresholds and Riparian Zones	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Nutrient enrichment in streams due to land use is increasing globally, reducing water quality and causing eutrophication of downstream fresh and coastal waters. In temperate developed countries, the intensive use of fertilizers in agriculture is a main driver of increasing nutrient concentrations, but high levels and fast rates of urbanization can be a predominant issue in some areas of the developing world. We investigated land use in the highly urbanized tropical State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. We collected total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and inorganic nutrient data from 35 independent watersheds distributed across the State and characterized land use at a riparian and entire watershed scales upstream from each sample station, using ArcGIS. We used regression models to explain land use influences on nutrient concentrations and to assess riparian protection relationships to water quality. We found that urban land use was the primary driver of nutrient concentration increases, independent of the scale of analyses and that urban land use was more concentrated in the riparian buffer of streams than in the entire watersheds. We also found significant thresholds that indicated strong increases in nutrient concentrations with modest increases in urbanization reaching maximum nutrient concentrations between 10 and 46% urban cover. These thresholds influenced calculation of reference nutrient concentrations, and ignoring them led to higher estimates of these concentrations. Lack of sewage treatment in concert with urban development in riparian zones apparently leads to the observation that modest increases in urban land use can cause large increases in nutrient concentrations.

Influence of Select Antibiotics on Vibrio fischeri and Desmodesmus subspicatus at mu g L-1 Concentrations	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The presence of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment is a contemporary reality and it is necessary to understand more about the effects of this presence on organisms. The purpose of this work was to assess the ecotoxicity of antibiotics metronidazole, nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim, and sulphamethoxazole (single and mixture) in Vibrio fischeri and Desmodesmus subspicatus at mu g L-1 concentrations. The evaluation of the toxic effect of the antibiotics on V. fischeri and D. subspicatus was based on fluorescence and bioluminescence tests, respectively, using nominal concentrations. When tested individually, the four antibiotics gave rise to a toxic effect on the evaluated organisms. Sulphamethoxazole caused a higher toxic effect on V. fischeri and D. subspicatus from 7.81 to 500 mu g L-1. Trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole showed hormesis for the concentrations, which ranged from 7.81 to 62.5 mu g L-1. The mixture of antibiotics induced a toxic effect on the V. fischeri and D. subspicatus organisms (from 0.03 to 1 mu g L-1 concentrations) than when the antibiotics were evaluated individually. These results were significant since water quality problems are widespread all over the word, and emerging pollutants such as antibiotics have been detected in the aquatic environment in very low concentrations.																	0364-152X	1432-1009				JUL	2017	60	1					157	164		10.1007/s00267-017-0841-4								WOS:000402792800011	28271212

A lot of fish species grow in this lake and many birds and ducks live and nest in this area. A total of 12 sets of surface water samples were collected from three representative points from Braeni Lake, during 2015 and 2016 for three seasons (autumn, winter and spring). The samples were taken bi-monthly. In situ, using a portable multiparameter WTW Multi 350i, were determined the physico-chemical parameters like: pH, EC, TDS, ORP, and salinity. In laboratory by using an ion chromatograph (IC500 Dionex) were analysed the following cations: NH4+, Mg-2(+), Ca-2(+), Li+, Na+, K+ and anions F- Cr-, NO2-, Br-, NO3-, PO43-, SO42-. The content of heavy metals (Cd, Pb and Fe) was analysed using an atomic absorption spectrometer (ZEEnit 700 Analytik Jena). The cations concentration varied between: 56.31 - 75.97 mg/L for Na+, 20.44 - 26.66 mg/L for K+, 35.92 - 54.80 mg/L for Mg2+, 67.83 - 144.22 mg/L for Ca2+. N-NH4+ was found only in one sample (0.3 mg/L) and Li+ was found in three samples (0.25 - 0.26 mg/L). The anions concentration varied between: 26.78 - 48.93 mg/L (Cl-), 0.20 - 0.51 mg/L (F), 0.19 - 4.07 mg/L (N-NO3-), 124.77 - 193.51 mg/L (SO42-). Lead ranged between 3.98 and 33.01 mu g/L and iron had levels between 0.02 and 0.6 mg/L. Using the obtained results, sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) and Kelley's index (KI) were calculated, in order to determine if the water is suitable for irrigation.																	1842-4090	1844-489X				JUL	2017	12	2					365	370										WOS:000402360400006

In many Cluj county rural areas, the drinking water from private wells is highly polluted with nitrate, as a result of agricultural activity (including excess application of inorganic nitrogenous fertilizers and manures) or seepage of human sewage from private septic systems. This study presents quality assessment of drinking water from Cluj county, regarding nitrate concentration. Drinking water parameter like conductivity, pH, turbidity, nitrite, ammonium, nitrates were investigated. The study was carried out in the January - December, 2015. The nitrate concentrations were low in drinking water samples from surface source in the ranged between 1.68-3.34 mg/L. On the other hand in groundwater samples high nitrate concentration was obtained 4.78-47.81 mg/L, but not exceed the limits indicated by the legislation (50mg/L).																	1842-4090	1844-489X				JUL	2017	12	2					389	393										WOS:000402360400009

A multilevel analysis	ENERGY POLICY												Increased hydraulic fracturing operations (also known as 'fracking') in the U.S. have introduced a larger portion of the public to new and more extensive risks and benefits: from concerns of impacts on water quality and human health to benefits from increased oil and gas production and local economic development. As most policy affecting fracking occurs at the state-level, it is important to understand how citizens' support for the technology is shaped by their states' industrial, environmental, and socioeconomic experiences. Using a nationally representative survey, we construct a multilevel model to understand how individuals' support for fracking varies as a function of both individual- and state-level characteristics. At the state-level, we find that people residing in states with a higher poverty rate and higher ground water use for public drinking supply are more likely to support fracking. At the individual level, the relationships between risk/benefit perceptions and support vary as a function of the state people live in. Additionally, the positive relationship between conservatism and support for fracking is stronger for people residing in states with a higher poverty rate. Based on these findings, we discuss the dynamics of public opinion in social contexts and implications on energy policymaking.

A Modeling Study of the Impacts of Mississippi River Diversion and Sea-Level Rise on Water Quality of a Deltaic Estuary	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Freshwater and sediment management in estuaries affects water quality, particularly in deltaic estuaries. Furthermore, climate change-induced sea-level rise (SLR) and land subsidence also affect estuarine water quality by changing salinity, circulation, stratification, sedimentation, erosion, residence time, and other physical and ecological processes. However, little is known about how the magnitudes and spatial and temporal patterns in estuarine water quality variables will change in response to freshwater and sediment management in the context of future SLR. In this study, we applied the Delft3D model that couples hydrodynamics and water quality processes to examine the spatial and temporal variations of salinity, total suspended solids, and chlorophyll-alpha concentration in response to small (142 m(3) s(-1)) and large (7080 m(3) s(-1)) Mississippi River (MR) diversions under low (0.38 m) and high (1.44 m) relative SLR (RSLR = eustatic SLR + subsidence) scenarios in the Breton Sound Estuary, Louisiana, USA. The hydrodynamics and water quality model were calibrated and validated via field observations at multiple stations across the estuary. Model results indicate that the large MR diversion would significantly affect the magnitude and spatial and temporal patterns of the studied water quality variables across the entire estuary, whereas the small diversion tends to influence water quality only in small areas near the diversion. RSLR would also play a significant role on the spatial heterogeneity in estuary water quality by acting as an opposite force to river diversions; however, RSLR plays a greater role than the small-scale diversion on the magnitude and spatial pattern of the water quality parameters in this deltaic estuary.																	1559-2723	1559-2731				JUL	2017	40	4					1028	1054		10.1007/s12237-016-0197-7								WOS:000402100700008

For this purpose, surface water quality data was collected from a drainage canal that bisected the southeast district of Ningbo Municipality (Zhejiang) from 2013 to 2015. The sampling transect was designed to represent the change in land-use from the agriculture dominated rural hinterland, to the predominantly urban city-centre. To calculate the representative land-use fraction of each sampling location, the contributing area was defined using an uni-directional 1 km vector line-buffer around the 'upstream' section of canal. The spatial and temporal variation of EC, DO, NH3 and turbidity indicated a measureable difference between the urban and rural sections of the channel. Water quality indicators were most sensitive to urban and parkland land-use types. The study yielded an increased spatial resolution to knowledge of water-quality variability in the urban environment compared to previous studies within the YRD region. The results were used to make recommendations for the development of an effective long-term strategy for the improvement in surface water quality in this region. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, a novel index of biotic integrity based on bacteria (Ba-IBI) was first developed for Qinhuai River in Nanjing city, China. Thirty-two biofilm samples were collected along the river bank and the bacterial communities were identified by high-throughput sequencing. By the range, responsive, and redundancy tests, four core metrics were selected from the dataset of 78 candidate metrics, including Pielou's evenness index, proportion of Paenibacillus, proportion of OTUs tolerant to organic pollution and proportion of Nitrosomonas. The results showed that the Ba-IBI was able to effectively discriminate different impaired site groups, and had a good correlation with the index of water quality (r = 0.79, p < 0.01) and the qualitative habitat evaluation index (r = 0.51, p < 0.01). Moreover, the Ba-IBI was negatively correlated with the number of population within a 1 km buffer (r = 0.71, p < 0.01). Application of the index showed that most of the sites were in the poor or bad class in the river. Our study revealed that the Ba-IBI is an effective and reliable approach for assessing the ecological status of Qinhuai River basin, which can complement the existing ecological assessment approaches for urban. rivers. Meanwhile, repeted surveys and field validations are still needed to further improve the applicability of the index in future studies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Haas, MB; Guse, B; Fohrer, N				Haas, Marcelo B.; Guse, Bjoern; Fohrer, Nicola			Assessing the impacts of Best Management Practices on nitrate pollution in an agricultural dominated lowland catchment considering environmental protection versus economic development	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Water quality is strongly affected by nitrate inputs in agricultural catchments. Best Management Practices (BMPs) are alternative practices aiming to mitigate the impacts derived from agricultural activities and to improve water quality. Management activities are influenced by different governmental policies like the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG). Their distinct goals can be contrasting and hamper an integrated sustainable development. Both need to be addressed in the actual conjuncture in rural areas. Ecohydrological models like the SWAT model are important tools for land cover and land use changes investigation and the assessment of BMPs implementation effects on water quality. Thus, in this study, buffer strip, fertilization reduction and alternative crops were considered as BMPs and were implemented in the SWAT model for the Treene catchment. Their efficiency in terms of nitrate loads reduction related to implementation costs at the catchment scale was investigated. The practices correspond to the catchment conditions and are based on small and mid areal changes. Furthermore, the BMPs were evaluated from the perspective of ecologic and economic policies. The results evidenced different responses of the BMPs. The critical periods in winter were addressed by most of the BMPs. However, some practices like pasture land increase need to be implemented in greater area for better results in comparison to current activities. Furthermore, there is a greater nitrate reduction potential by combining BMPs containing fertilization reduction, buffer strips and soil coverage in winter. The discussion about efficiency showed the complexity of costs stipulation and the relation with arable land and yield losses. Furthermore, as the government policies can be divergent an integrated approach considering all the involved actors is important and seeks a sustainable development. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Deng, WH; Wang, GY				Deng, Weihui; Wang, Guoyin			A novel water quality data analysis framework based on time-series data mining	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The rapid development of time-series data mining provides an emerging method for water resource management research. In this paper, based on the time-series data mining methodology, we propose a novel and general analysis framework for water quality time-series data. It consists of two parts: implementation components and common tasks of time-series data mining in water quality data. In the first part, we propose to granulate the time series into several two-dimensional normal clouds and calculate the similarities in the granulated level. On the basis of the similarity matrix, the similarity search, anomaly detection, and pattern discovery tasks in the water quality time-series instance dataset can be easily implemented in the second part. We present a case study of this analysis framework on weekly Dissolve Oxygen time-series data collected from five monitoring stations on the upper reaches of Yangtze River, China. It discovered the relationship of water quality in the mainstream and tributary as well as the main changing patterns of DO. The experimental results show that the proposed analysis framework is a feasible and efficient method to mine the hidden and valuable knowledge from water quality historical time-series data.

Melodie; Bhat, Mahadev G.; Miralles-Wilhelm, Fernando			Water quality trading opportunities in two sub-watersheds in the northern Lake Okeechobee watershed	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												For decades, the increase of nutrient enrichment has threatened the ecological integrity and economic sustainability of many rivers, lakes, and coastal waters, including Lake Okeechobee, the second largest freshwater lake in the contiguous United States. Water quality trading programs have been an area of active development to both, reduce nutrient pollution and minimize abatement costs. The objective of this study was to apply a comprehensive modeling framework, integrating a hydrologic-water quality model with an economic model, to assess and compare the cost-effectiveness of a water quality trading program over a command-and-control approach in order to reduce phosphorus loadings to Lake Okeechobee. The Upper Kissimmee (UK) and Taylor Creek/Nubbin Slough (TCNS) sub-watersheds, identified as major sources of total phosphorus (TP) loadings to the lake, were selected for this analysis. The effect of different caps on the market potential was assessed while considering four factors: the least-cost abatement solutions, credit prices, potential cost savings, and credit supply and demand. Hypothetical trading scenarios were also developed, using the optimal caps selected for the two sub watersheds. In both sub-watersheds, a phosphorus credit trading program was less expensive than the conventional command-and-control approach. While attaining cost-effectiveness, keeping optimal credit prices, and fostering market competition, phosphorus reduction targets of 46% and 32% were selected as the most appropriate caps in the UK and TCNS sub-watersheds, respectively. Wastewater treatment facilities and urban areas in the UK, and concentrated animal feeding operations in the TCNS sub watershed were identified as potential credit buyers, whereas improved pastures were identified as the major credit sellers in both sub-watersheds. The estimated net cost savings resulting from implementing a phosphorus trading program in the UK and TCNS sub-watersheds were 76% ($ 34.9 million per year) and 45% ($ 3.2 million per year), respectively. It is important to note that the realization of the environmental and economic benefits of this market-based alternative is also contingent on other important factors, such as the market structure, the specific program rules, the risk perception, and the education and outreach to develop trusted relationships among regulatory agencies, the public sector, and other stakeholders. Nevertheless, this research provided the foundation for stakeholders to better understand whether water quality trading has the potential to work in the Lake Okeechobee watershed and to facilitate the development of a pilot program.

J	Cai, BM; Wang, CC; Zhang, B				Cai, Beiming; Wang, Chencheng; Zhang, Bing			Worse than imagined: Unidentified virtual water flows in China	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The impact of virtual water flows on regional water scarcity in China had been deeply discussed in previous research. However, these studies only focused on water quantity, the impact of virtual water flows on water quality has been largely neglected. In this study, we incorporate the blue water footprint related with water quantity and grey water footprint related with water quality into virtual water flow analysis based on the multiregional input-output model of 2007. The results find that the interprovincial virtual flows accounts for 23.4% of China's water footprint. The virtual grey water flows are 8.65 times greater than the virtual blue water flows; the virtual blue water and grey water flows are 91.8 and 794.6 Gm(3)/y, respectively. The use of the indicators related with water quantity to represent virtual water flows in previous studies will underestimate their impact on water resources. In addition, the virtual water flows are mainly derived from agriculture, chemical industry and petroleum processing and the coking industry, which account for 66.8%, 7.1% and 6.2% of the total virtual water flows, respectively. Virtual water flows have intensified both quantity- and quality-induced water scarcity of export regions, where low-valueadded but water-intensive and high-pollution goods are produced. Our study on virtual water flows can inform effective water use policy for both water resources and water pollution in China. Our methodology about virtual water flows also can be used in global scale or other countries if data available. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Nitrogen Source Inventory and Loading Tool: An integrated approach toward restoration of water-quality impaired karst springs	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Nitrogen (N) from anthropogenic sources has contaminated groundwater used as drinking water in addition to impairing water quality and ecosystem health of karst springs. The Nitrogen Source Inventory and Loading Tool (NSILT) was developed as an ArcGIS and spreadsheet-based approach that provides spatial estimates of current nitrogen (N) inputs to the land surface and loads to groundwater from nonpoint and point sources within the groundwater contributing area. The NSILT involves a three-step approach where local and regional land use practices and N sources are evaluated to: (1) estimate N input to the land surface, (2) quantify subsurface environmental attenuation, and (3) assess regional recharge to the aquifer. NSILT was used to assess nitrogen loading to groundwater in two karst spring areas in west-central Florida: Rainbow Springs (RS) and Kings Bay (KB). The karstic Upper Floridan aquifer (UFA) is the source of water discharging to the springs in both areas. In the KB study area (predominantly urban land use), septic systems and urban fertilizers contribute 48% and 22%, respectively, of the estimated total annual N load to groundwater 294,400 kg-N/yr. In contrast for the RS study area (predominantly agricultural land use), livestock operations and crop fertilizers contribute 50% and 13%, respectively, of the estimated N load to groundwater. Using overall groundwater N loading rates for the KB and RS study areas, 4.4 and 3.3 kg N/ha, respectively, and spatial recharge rates, the calculated groundwater nitrate-N concentration (2.1 mg/L) agreed closely with the median nitrate-N concentration (1.7 mg/L) from groundwater samples in agricultural land use areas in the RS study area for the period 2010-2014. NSILT results provide critical information for prioritizing and designing restoration efforts for water-quality impaired springs and spring runs affected by multiple sources of nitrogen loading to groundwater.

However, implementing this empirical comparative approach at a greater spatial scale remains a challenge due to the diversity of biogeographical contexts encompassed by regional and national scales. We showed in previous studies that the use of standard organisms caged permits the use of a common biomonitor over a far greater geographical range, while limiting the influence of confounding factors on levels of bioavailable contamination. In this study, levels of Cd, Hg, Ni and Pb contamination assessed by active biomonitoring with caged Gammarus fossarum were compared to abundances of on-site gammarids, on 94 sites in France. Based on this national dataset of in situ bioassays, we first re-determined bioavailable background assessment concentrations (BBACs), i.e. concentrations measured in caged G. fossarum indicating a significant bioavailable contamination, which we had previously defined at a regional scale for these four metallic elements. On-site gammarid abundances were retrieved from monitoring programs implemented by French water agencies for the evaluation of ecological status for the European Water Framework Directive. These abundances were corrected for the influence of stream physico-chemical typology in order to permit a reliable comparison of gammarid densities between sites at the national scale. Clear trends of degradation of gammarid densities with increasing levels of bioaccumulated concentrations were identified for three of the four elements (Cd, Ni and Pb). Threshold concentrations in caged organisms above which the numbers of free-ranging gammarids were abnormally low namely bioavailable ecological assessment concentrations (BEACs) were determined. The reliability and validity of the BEACs, their comparison with BBACs and their usefulness in terms of prioritisation of contaminants, sites in freshwater management, are discussed.

M.; Zhu, Guangwei; Gao, Guang			Improving water quality in China: Environmental investment pays dividends	WATER RESEARCH												This study highlights how Chinese economic development detrimentally impacted water quality in recent decades and how this has been improved by enormous investment in environmental remediation funded by the Chinese government. To our knowledge, this study is the first to describe the variability of surface water quality in inland waters in China, the affecting drivers behind the changes, and how the government-financed conservation actions have impacted water quality. Water quality was found to be poorest in the North and the Northeast China Plain where there is greater coverage of developed land (cities + cropland), a higher gross domestic product (GDP), and higher population density. There are significant positive relationships between the concentration of the annual mean chemical oxygen demand (COD) and the percentage of developed land use (cities + cropland), GDP, and population density in the individual watersheds (p < 0.001). During the past decade, following Chinese government financed investments in environmental restoration and reforestation, the water quality of Chinese inland waters has improved markedly, which is particularly evident from the significant and exponentially decreasing GDP-normalized COD and ammonium (NH4+-N) concentrations. It is evident that the increasing GDP in China over the past decade did not occur at the continued expense of its inland water ecosystems. This offers hope for the future, also for other industrializing countries, that with appropriate environmental investments a high GDP can be reached and maintained, while simultaneously preserving inland aquatic ecosystems, particularly through management of sewage discharge.

A year-long monitoring program in the shore area of Chongqing Urban Section of the Jialing River (JR) was launched to determine the variations in carbonic anhydrase activity (CAA) and its change mechanism in the hydro-fluctuation belt of the tributaries in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) area. The variations in basic water quality parameters, different carbon forms, and CAA were investigated from November 2013 to October 2014. Results showed that the mean CAA value in JR was 0.67 +/- 0.31 EU/10(6) cells. CAA was high during the flood stage, low during the impounding stage, and peaked on April 3, 2014 during the discharging stage. No significant difference was observed in the CAA of different sampling sites in JR. However, a significant difference was observed between the CAA of JR and that of the Yangtze River. Correlation analyses showed that water temperature, pH, algal cell density, and dissoluble organic carbon were positively correlated with CAA, whereas CO2 and dissoluble inorganic carbon were negatively correlated with CAA. A model for CAA and related parameters was built through principal component regression. The equation was expressed as follows: CM = 0.116T + 0.00746Cells+0.0156pH-0.0157CO(2)-0.0150D1C+0.0135D0C+0.565. Results revealed that CAA in JR was controlled by multiple factors, which could be used for CM monitoring. The model demonstrated a potential value in controlling algal blooms. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Among these herbicides, tefuryltrione (TFT) is the first registered herbicide for rice farming, and recently its distribution has grown dramatically. In this study, we developed analytical methods for TFT and its degradation product 2-chloro-4-methylsulfonyl-3-[(tetrahydrofuran-2-ylmethoxy) methyl] benzoic acid (CMTBA). TFT was found frequently in surface waters in rice production areas at concentrations as high as 1.9 a. The maximum observed concentration was lower than but close to 2 mu g/L, which is the Japanese reference concentration of ambient water quality for pesticides. However, TFT was not found in any drinking waters even though the source waters were purified by conventional coagulation and filtration processes; this was due to chlorination, which transforms TFT to CMTBA. The conversion rate of TFT to CMBA on chlorination was almost 100%, and CMTBA was stable in the presence of chlorine. Moreover, CMTBA was found in drinking waters sampled from household water taps at a similar concentration to that of TFT in the source water of the water purification plant. Although the acceptable daily intake and the reference concentration of CMTBA are unknown, the highest concentration in drinking water exceeded 0.1 mu g/L, which is the maximum allowable concentration for any individual pesticide and its relevant metabolites in the European Union Drinking Directive.

Leachate, generated during the landfill treatment of municipal solid waste, is the important hotspot of the antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), and no effective on-site treatment has been put forward for preventing ARGs dissemination. Herein, the aged refuse bioreactor was employed to remove antibiotics and ARGs from leachate, and the great removal performance was observed. For the detected antibiotics, the total removal efficiency was about 76.75%, and sulfanilamide and macrolide were removed with high efficiencies (>80%). Among the target ARGs, tetracycline and macrolide resistance genes (tetM, tetQand ermB) were eliminated with 1.2-2.0 orders of magnitude. The occurrences of ARGs did not correlated with water quality parameters such as COD, total nitrogen, ammonia, nitrate and nitrite, but closely linked to the variations of the bacterial community structure. Redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated the significant correlations between four genera and the distribution of ARGs, which implied that these key genera (including potential pathogens) drove the ARGs removal. Furthermore, the hydraulic loading test confirmed that the aged refuse bioreactor was capable of achieving high removal efficiencies even under shock loading for the higher loading was negative for the proliferations of potential ARGs hosts. This study suggested that aged refuse bioreactor could be a promising way for antibiotics and ARGs on-site removal from leachate. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

A worldwide data set of 699 observations drawn from 133 studies combines information reported in primary studies with geospatial data. The meta-analysis explores antagonisms and synergies between ecosystem services. This is the first meta-analysis to incorporate simultaneously external geospatial data and ecosystem service interactions. We first show that it is possible to reliably predict the value of ecosystem services provided by lakes based on their physical and geographic characteristics. Second, we demonstrate that interactions between ecosystem services appear to be significant for explaining lake ecosystem service values. Third, we provide an estimation of the average value of ecosystem services provided by lakes: between 106 and 140 USD$2010 per respondent per year for non-hedonic price studies and between 169 and 403 USD$2010 per property per year for hedonic price studies.

Modeling Water-Quality Parameters Using Genetic Algorithm-Least Squares Support Vector Regression and Genetic Programming	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												The modeling and monitoring of water-quality parameters is necessary because of the ever increasing use of water resources and contamination caused by sewage disposal. This study employs two data-driven methods for modeling water-quality parameters. The methods are the least-squares support vector regression (LSSVR) and genetic programming (GP). Model inputs to the LSSVR algorithm and GP were determined using principal component analysis (PCA). The coefficients of the LSSVR were selected by sensitivity analysis employing statistical criteria. The results of the sensitivity analysis of the LSSVR showed that its accuracy depends strongly on the values of its coefficients. The value of the Nash-Sutcliffe (NS) statistic was negative for 60% of the combinations of coefficients applied in the sensitivity analysis. That is, using the mean of a time series would produce a more accurate estimate of water-quality parameters than the LSSVR method in 60% of the combinations of parameters tried. The genetic algorithm (GA) was combined with LSSVR to produce the GA-LSSVR algorithm with which to achieve improved accuracy in modeling water-quality parameters. The GA-LSSVR algorithm and the GP method were employed in modeling Na+, K+, Mg2+, SO42-, Cl-, pH, electric conductivity (EC), and total dissolved solids (TDS) in the Sefidrood River, Iran. The results indicate that the GA-LSSVR algorithm has better accuracy for modeling water-quality parameters than GP judged by the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the NS criterion. The NS static established, however, that the GA-LSSVR and GP methods have the capacity to model water-quality parameters accurately.

Water quality indices can and have been used to identify threats to water quality along a stream and contribute to better water resources management. There are many water quality indices for the assessment and use of surface water for drinking purposes. However, there is no well-established index for the assessment and direct use of river water for irrigation purposes. The aim of this study was to adopt the framework of the National Sanitation Foundation Water Quality Index (NSFWQI) and, with adjustments, apply it in a way which will conform to irrigation water quality requirements. To accomplish this, the NSFWQI parameters for drinking water use were amended to include water quality parameters suitable for irrigation. For each selected parameter, an individual weighting chart was generated according to the FAO 29 guideline. The NSFWQI formula was then used to calculate a final index value, and for each parameter an acceptable range in this value was determined. The new index was then applied to the Ghezel Ozan River in Iran as a case study. A forty five year record of water quality data (1966 to 2010) was collected from four hydrometery stations along the river. Water quality parameters including Na+, Cl-, pH, HCO(-)3, EC, SAR and TDS were employed for water quality analysis using the adjusted NSFWQI formula. The results of this case study showed variation in water quality from the upstream to downstream ends of the river. Consistent monitoring of the river water quality and the establishment of a long term management plan were recommlended for the protection of thisvaluable water resource. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Zhong, XX; Xu, GJ; Xu, HL				Zhong Xiaoxiao; Xu Guangjian; Xu Henglong			Use of multiple functional traits of protozoa for bioassessment of marine pollution	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Ecological parameters based on multiply functional traits have many advantages for monitoring programs by reducing "signal to noise" ratios of observed species data. To identify potential indicators for bioassessment of marine pollution in function space, the functional patterns of protozoan communities and relationships with environmental changes were studied in coastal waters of the Yellow Sea during a 1-year period. The results showed that: (1) the spatial variability in functional trait distributions of the protozoa was significantly associated with changes in environmental variables, especially chemical oxygen demand (COD) and nutrients on spatial scale; (2) the functional traits, especially food resources and feeding type, were significantly correlated with COD and nutrients; and (3) the functional diversity indices were generally related to nutrients or COD. Based on the results, we suggest that the functional traits and diversity indices of protozoan communities may be used as more effective indicators for bioassessment of marine pollution.

Environmental indicators and macrobenthic communities, were investigated during summer and winter 2015. Results indicated a strong seasonality in biotope of intertidal and subtidal zones. Lower macrobenthic diversity were calculated from subtidal inner bay, reflecting the effects of anthropogenic nutrients. However, intertidal sites in that part were indicated to be in a relatively healthier ecological status. Seasonal effects of excess nutrients on benthic habitat were reflected in ecological indicators. It is concluded that the excess nutrients at spatiotemporal scales, influences on the health of benthic habitat. Eventually, it is recommended by this research that, with considering the natural/anthropogenic circumstances, the taxonomic and phylogenetic ecological indicators would be helpful tools to evaluate the benthic health of a typical sub-tropical semi-enclosed bay.

Four types of coastal engineering works were analyzed, namely port construction, petroleum exploitation, fishery and aquaculture, and seawall defense. In addition, two areas with limited human disturbances were considered for comparison. From the weights of the response value for each indicator, port construction was determined to be the primary impact contributor among the four engineering works studies. Specifically, hydrodynamic conditions, ecological status, economic costs, and engineering intensity were on average 72.78%, 65.03%, 75.03%, and 66.35% higher than those of other engineering types. Furthermore, fishery and aquaculture impact on water quality was 42.51% higher than that of other engineering types, whereas seawall defense impact on landscape variation was 51.75% higher than that of other engineering types. The proposed indicator system may provide effective coastal management in future. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Variation in the health and biochemical condition of the coral Acropora tenuis along two water quality gradients on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												This study explores how plasticity in biochemical attributes, used as indicators of health and condition, enables the coral Acropora tenuis to respond to differing water quality regimes in inshore regions of the Great Barrier Reef. Health attributes were monitored along a strong and weak water quality gradient, each with three reefs at increasing distances from a major river source. Attributes differed significantly only along the strong gradient; corals grew fastest, had the least dense skeletons, highest symbiont densities and highest lipid concentrations closest to the river mouth, where water quality was poorest. High nutrient and particulate loads were only detrimental to skeletal density, which decreased as linear extension increased, highlighting a trade-off. Our study underscores the importance of assessing multiple health attributes in coral reef monitoring. For example, autotrophic indices are poor indicators of coral health and condition, but improve when combined with attributes like lipid content and biomass.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				JUN 30	2017	119	2					106	119		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.03.066								WOS:000403985200012	28460877

Galvanic Corrosion of Lead by Iron (Oxyhydr)Oxides: Potential Impacts on Drinking Water Quality	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Lead exposure via drinking water remains a significant public health risk; this study explored the potential effects of upstream iron corrosion on lead mobility in water distribution systems. Specifically, galvanic corrosion of lead by iron (oxyhydr)oxides was investigated. Coupling an iron mineral cathode with metallic lead in a galvanic cell increased lead release by 531 mu g L-1 on average a 9-fold increase over uniform corrosion in the absence of iron. Cathodes were composed of spark plasma sintered Fe3O4 or alpha-Fe2O3 or field extracted Fe3O4 and alpha-FeOOH. Orthophosphate immobilized oxidized lead as insoluble hydroxypyromorphite, while humic acid enhanced lead mobility. Addition of a humic isolate increased lead release due to uniform corrosion by 81 mu g L-1 and-upon coupling lead to a mineral cathode-release due to galvanic corrosion by 990 mu g L-1. Elevated lead in the presence of humic acid appeared to be driven by complexation, with Pb-208 and UV254 size-exclusion chromatograms exhibiting strong correlation under these conditions (R-average(2) = 0.87). A significant iron corrosion effect was consistent with field data: lead levels after lead service line replacement were greater by factors of 2.3-4.7 at sites supplied by unlined cast iron distribution mains compared with the alternative, lined ductile iron.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				JUN 20	2017	51	12					6812	6820		10.1021/acs.est.7b01671								WOS:000404087400021	28557454

A Complementary Isothermal Amplification Method to the US EPA Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction Approach for the Detection of Enterococci in Environmental Waters	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												We report a novel molecular assay, based on helicasedependent amplification (HDA), for the detection of enterococci as markers for fecal pollution in water. This isothermal assay targets the same Enterococcus 23S r-RNA gene region as the existing quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Methods 1611 and 1609 but can be entirely performed on a simple heating block. The developed Enterococcus HDA assay successfully discriminated 15 enterococcal from 15 non-enterococcal reference strains and reliably detected 48 environmental isolates of enterococci. The limit of detection was 25 target copies per reaction, only 3 times higher than that of qPCR. The applicability of the assay was tested on 30 environmental water sample DNA extracts, simulating a gradient of fecal pollution. Despite the isothermal nature of the reaction, the HDA results were consistent with those of the qPCR reference. Given this performance, we conclude that the developed Enterococcus HDA assay has great potential as a qualitative molecular screening method for resource-limited settings when combined with compatible up- and downstream processes. This amplification strategy can pave the way for developing a new generation of rapid, low-cost, and field-deployable molecular diagnostic tools for water quality monitoring.

However, little empirical evidence exists to characterize the potential health benefits from sanitation externalities. This study investigated the effect of community sanitation coverage versus individual household sanitation access on child health and drinking water quality. Using a Census of 121 villages in rural Mali, we analyzed the association of community latrine coverage (defined' by a 200 m radius surrounding a household) and individual household latrine ownership with child growth and household stored water quality. Child height-for-age had a significant and positive linear relationship with community latrine coverage, while child weight-for-age and household water quality had nonlinear relationships that leveled off above 60% coverage (p < 0.01; generalized additive models). Child growth and water quality were not associated with individual household latrine ownership. The relationship between community latrine coverage and child height was strongest among households without a latrine; for these households, each 10% increase in latrine coverage was associated with a 0.031 (p-value = 0.040) increase in height-for-age z-score. In this study, the level of sanitation access of surrounding households was more important than private latrine access for protecting water quality and child health.

The key factors controlling GHG emission from subtropical estuarine wetlands were investigated in this study, which continuously monitored the uptake/emission of GHGs (CO2, CH4, and N2O) by/from a subtropical estuarine wetland located in the Minjiang estuary in the coastal region of southeastern China. A self-designed floating chamber was used to collect air samples on site at three environmental habitats (Phragmites australis marsh, mudflats, and river water). The CO2, CH4, and N2O concentrations were then measured using an automated nondispersive infrared analyzer. The magnitudes of the CO2 and N2O emission fluxes at the three habitats were ordered as river water > P. australis > mudflats. P. australis emitted GHGs through photosynthesis and respiration processes. Emissions of CH4 from P. australis and the mudflats were revealed to be slightly higher than those from the river water. The total GHG emission fluxes at the three environmental habitats were quite similar (4.68-4.78 g m(-2) h(-1)). However, when the total carbon dioxide equivalent fluxes (CO2-e) were considered, the river water was discovered to emit the most CO2-e compared with P. australis and the mudflats. Based on its potential to increase global warming, N2O was the main contributor to the total GHG emission, with that emitted from the river water being the most considerable. Tidal water carried onto the marsh had its own GHG content and thus has acted as a source or sink of GHGs. However, water quality had a large effect on GHG emissions from the river water whereas the tidal water height did not. Both high salinity and large amounts of sulfates in the wetlands explicitly inhibited the activity of CH4-producing bacteria, particularly at nighttime.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				JUN 15	2017	119	1					289	298		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.04.005								WOS:000403511000045	28434669

In general, loss of water quality and biological communities and massive development of toxic microorganisms are some of the consequences of this phenomenon. To reveal changes in species composition and cell abundance of the taxocoenosis of epibenthic dinoflagellates before and after a harmful algal bloom event in the water column that lasted about 150 days (August-December 2011) in the Dzilam - San Crisanto area (northern Yucatan Peninsula, southeastern Gulf of Mexico) were the main objectives of the present study. In August 2011 and September 2012, sampling along 20 transects perpendicular to the coastline along the entire northern Yucatan coast, starting from 20 sampling sites from El Cuyo in the east to Celestun in the west, at a distance of 50, 150 and 250 m from the coast, was carried out. Physicochemical characteristics measured before and after the bloom were within the ranges previously reported in the study area. Salinity was the most stable characteristic, with mean values of 36.25 and 36.42 in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Phosphates were the only parameter that showed a wide range with higher values before the bloom (0.03-0.54 mu M/I). A total of 168 macrophyte (seaweeds and seagrasses), sponge and sediment samples (105 in 2011 and 63 in 2012) that included associated microphytobenthos were taken by snorkeling from 0.7 to 5 m depth. Six substrate types were distinguished: Chlorophyta, Phaeophyceae, Rhodophyta, Angiospermae (seagrasses), Demospongiae (sponges) and sediment. Chlorophytes dominated the collected samples: 38 samples in 2011 and 23 in 2012. Avrainvillea longicaulis f. laxa predominated before the bloom and Udotea flabellum after it. In total, 25 epibenthic dinoflagellate species from 11 genera were found. The genus Prorocentrum was the most representative in terms of the number of species. The highest total dinoflagellate cell abundances were observed in the sites with different types of macrophytes (up to 2441 cells/g substrate wet weight in 2011 and up to 1068 cells/g in 2012). The lowest cell densities were observed in the areas with scarce or no macrophytes on sandy seafloor. Before the bloom, Prorocentrum rhathymum (up to 4995 cells/g) and P. cf. sipadanensis (up to 5275 cells/g) were the most abundant, and after the bloom the latter was dominant (up to 3559 cells/g); in 2012, both variety of substrates and dinoflagellate cell abundance diminished. A canonical correspondence analysis revealed significant relationships between the physicochemical variables and epiphytic/benthic dinoflagellate species either before or after the bloom. The pelagic bloom resulted in the loss of substrate for epiphytic dinoflagellates, which caused replacement of the dominant species and a decrease in cell abundance of the whole taxocoenosis.

Effect of aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) on recovered stormwater quality variability	WATER RESEARCH												Aquifer Storage and Recovery (ASR) is increasingly being considered as a means of reusing urban stormwater to supplement available urban water resources. Storage of stormwater in an aquifer has been shown to affect water quality but it has also been claimed that storage will also decrease the stormwater quality variability making for improved predictability and management. This study is the first to document the changes in stormwater quality variability as a result of subsurface storage at four full scale ASR sites using advanced statistical techniques. New methods to examine water quality are required as data is often highly left censored and so traditional measures of variability such as the coefficient of variation are inappropriate. It was observed that for some water quality parameters (most notably E. coli) there was a marked improvement of water quality and a significant decrease in variability at all sites. This means that aquifer storage prior to engineered treatment systems may be advantageous in terms of system design to avoid over engineering. For other parameters such as metal(loids)s and nutrients the trend was less clear due to the numerous processes occurring during storage leading to an increase in variability, especially for geogenic metals and metalloids such as iron and arsenic. Depending upon the specific water quality parameters and end use, use of ASR may not have a dampening effect on stormwater quality variability. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Wu, BL; Wang, XCC; Dzakpasu, M				Wu, Baolei; Wang, Xiaochang C.; Dzakpasu, Mawuli			Genetic characterization of fecal impacts of seagull migration on an urban scenery lake	WATER RESEARCH												A microbial source tracking scheme was devised to differentiate fecal impacts of seagulls from that of human activities on an urban scenery lake in southern China, which is a major wintering ground for the black-headed seagull. Fecal contamination of seagulls was characterized by quantifying a novel genetic marker targeting Catellicoccus marimamalium. Quantification of this marker was combined with those of Escherichia coli, human-associated Bacteroidales, thermophilic Campylobacter and Helicobacter. Findings of a year-round study indicate that C marimamalium levels correlated strongly, both spatially and temporally, with seagull migration. A steady increase in C marimammalium concentrations was recorded between October 2014 and March 2015, which peaked at about 5-log copies/100 mL in January. However, a background level of about 2.1-log copies/100 mL was noticeable from April through September when seagulls were absent, probably due to other host sources or secondary habitats for C marimammalium. Seagull migration also caused an apparent elevation of E. coli concentrations (86% and 60%, respectively for qPCR and culture method; p < 0.001) as well as Campylobacter and Helicobacter (66% and 68%, respectively; p < 0.001). Nonetheless, in contrast to the declining levels of E. coli, Campylobacter and Helicobacter, the human-specific Bacteroidales marginally increased in the seagull-absent season, indicating a limited influence of human activities, compared with seagull migration, on the seasonal variations in microbial water quality of the lake. The elevated levels of FIB, Campylobacter and Helicobacter along with C marimammalium may imply human health risk of the lake water due to seasonal seagull migration, which requires further investigation for risk assessment.

The input of excessive amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus both from point and nonpoint sources could impair surface water quality and prevent its use for human consumption. The objective of this work was to evaluate surface water quality in small catchments under agricultural use located within this river basin. To this end, 5 streams and 4 small polders were surveyed between September 2008 and December 2009. The median concentrations of total phosphorus and total nitrogen in the streams across all sites and periods were 770 and 1659 mu g L-1, respectively, exceeding in the case of total phosphorus national and international thresholds. Furthermore, soluble phosphorous, the most readily available form to algae, represented 88.3% of total phosphorus. Concentrations of phosphorous and nitrogen in polders were also high. The eutrophication process of this water bodies could be linked to the intensive agricultural land use in the area because the nutrient input from cities and industries was not relevant in these catchments.																	1178-6221					JUN 14	2017	10						1	8		10.1177/1178622117715446								WOS:000403604500001

ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Microbial water quality monitoring is crucial for managing water resources and protecting public health. However, institutional testing activities in sub-Saharan Africa are currently limited. Because the economics of water quality testing are poorly understood, the extent to which cost may be a barrier to monitoring in different settings is unclear. This study used cost data from eighteen African monitoring institutions (piped water suppliers and health surveillance agencies in six countries) and estimates of water supply type coverage from fifteen countries to assess the annual financial requirements for microbial water testing at both national and regional levels, using World Health Organization recommendations for sampling frequency. We found that a microbial water quality test costs 21.0 +/- 11.3 USD, on average, including consumables, equipment, labor, and logistics, which is higher than previously calculated. Our annual cost estimates for microbial monitoring of piped supplies and improved point sources ranged between 8,000 USD for Equatorial Guinea and 1.9 million USD for Ethiopia, depending primarily on the population served but also on the distribution of piped water system sizes. A comparison with current national water and sanitation budgets showed that the cost of implementing prescribed testing levels represents a relatively modest proportion of existing budgets (<2%). At the regional level, we estimated that monitoring the microbial quality of all improved water sources in sub-Saharan Africa would cost 16.0 million USD per year, which is minimal in comparison to the projected annual capital costs of achieving Sustainable Development Goal 6.1 of safe water for all (14.8 billion USD).

Interaction between Physical Heterogeneity and Microbial Processes in Subsurface Sediments: A Laboratory-Scale Column Experiment	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Physical heterogeneity determines interstitial [GRAPHIC] fluxes in porous media. Nutrients and organic matter distribution in depth influence physicochemical and microbial processes occurring in subsurface. Columns 50 cm long were filled with sterile silica sand following five different setups combining fine and coarse sands or a mixture of both mimicking potential water treatment barriers. Water was supplied continuously to all columns during 33 days. Hydraulic conductivity, nutrients and organic matter, biofflm biomass, and activity were analyzed in order to study the effect of spatial grain size heterogeneity on physicochemical and microbial processes and their mutual interaction. Coarse sediments showed higher biomass and activity in deeper areas compared to the others; however, they resulted in incomplete denitrification, large proportion of dead bacteria in depth, and low functional diversity. Treatments with fine sediment in the upper 20 cm of the columns showed high phosphorus retention. However, low hydraulic conductivity values reported in these sediments seemed to constraint biofflm activity and biomass. On the other hand, sudden transition from coarse-to-fine grain sizes promoted a hot-spot of organic matter degradation and biomass growth at the interface. Our results reinforce the idea that grain,: size disposition in subsurface sandy sediments drives the interstitial fluxes, influencing microbial processes.

Groundwater suitability evaluation by CCME WQI model for Kadava River Basin, Nashik, Maharashtra, India	MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT												In this study, an attempt has been made to use the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment Water Quality Index (CCME WQI) model to classify groundwater suitability (n = 40) of Kadava river basin during pre and post monsoon season of 2012. The CCME WQI model computed for drinking and irrigation through guidelines of the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) and Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). The pH, EC, TDS, TH, Calcium, Magnesium, Sodium, Potassium, Chloride, Fluoride, Sulfate and Nitrate variables were considered. The groundwater samples were classified into five categories from poor to excellent, ranges from 0 to 100. The result reveals that, the groundwater quality is poor to fair and majority of samples having marginal water quality for drinking. The groundwater quality is quite good for irrigation and it ranges from fair to good type with maximum samples fall in fair category. In the study area, the groundwater quality is considerably affected and found vulnerable in pre monsoon season due to intensive agriculture and anthropogenic activities. Spatial distribution maps of water quality index for pre and post monsoon season were prepared through GIS technique. In pre monsoon season, except Central part, many groundwater samples are found vulnerable and restricting their use for drinking. Three vulnerable hotspots are identified in North, NE and South region in post monsoon season. In pre monsoon season, Central, South and North part is affected; while, in post monsoon season, few patches in North, Central and Southern area are critical for irrigation use. In the study area, few aquifers are found to be problematic and thus limiting their use for drinking and irrigation. The CCME WQI is an effective tool to assess the groundwater quality and to communicate the health of water to multiple users. It gives precise results and water quality report in an easier way to the policy and decision makers. Finally, the study confirmed that the groundwater quality is influenced by agricultural activities and appropriate water management plan is essential to nurture precious groundwater resources in the study area.																	2363-6203	2363-6211				JUN	2017	3	2					557	565		10.1007/s40808-017-0316-x								WOS:000432244700005						
J	McInnes, RJ; Everard, M				McInnes, R. J.; Everard, M.			Rapid Assessment of Wetland Ecosystem Services (RAWES): An example from Colombo, Sri Lanka	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES												Wetlands make essential positive contributions to multiple dimensions of human wellbeing. However, recognition of these benefits is often lacking in decision-making, compromising the wellbeing of both the ecosystem and is many linked human beneficiaries. Wetland site managers, decision-makers and stakeholders all need to better understand the benefits provided by wetlands. Despite a plethora of available assessment techniques, very few approaches are genuinely rapid, applicable across different wetland types or consider the realities of time and money resource constraints. The Rapid Assessment of Wetland Ecosystem Services (RAWES) approach is presented as a method that meets these needs, illustrated through its practical application in over 60 different wetland sites supporting development of a Wetland Strategy for the Metro Colombo Region, Sri Lanka. The approach is based on the trained, local assessors using a variety of field indicators in order to assess the positive or negative contribution over 30 wetland ecosystem services provide at local, regional or global scales. Outputs are simplified, signalling to decision- makers the diversity of interlinked ecosystem service outcomes consequent from management policies and actions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Spatio-temporal changes of water quality variables in a highly disturbed river	GLOBAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT-GJESM												Quality of river varies widely depending on the land use in the catchment and environmental factors. Many rivers in developing countries are unhealthy because they contain harmful physical, chemical and biological agents. Zanjanrud River, located in Zanjan Province, Iran, where recently faced human intervention needs a regular monitoring from upstream to downstream for sustainable management. Hence, the current study aimed to assess spatial and temporal variations of pollutant in Zanjanrud River in different stations from headstream to tail of the river. To achieve this goal, semi-monthly samples were collected from October 2015 to Jun 2016 at 5 stations along the river. The physicochemical variables were monitored and analysed using two-way analysis of variance. The results showed the highest values of suspended and dissolved solids and total solids (220.13 +/- 5.57, 641.6 +/- 39.63 and 793.6 +/- 34.5mg/L respectively) were at the tail site in low-flow period. Nitrate-nitrogen and nitrate were also highest (5.39 +/- 02.44 and 23.90 +/- 10.85 mg/L) at the middle of the river where was vicinity to farm lands. The values of pH and dissolved oxygen ranged from 6 to 8.15 and 0.5 to 4mg/L respectively with the highest values in high-flow period at most of the study sites. The maximum and minimum values of electrical conductivity (1439 and 256 mu s/cm) were recorded at tail site and headstream site respectively. Hardness had an increasing trend from upstream to downstream (189.60 +/- 53.53 to 515.83 +/- 64.77mg/L). Phosphorus was also lowest (0.09 +/- 0.04mg/L) at upstream. Results illustrated the high degree of pollutant in studied river. So, an effective management of erosion, domestic waste and agricultural activities in watershed is highly recommended.					kavian, ataollah/0000-0003-1767-0708												2383-3572					SUM	2017	3	3					243	256		10.22034/gjesm.2017.03.03.002								WOS:000416768300002

Evaluation of seasonal variability in surface water quality of Shallow Valley Lake, Kashmir, India, using multivariate statistical techniques	POLLUTION												Seasonal variation in water quality of Anchar Lake has been evaluated, using two multivariate statistical techniques, namely Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Cluster Analysis (CA). Water quality data, collected during four seasons, have been analyzed for 13 parameters and ANOVA has shown that pH (F-3= 10.86, P < 0.05), temperature (F-3 = 65, P < 0.05), electrical conductivity (F-3= 32.72, P < 0.05), Calcium (F-3= 36.84, P < 0.05), Magnesium (F-3= 16.52, P < 0.05), nitrate-nitrogen (F-3= 48.06, P < 0.05), ammonical nitrogen (F-3 = 198.75, P < 0.05), and dissolved oxygen (F-3= 4.96, P < 0.05) varied by season, whereas the substantial variations of sodium (F-2= 7.18, P < 0.05), phosphate-phosphorous (F-2= 25.31, P < 0.05), biological oxygen demand (F-2= 11.02, P < 0.05), and chemical oxygen demand (F-2= 37.73, P < 0.05) were based on different sites. CA has grouped the three sampling sites throughout the four seasons into three clusters of similar water quality as relatively Less-Polluted (LP), Medium-Polluted (MP), and Highly-Polluted (HP). In addition, PCA has been applied on the extract to recognize the factors, responsible for water quality variations in four seasons of the year, resulting in four principal components for winter, summer, and autumn, five ones for spring, accounting for 79.58%, 89.07%, 83.34%, and 93.13% of total variance respectively. Thus the factors, responsible for water quality variation, are mainly related to domestic wastewaters, seasonal variation, agricultural runoff, and catchment geology. These results will help decision-makers better understand the influence of various factors on water quality and manage pollution/eutrophication adaptively in Anchar Lake.																	2383-451X	2383-4501				SUM	2017	3	3					349	362		10.7508/pj.2017.03.001								WOS:000414862900001

Characterization of tannery effluents of Hazaribagh area, Dhaka, Bangladesh	POLLUTION												The present investigation characterizes tannery effluents by determining water quality parameters and some selected trace metallic constituents in order to measure the magnitude of environmental pollution. Effluents and sediments have also been used to isolate chromium-resistant bacteria, collected from Hazaribagh area, Dhaka, claimed to be increasing Cr (VI)-enriched environments, and utilized to reduce Cr (VI). The pH, TDS, DO, and EC values of all investigated samples have been within the range of 4.35 to 9.74, 290 to 9,200 mg/L, 1.5 to 4.90 mg/L, and 587 to 19,000 mu s/cm, respectively. The concentrations of trace metallic constituents have been determined by means of Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS), giving the following ranges: Cr: 14.282 to 6,769.554 mg/L; Cd: 1.546 to 2.214 mg/L; Pb: 18.808 to 32.026 mg/L; Cu: 1.522 to 2.578 mg/L; Zn: 0.682 to 8.688 mg/L; Fe: 1.37 to 108.556 mg/L; and Mn: 3.494 to 17.17 mg/L. The order of trace metallic constituents in the effluent samples was Cr > Fe > Pb > Mn > Zn > Cd > Cu. The water quality parameters and metallic constituents' concentration were higher than that of standard permissible limits in all the examined samples. The average number of Cr (VI)-resistant bacteria in the sediment samples with glucose (0.5%, w/v) supplementation was 2.35x 10(3) CFU/gm at 24h. One of the representative isolate was able to tolerate up to 400 mg/L of K2Cr2O7 as Cr (VI). The bacteria, isolated in the present study, can be used as eco-friendly biological agents for the remediation and/or detoxification of chromium (Cr) pollution from the chromium contaminated environments.																	2383-451X	2383-4501				SUM	2017	3	3					395	406		10.7508/pj.2017.03.005								WOS:000414862900005

DO, BOD5, COD, pH, EC, Chloride, Alkalinity, and Hardness concentrations in water samples have been found to range within 0.93-5.15 mg/L, 30-545 mg/L, 43-983 mg/L, 6.3-7.3, 110-524 uS/cm, 12-56 mg/L, 35-67 mg/L, and 38-121 mg/L, respectively. Multivariate statistical analyses, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as well as Correlation Matrix (CM) have revealed significant anthropogenic pollutant intrusions in water. Cluster Analysis (CA) has indicated decent results of rendering three different groups of resemblance between the two sampling sites, reflecting the different water quality indicators of the river system. A very strong positive linear relation has been found between COD and BOD (1.000), hardness and EC (0.993), pH and DO (0.979), hardness and COD (0.929), hardness and BOD (0.924), EC and COD (0.922), and EC and BOD (0.916) at a significance level of 0.01, proving their common origin entirely from industrial effluents, municipal wastes, and agricultural activities. River Pollution Index (RPI) has indicated that the water from rivers at Kalurghat and Modhunaghat varied from low to high pollution, which is due to the former area's being mostly industrial zone with some domestic sewage, while the latter underwent less industrial activities. On the contrary, lots of agricultural activities have been found in Modhunaghat. Use of river water can pose serious problems to human health and aquatic ecosystem via biological food chain. The present research suggests special preference for proper management of the river with eco-friendly automation along with development of the country's sustainable economic.				Bhuyan, Md.

Assessment of the presence of metals and quality of water used for irrigation in Kwara State, Nigeria	POLLUTION												In Nigeria irrigated agriculture is an important tool for economic growth, food security, and poverty reduction during dry periods of rain-fed agriculture. The concentration and composition of dissolved constituents in water determines its quality for irrigation use. Water quality studies strongly suggest that agriculture is a leading source of water quality problems, due to pesticides and other agro-inputs, widely used by farmers to improve agricultural productivity. Poor quality irrigation water would therefore obviously affect soil quality and crop productivity. This study was carried out in 2015 to assess the presence of metals and physical properties of water, used for irrigation in Kwara state, Nigeria. Samples were randomly collected from thirty irrigation sources in three senatorial zones of Kwara State. The samples were analyzed for the presence of metals and water quality parameters, using standard procedures. Results showed that the highest concentration of Sulphate (7.0mg/L), Nitrate (8.9mg/L), Sodium (31.6mg/L), Calcium (3.1mg/L), and Magnesium (0.7) ions were within acceptable limits. The Sodium Adsorption Ratio, an indicator for water suitability in agricultural irrigation as well as a standard diagnostic parameter for the sodicity hazard of a soil, was significantly the highest (22.7) in Kwara North. Results of the study point to the need for an effective irrigation water quality assessment to curb nonpoint source pollution that could be caused by improper use of chemicals and pesticides by farmers.																	2383-451X	2383-4501				SUM	2017	3	3					461	470		10.7508/pj.2017.03.011								WOS:000414862900011

The methodology is developed in accordance with ISO 14040s and ISO 14046. This study suggested the water depletion and eutrophication results of white radishes as water footprint results. The water depletion results are 25.58 m(3) freshwater/ton (spring season white radish), 20.74 m(3) freshwater/ton (autumn season white radish), 26.68 m(3) freshwater/ton (alpine region white radish), and 28.56 m(3) freshwater/ton (facility white radish), respectively. And the eutrophication results are 3.23E-11 kg P/ton (spring season white radish), 2.66E-11 kg P/ton (autumn season white radish), 3.94E-11 kg P/ton (alpine region white radish), and 1.56E-11 kg P/ton (facility white radish), respectively. In conclusion, autumn season white radish is more competitive than other cultivation types in the context of water footprint assessment. As a result, switching from other cultivation types to autumn season white radish is expected to offer a more water -efficient means of white radish cultivation. Henceforth, drawing upon evidence within this report, decision -makers would be wise to cultivate in more effective water use cultivation type and crop species.

The seasonal variation of the physicochemical parameters including pH, temperature (T), electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (O-2), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total organic carbon (TOC), and trace metals were assessed in water samples collected from wells (n=3) and two rivers which were the River Lukemi (RLK, n=3) and River Luini (RLN, n=2) located in the City of Kikwit (Province of Kwilu, Democratic Republic of the Congo). Samples were collected during the dry and wet seasons. The concentration of trace metals (Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Mo, Ag, Cd, Sn, Sb, and Pb) in water was measured using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS), and soluble ions (Nat Kt NFLit SO42-, NO3, and Cl)-analysis was performed using Ion Chromatography. The results indicate the seasonal difference in the physicochemical composition of water e.g., the pH was lower in the wet compared to the dry season. pH values during the wet season ranged from 4.12 to 5.60 in wells and from 5.55 to 6.31 in rivers while the dry season values ranged from 6.27 to 6.98 in wells and from 7.09 to 7.44 in rivers. The concentrations of soluble ions and other physicochemical parameters (O-2, DOC and TOC) also varied with the seasons, being higher in the wet and lower in the dry season. With the exception of Mn, the average concentrations of other trace metals measured in water samples from wells and rivers met the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for drinking/domestic water quality. Mn concentration in water samples analysed ranged between 634 to 812 and 1352-1741 ng L-1 during the dry and wet seasons, respectively. These results imply that the high concentration of Mn in the water samples may be explained by the geological origin and result of natural weathering processes. In general, according to the parameters analysed, the water samples taken from the sites studied in both seasons appear to meet drinking water standards according to the WHO guidelines but with the two exceptions of the pH and Mn. This study is important for the present situation and can be applied in similar environmental compartments in the future to assess the availability of safe drinking water in developing countries.

Impacts of Heronries on Water Quality as Evaluated through Escherichia coli and Fecal Sterol Analyses	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												The authors used fecal sterol analysis to determine the potential contribution of E. coli from heronries to waterbodies in east-central Texas. They analyzed E. coli and fecal sterol concentrations in samples from four heronries during the breeding seasons in 2011-2013. The highest E. coli concentrations were in water samples from the two largest heronries established directly over water. The main sterols in fecal samples were cholesterol and stigmasterol, and in water, cholesterol, coprostanol, and cholestanol. Total sterols ranged 979 to 5838 ng/g dry weight in fecal samples, and 13 to 600 ng/L in water samples. There was a positive correlation between E. coli and the sum of bird sterols in water exposed directly to fecal deposition, but not in water surrounding the heronries. The authors found a strong association between E. coli and stigmasterol, suggesting that the presence of stigmasterol in water could be used for predicting E. coli sources from heronries nesting close to waterbodies.

This is particularly important in areas that have suffered from a significant impact of human pressure on the ecological status of water. Field studies were conducted in the Ruda River in an area that had undergone anthropogenic disturbances. The objectives of our survey were to test the biological metrics based on benthic macroinvertebrates at four study sites. Spring and autumn surveys of benthic invertebrates indicated that based on the BMWP and BMWP(PL) indices, water quality was higher in comparison with the value of Multimetric index at all of the sites that were studied. Our results revealed that the water quality was higher at the study sites that are located above the dam reservoir based on both the chemical and biological parameters. This study also indicated that both spring and autumn constitute appropriate periods for carrying out monitoring studies. The values of multimeric index indicated the same water quality ( except for site 1) in both sampling periods. Anthropogenic transformations of a riverbed influence the flora and fauna and affect the ecological status of rivers.																	1898-6196					JUN	2017	24	2					285	298		10.1515/eces-2017-0020								WOS:000410753700009						
J	Xu, GJ; Xu, HL				Xu, Guangjian; Xu, Henglong			An approach to analysis of functional redundancy in protozoan communities for bioassessment in marine ecosystems	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												It is necessary to detect how much ecological redundancy or response units (RUs) exist in communities for reducing the "signal-to-noise" ratios of the observed full species data in community-based ecological research and monitoring programs. To reveal the functional redundancy in ciliated protozoan communities in marine ecosystems for both ecological research and monitoring programs, a multivariate approach (peeling procedure) was used to identify the response units to the environmental changes using a dataset of biofilm-dwelling ciliates from coastal waters of the Yellow Sea, northern China. From the full 141-species dataset, three subsets with sufficient information of the whole community (correlation coefficient >0.75) were identified as response units (RUs 1-3) at three levels of functional redundancy, which comprised 20, 26 and 27 species, respectively. These response units appeared to be interchangeable between functional equivalents on both spatial and temporal scales. In terms of relative abundance, RU1, which predominated the ciliate communities over 1-year period, and RU2, which occurred only in warm seasons (except winter) with a peak in summer, presented a decreasing trend, while RU3, which distributed all four seasons with two peaks in summer and autumn, increased with the increase of pollution level. Furthermore, high proportions of bacterivores were found in RU1 during warm seasons and represented an increase trend, while high relative abundances of algivores occurred in RUs 2 and 3 appeared to be decreasing along the pollution gradient. These results demonstrated that the ciliated protozoan assemblages have high functional redundancy in response to environmental changes in marine ecosystems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Alikas, K; Kratzer, S				Alikas, Krista; Kratzer, Susanne			Improved retrieval of Secchi depth for optically-complex waters using remote sensing data	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Water transparency is one of the ecological indicators for describing water quality and the underwater light field which determines its productivity. In the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) as well as in the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) water transparency is used for ecological status classification of inland, coastal and open sea waters and it is regarded as an indicator for eutrophication in Baltic Sea management (HELCOM, 2007). We developed and compared different empirical and semi-analytical algorithms for lakes and coastal Nordic waters to retrieve Secchi depth (Z(SD)) from remote sensing data (MERIS, 300 m resolution).The algorithms were developed in water bodies with high coloured dissolved organic matter absorption (a(CNOM)(442) ranging 1.7-4.0 m(-1)), Chl a concentration (0.5-73 mg m(-3)) and total suspended matter (0.7-37.5 g m(-3)) and validated against an independent data set over inland and coastal waters (0.6 m < Z(SD) < 14.8 m). The results indicate that for empirical algorithms, using longer wavelengths in the visible spectrum as a reference band decreases the RMSE and increases the coefficient of determination (R-2). The accuracy increased (R-2 = 0.75, RMSE = 1.33 m, n = 134) when Z(SD) was retrieved via an empirical relationship between Z(SD) and K-d (490). The best agreement with in situ data was attained when Z(SD) was calculated via both the diffuse and the beam attenuation coefficient (R-2 = 0.89, RMSE = 0.77 m, n = 89). The results demonstrate that transparency can be retrieved with high accuracy over various optical water types by the means of ocean color remote sensing, improving both the spatial and temporal coverage. The satellite derived Z(SD) product could be therefore used as an additional source of information for WFD and MSFD reporting purposes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Although Karenia brevis blooms have appeared in all Mexican states (except Quintana Roo) and blooms of Cladophora spp., Chattonella marina, Chattonella subsalsa, Glenodinium pseudostigmosum and Chaetoceros holsaticus are fairly new to the MC-GoM-LME, their spatial and temporal variations are largely unknown. It appears that anthropogenic nutrient over-enrichment is the main driver of eutrophication along the MC-GoM-LME. Trophic conditions based on physicochemical parameters, phytoplankton and submerged aquatic vegetation along the northern coast of Yucatan show the influence of Gulf of Mexico LME and Caribbean Sea LME waters, seasonal upwelling and polluted inputs from submarine groundwater discharges. Meso-eutrophic and oligo-mesotrophic conditions on the coast are associated with human activities such as domestic sewage discharges from septic tanks, harbor effluents and brackish waters from artificial inlets. Coastal lagoons in Veracruz have been impacted by urbanization expansion leading to waste-water discharges, fertilizer runoff and changes in land use. Overall, trophic conditions in Veracruz have improved relative to historic trophic index values. At least for the Yucatan State and the Quintana Roo State, there are sites that appear to link the occurrence of HABs and anthropogenic eutrophication. Additional research over inshore, estuarine, coastal and offshore environments requires future monitoring efforts and collaboration with the international community (especially the U.S.).																	2211-4645	2211-4653				JUN	2017	22						120	128		10.1016/j.envdev.2016.10.007								WOS:000405729600013

The threat to the water quality is becoming more and more serious. However, how to detect the pesticides quickly in the water becomes an important problem. Ground on acetylcholinesterase' (AChE) inhibition, the paper states the construction of an amperometric biosensor for carbamate insecticide carbofuran's highly sensitive detection. Using an enzyme biosensor ground on poly diallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDDA) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE), then immobilizing the Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) for modifying GCE with layer-by-layer (LBL) technique directly. Detect the inhibition of Aches with the amperometric i-t response. The pesticide concentration is correlated to the percentage inhibition of enzyme activity. Comparing with the enzyme biosensor {PDDA/MWNTs}(5)/ED/AChE/GCE we built previously with detection limit to be 10(-11) g/L and recovery to be 99.8 +/- 5.7% to 10(-8) g/L, nowadays, the new enzyme electrode shows a good linearity ranging from 10(-12) g/L to 10(-6) g/L between the lg[carbofuran] and inhibition rates, and the detection limit is 10(-12) g/L. The improvement of the electrode structure contributes significantly to the sensibility of detection for pesticide in seawater.

J	Luo, Y; Zhang, JY				Luo, Yang; Zhang, Jianying			Application of a Load Duration Curve for Establishing TMDL Programs Upstream of the Tiaoxi River within the Taihu Watershed, China	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH					International Conference on Water Resource and Environment (WRE)	JUL 23-26, 2016	Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA					The impairment of water quality is a major concern for streams and rivers in China. Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) can be used to establish a framework and propose a series of techniques and tools to assess water quality at the watershed scale. While TMDLs have been developed for water quality management by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, scientists and stakeholders, the development of TMDLs in China is hindered due to the lack of comprehensive data collection system and by the difficulties in incorporating seasonal variations efficiently and accurately. In this study, load duration curves (LDCs) were used to calculate TMDLs for ammonia and to quantify the corresponding monthly and seasonal variations in the TMDL. The analysis indicated that the ammonia TMDL was affected by flow patterns, ranging from a maximum of 9418 kg.d(-1) in high flow zones to a minimum of 48 kg.d(-1) in low flow zones. Seasonally, the TMDL varied from 232 kg.d(-1) in spring to 390 kg.d(-1) in summer, 110 kg.d(-1) in autumn, and 25 kg.d(-1) in winter. The monthly load allocation for ammonia was in the range of 3.0 to 18 kg.d(-1). The results provide policymakers with quantitative limits of nutrients loadings with seasonal variations which can be used to implement various water quality targets. This approach also provides a convenient way for water quality assessment when current pollution data is available and proposes seasonal targets of total amount control for local EPA implementing refined water quality management strategy under current economic development level and management ability as well as.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				SUM	2017					80		80	85		10.2112/SI80-011.1								WOS:000405827600011

A theoretically consistent stochastic cascade for temporal disaggregation of intermittent rainfall	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Generating fine-scale time series of intermittent rainfall that are fully consistent with any given coarse-scale totals is a key and open issue in many hydrological problems. We propose a stationary disaggregation method that simulates rainfall time series with given dependence structure, wet/dry probability, and marginal distribution at a target finer (lower-level) time scale, preserving full consistency with variables at a parent coarser (higher-level) time scale. We account for the intermittent character of rainfall at fine time scales by merging a discrete stochastic representation of intermittency and a continuous one of rainfall depths. This approach yields a unique and parsimonious mathematical framework providing general analytical formulations of mean, variance, and autocorrelation function (ACF) for a mixed-type stochastic process in terms of mean, variance, and ACFs of both continuous and discrete components, respectively. To achieve the full consistency between variables at finer and coarser time scales in terms of marginal distribution and coarse-scale totals, the generated lower-level series are adjusted according to a procedure that does not affect the stochastic structure implied by the original model. To assess model performance, we study rainfall process as intermittent with both independent and dependent occurrences, where dependence is quantified by the probability that two consecutive time intervals are dry. In either case, we provide analytical formulations of main statistics of our mixed-type disaggregation model and show their clear accordance with Monte Carlo simulations. An application to rainfall time series from real world is shown as a proof of concept. Plain Language Summary Rainfall is the main input to most hydrological systems. A wide range of studies concerning floods, water resources and water quality require characterization of rainfall inputs at fine time scales. This may be possible using empirical observations, but there is often a need to extend available data in terms of temporal resolution satisfying some additive property (i.e. that the sum of the values of consecutive variables within a period be equal to the corresponding coarse-scale amount). Hence, rainfall disaggregation models are required. Although there is substantial experience in stochastic disaggregation of rainfall to fine time scales, most modeling schemes existing in the literature are ad hoc techniques rather than consistent generalized methods. This is mainly due to the skewed distributions and the intermittent nature of the rainfall process at fine time scales, which are severe obstacles for the application of a theoretically consistent scheme to rainfall disaggregation. We propose a consistent disaggregation model that first generates lognormal time series of rainfall depths based on a random cascade structure. Then, such time series are multiplied by binary sequences (i.e., rainfall occurrences) to obtain intermittent rainfall time series with known summary statistics.

Usually, they cope with instability problems by adopting computationally expensive small time steps. However, some simulators use fixed computation time steps and hence do not have the flexibility to do so. This paper presents a novel quasi-analytical solution for CSTR-based water quality simulators of an unsteady system. The robustness of the new method is compared with the commonly used fourth-order Runge-Kutta methods, the Euler method and three versions of the SWAT model (SWAT2012, SWAT-TCEQ, and ESWAT). The performance of each method is tested for different hypothetical experiments. Besides the hypothetical data, a real case study is used for comparison. The growth factors we derived as stability measures for the different methods and the R-factor-considered as a consistency measure-turned out to be very useful for determining the most robust method. The new method outperformed all the numerical methods used in the hypothetical comparisons. The application for the Zenne River (Belgium) shows that the new method provides stable and consistent BOD simulations whereas the SWAT2012 model is shown to be unstable for the standard daily computation time step. The new method unconditionally simulates robust solutions. Therefore, it is a reliable scheme for CSTR-based water quality simulators that use first-order reaction formulations.

J	Ahn, KH; Yellen, B; Steinschneider, S				Ahn, Kuk-Hyun; Yellen, Brian; Steinschneider, Scott			Dynamic linear models to explore time-varying suspended sediment-discharge rating curves	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												This study presents a new method to examine long-term dynamics in sediment yield using time-varying sediment-discharge rating curves. Dynamic linear models (DLMs) are introduced as a time series filter that can assess how the relationship between streamflow and sediment concentration or load changes over time in response to a wide variety of natural and anthropogenic watershed disturbances or long-term changes. The filter operates by updating parameter values using a recursive Bayesian design that responds to 1 day-ahead forecast errors while also accounting for observational noise. The estimated time series of rating curve parameters can then be used to diagnose multiscale (daily-decadal) variability in sediment yield after accounting for fluctuations in streamflow. The technique is applied in a case study examining changes in turbidity load, a proxy for sediment load, in the Esopus Creek watershed, part of the New York City drinking water supply system. The results show that turbidity load exhibits a complex array of variability across time scales. The DLM highlights flood event-driven positive hysteresis, where turbidity load remained elevated for months after large flood events, as a major component of dynamic behavior in the rating curve relationship. The DLM also produces more accurate 1 day-ahead loading forecasts compared to other static and time-varying rating curve methods. The results suggest that DLMs provide a useful tool for diagnosing changes in sediment-discharge relationships over time and may help identify variability in sediment concentrations and loads that can be used to inform dynamic water quality management.

Increased sediment oxygen flux in lakes and reservoirs: The impact of hypolimnetic oxygenation	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Hypolimnetic oxygenation is an increasingly common lake management strategy for mitigating hypoxia/anoxia and associated deleterious effects on water quality. A common effect of oxygenation is increased oxygen consumption in the hypolimnion and predicting the magnitude of this increase is the crux of effective oxygenation system design. Simultaneous measurements of sediment oxygen flux (J(O2)) and turbulence in the bottom boundary layer of two oxygenated lakes were used to investigate the impact of oxygenation on J(O2). Oxygenation increased J(O2) in both lakes by increasing the bulk oxygen concentration, which in turn steepens the diffusive gradient across the diffusive boundary layer. At high flow rates, the diffusive boundary layer thickness decreased as well. A transect along one of the lakes showed J(O2) to be spatially quite variable, with near-field and far-field J(O2) differing by a factor of 4. Using these in situ measurements, physical models of interfacial flux were compared to microprofile-derived J(O2) to determine which models adequately predict J(O2) in oxygenated lakes. Models based on friction velocity, turbulence dissipation rate, and the integral scale of turbulence agreed with microprofile-derived J(O2) in both lakes. These models could potentially be used to predict oxygenation-induced oxygen flux and improve oxygenation system design methods for a broad range of reservoir systems.

Determination of hyporheic travel time distributions and other parameters from concurrent conservative and reactive tracer tests by local-in-global optimization	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The complexity of hyporheic flow paths requires reach-scale models of solute transport in streams that are flexible in their representation of the hyporheic passage. We use a model that couples advective-dispersive in-stream transport to hyporheic exchange with a shape-free distribution of hyporheic travel times. The model also accounts for two-site sorption and transformation of reactive solutes. The coefficients of the model are determined by fitting concurrent stream-tracer tests of conservative (fluorescein) and reactive (resazurin/resorufin) compounds. The flexibility of the shape-free models give rise to multiple local minima of the objective function in parameter estimation, thus requiring global-search algorithms, which is hindered by the large number of parameter values to be estimated. We present a local-in-global optimization approach, in which we use a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo method as global-search method to estimate a set of in-stream and hyporheic parameters. Nested therein, we infer the shape-free distribution of hyporheic travel times by a local Gauss-Newton method. The overall approach is independent of the initial guess and provides the joint posterior distribution of all parameters. We apply the described local-in-global optimization method to recorded tracer breakthrough curves of three consecutive stream sections, and infer section-wise hydraulic parameter distributions to analyze how hyporheic exchange processes differ between the stream sections. Plain Language Summary Compounds, dissolved in river water, are transported along the river, but also to some extent into the sediments and back into the river. While being in the sediments, they may react. In reactive stream-tracer tests, we add easy-to-detect reactive compounds into a stream and measure time-series of concentration in the river further downstream. We present an approach of analyzing such tracer tests in a flexible, yet reliable manner, which also provides the uncertainty of our interpretation.

Biogeochemical hotspots: Role of small water bodies in landscape nutrient processing	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Increased loading of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from agricultural and urban intensification has led to severe degradation of inland and coastal waters. Lakes, reservoirs, and wetlands (lentic systems) retain these nutrients, thus regulating their delivery to downstream waters. While the processes controlling N and P retention are relatively well-known, there is a lack of quantitative understanding of how these processes manifest across spatial scales. We synthesized data from 600 lentic systems around the world to gain insight into the relationship between hydrologic and biogeochemical controls on nutrient retention. Our results indicate that the first-order reaction rate constant, k [T-1], is inversely proportional to the hydraulic residence time, tau [T], across 6 orders of magnitude in residence time for total N, total P, nitrate, and phosphate. We hypothesized that the consistency of the relationship points to a strong hydrologic control on biogeochemical processing, and validated our hypothesis using a sediment-water model that links major nutrient removal processes with system size. Finally, the k-tau relationships were upscaled to the landscape scale using a wetland size-frequency distribution. Results suggest that small wetlands play a disproportionately large role in landscape-scale nutrient processing-50% of nitrogen removal occurs in wetlands smaller than 10(2.5) m(2) in our example. Thus, given the same loss in wetland area, the nutrient retention potential lost is greater when smaller wetlands are preferentially lost from the landscape. Our study highlights the need for a stronger focus on small lentic systems as major nutrient sinks in the landscape. Plain Language Summary Excess nutrient pollution from intensive fertilizer use and farming operations poses an increasing threat to water quality worldwide. Lakes, streams, and wetlands restrict the movement of nutrients, and thus protect downstream waters. We have a limited understanding, however, of how removal processes are affected by the size and type of the water body. Based on a synthesis of data from lakes, reservoirs, and wetlands worldwide, we found that smaller water bodies tend to have higher nutrient removal rates. We applied our findings to the landscape scale and found that for the same wetland area lost, the loss of small wetlands corresponds to a greater loss in wetland nutrient removal potential. Such findings are significant to wetland protection and restoration efforts, which have historically focused on maximizing total wetland area rather than on preserving a distribution of different wetlands sizes within a landscape.

Channels are mostly in direct connection with the surrounding arable agricultural land and are exposed to different run-off, leaching and/or wind erosion processes. Close to urban areas, some channel sections serve as recipients of unrefined sewage and industrial waste waters. Water flows and velocities, as well as the transportable capacity of fluvial materials (sediments) are relatively low. This, in combination with other natural and anthropogenic impacts, contributes to sediment generation in the drainage channel network. Based on around 100 sediment samples from 46 channels, concentrations of primary nutrients (N, P and K) were elaborated in this study. Detected concentrations of macronutrients in the channel sediments (e.g. N 1-1.2%, P 100-265 and K 100-380 mg 100 g(-1)) exceeded their content in surrounding arable land by a few fold. Also, significantly higher nutrient concentrations (in average by 50%) were detected in downstream (vs. upstream) channel sections. An excessive presence of observed elements in channel sediments, due to interactive processes between water and sediment material, can adversely influence the water quality and life conditions for channel biota and caused other negative environmental impacts such as eutrophication. These results clearly confirm that the processes of nutrient accumulation in channel sediments are greater than those in the surrounding, mostly intensively arable land areas. The erosion of unprotected agricultural areas and sediment transport as the most important pollution pathways from the drainage basin to channel network may be essential factors responsible for detected condition of nutrient accumulation.

Since the late 1980s, water scarcity research has attracted much political and public attention. We here review a variety of indicators that have been developed to capture different characteristics of water scarcity. Population, water availability, and water use are the key elements of these indicators. Most of the progress made in the last few decades has been on the quantification of water availability and use by applying spatially explicit models. However, challenges remain on appropriate incorporation of green water (soil moisture), water quality, environmental flow requirements, globalization, and virtual water trade in water scarcity assessment. Meanwhile, inter-and intra-annual variability of water availability and use also calls for assessing the temporal dimension of water scarcity. It requires concerted efforts of hydrologists, economists, social scientists, and environmental scientists to develop integrated approaches to capture the multi-faceted nature of water scarcity.

J	Richardson, M; Kumar, P				Richardson, Meredith; Kumar, Praveen			Critical Zone services as environmental assessment criteria in intensively managed landscapes	EARTHS FUTURE												The Critical Zone (CZ) includes the biophysical processes occurring from the top of the vegetation canopy to the weathering zone below the groundwater table. CZ services provide a measure for the goods and benefits derived from CZ processes. In intensively managed landscapes, cropland is altered through anthropogenic energy inputs to derive more productivity, as agricultural products, than would be possible under natural conditions. However, the actual costs of alterations to CZ functions within landscape profiles are unknown. Through comparisons of corn feed and corn-based ethanol, we show that valuation of these CZ services in monetary terms provides a more concrete tool for characterizing seemingly abstract environmental damages from agricultural production systems. Multiple models are combined to simulate the movement of nutrients throughout the soil system, enabling the measurement of agricultural anthropogenic impacts to the CZ's regulating services. Results indicate water quality and atmospheric stabilizing services, measured by soil carbon storage, carbon respiration, and nitrate leaching, among others, can cost more than double that of emissions estimated in previous studies. Energy efficiency in addition to environmental impact is assessed to demonstrate how the inclusion of CZ services is necessary in accounting for the entire life cycle of agricultural production systems. These results conclude that feed production systems are more energy efficient and less environmentally costly than corn-based ethanol.

Intensive, long-term studies on hydrological and hydrochemical parameters were monitored at 4 permanent dripping sites (VP1-VP4) in the Velika Pasica Cave (Slovenian) over a period from 2006 to 2013 concurrently with aquatic fauna sampling. Multivariate methods were applied to elucidate the relationship between the environmental conditions and the resident aquatic ecosystem. Seven major aquatic taxa were collected from the drips, with Copepoda being the dominant taxa; however, the spatial distribution and composition of these species varied distinctively at the 4 study sites; the drip water from different sites had distinct hydrological and hydrochemical characteristics. The most significant parameters influencing community composition were drip water discharge volume and NO3-ion content. The results indicate that hydrology and hydrochemistry significantly influence the microdistribution of aquatic fauna within the epikarstic aquifer.																	1936-0584	1936-0592				JUN	2017	10	4							UNSP e1835	10.1002/eco.1835								WOS:000403068700013

The effects of catchment and riparian forest quality on stream environmental conditions across a tropical rainforest and oil palm landscape in Malaysian Borneo	ECOHYDROLOGY												Freshwaters provide valuable habitat and important ecosystem services but are threatened worldwide by habitat loss and degradation. In Southeast Asia, rainforest streams are particularly threatened by logging and conversion to oil palm, but we lack information on the impacts of this on freshwater environmental conditions, and the relative importance of catchment versus riparian-scale disturbance. We studied 16 streams in Sabah, Borneo, including old-growth forest, logged forest, and oil palm sites. We assessed forest quality in riparian zones and across the whole catchment and compared it with stream environmental conditions including water quality, structural complexity, and organic inputs. We found that streams with the highest riparian forest quality were nearly 4 degrees C cooler, over 20 cm deeper, had over 40% less sand, greater canopy cover, more stored leaf litter, and wider channels than oil palm streams with the lowest riparian forest quality. Other variables were significantly related to catchment-scale forest quality, with streams in the highest quality forest catchments having 40% more bedrock and 20 times more dead wood, along with higher phosphorus, and lower nitrate-N levels compared to streams with the lowest catchment-scale forest quality. Although riparian buffer strips went some way to protecting waterways, they did not maintain fully forest-like stream conditions. In addition, logged forest streams still showed signs of disturbance 10-15 years after selective logging. Our results suggest that maintenance and restoration of buffer strips can help to protect healthy freshwater ecosystems but logging practices and catchment-scale forest management also need to be considered.

Additionally, the water environment provides habitats for numerous species and plays an important role in hydrological, nutrient, and carbon cycles. Among the existing natural resources on Earth's surface, water is the most extensive as it covers more than 70% of the Earth. To gather a comprehensive understanding of the focus of past, present, and future directions of remote sensing water research, we provide an alternative perspective on water research using moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery by conducting a comparative quantitative and qualitative analysis of research development, current hotspots, and future directions using a bibliometric analysis. Our study suggests that there has been a rapid growth in the scientific outputs of water research using MODIS imagery over the past 15 years compared to other popular satellites around the world. The analysis indicated that Remote Sensing of Environment was the most active journal, and "remote sensing," "imaging science photographic technology," "environmental sciences ecology," "meteorology atmospheric sciences," and "geology" are the top 5 most popular subject categories. The Chinese Academy of Sciences was the most productive institution with a total of 477 papers, and Hu CM (Chinese) was the most productive author with 76 papers. A keyword analysis indicated that "vegetation index," "evapotranspiration," and "phytoplankton" were the most active research topics throughout the study period. In addition, it is predicted that more attention will be paid to research on climate change and phenology in the future. Based on the keyword analysis and in consideration of current environmental problems, more studies should focus on the following three aspects: (1) develop methods suitable for data assimilation to fully explain climate or phenological phenomena at continental or global scales rather than at local scales; (2) accurately predict the effect of global change and human activities on evapotranspiration and the water cycle; and (3) determine the evolutionary process of the water environment (i.e., water quality, macrophytes, cyanobacteria, etc.), ascertaining its dominant factors and driving mechanisms. By focusing on these three aspects, researchers will be able to provide timely monitoring and evaluation of water quality and its response to global change and human activities.

However, water quality deteriorates day by day which makes it urgent to improve the standards of the treatment procedure. Coagulation-flocculation-sedimentation performance of ferric chloride and alum was comparatively investigated for carbofuran treatment in simulated wastewater. Coagulation trails were performed in a jar test at several pH levels and coagulant doses to determine reduction efficiencies of carbofuran degradation and chemical oxygen demand (COD). Effect of carbofuran on proliferation, viability, and direct cytotoxicity was performed using human neuroblastoma cells U-87. Direct toxicity of carbofuran on human mononuclear cells and red blood cells (RBC) was also analyzed. Carbofuran and its derivatives were found to be relatively safe at low concentration (2-5 mu M). However, at slightly higher concentration (8 mu M), a moderate loss in viability and proliferative potential was observed. Taken together, these results suggest that carbofuran appears to be safe at moderate or low concentration with respect to viability of normal human lymphocytes and RBC.

Therefore, information about the transformation and transport of bacteria is crucial for determining their source. In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was applied to simulate fecal coliform bacteria load in the Miyun Reservoir watershed, China. The data for the fecal coliform were obtained at three sampling sites, Chenying (CY), Gubeikou (GBK), and Xiahui (XH). The calibration processes of the fecal coliform were conducted using the CY and GBK sites, and validation was conducted at the XH site. An interval-to-interval approach was designed and incorporated into the processes of fecal coliform calibration and validation. The 95% confidence interval of the predicted values and the 95% confidence interval of measured values were considered during calibration and validation in the interval-to-interval approach. Compared with the traditional point-to-point comparison, this method can improve simulation accuracy. The results indicated that the simulation of fecal coliform using the interval-to-interval approach was reasonable for the watershed. This method could provide a new research direction for future model calibration and validation studies.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				JUN	2017	24	18					15462	15470		10.1007/s11356-017-9101-7								WOS:000404358200025	28512705

In this study, the ammonium-N (NH4+-N), nitrate-N (NO3--N), and total N (TN) concentrations were observed in the stream water and groundwater of two contrasting catchments (named Tuojia and Jianshan) in subtropical central China from 2010 to 2014, to determine the rice agriculture impacts on the hydrographic patterns, and N export characteristics of the catchments. The results suggested that greater amounts of stream flow (523.0 vs. 434.7 mm year(-1)) and base flow (237.6 vs. 142.8 mm year(-1)) were produced in Tuojia than in Jianshan, and a greater base flow contribution to stream flow and higher frequencies of high-base flow days were observed during the fallow season than during the rice-growing season, indicating that intensive rice agriculture strongly influences the catchment hydrographic pattern. Rice agriculture resulted in moderate N pollution in the stream water and groundwater, particularly in Tuojia. Primarily, rice agriculture increased the NH4+-N concentration in the stream water; however, it increased the NO3--N concentrations in the groundwater, suggesting that the different N species in the paddy fields migrated out of the catchments through distinct hydrological pathways. The average TN loading via stream flow and base flow was greater in Tuojia than in Jianshan (1.72 and 0.58 vs. 0.72 and 0.15 kg N ha(-1) month(-1), respectively). Greater TN loading via stream flow was observed during the fallow season in Tuojia and during the rice-growing season in Jianshan, and these different results were most likely a result of the higher base flow contribution to TN loading (33.5 vs. 21.3%) and greater base flow enrichment ratio (1.062 vs. 0.876) in Tuojia than in Jianshan. Therefore, the impact of rice agriculture on catchment eco-hydrological processes should be considered when performing water quality protection and treatment in subtropical central China.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				JUN	2017	24	18					15700	15711		10.1007/s11356-017-9044-z								WOS:000404358200046	28527141

This paper developed a new approach to assess trends and change-points of water quality parameters by integrating locally weighted polynomial regression (LWPR) and segmented regression (SegReg). Firstly, LWPR was used to pretreat the original water quality data into a smoothed time series to represent the long-term trend of water quality. Then, SegReg was used to identify the long-term trends and change-points of the smoothed time series. Finally, statistical tests were applied to determine the significance of the long-term trends and change-points. The efficacy of this approach was validated using a 10-year record of total nitrogen (TN) and chemical oxygen demand (CODMn) from Shanxi Reservoir watershed in eastern China. Results showed that this approach was straightforward and reliable for assessment of long-term trends and change-points on irregular water quality datasets. The reliability was verified by statistical tests and practical considerations for Shanxi Reservoir watershed. The newly developed integrated LWPR-SegReg approach is not only limited to the assessment of trends and change-points of water quality parameters but also has a broad application to other fields with long-term time series records.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				JUN	2017	24	18					15827	15837		10.1007/s11356-017-9188-x								WOS:000404358200057	28534269

In this study, a support vector machine (SVM) was used to predict the bio-indicators of an aquatic ecosystem (i.e., macroinvertebrates, fish, algae communities) in the Taizi River, northeast China. Environmental factors, including physico-chemical (i.e., dissolved oxygen (DO), electricity conductivity (EC), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand in five days (BOD5), total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN)) and hydromorphology parameters (i.e., water quantity, channel change, morphology diversity) were used as the input variables to train and validate the SVM model. The sensitivity of the input variables for the prediction was examined by removing a variable from the SVM model. Results revealed that the SVM model reproduced the variation in bio-indicators of fish and algae communities well, based on the input variables. The sensitivity for the input variables applied in SVM showed that in the Taizi River the most sensitive variables for predicting macroinvertebrate and algae communities were channel change, DO, TN, and TP, while the most sensitive variables for predicting fish communities were DO and BOD5. This study proposed an effective method for predicting biological communities, which will improve freshwater quality and hydromorphology management schemes. The outputs can guide the decision-making process in river basin management, support the prioritization of actions and resource allocation, and help to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions.																	2071-1050					JUN	2017	9	6							892	10.3390/su9060892								WOS:000404133200023

The turbidity of the Imha reservoir is much higher than that of the Andong reservoir. Thus, it is necessary to examine the movement of turbidity between the two reservoirs via the water transfer tunnel. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the water transfer tunnel on the turbidity behavior of the two connecting reservoirs and to further understand the effect of reservoir turbidity distribution as a function of the selective withdrawal depth. This study applied the CE-QUAL-W2, a water quality and 2-dimensional hydrodynamic model, for simulating the hydrodynamic processes of the two reservoirs. Results indicate that, in the Andong reservoir, the turbidity of the released water with the water transfer tunnel was similar to that without the tunnel. However, in the Imha reservoir, the turbidity of the released water with the water transfer tunnel was lower than that without the tunnel. This can be attributed to the higher capacity of the Andong reservoir, which has double the storage of the Imha reservoir. Withdrawal turbidity in the Imha reservoir was investigated using the water transfer tunnel. This study applied three withdrawal selections as elevation (EL.) 141.0 m, 146.5 m, and 152.0 m. The highest withdrawal turbidity resulted in EL. 141.0 m, which indicates that the high turbidity current is located at a vertical depth of about 20-30 m because of the density difference. These results will be helpful for understanding the release and selective withdrawal turbidity behaviors for a water transfer tunnel between two reservoirs.

In accordance with the water environment features of the plain river network area, a cumulative risk assessment system of water environment in the plain river network area was established in this paper, the design process for which could be divided into three step: (1) Control unit divided reasonably was chosen as the basic unit for water quality management. (2) On that basis, according to the characteristics of the plain river network area, the cumulative risk indexes were selected. The index weight is calculated using entropy method and analytic hierarchy process (AHP), which could determine the risk grade of each control unit. (3) The cumulative risk assessment method is coupled to the existing water environment management platform. The platform with a dynamic database can realize the dynamic calculation and visualization of the cumulative risk grade. In this paper, the Zhejiang area of Taihu Basin was selected to be the research target as the typical plain river network area. Thirty-five control units were divided with regional water environment and control section. Taking the data in the year 2011 as example, the proposed cumulative risk assessment method was used to identify the control units in different grades and the results demonstrated that the numbers of high-, medium-, low-and extremely low-risk control units are 13, 12, 5 and 5, respectively. It is necessary to give priority to the high-risk control unit. Therefore, the cumulative risk assessment method based on the control unit provides an essential theoretical basis for reducing the probability of water pollution and reducing the degree of water pollution damage.																	2071-1050					JUN	2017	9	6							975	10.3390/su9060975								WOS:000404133200106

In the future, an increasing frequency of climate extremes, such as droughts, heat waves, and excess moisture, is expected. Past research on the interaction between environment and resources has focused on climate change effects on various sectors, including agricultural production (especially crop production), but research on the effects of climate change using agri-environmental indicators (AEI) of environmental sustainability of agriculture is limited. The aim of this paper was to begin to address this knowledge gap by exploring the effects of future drought and excess moisture on environmental sustainability of agriculture. Methods included the use of a conceptual framework, literature reviews, and an examination of the climate sensitivities of the AEI models. The AEIs assessed were those for the themes of soil and water quality, and farmland management as developed by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. Additional indicators included one for desertification and another for water supply and demand. The study area was the agricultural region of the Canadian Prairie Provinces. We found that the performance of several indicators would likely decrease in a warming climate with more extremes. These indicators with declining performances included risks for soil erosion, soil salinization, desertification, water quality and quantity, and soil contamination. Preliminary trends of other indicators such as farmland management were not clear. AEIs are important tools for measuring climate impacts on the environmental sustainability of agriculture. They also indicate the success of adaptation measures and suggest areas of operational and policy development. Therefore, continued reporting and enhancement of these indicators is recommended.																	2071-1050					JUN	2017	9	6							970	10.3390/su9060970								WOS:000404133200101

But factors influencing their growth are still poorly understood. In the present study the effect of micronutrients, N:P ratio and silica concentration on benthic diatom Synedra sp. grown in fish pond waste water was studied along with nutrient removal efficiency. We have studied nine different treatments, of which addition of micronutrient mixture Nualgi along with adjusted N: P to 6:1 resulted in highest cell density, followed by silicate enrichment, whereas only N:P adjustment and Nualgi addition had no significant effect on diatom growth. At the end of the growth experiment, the N removal efficiencies of treatment groups (50.23%-65.44%) were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of the control group (43.56%), whereas phosphate removal efficiency was significantly higher (P < 0.05) with Nualgi and N:P adjustment (53.37%-68.98%). The silicate consumption was significantly higher in the control group, at 63.87%, than in other experimental groups. These results will give us a new insight into important factors influencing beneficial algae growth and simultaneous nutrient removal from aquaculture waste water.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				JUN	2017	75	12					2777	2783		10.2166/wst.2017.156								WOS:000404557300006	28659517

Advanced phosphorus removal via coagulation, flocculation and microsieve filtration in tertiary treatment	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The applicability of microsieve technology together with coagulation and flocculation for advanced phosphorus removal was investigated. A pilot unit including a microsieve with 10 mu m mesh size was operated continuously with secondary effluent from Ruhleben wastewater treatment plant in Berlin. By applying a pretreatment of 0.07-0.09 mmol/L (as metal) coagulant and 1.5-2 mg/L cationic polymer, total phosphorus values below 80 mu g/L were achieved. Coagulation with polyaluminum chloride (PACl) produced a better effluent quality compared to FeCl3, as less suspended solids and less residual coagulant were found in the microsieve effluent. In addition, the transmittance of UV radiation through the water was improved by using PACl. The produced amount of backwash water was always below 3% (on average 1.6%). Under optimized mixing conditions, polymer doses of 0.6 mg/L were possible without losses in water quality and filtration performance. Microsieving with chemical pretreatment is a viable option for high quality effluent polishing.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				JUN	2017	75	12					2875	2882		10.2166/wst.2017.166								WOS:000404557300016	28659527

PASSAGE OF FIPROLES AND IMIDACLOPRID FROM URBAN PEST CONTROL USES THROUGH WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANTS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Urban pest control insecticides-specifically fipronil and its 4 major degradates (fipronil sulfone, sulfide, desulfinyl, and amide), as well as imidacloprid-were monitored during drought conditions in 8 San Francisco Bay (San Francisco, CA, USA) wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). In influent and effluent, ubiquitous detections were obtained in units of ng/L for fipronil (1388 ng/L), fipronil sulfone (1-28 ng/L), fipronil sulfide (1-5 ng/L), and imidacloprid (58-306 ng/L). Partitioning was also investigated; in influent, 100% of imidacloprid and 62 +/- 9% of total fiproles (fipronil and degradates) were present in the dissolved state, with the balance being bound to filter-removable particulates. Targeted insecticides persisted during wastewater treatment, regardless of treatment technology utilized (imidacloprid: 93 +/- 17%; total fiproles: 65 +/- 11% remaining), with partitioning into sludge (3.7-151.1 mg/kg dry wt as fipronil) accounting for minor losses of total fiproles entering WWTPs. The load of total fiproles was fairly consistent across the facilities but fiprole speciation varied. This first regional study on fiprole and imidacloprid occurrences in raw and treated California sewage revealed ubiquity and marked persistence to conventional treatment of both phenylpyrazole and neonicotinoid compounds. Flea and tick control agents for pets are identified as potential sources of pesticides in sewage meriting further investigation and inclusion in chemical-specific risk assessments.

EXPOSURE TO CHLORANTRANILIPROLE AFFECTS THE ENERGY METABOLISM OF THE CADDISFLY SERICOSTOMA VITTATUM	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Caddisflies have been included in ecotoxicological studies because of their sensitivity and ecological relevance. The present study aimed to assess the sublethal effects of an anthranilic diamide insecticide, chlorantraniliprole (CAP), to Sericostoma vittatum. Used worldwide, CAP is a persistent compound that has been found in surface waters at concentrations from 0.1 mu g/L to 9.7 mu g/L. It targets the ryanodine receptors, and the present ecotoxicological assessment focused on biomarkers related to neurotransmission, biotransformation, oxidative stress damage, and endpoints related to energy processing (feeding, energy reserves, and cellular metabolism). Six days of exposure trials revealed that feeding activity was significantly decreased in S. vittatum larvae exposed to 0.9 mu g/L CAP. Concomitantly, a reduction in cellular metabolism and a significant decrease in protein content were also observed in caddisfly larvae exposed to CAP, suggesting metabolic depression. The results show that sublethal concentrations of CAP can cause detrimental sublethal effects on S. vittatum total glutathione content at concentrations as low as 0.2 mg/L. Bioenergetics can be used to assess physiological effects of contaminants, and the present results show that exposure to low, environmentally relevant, concentrations of CAP alter energy acquisition and metabolism in nontarget aquatic insects with potential population level effects.

J	Wei, YN; Fan, W; Wang, W; Deng, LS				Wei, Ya-ni; Fan, Wen; Wang, Wei; Deng, Longsheng			Identification of nitrate pollution sources of groundwater and analysis of potential pollution paths in loess regions: a case study in Tongchuan region, China	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Groundwater is the essential and predominant source of drinking and irrigation water supplies in most arid and semiarid regions, particularly in Loess Plateau of China. The threat to groundwater quality by nitrate pollution has always been of considerable concern in loess regions. In this paper, correspondence analysis, stoichiometric analysis, ratios of major ions and some qualitative analysis are employed to discuss the spatial variability of nitrate (NO3-), identification of NO3- pollution sources and its potential pollution paths based on 112 water samples in Tongchuan region on the middle edge of Loess Plateau of China. Results indicate that the NO3- concentrations ranged from 0.25 to 173 mg/L, 20.54% of water samples exceeded the Standards for Drinking Water Quality from China (<= 44 mg/L), and 15.18% of samples exceeded the Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality from World Health Organization (<= 50 mg/L); the water samples with high NO3- concentrations primarily concentrated in river valleys, and the types were mainly pore waters and individual surface waters. Sewage or manure from livestock effluent was the primary sources of NO3- in some surface waters, pore water samples with high NO3- were closely related to agricultural input or a mixing process. Groundwater recharges from surface water and vertical infiltration in river valleys with shallow groundwater depth were considered as the potential pollution paths for NO3- ions in the study area based on nitrate nitrogen distribution in soil profile. Driven by concentration difference and local seepage system, these NO3- ions diffused around and groundwater buried in great depth was consequently polluted. Therefore, river valleys should be listed as the prior protection areas in loess regions; in addition, the time lag between land use changes and groundwater quality response should also be paid attention to in nitrate pollution prevention, particularly in the thick unsaturated zones.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JUN	2017	76	12							423	10.1007/s12665-017-6756-9								WOS:000404390900016

A Tale of Ecology, Exposure, Purification and Clinical Relevance	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH												Microbiological drinking water safety is traditionally monitored mainly by bacterial parameters that indicate faecal contamination. These parameters correlate with gastro-intestinal illness, despite the fact that viral agents, resulting from faecal contamination, are usually the cause. This leaves behind microbes that can cause illness other than gastro-intestinal and several emerging pathogens, disregarding non-endemic microbial contaminants and those with recent pathogenic activity reported. This white paper focuses on one group of contaminants known to cause allergies, opportunistic infections and intoxications: Fungi. It presents a review on their occurrence, ecology and physiology. Additionally, factors contributing to their presence in water distribution systems, as well as their effect on water quality are discussed. Presence of opportunistic and pathogenic fungi in drinking water can pose a health risk to consumers due to daily contact with water, via several exposure points, such as drinking and showering. The clinical relevance and influence on human health of the most common fungal contaminants in drinking water is discussed. Our goal with this paper is to place fungal contaminants on the roadmap of evidence based and emerging threats for drinking water quality safety regulations.

The Fate of Pollutants in Porous Asphalt Pavements, Laboratory Experiments to Investigate Their Potential to Impact Environmental Health	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH												Pervious Paving Systems (PPS) are part of a sustainable approach to drainage in which excess surface water is encouraged to infiltrate through their structure, during which potentially toxic elements, such as metals and hydrocarbons are treated by biodegradation and physical entrapment and storage. However, it is not known where in the PPS structure these contaminants accumulate, which has implications for environmental health, particularly during maintenance, as well as consequences for the recycling of material from the PPS at the end-of-life. A 1 m3 porous asphalt (PA) PPS test rig was monitored for 38 months after monthly additions of road sediment (RS) (367.5 g in total) and unused oil (430 mL in total), characteristic of urban loadings, were applied. Using a rainfall simulator, a typical UK rainfall rate of 15 mm/h was used to investigate its efficiency in dealing with contamination. Water quality of the effluent discharged from the rig was found to be suitable for discharge to most environments. On completion of the monitoring, a core was taken down through its surface, and samples of sediment and aggregate were taken. Analysis showed that most of the sediment remained in the surface course, with metal levels lower than the original RS, but higher than clean, unused aggregate or PA. However, even extrapolating these concentrations to 20 years' worth of in-service use (the projected life of PPS) did not suggest their accumulation would present an environmental pollution risk when carrying out maintenance of the pavement and also indicates that the material could be recycled at end-of-life.

Drivers of Microbial Risk for Direct Potable Reuse and de Facto Reuse Treatment Schemes: The Impacts of Source Water Quality and Blending	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH												Although reclaimed water for potable applications has many potential benefits, it poses concerns for chemical and microbial risks to consumers. We present a quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) Monte Carlo framework to compare a de facto water reuse scenario (treated wastewater-impacted surface water) with four hypothetical Direct Potable Reuse (DPR) scenarios for Norovirus, Cryptosporidium, and Salmonella. Consumer microbial risks of surface source water quality (impacted by 0-100% treated wastewater effluent) were assessed. Additionally, we assessed risks for different blending ratios (0-100% surface water blended into advanced-treated DPR water) when source surface water consisted of 50% wastewater effluent. De facto reuse risks exceeded the yearly 10 4 infections risk benchmark while all modeled DPR risks were significantly lower. Contamination with 1% or more wastewater effluent in the source water, and blending 1% or more wastewater-impacted surface water into the advanced-treated DPR water drove the risk closer to the 10(-4) benchmark. We demonstrate that de facto reuse by itself, or as an input into DPR, drives microbial risks more so than the advanced-treated DPR water. When applied using location-specific inputs, this framework can contribute to project design and public awareness campaigns to build legitimacy for DPR.																	1660-4601					JUN	2017	14	6							635	10.3390/ijerph14060635								WOS:000404107600083

The detection of other microorganisms is not required. The aim of this study is to determine the bacteriological quality of groundwater used for irrigation and the occurrence of enteric viruses (Norovirus, Enterovirus, Rotavirus, Hepatovirus A), and to compare the presence of viruses with the fecal bacteria indicators. A total of 182 wells was analyzed. Widespread fecal contamination of Apulian aquifers was detected (141 wells; 77.5%) by the presence of fecal bacteria (i.e., E. coli, Salmonella, total coliforms, and enterococci). Considering bacteria included in Ministerial Decree No. 185, the water from 35 (19.2%) wells was unsuitable for irrigation purposes. Among 147 wells with water considered suitable, Norovirus, Rotavirus, and Enterovirus were detected in 23 (15.6%) wells. No Hepatovirus A was isolated. Consequently, 58 wells (31.9%) posed a potential infectious risk for irrigation use. This study revealed the inadequacy of fecal bacteria indicators to predict the occurrence of viruses in groundwater and it is the first in Italy to describe the presence of human rotaviruses in well water used for irrigation.

A Three-Year Follow-Up Study of Antibiotic and Metal Residues, Antibiotic Resistance and Resistance Genes, Focusing on Kshipra-A River Associated with Holy Religious Mass-Bathing in India: Protocol Paper	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH												Background: Antibiotic resistance (ABR) is one of the major health emergencies for global society. Little is known about the ABR of environmental bacteria and therefore it is important to understand ABR reservoirs in the environment and their potential impact on health. Method/ Design: Quantitative and qualitative data will be collected during a 3-year follow-up study of a river associated with religious mass-bathing in Central India. Surface-water and sediment samples will be collected from seven locations at regular intervals for 3 years during religious mass-bathing and in absence of it to monitor water-quality, antibiotic residues, resistant bacteria, antibiotic resistance genes and metals. Approval has been obtained from the Ethics Committee of R.D. Gardi Medical College, Ujjain, India (No. 2013/07/17-311). Results: The results will address the issue of antibiotic residues and antibiotic resistance with a focus on a river environment in India within a typical socio-behavioural context of religious mass-bathing. It will enhance our understanding about the relationship between antibiotic residue levels, water-quality, heavy metals and antibiotic resistance patterns in Escherichia coli isolated from river-water and sediment, and seasonal differences that are associated with religious mass-bathing. We will also document, identify and clarify the genetic differences/similarities relating to phenotypic antibiotic resistance in bacteria in rivers during religious mass-bathing or during periods when there is no mass-bathing.																	1660-4601					JUN	2017	14	6							574	10.3390/ijerph14060574								WOS:000404107600022

Polyaluminum chloride (PACl) was used as coagulant, and a hydrophilic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) submerged hollow fiber microfiltration membrane was employed. The influences of trans-membrane pressure (TMP), zeta potential (ZP) of the suspended particles in raw water, and KMnO4 dosing on water flux and the removal of turbidity and organic matter were systematically investigated. Continuous bench-scale experiments showed that the permeate quality of the MCR satisfied the requirement for a centralized water supply, according to the Standards for Drinking Water Quality of China (GB 5749-2006), as evaluated by turbidity (<1 NTU) and total organic carbon (TOC) (<5 mg/L) measurements. Besides water flux, the removal of turbidity, TOC and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the raw water also increased with increasing TMP in the range of 0.01-0.05 MPa. High ZP induced by PACl, such as 5-9 mV, led to an increase in the number of fine and total particles in the MCR, and consequently caused serious membrane fouling and high permeate turbidity. However, the removal of TOC and DOC increased with increasing ZP. A slightly positive ZP, such as 1-2 mV, corresponding to charge neutralization coagulation, was favorable for membrane fouling control. Moreover, dosing with KMnO4 could further improve the removal of turbidity and DOC, thereby mitigating membrane fouling. The results are helpful for the application of the MCR in producing drinking water and also beneficial to the research and application of other coagulation and membrane separation hybrid processes.

Spatiotemporal variations of water quality and their inherent constraints make it very complex. This study explored a data-based method for short-term water quality forecasting. Prediction of water quality indicators including dissolved oxygen, chemical oxygen demand by KMnO4 and ammonia nitrogen using support vector machine was taken as inputs of the particle swarm algorithm based optimal wavelet neural network to forecast the whole status index of water quality. Gubeikou monitoring section of Miyun reservoir in Beijing, China was taken as the study case to examine effectiveness of this approach. The experiment results also revealed that the proposed model has advantages of stability and time reduction in comparison with other data-driven models including traditional BP neural network model, wavelet neural network model and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree model.

Influence of Local, Landscape, and Regional Variables on Sedge and Marsh Wren Occurrence in Great Lakes Coastal Wetlands	WETLANDS												We determined the influence of habitat, landscape, geographic, and climate variables on Sedge Wren (Cistothorus platensis) and Marsh Wren (C. palustris) occurrence in 840 coastal wetland survey points throughout the Great Lakes. Variables included surrounding land use and configuration out to 2000 m; latitude; longitude; temperature; precipitation; and vegetation characteristics within 100 m. Classification trees predicted Sedge Wren occurrence at points in the western Great Lakes with < 11 km of roads within 1000 m. Emergent herbaceous wetland within 500 m, woody wetland within various distances, and sedge within 100 m were also positively associated with Sedge Wren occurrence. Marsh Wren occurrence was predicted at points in the southern Great Lakes with < 42% developed land within 500 m. Emergent herbaceous wetland within 500 m, cropland within various distances, and cattail within 100 m were also positively associated with Marsh Wren occurrence. Our results suggest limiting development around wetlands is important for conserving these bird species throughout Great Lakes coastal wetlands. Landscape-scale land cover variables are easily obtainable and significantly increase our ability to predict occurrence of these species across a broad geographic scale.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				JUN	2017	37	3					447	459		10.1007/s13157-017-0881-9								WOS:000403573000005

The Bahr El-Baqar drain in Sharqia, Egypt, is one of the main drains in the Nile Delta that receives various types of wastewater. Monitoring and assessing the drain's water quality were achieved by collecting georeferenced water samples along the drain during the 2015 summer and winter cropping seasons. Chemical, microbial, and parasitic analyses were performed. Additionally, surface soil samples irrigated with the drain water were gathered from the adjacent area to quantify the main physicochemical properties. Water analysis results revealed that the concentrations of most trace elements were within international standards and the Egyptian allowable levels forTWWreuse in agriculture. Oxygen depletion was observed for all samples collected. The microbial analysis indicated that there was fecal coliform contamination (> 1000 per 100 mL) in the summer and winter samples. Concentrations of PO4 and SO4 were within the permissible level for irrigation use, whereas NH4, NO3, and MoO4 concentrations were higher than the recommended values for reusing Bahr El-Baqar water in irrigation. Based on the soil analysis results, Cd contamination was observed, whereas the Pb concentration in soils was slightly higher than its normal range. Mixing Bahr El-Baqar water with freshwater and implementing appropriate on-farm treatment before the reuse are recommended as a prerequisite for reusing Bahr El-Baqar water for irrigation. Bio-diesel fuel and energy oil crops are recommended for the studied region.

Upstream the mine, groundwaters were more acid and some elements and compounds, such as iron, aluminum, and sulfate, were in higher concentration, possibly because of acid mine drainage (AMD) generation in tailing pit. U-238 and U-234 activity concentrations exceeded the standards proposed by the World Health Organization in two sampling periods in effluent samples and in some groundwater samples, indicating that waters from this aquifer system were unhealthy for human consumption. Uranium isotopes were more elevated in groundwaters in the rainy month probably because of a higher leaching and transport rate of this element from rocks/tailings pit to waters. The average radon activity concentration in groundwater was higher than in surface waters and effluents in both periods studied, possibly due to the enhanced presence of uranium and radium in the aquifer rocks that would favor the radon accumulation and entrapment. The effects of the mining activities on the groundwater quality were displayed in terms of activity ratios (U-234/U-238, Ra-226/U-238), which showed different behaviors upstream the mine area relatively to areas downstream the mine.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				JUN	2017	228	6							207	10.1007/s11270-017-3381-x								WOS:000403574100011

All of these sources emit pathogens and fecal indicator bacteria into the surface water, which the EU Bathing Water Directive addresses by giving threshold values for the indicators Escherichia coli and intestinal enterococci. This study presents a comparison between 21 scenarios of costs for processes that reduce the load of Escherichia coli and intestinal enterococci into the Ruhr River during and shortly after rain events. The methods examined include UV irradiation for WWTPs, integrated sewer management and treatment of CSOs with vertical flow constructed wetlands or performic acid. For pollution by diffuse overland flow, we evaluated organizational measures. The treatment of only diffuse pollution shows merely a slight effect on intestinal enterococci, but none on Escherichia coli and hence, was not considered further. Combining all three CSO reduction methods with the irradiation of WWTP effluent provides the best simulation results in terms of reducing both indicator bacteria.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				JUN	2017	75	11					2659	2668		10.2166/wst.2017.141								WOS:000403486600019	28617286

Compared with the control pond, the experiment pond had better water quality as indicated by 64.2% reduction in chlorophyll a, and 81.1% reduction in algal cells. The chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus concentration were reduced by 55.1%, 57.5%, and 50.8%, respectively. The treatment efficiency is mainly due to the growth control of Microcystis (i.e. cell reduction of 96.4%). The gas vesicles collapsing because of the water pressure was suggested to be the mechanism for Microcystis suppression by the deep well circulation treatment. The Microcystis lost its buoyancy after gas vesicles collapsed and it settled to the bottom of the aquaculture pond. As a result, the algae reproduction was suppressed because algae could only grow in the area with enough sunlight (i.e. water depth less than 1 m).																	0273-1223	1996-9732				JUN	2017	75	11					2692	2701		10.2166/wst.2017.159								WOS:000403486600022	28617289

Micro-zooplankton grazing as a means of fecal bacteria removal in stormwater BMPs	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												A priority for environmental managers is control of stormwater runoff pollution, especially fecal microbial pollution. This research was designed to determine if fecal bacterial grazing by micro-zooplankton is a significant control on fecal bacteria in aquatic best management practices (BMPs); if grazing differs between a wet detention pond and a constructed wetland; and if environmental factors enhance grazing. Both 3-day grazing tests and 24-h dilution assays were used to determine grazing differences between the two types of BMP. Micro-zooplankton grazing was a stronger bacteria removal mechanism in stormwater wetlands rich in aquatic vegetation compared to a standard wet detention pond, although grazing was important in detention ponds as well. Our experiments indicated that the majority of grazers that fed on fecal bacteria were <20 mu m in size. Grazing rates were positively correlated with fecal coliform abundance and increased water temperatures. Enumeration of grazers demonstrated that protozoans were significantly more abundant among wetland vegetation than in open water, and open wetland waters contained more flagellates and dinoflagellates than open wet detention pond waters. Grazing on fecal bacteria in BMPs is enhanced by aquatic vegetation, and grazing in aquatic BMPs in warmer climates should be greater than in cooler climates.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				JUN	2017	75	11					2702	2715		10.2166/wst.2017.170								WOS:000403486600023	28617290

Such adverse effects are of particular concern in permanently stratified meromictic lakes. Yet little is known about when and how meromixis and hypoxia became established (or vanished) prior to anthropogenic impacts, or how human activities such as deforestation, erosion and nutrient cycling affected the mixing regimes of lakes. We used calibrated hyperspectral imaging (HSI) data in the visible and near infrared range from a fresh, varved sediment core taken in Lake Jaczno, NE Poland, to map sedimentary pigments at very high resolution (sub-varve scale) over the past 1700 years. HSI-inferred bacteriopheophytin a (bphe a, produced by anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria) serves as a proxy for meromixis, whereas HSI-inferred green pigments (chlorophyll a and diagenetic products) can be used as estimators of aquatic productivity. Meromixis was established and vanished long before significant human disturbance in the catchment was observed in the late eleventh century AD. Under pre-anthropogenic conditions, however, meromixis was interrupted frequently, and the lake mixing regime flickered between dimixis and meromixis. During two periods with intense deforestation and soil erosion in the catchment, characterised by sedimentary facies rich in clay and charcoal (AD 1070-1255 and AD 1670-1710), the lake was mostly dimictic and better oxygenated than in periods with relative stability and a presumably closed forest around the lake, i.e. without human disturbances. After ca. AD 1960, meromixis became established quasi-permanently as a result of eutrophication. The persistent meromixis of the last similar to 60 years is unusual with respect to the record of the last 1700 years.

Planning and establishment principles for constructed wetlands and riparian buffer zones in agricultural catchments	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												In a great number of scientific articles on water quality improvement using constructed wetlands (CW) and riparian buffers zones (RBZ) at catchment scale, contradictory results are found. In most cases this is due to underestimating or even ignoring the role of the hydrological factor for water quality improvement. It has often resulted in biased estimates of buffering systems' efficiency at catchment scale and, consequently, has caused planning and establishment failures, mistakes and inconsistencies in legislative acts and finally, it has influenced stakeholder's willingness to support these eco-technological measures. In this paper we present a short but critical overview of the potential of CWs and RBZs in water quality improvement at catchment scale and highlight the most important aspects to be considered when planning, establishing and managing these systems.

Recovering hydromorphological functionality to improve natural purification capacity of a highly human-modified wetland	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING					9th International Meeting of the European-Chapter of the Society-of-Wetland-Scientists (SWS) on Wetlands Biodiversity and Services - Tools for Socio-Ecological Development held Jointly with the 6th Conference of the European-Pond-Conservation-Network	SEP 14-18, 2014	Huesca, SPAIN	Soc Wetland Scientists, European Chapter, European Pond Conservat Network				Modification of the hydrological regime by human actions can reduce the capacity of wetlands to improve water quality. For the first time, a study was conducted of the inherent pollution attenuation capacity of wetlands associated with the highly regulated Spanish Tagus River. We determined the natural purification capacity of a floodplain where irrigated agriculture predominates and hydraulic connection with the river is virtually nonexistent. To this end, continuous hydrophysical measurements and sediment and water samples were taken during the period extending from April 2013 to March 2014. A multi-parametric dataset including hydraulic, physico-chemical, bacterial and macroinvertebrate indicators was collected from ten piezometers located within a meander, together with two additional sampling points in the river. Sampling was performed monthly to measure hydraulic and physico-chemical parameters and quarterly for bacteria and macroinvertebrates. The data enabled us to implement different but complementary methodological approaches to characterize denitrification. Specifically, we performed: (i) end-member mixing analysis (EMMA); (ii) macroinvertebrate characterization; (iii) denitrification potential analysis; (iv) bacterial assemblage structure analysis; and (v) hydrological modeling of the current and different future management scenarios. All the approaches except EMMA indicated the same conclusion: denitrification is almost nonexistent due to the fact that the study site does not present the hydric soil and oxygen-limited conditions required to enable denitrification. The EMMA analysis showed that theoretical nitrate concentrations were lower than expected in some areas during the summer months (e.g. Delta NO3 = -41 in August 2013), which may have been because irrigation intensity was spatiotemporal variable at the study site. Our results show that floodplain denitrification has been drastically reduced due to the suppression of flood pulses. In this context, restoration of the hydrological regime in riverine wetlands would lead to the decay of nitrates whose dynamic evolution increases with flooding, as scenarios tested by the MOHID hydro-biogeochemical model have demonstrated.

Assessment of the denitrification process in alluvial wetlands at floodplain scale using the SWAT model	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING					9th International Meeting of the European-Chapter of the Society-of-Wetland-Scientists (SWS) on Wetlands Biodiversity and Services - Tools for Socio-Ecological Development held Jointly with the 6th Conference of the European-Pond-Conservation-Network	SEP 14-18, 2014	Huesca, SPAIN	Soc Wetland Scientists, European Chapter, European Pond Conservat Network				As alluvial plains support intensive agricultural activities, they often suffer from groundwater nitrate pollution. Denitrification is recognised as an important process in nitrate pollution control in riparian zones. In shallow aquifer zones influenced by recharged surface water, denitrification efficiently attenuates nitrate in groundwater as well, and the exchange between surface water and groundwater has a significant impact on the occurrence of denitrification. Denitrification is simulated in numerous models, however most models do not take into account the denitrification occurring in shallow aquifers or the influence of recharge surface water in the alluvial aquifer with organic carbon and bacteria to activate denitrification. In this study, a new module was developed that represents the occurrence of denitrification in the shallow aquifer of alluvial floodplains. Nitrate inputs in the shallow aquifer caused by the recharged river water through both lateral (river bank) and vertical (surface) infiltration and the influence of flooding on nitrate leaching were added to the Soil and Water Assessment Tool - Landscape Unit Darcy (SWAT-LUD) model. The influences of both dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) on denitrification were evaluated. The modified model was applied on an experimental site located in the floodplain of the Garonne River (southwest France). Results showed that the modified SWAT-LUD model was able to simulate the aquifer nitrate concentration in the near-bank zone (riparian zone) satisfactorily. The near-bank zone in the floodplain played the most important role in attenuating nitrate through denitrification with an annual denitrification rate of around 130 kg N-NO(3)(-)ha(-1)y(-1), representing about 40% of the nitrate input in this area. POC was more important than DOC in the denitrification process, especially in the near-bank zone where 98% of the nitrate was attenuated through POC consumption. Relationships between denitrification rates, groundwater levels and total input nitrate masses in the near-bank zone were determined. The results illustrated that groundwater levels were positively related to the denitrification rates in the near-bank zone. The absolute denitrification rate increased as the nitrate content increased, but the relative consumption rate by denitrification decreased. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Samples were taken during different periods of the year during 2011-2014 to evaluate the influence of agricultural activities during the two years following their completion. Nitrate concentration was significantly higher in the in-stream wetlands, showing a clear dilution effect caused by the inputs of the irrigation return flows. The patterns followed by the first-order nitrate removal rate constant were different for in-stream and off-stream wetlands and during irrigation and non-irrigation seasons. During non-irrigation seasons, the nitrate outflowing concentration was found to be negatively correlated (p < 0.01) to the first-order nitrate removal rate constant for in-stream wetlands, indicating that high nitrate inputs may restrict the effectiveness of the wetlands. Temperature and dissolved oxygen were also found to significantly influence the performance of off-stream wetlands during non-irrigation seasons, but only dissolved oxygen promoted the nitrate removal during the irrigation period, indicating the influence of the seasonal factor on nitrate and wetlands dynamics. The results of this study showed that although a longer time is required to achieve optimal wetland development, wetlands can be used as buffer zones that effectively remove nitrates. This study emphasizes the influence of the agricultural seasonality of the factors affecting nitrate removal in wetlands, expanding the information provided by similar studies and validating a model that is applicable to a wide range of agricultural, hydrological and seasonal conditions.

Riparian forest is thus a green infrastructure for biodiversity conservation. However, a long history of landscape alteration now calls for maintenance and restoration by ecological engineering. This study evaluates management guidelines advocating constant vs. variable width of riparian forest protected zones in managed landscapes. In naturally dynamic forests, stands with gap-phase dynamic along streams often provide a network of habitats with a high degree of continuity in tree canopy cover and dead wood for biodiversity conservation and delivery of ecosystem services including water purification. Based on the observation that tall herb sites indicate a potential for temporally continuous forest cover, we tested three null hypotheses. Tall herb sites ( 1) are equally common in the riparian zone and in the surrounding forest landscape; ( 2) have the same width on both sides of a stream; and ( 3) their widths are independent of the width of the adjacent stream. We described the ground vegetation in transects along and perpendicular to streams, and in the surrounding landscape, in six 3rd stream order catchment located in Sweden, Lithuania and the Komi Republic of Russia. The results showed that tall herb sites were 21-27 times more common along streams compared to in the rest of the landscape, the width of tall herb sites varied considerably along streams, and it was independent of the width of the adjacent stream. This study suggests that rather than fixed-width guidelines for riparian set-asides, to support cost-efficient maintenance of riparian forest, local site conditions should be used as guide for planning, maintenance and engineering of riparian ecotones. Because tall herb forest sites were historically cleared for agricultural purposes, the potential natural amount of riparian forest is severely underestimated. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In recent years, the water quality of this reservoir has been seriously threatened by eutrophication resulting from increased nonpoint source pollution loads. In this study, we used a Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to calculate pollution loads (total nitrogen [TN] and total phosphorus [TP]) in the area surrounding the Yuqiao Reservoir. We then established a coupled two-dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model that was used to simulate temporal and spatial distributions of TN and TP from June to September 2008. SWAT model results provided water quality boundary conditions for the coupled two-dimensional model. Results indicated that Liu Xiangying and Wu Baihu were the main TN inlets, and the average TN concentration in the reservoir was highest in September (3.74 mg/L). Meanwhile, the TP concentration in the eastern portion of the Yuqiao Reservoir was higher than that in the west, and the average TP concentration peaked in August (1.56 mg/L).

A literature search was conducted in order to review: (1) methods used for investigating the effects of public drinking water on GI; (2) evidence of possible dose-response relationship between sporadic GI and drinking water consumption; and (3) association between sporadic GI and factors affecting drinking water quality. Seventy-four articles were selected, key findings and information gaps were identified. In-home intervention studies have only been conducted in areas using surface water sources and intervention studies in communities supplied by ground water are therefore needed. Community-wide intervention studies may constitute a cost-effective alternative to in-home intervention studies. Proxy data that correlate with GI in the community can be used for detecting changes in the incidence of GI. Proxy data can, however, not be used for measuring the prevalence of illness. Local conditions affecting water safety may vary greatly, making direct comparisons between studies difficult unless sufficient knowledge about these conditions is acquired. Drinking water in high-income countries contributes to endemic levels of GI and there are public health benefits for further improvements of drinking water safety.

Comparison of MI, Chromocult (R) coliform, and Compass CC chromogenic culture-based methods to detect Escherichia coli and total coliforms in water using 16S rRNA sequencing for colony identification	JOURNAL OF WATER AND HEALTH												The MI, Chromocult (R) coliform, and Compass CC chromogenic culture-based methods used to assess water quality by the detection of Escherichia coli and total coliforms were compared in terms of their specificity and sensitivity, using 16S rRNA sequencing for colony identification. A sewage water sample was divided in 2-mu L subsamples for testing by all three culture-based methods. All growing colonies were harvested and subjected to 16S rRNA sequencing. Test results showed that all E. coli colonies were correctly identified by all three methods, for a specificity and a sensitivity of 100%. However, for the total coliform detection, the MI agar, Chromocult (R) coliform agar, and Compass CC agar were specific for only 69.2% (9/13), 47.2% (25/53), and 40.5% (17/42), whereas sensitive for 97.8% (45/46), 97.5% (39/40), and 85.7% (24/28), respectively. Thus, given the low level of specificity of these methods for the detection of total coliforms, confirming the identity of total coliform colonies could help to take public health decisions, in particular for cities connected to a public drinking water distribution system since the growth of few putative total coliform colonies on chromogenic agar is problematic and can lead to unnecessary and costly boiling notices from public health authorities.																	1477-8920					JUN	2017	15	3					353	359		10.2166/wh.2017.174								WOS:000403110200003	28598339

In order to assess the potential risk for legionellosis, we analyzed Legionella contamination of water distribution systems in 36 recreational facilities equipped with swimming pools. One hundred and sixty water samples were analyzed from shower heads or taps located in locker rooms or in bathrooms. By culture method and polymerase chain reaction, 41/160 samples were positive for Legionella from 12/36 recreational centers. Hotels (57.1%) and sports centers (41.2%) were the most contaminated. L. pneumophila serotypes 2-14 (25/41) were more frequently found than serotype 1 (10/41). Samples at temperature >= 30 degrees C were more frequently positive than samples at temperature <30 degrees C (n = 39 vs n = 2, p < 0.00001). The presence of L. pneumophila was investigated by comparison with heterotrophic plate count (HPC), an indicator of water quality. The presence of L. pneumophila was associated more frequently with high and intermediate HPC load at 37 degrees C, therefore should be considered a potential source when HPC at 37 degrees C is >10 CFU/mL. Maintenance, good hygiene practices, interventions on the hydraulic system and regular controls must be implemented to minimize exposure to L. pneumophila infection risk.																	1477-8920					JUN	2017	15	3					402	409		10.2166/wh.2017.296								WOS:000403110200008	28598344

Respondents with lower levels of environmental concern, education levels, and lower organoleptic perceptions were most likely to perceive health risks from tap water consumption, and were most likely to use bottled water. Income, age, and organoleptic perceptions were predictors of water filter use among respondents. Clean water for recreational purposes was not found to be significant with either of these models. Our results demonstrate that bottle use and filter use are explained differently. We argue that more education and better communication about local tap water quality would decrease the use of bottled water. We demonstrate that household filters could be used as an alternative to bottled water.																	1477-8920					JUN	2017	15	3					451	461		10.2166/wh.2017.219								WOS:000403110200013	28598349

Assessment of water quality using multivariate techniques in River Sosiani, Kenya	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Multivariate techniques can infer intrinsic characteristics of complex data by generating correlation, similarity, dissimilarity, and covariance vector matrix to ascertain their relationships. The study evaluated the effect of anthropogenic activities by analyzing selected physicochemical water quality parameters (WQP) as indicators of pollution in River Sosiani, located in western Kenya, at six stations from August 2012 to February 2013 (Aug-Oct = wet season, Nov-Feb = Dry season). Temperature, pH, Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), conductivity, and Dissolved Oxygen (DO) were measured in situ while Total Phosphorus (TP), Total Organic Nitrogen (TON), and Biologial Oxygen Demand (BOD) were measured in vitro using standard methods. Except for DO and pH, the other variables were increasing in concentration downstream. Cluster analysis grouped stations with municipal discharge, to be the most distant linked to other stations in both seasons. Multidimensional scaling had four categories of stations with similar WQP: before, after, and wet and dry seasons. Principal component analysis with (60.5 and 26.1% for components 1 and 2) evaluated TON and TP as key pollutants in both seasons. Factor analysis with varifactor two at 35.3 and 27.1% variance in wet and dry seasons, respectively, had strong absolute factor loading of BOD (wet 0.878, dry 0.915) and TP (wet 0.839, dry 0.709) inferring sites with organic pollution also had nutrient pollution. Assessment of pollution with the selected WQP identified two major effects: nutrient and organic. Additional variables may identify other pollutants along the river. Multiple pollution effects, changing environment, and intrinsic characteristics of aquatic ecosystems generate complex data which are better assessed with multivariate techniques.

Management of rainwater harvesting and its impact on the health of people in the Middle East: case study from Yatta town, Palestine	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Water-related diseases are a primary problem in Palestine where many residents revert to harvested rainwater as their primary water source due to water shortages within the area. From an environmental engineering perspective, it is already well known that certain situations (e.g., cross contamination) reduce drinking water quality and ultimately cause diseases in a population. In this study, we investigated the social practices and situations that may lead to lower disease occurrence. Towards this goal, we surveyed 382 residents in Yatta to collect data on the water-related diseases that they experienced and the specific situations that might affect the disease occurrences such as the residents' practices (i) for maintaining a high quality of cistern water, (ii) for maintaining the environment around the cistern, and (iii) for managing the wastewater. In addition, we measured the physicochemical and microbiological parameters in cisterns to support the qualitative survey data. The measured parameters, including turbidity, salinity, free available chlorine, total Coliforms, and fecal Coliforms, were above Palestinian Standard Institution (PSI) and World Health Organization (WHO) guideline levels, suggesting a potential infectious hazard. The poor quality of the water was also observed by residents based on change in taste and by visually noting floating impurities, turbidity, and green coloration. Survey results showed that observations of the poor quality in cisterns and surrounding environment had statistically significant correlation with most of the water-related diseases. Additionally, frequently emptying the septic tank contributes to improving the observed water qualities. Therefore, residents should be encouraged to continue to observe the water quality in the cistern, improve the surrounding environment of cistern, and empty their septic tank frequently, to keep the water diseases away from their households.

Hydrological connectivity and Burkholderia pseudomallei prevalence in wetland environments: investigating rice-farming community's risk of exposure to melioidosis in North-East Thailand	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												In our analysis of 136 water samples from wetland environments (rice paddies, natural wetland sites, man-made water bodies) in rural areas of North-East Thailand, Burkholderia pseudomallei was most prevalent in rice paddies (15 of the 30 positive sites). The high prevalence in the water of rice fields is indicative of the inherent vulnerability of farmers in rural agricultural areas in this area of Thailand and likely other locations in the tropics. Nearly all B. pseudomallei-positive sites were found within the vicinity of a large wetland associated with the Chi River, in the month of July 2014. Positive samples were found in water ranging in pH from 5.9 to 8.7, salinity ranging from 0.04 to 1.58 ppt, nitrate ranging from 0 to 10.8 ppm, and iron ranging from 0.003 to 1.519 ppm. Of these variables, only iron content was statistically higher in B. pseudomallei-positive versus B. pseudomallei-negative sites, suggesting that increasing concentrations of iron may encourage the growth of this bacterium, which is responsible for melioidosis. Our results, when combined with data from other published studies, support the notion that B. pseudomallei can exist in a wide range of environmental conditions. Thus, we argue that health safety education is a more appropriate means of addressing farmer vulnerability than chemical or physical alterations to fields at large scales. Further, it may be important to investigate melioidosis through transdisciplinary approaches that consider the complex social and ecological contexts in which the disease occurs.

Surface water samples were collected from 11 different stations from 0 to 10 km offshore with the help of a mechanized trawler. Parameters like tintinnid species enumeration, zooplankton biomass, phytoplankton concentration (total chlorophyll) and abundance, sea surface temperature (SST), pH, transparency, salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO), total phosphate, silicate and nitrate were analysed. A total of 20 different tintinnid species (16 agglomerated +4 non-agglomerated) belonging to 6 genera were recorded from the study area with seasonal variation in tintinnid diversity, i.e. higher in summer (total 2745 individual/l) compared to winter (total 1191 individual/l). Tintinnopsis was the most dominant genus during both the seasons, i.e. 2100 individual/l in summer and 727 individual/l in winter, contributing about 76 and 61% population for the respective seasons. The correlation between species and water quality parameters showed that Tintinnopsis sp. abundance was significantly regulated by nitrate concentration, salinity, dissolved oxygen, water transparency and pH. However, the mentioned hydrological parameters were not the only factors regulating the tintinnid abundance. Tintinnid abundance was also found to be positively related with transparency (r = 0.732) and salinity (r = 0.524) and moderately related with dissolved oxygen (r = 0.488) whereas strong negative relation (at p = 0.05) was established between tintinnid abundance with nitrate (r = -0.681) and pH (r = -0.561). Bray-Curtis cluster analysis of tintinnid species showed more than 60% similarity. Shannon's diversity index (H'), Simpson's evenness index (D) and Margalef's species richness index were found to be higher in summer, i.e. 1.61, 0.729 and 1.612, compared to the winter season, i.e. 1.139, 0.597 and 1.268. k-dominance curve showed maximum abundance of Tintinnopsis baltica in winter and Tintinnopsis gracilis in summer. Principal component analysis (PCA) was analysed to find out the environmental variables affecting different tintinnid species diversity. A significant spatiotemporal variation in Tintinnid population distribution was observed from two-way ANOVA. The results reflect significant seasonal (F = 840.0), spatial (F = 47.3) and interactive variation (F = 71.2) among the ciliate microzooplankton at n = 66, p = 0.001. High chlorophyll content and phytoplankton population in summer indicated that tintinnid diversity in the season was positively influenced by producer community in coastal waters of Digha.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				JUN	2017	189	6							258	10.1007/s10661-017-5961-z								WOS:000403083300015	28478543

Bioaccumulation of toxins is a worldwide problem nowadays and has been, historically, overlooked by the supervisory authorities. This study evaluated cytogenotoxic effects of Guaribas river (a Brazilian river) water during dry and rainy seasons of 2014 by using the Allium cepa test system. The toxicogenetic variables, including root growth, mitotic index, and chromosomal aberrations, were analyzed in meristematic cells of A. cepa exposed to water samples taken from the up-, within, and downstream of the city Picos (state: Piaui). The physical-chemical parameters were also analyzed to explain water quality and possible anthropogenic action. Additionally, the presence of heavy metals was also analyzed to explain water quality and possible damaging effects on eukaryotic cells. The results suggest that the river water exerted cytotoxic, mutagenic, and genotoxic effects, regardless of the seasons. In addition, Guaribas river presented physicochemical values outside the Brazilian laws, which can be a characteristic of human pollution (domestic sewage, industrial, and local agriculture). The genetic damage was positively correlated with higher levels of heavy metals. The pollution of the Guaribas river water may link to the chemical contamination, including the action of heavy metals and their impacts on genetic instability in the aquatic ecosystem. In conclusion, necessary steps should be taken into account for further toxicogenetic studies of the Guaribas river water, as it has an influence in human health of the same region of Brazil.

An urban observatory for quantifying phosphorus and suspended solid loads in combined natural and stormwater conveyances	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Water quality in urban streams and stormwater systems is highly dynamic, both spatially and temporally, and can change drastically during storm events. Infrequent grab samples commonly collected for estimating pollutant loadings are insufficient to characterize water quality in many urban water systems. In situ water quality measurements are being used as surrogates for continuous pollutant load estimates; however, relatively few studies have tested the validity of surrogate indicators in urban stormwater conveyances. In this paper, we describe an observatory aimed at demonstrating the infrastructure required for surrogate monitoring in urban water systems and for capturing the dynamic behavior of stormwater-driven pollutant loads. We describe the instrumentation of multiple, autonomous water quality and quantity monitoring sites within an urban observatory. We also describe smart and adaptive sampling procedures implemented to improve data collection for developing surrogate relationships and for capturing the temporal and spatial variability of pollutant loading events in urban watersheds. Results show that the observatory is able to capture short-duration storm events within multiple catchments and, through intersite communication, sampling efforts can be synchronized across multiple monitoring sites.

Similar to its effect across various sectors and areas, climate change has potential to affect surface water quality directly and indirectly. On the one hand, the rise in temperature enhances the microbial activity and decomposition of organic matter in the river system and changes in rainfall alter discharge and water flow in the river ultimately affecting pollution dilution level. On the other hand, the disposal of organic waste and channelizing municipal sewage into the rivers seriously worsen water quality. This study attempts to relate hydro-climatology, water quality, and impact of climatic and non-climatic stresses in affecting river water quality in the upper Bagmati basin in Central Nepal. The results showed that the key water quality indicators such as dissolved oxygen and chemical oxygen demand are getting worse in recent years. No significant relationships were found between the key water quality indicators and changes in key climatic variables. However, the water quality indicators correlated with the increase in urban population and per capita waste production in the city. The findings of this study indicate that dealing with non-climatic stressors such as reducing direct disposal of sewerage and other wastes in the river rather than emphasizing on working with the effects from climate change would largely help to improve water quality in the river flowing from highly populated urban areas.

Evaluating the performance of a retrofitted stormwater wet pond for treatment of urban runoff	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												This paper describes the performance of a retrofitted stormwater retention pond (Ashby Pond) in Northern Virginia, USA. Retrofitting is a common practice which involves modifying existing structures and/or urban landscapes to improve water quality treatment, often compromising standards to meet budgetary and site constraints. Ashby Pond is located in a highly developed headwater watershed of the Potomac River and the Chesapeake Bay. A total maximum daily load (TMDL) was imposed on the Bay watershed by the US Environmental Protection Agency in 2010 due to excessive sediment and nutrient loadings leading to eutrophication of the estuary. As a result of the TMDL, reducing nutrient and sediment discharged loads has become the key objective of many stormwater programs in the Bay watershed. The Ashby Pond retrofit project included dredging of accumulated sediment to increase storage, construction of an outlet structure to control flows, and repairs to the dam. Due to space limitations, pond volume was less than ideal. Despite this shortcoming, Ashby Pond provided statistically significant reductions of phosphorus, nitrogen, and suspended sediments. Compared to the treatment credited to retention ponds built to current state standards, the retrofitted pond provided less phosphorus but more nitrogen reduction. Retrofitting the existing stock of ponds in a watershed to at least partially meet current design standards could be a straightforward way for communities to attain downstream water quality goals, as these improvements represent reductions in baseline loads, whereas new ponds in new urban developments simply limit future load increases or maintain the status quo.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				JUN	2017	189	6							256	10.1007/s10661-017-5930-6								WOS:000403083300013	28478541

The lake has hosted numerous different management efforts. Diversion of sewage waters away from the lake in 1979 resulted in a considerable reduction of external P loading. Due to diffuse loading from agricultural areas, external loading however still exceeds the critical loading of the lake, thus having an effect on the water quality. The total P concentration of surface layers has decreased but is still on a hypertrophic level (90 g1-1). The high productivity of the lake is maintained also by intensive internal P loading, and the sediment has a potential to release P to the water for decades even if external loading would be reduced to a tolerable level. Internal P loading has not decreased over the studied decades despite numerous within-lake management efforts (aeration with different methods, food web management). In opposite, our results demonstrated that destratification applied since 1998 resulted in a persisting internal P loading. Destratification has increased the concentration of oxygen and decreased the concentration of soluble P in deep water, but at the same time it has accelerated P release from aerobic bottoms. This can be due to elevated near-bottom temperatures, enhanced liberation of organic P through accelerated mineralization, and increased sediment resuspension by aeration-induced turbulence. Additionally, increasing wind velocities may have a role in the increasing aerobic internal loading. Food web management has compensated for the amplified P-cycling, revealed by the decreasing chlorophyll:total P ratio. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Wang, XZ; Tan, X				Wang, Xingzhong; Tan, Xiang			Macroinvertebrate community in relation to water quality and riparian land use in a substropical mountain stream, China	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Exploring how water quality and land use shape the benthic macroinvertebrate community composition is of widespread interest in biodiversity conservation and environmental management. In this study, we investigated the structures of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages and their environmental controls in terms of water quality and riparian land use in the Jinshui River, China. We carried out three campaigns including wet season (August 2009), dry season (November 2009), and normal season (April 2010) based on the hydrological regime in Jinshui basin. The result showed that macroinvertebrate assemblage variations were better explained by water quality factors than land use based on variance partitioning procedure. The land use of 2 km upstream from the sampling sites had explained more variation than that of the whole riparian zone in upstream catchment on macroinvertebrate community, and land use of 2 km upstream also had more interactions with water quality. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) indicated that the elements or nutrient of magnesium (Mn), selenium (Se), strontium (Sr), silicon (Si), dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DN), sulfur (S), total organic carbon (TOC), and total nitrogen (TN) in water exhibited a strong relationship with macroinvertebrate assemblages. However, the variance in water quality explained by land use was lower than that explained by water quality in rivers using redundancy analysis. Our study suggested that proximate factors (i.e., water quality) were more important to interpret the macroinvertebrate community compared to ultimate factors (i.e., land use) for macroinvertebrate assemblages in river system.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				JUN	2017	24	17					14682	14689		10.1007/s11356-017-9042-1								WOS:000402997700012	28456917

The MRPP method can handle uncertainties expressed as fuzzy-random-boundary intervals, probability distributions, and interval numbers, and analyze the effects of uncertainties as well as their interactions on modeling outputs. It is applied to plan water quality management in the Xiangxihe watershed. Results reveal that a lower probability of satisfying the objective function (theta) as well as a higher probability of violating environmental constraints (q (i) ) would correspond to a higher system benefit with an increased risk of violating system feasibility. Chemical plants are the major contributors to biological oxygen demand (BOD) and total phosphorus (TP) discharges; total nitrogen (TN) would be mainly discharged by crop farming. It is also discovered that optimistic decision makers should pay more attention to the interactions between chemical plant and water supply, while decision makers who possess a risk-averse attitude would focus on the interactive effect of q (i) and benefit of water supply. The findings can help enhance the model's applicability and identify a suitable water quality management policy for environmental sustainability according to the practical situations.

BIOACCUMULATION OF INORGANIC ELEMENTS IN DREISSENA POLYMORPHA FROM THE EBRO RIVER, SPAIN: COULD ZEBRA MUSSELS BE USED AS A BIOINDICATOR OF THE IMPACT OF HUMAN ACTIVITIES?	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Dreissena polymorpha is among the top 100 most harmful invasive species in aquatic habitats. European Directive 2013/39/UE establishes Environmental Quality Standards for biota because it has been demonstrated that pollutants bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms. This study evaluated bioaccumulation of inorganic elements in the soft tissues of D. polymorpha in order to assess the usefulness of zebra mussels as a bioindicator of contaminant presence in superficial waters. Concentrations of 66 elements were measured in order to evaluate their relationship with nearby anthropogenic activity and to the values recommended by Environmental Quality Standards for biota. Bivalves were collected from four sample points along the Ebro River Basin (Spain), where diverse human activities are carried out. Zebra mussels accumulate toxins in soft tissue during their life cycle, including Al, Cr, Fe, Hg, Pb, Th, Cd and U. The highest levels of accumulation corresponded to elements associated with human activity in the area, showing the impact of anthropogenic actions on biota. D. polymorpha not only supplies information about current water quality but also acts as a witness of past water quality by bioconcentrating toxic elements present in the environment and providing relevant results about historical water contamination. In conclusion, D. polymorpha is a harmful and dangerous invasive species, but its pervasiveness means that it can be used as a bioindicator to assess current and past presence of elements in water.

This paper presents a methodology to characterise and classify the regime of a temporary river in Southern Italy based on hydrological indicators (HIs) computed with long- term daily flow records. By using a principal component analysis (PCA), a set of non-redundant indices were identified describing the main characteristics of the hydrological regime in the study area. The indicators identified were the annual maximum 30- and 90-day mean (DH4 and DH5), the number of zero flow days (DL6), flow permanence (MF) and the 6-month seasonal predictability of dry periods (SD6). A methodology was also tested to estimate selected HIs in ungauged river reaches. Watershed characteristics such as catchment area, gauging station elevation, mean watershed slope, mean annual rainfall, land use, soil hydraulic conductivity and available water content were derived for each site. Selected indicators were then linked to the catchment characteristics using a regression analysis. Finally, MF and SD6 were used to classify the river reaches on the basis of their degree of intermittency. The methodology presented in this paper constitutes a useful tool for ecologists and water resource managers in the Water Framework Directive implementation process, which requires a characterisation of the hydrological regime and a 'river type' classification for all water bodies.

Influence of land use and land cover on the spatial variability of dissolved organic matter in multiple aquatic environments	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Water quality of lakes, estuaries, and coastal areas serves as an indicator of the overall health of aquatic ecosystems as well as the health of the terrestrial ecosystem that drains to the water body. Land use and land cover plays not only a significant role in controlling the quantity of the exported dissolved organic matter (DOM) but also influences the quality of DOM via various biogeochemical and biodegradation processes. We examined the characteristics and spatial distribution of DOM in five major lakes, in an estuary, and in the coastal waters of the Mississippi, USA, and investigated the influence of the land use and land cover of their watersheds on the DOM composition. We employed absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy including excitation-emission matrix (EEM) combined with parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis modeling techniques to determine optical properties of DOM and its characteristics in this study. We developed a site-specific PARAFAC model to evaluate DOM characteristics resulting in five diverse DOM compositions that included two terrestrial humic-like (C1 and C3), two microbial humic-like (C2 and C5), and one protein-like (C4) DOM. Our results showed elevated fluorescence levels of microbial humic-like or protein-like DOM in the lakes and coastal waters, while the estuarine waters showed relatively high fluorescence levels of terrestrial humic-like DOM. The results also showed that percent forest and wetland coverage explained 68 and 82% variability, respectively, in terrestrial humic-like DOM exports, while 87% variability in microbially derived humiclike DOM was explained by percent agricultural lands. Strong correlations between microbial humic-like DOM and fluorescence-derived DOM indices such as biological index (BIX) and fluorescence index (FI) indicated autochthonous characteristics in the lakes, while the estuary showed largely allochthonous DOM of terrestrial origin. We also observed higher concentrations of total dissolved phosphorous (TDP) and ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N) in coastal waters potentially due to photodegradation of refractory DOM derived from the sediment-bound organic matter in the coastal wetlands. This study highlights the relationships between the DOM compositions in the water and the land use and land cover in the watershed. The spatial variability of DOM in three different types of aquatic environments enhances the understanding of the role of land use and land cover in carbon cycling through export of organic matter to the aquatic ecosystems.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				JUN	2017	24	16					14124	14141		10.1007/s11356-017-8917-5								WOS:000402748300021	28417327

Hydrochemical examination of wet-monsoon season primarily revealed Ca-MgHCO3 type (66%) and followed by Na-Cl type (17.70%) water. In the dry-monsoon season, the scenario reversed with primary water being Na-Cl type (52.27%) followed by Ca-Mg-HCO3 type (31.81%). Analysis of Cl/Br molar ratio vs. Cl (mg/L) depicted sampling area affected by seawater intrusion (SWI). Spatial analysis by ordinary kriging method confirmed approximately 77% sample in the dry-monsoon, and 34% of the wet-monsoon season had shown SWI. The most saline-intruded areas in the wet-monsoon seasons were extreme south-west coastal zone of Bangladesh, lower Meghna River floodplain and Meghna estuarine floodplain and southeastern part of Chittagong coastal plains containing the districts of Chittagong and Cox's Bazar adjacent to Bay of Bengal. In addition, mid-south zone is also affected slightly in the dry-monsoon season. From the analyses of data, this study could further help to comprehend seasonal trends in the hydrochemistry and water quality of the coastal and estuarine rivers. In addition, it can help policy makers to obligate some important implications for the future initiatives taken for the management of land, water, fishery, agriculture and environment of coastal rivers and estuaries of Bangladesh.

In the present study, metal contents and toxicity of soils, aqueous extracts from soils and mine drainage waters from an abandoned F-Ba-Pb-Zn mining area in Osor (Girona, NE Spain) were evaluated through chemical extractions and ecotoxicity bioassays. Toxicity assessment in the terrestrial compartment included lethal and sublethal endpoints on earthworms Eisenia fetida, arthropods Folsomia candida and several plant species, whereas aquatic tests involved bacteria Vibrio fischeri, microalgae Raphidocelis subcapitata and crustaceans Daphnia magna. Total concentrations of Ba (250-5110 mg kg(-1)), Pb (940 to > 5000 mg kg(-1)) and Zn (2370-11,300 mg kg(-1)) in soils exceeded intervention values to protect human health. Risks for the aquatic compartment were identified in the release of drainage waters and in the potential leaching and runoff of metals from contaminated soils, with Cd (1.98-9.15 A mu g L-1), Pb (2.11-326 A mu g L-1) and Zn (280-2900 A mu g L-1) concentrations in filtered water samples surpassing US EPA Water Quality Criteria (2016a, b). Terrestrial ecotoxicity tests were in accordance with metal quantifications and identified the most polluted soil as the most toxic. Avoidance and reproduction tests with earthworms showed the highest sensitivity to metal contamination. Aquatic bioassays performed in aqueous extracts from soils confirmed the results from terrestrial tests and also detected toxic effects caused by the mine drainage waters. Algal growth inhibition was the most sensitive aquatic endpoint. In view of the results, the application of a containment or remediative procedure in the area is encouraged.																	0269-4042	1573-2983				JUN	2017	39	3					665	679		10.1007/s10653-016-9840-2								WOS:000402049700014	27260479

The aim of this study was to evaluate the microbiological water quality of the Negro River basin during this extreme flood to investigate this apparent association between the illness cases and the population exposed to the contaminated waters. Forty water samples were collected and analysed for classic and emerging enteric viruses. Human adenoviruses, group A rotaviruses and genogroup II noroviruses were detected in 100, 77.5 and 27.5% of the samples, respectively, in concentrations of 10(3)-10(6) GC/L. All samples were compliant with local bacteriological standards. HAdV2 and 41 and RVA G2, P[6], and P[8] were characterised. Astroviruses, sapoviruses, genogroup IV noroviruses, klasseviruses, bocaviruses and aichiviruses were not detected. Statistical analyses showed correlations between river stage level and reported gastroenteritis cases and, also, significant differences between virus concentrations during this extreme event when compared with normal dry seasons and previous flood seasons of the Negro River. These findings suggest an association between the extreme flood experienced and gastrointestinal cases in the affected areas providing circumstantial evidence of causality between the elevations in enteric viruses in surface waters and reported illness.																	1867-0334	1867-0342				JUN	2017	9	2					195	207		10.1007/s12560-017-9280-x								WOS:000401519200008	28160215

Rainwater harvesting for restoring degraded dry agro-pastoral ecosystems: a conceptual review of opportunities and constraints in a changing climate	ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS												Water resources in dry environments are becoming scarcer, especially under the changing climate. In response, rainwater harvesting (RWH) is being reemphasized with calls to revive the practice. Ancient knowledge on RWH - mainly the collection through runoff, storage, and use of rainwater for various purposes - is still relevant, especially for dry environments. However, many old practices and technologies may not be suitable or feasible for the present and future. Little has been done to modernize and (or) develop new practices and technologies based on ancient indigenous knowledge. Modernizing old practices or developing new ones and using them in integrated rangelands restoration packages with enabling policy environment can unlock their potential in many water-scarce regions of the world. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of micro-catchment rainwater harvesting (MIRWH) in dry environments and discusses the opportunities available and the major obstacles faced in using it to restore degraded agro-pastoral ecosystems and support their sustainability. The review highlights the knowledge behind it, the practices developed over the years, and their relevance to today and the future. The paper indicates areas of modernization that can make it more feasible for the future of the dry environments, especially their role in mitigating and adapting to climate change. Conventional and passive approaches to restoring/rehabilitating degraded dry agro-pastoral ecosystems are either too slow to show an obvious impact or not progressing satisfactorily. One main reason is that, because of land degradation, the majority of rain falling on such ecosystems and needed for revegetation is lost with little benefit being gained. Adopting a more progressive intervention to alter the processes of degradation and move towards new system equilibrium is required. MIRWH can enable a large portion of this otherwise lost rainwater to be stored in the soil, and, if used in an integrated packages including suitable plant species and sound grazing management, it may support meaningful vegetation growth and help system restoration. The Badia Benchmark project, implemented by ICARDA in Jordan and Syria, has demonstrated the potential for adoption at large scale in similar environments. This case study illustrates the potential and the constraints of this practice.																	1208-6053	1181-8700				JUN	2017	25	2					135	162		10.1139/er-2016-0069								WOS:000402318000001

Stochastic multicomponent reactive transport analysis of low quality drainage release from waste rock piles: Controls of the spatial distribution of acid generating and neutralizing minerals	JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY												In mining environmental applications, it is important to assess water quality from waste rock piles (WRPs) and estimate the likelihood of acid rock drainage (ARD) over time. The mineralogical heterogeneity of WRPs is a source of uncertainty in this assessment, undermining the reliability of traditional bulk indicators used in the industry. We focused in this work on the bulk neutralizing potential ratio (NPR), which is defined as the ratio of the content of non-acid-generating minerals (typically reactive carbonates such as calcite) to the content of potentially acid-generating minerals (typically sulfides such as pyrite). We used a streamtube-based Monte-Carlo method to show why and to what extent bulk NPR can be a poor indicator of ARD occurrence. We simulated ensembles of WRPs identical in their geometry and bulk NPR, which only differed in their initial distribution of the acid generating and acid neutralizing minerals that control NPR. All models simulated the same principal acid-producing, acid-neutralizing and secondary mineral forming processes. We show that small differences in the distribution of local NPR values or the number of flow paths that generate acidity strongly influence drainage pH. The results indicate that the likelihood of ARD (epitomized by the probability of occurrence of pH < 4 in a mixing boundary) within the first 100 years can be as high as 75% for a NPR = 2 and 40% for NPR = 4. The latter is traditionally considered as a "universally safe" threshold to ensure non-acidic waters in practical applications. Our results suggest that new methods that explicitly account for mineralogical heterogeneity must be sought when computing effective (upscaled) NPR values at the scale of the piles.					Mayer, K.

J	Bonotto, DM; de Oliveira, AMMA				Bonotto, Daniel Marcos; Marinello Assis de Oliveira, Ana Maria			Mobility indices and doses from Po-210 and Pb-210 activity concentrations data in Brazilian spas groundwaters	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY												Po-210 and (210)pb activity concentrations in spas groundwaters occurring at Sao Paulo (SP) and Minas Gerais (MG) states, Brazil, have been reported in this paper with a dual purpose: to compare different indices for evaluating the radionuclides mobility into waters and to evaluate the drinking water quality from dose calculations. The waters (75 sampling points) are extensively used for drinking in public places, bottling and bathing purposes, among other. The samples were taken from springs and wells drilled at different aquifer systems inserted in Parana and Southeastern Shield hydrogeological provinces. The WHO guideline reference value for Pb-210 and Po-210 of 0.1 Bq/L in drinking water was not reached for Pb-210 but the Po-210 levels were equal or above it in four spas groundwaters from MG State. The maximum WHO guidance dose level of 0.1 mSv/yr was also reached or surpassed in them. The Pb-210 "mobility index" taking into account the ratio of the weight of the dissolved Pb-210 per unit volume of solution to its weight per unit weight of the rock matrix yielded values in the range of 0.01-5.2 kg/m(3). Another "mobility index" (Preference Ratio) expressing the ratio of Pb-210 and U-238 in the waters divided by the ratio of Pb-210 and U-238 in the rock matrices provided values between 0.004 and 7994. The (210)pb-/U-238 activity ratios of some spas groundwaters suggested preferential U-238 transport relative to Pb-210 into the liquid phase, whereas the ratio of the Pb-210 to U-238 mobility indices indicated the opposite. Such finding showed a better usefulness of the mobility indices for evaluating processes affecting the radionuclides release into the liquid phase during the water/rock interactions.

A particle-tracking technique for spatial and temporal interpolation of satellite images applied to Lake Superior chlorophyll measurements	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Ocean color satellite-derived estimates of water properties are generally discontinuous in spatial and temporal coverage due to cloud cover. We describe a novel method for providing an estimate of continuous distribution of a satellite-derived water property, chlorophyll concentration in Lake Superior. The method uses calculated wind-driven lake circulation from a hydrodynamic model to estimate the evolution of the chlorophyll concentration field between available imagery. This new technique considers hydrodynamic effects by integrating a property-carrying particle model (PCPM) and an Eulerian concentration remapping approach. The PCPM interpolation method uses computational tracer particles that move with the calculated lake currents to represent the chlorophyll field. The concentration associated with each particle is dynamically adjusted toward the satellite-derived chlorophyll field at times and locations where imagery is available and produces a spatially and temporally continuous estimate of the chlorophyll concentration field. One of the important characteristics revealed from the analysis is the seasonally-dependent and region-specific chlorophyll concentration, which is significantly controlled by seasonal hydrodynamic conditions in Lake Superior. Analysis suggests that without adding extra sampling cost, moving a few sampling locations from offshore water to sample the embayments and southern coasts can provide more accurate characterization of the spatial pattern of chlorophyll concentration in Lake Superior. Furthermore, we found that Lake Superior chlorophyll concentrations do not appear to have changed significantly over the past 12 years and likely only slightly or not at all over the last 50 years, which differs from that in the other upper Great Lakes.

Assessing the status of sediment toxicity and macroinvertebrate communities in the Eighteenmile Creek Area of Concern, New York	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												In 1972, the governments of Canada and the United States committed to restoring the physical, chemical, and biological integrity of the Laurentian Great Lakes under the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. Through this framework, the downstream-most section of Eighteenmile Creek, a tributary to the south shore of Lake Ontario in New York, was designated as an Area of Concern (AOC) because water quality and bed sediments were contaminated by past industrial and municipal discharges, waste disposal, and pesticide usage. Five beneficial use impairments (BUls) have been identified in the AOC including the degradation of the "benthos", or the benthic macroinvertebrate community. This investigation used sediment toxicity testing and macroinvertebrate community assessments to determine if the toxicity of bed sediments in the AOC differed from that of an unimpacted reference stream. Results from 10-day toxicity tests indicated that survival and growth of the dipteran Chironomus dilutus and the amphipod Hyalella azteca did not differ significantly between sediments from the AOC and reference area. Analyses of benthic macroinvertebrate community integrity and structure also indicated that macroinvertebrate communities, while impacted across most sites on both streams, were generally similar between the AOC and reference area. Despite these findings, the upstream-most AOC site consistently scored poorly in all analyses, which suggests that localized sediment toxicity may exist in the AOC, even if large scale differences between the AOC and a comparable reference stream are minimal.

To quantify microbial loads and to determine probable sources of elevated E. coli levels, water and sediment samples were collected from both beaches during swimming season 2011. Sources of fecal pollution were assessed using multiple molecular markers: human-associated Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron alpha 1-6 mannanase (B. theta), bovine-associated Bacteroides (BoBac), human adeno-viruses (HAdVs), and bovine adenoviruses (BAdVs). Fecal indicator bacteria (E. coli and enterococci) were also monitored. In Singing Bridge Beach, 50% of water samples (n = 78) exceeded the recreational water quality guidelines for E. coli, while in Whites Beach all water samples met the E. coli standard. B. theta, BoBac, HAdVs, and BAdVs were detected in both beaches indicating influence of multiple sources of contamination. Cell culture assays indicated six water samples from Singing Bridge Beach and seven water samples from Whites Beach contained infectious viruses. Both frequency and concentrations of B. theta and BoBac were higher in sediment samples than in water samples. Elevated BoBac as compared with B. theta in water and sediment samples in both beaches, which are located in a watershed characterized as intensely farmed, suggest that runoff from agricultural areas was one of the probable dominant pollution sources. This study demonstrates that Bacteroides markers used in combination with land use information may help to characterize impacted beaches in mixed watersheds and design management plans.

J	Brothers, S; Vadeboncoeur, Y; Sibley, P				Brothers, Soren; Vadeboncoeur, Yvonne; Sibley, Paul			A decline in benthic algal production may explain recent hypoxic events in Lake Erie's central basin	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Since the late 1990s, the central basin of Lake Erie has reputedly experienced an increase in the frequency and severity of hypoxic events. However, total phosphorus (TP) loading, in-lake TP concentrations, chlorophyll a (Chl a), and sediment oxygen demand (SOD) have all declined in the central basin since the 1970s. Water clarity in this basin has declined from the 1970s to 2000s despite the invasion of dreissenid mussels around 1990. In shallow lakes, declines in benthic primary production (PP) can generate positive feedback loops between the internal loading of nutrients/dissolved organic carbon and hypoxic/anoxic conditions in the water column. Such a hypoxia-inducing mechanism driven by declines in benthic PP has not been explored in Lake Erie. To test if a decline in benthic PP might explain hypoxic events in the central basin of Lake Erie, we calculated the inter-decadal changes in benthic and planktonic algal production in this basin from the 1970s to the 2000s. Primary production models using water column Chl a concentrations and light attenuation indicated that benthic PP represents roughly 10% of the basin's total areal PP. However, our calculations show that bentliic PP declined from approximately 540 to 200 g C/m(2) y since the 1970s. We propose that a decline in benthic PP may have played a key mechanistic role in the transition from externally-induced hypoxia (i.e. watershed nutrient loading fueling phytoplankton production) in the 1970s and 80s to internally-induced hypoxia (sediment resuspension and internal loading) since the late 1990s.

Stimulation of Saginaw Bay charophyte photosynthesis by phosphorus	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Like many other benthic algae, charophytes can attain high abundance in shallow waters, thereby affecting benthic ecology and nutrient cycling, and their subsequent death, detachment, and shoreline deposition contribute to beach fouling within the Laurentian Great Lakes. In-situ nutrient enrichment experiments and stoichiometric analyses have shown that other types of Great Lakes benthic algae are frequently phosphorus (P)-limited, but comparable information is lacking for charophytes. This study coupled short-term P enrichment of charophytes collected from inner Saginaw Bay with fluorometric estimates of algal photosynthesis to assess potential nutrient limitation. Benthic irradiance at the experimental sites was frequently sufficient to saturate charophyte photosynthesis, and charophyte photosynthesis was stimulated by experimental P enrichment, suggesting that these algae were P -limited under natural conditions. Reduction of P loading may be an effective charophyte control measure, even in relatively light-poor and nutrient-rich areas of the Great Lakes.

Ontogenetic dietary shifts and bioaccumulation of diphenhydramine in Mugil cephalus from an urban estuary	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Though bioaccumulation of pharmaceuticals has received attention in inland waters, studies of pharmaceutical bioaccumulation in estuarine and marine systems are limited. Further, an understanding of pharmaceutical bioaccumulation across size classes of organisms displaying ontogenetic feeding shifts is lacking. We selected the striped mullet, Mugil cephalus, a euryhaline and eurythermal species that experiences dietary shifts with age, to identify whether a model base, diphenhydramine, accumulated in a tidally influenced urban bayou. We further determined whether diphenhydramine accumulation differed among size classes of striped mullet over a two year study period. Stable isotope analysis identified that ontogenetic feeding shifts of M. cephalus occurred from juveniles to adults. However, bioaccumulation of diphenhydramine did not significantly increase across age classes of M. cephalus but corresponded to surface water levels of the pharmaceutical, which suggests inhalational uptake to diphenhydramine was more important for bioaccumulation than dietary exposure in this urban estuary.

Municipal wastewater treatment plant effluent-induced effects on freshwater mussel populations and the role of mussel refugia in recolonizing an extirpated reach	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Global human population and urbanization continually increase the volume of wastewater entering aquatic environments. Despite efforts to treat these effluents, they contribute a diverse suite of substances that enter watersheds at concentrations that have the potential to elicit adverse effects on aquatic organisms. The relationship between wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent exposure and biological responses within aquatic ecosystems remains poorly understood, especially at the population level. To examine the effect of WWTP effluents on sentinel invertebrates, freshwater mussels were assessed in the Grand River, Ontario, in populations associated with the outfall of a major WWTP. This watershed, within the Laurentian Great Lakes basin, has a diverse community of twenty-five species of mussels, including nine Species at Risk, and is representative of many habitats that receive WWTP effluents regionally as well as globally. Surveys were conducted to assess the presence and species richness of freshwater mussels. In total, 55 sites downstream of the WWTP were examined using timed visual searches with one or 2 h of effort spent searching 100 m segments. Although seven species of mussels were found in moderate abundance (mean of 8 mussels per hour of searching across 2 sites) upstream of the WWTP outfall, no live mussels were observed for 7.0 km downstream of the WWTP. Long-term water quality monitoring data indicate that ammonia and nitrite concentrations along with large seasonal declines in diel dissolved oxygen were associated with the extirpation of mussels downstream of the WWTP. The first live mussels found downstream were below the confluence with a major tributary indicating that in addition to an improvement in water quality to a state that enables mussels (and/or their fish hosts) to survive, a nearby mussel refuge may have facilitated the recolonization of the depauperate WWTP-impacted zone.

However, no reliable, practical and low-cost method exists to measure the direct release of metals from antifouling paints. Therefore, the paint industry and regulatory authorities are obliged to use release rate measurements derived from either mathematical models or from laboratory studies. To bridge this gap, we have developed a novel method using a handheld X-Ray Fluorescence spectrometer (XRF) to determine the cumulative release of Cu and Zn from antifouling paints. The results showed a strong linear relationship between XRF K-alpha net intensities and metal concentrations, as determined by ICP-MS. The release of Cu and Zn were determined for coated panels exposed in harbors located in the Baltic Sea and in Kattegat. The field study showed salinity to have a strong impact on the release of Cu, i.e. the release increased with salinity. Contrary, the effect of salinity on Zn was not as evident. As exemplified in this work, the XRF method also makes it possible to identify the governing parameters to the release of Cu and Zn, e.g. salinity and type of paint formulation. Thus, the XRF method can be used to measure environmentally relevant releases of metallic compounds to design more efficient and optimized antifouling coatings. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Their use has been linked to a host of deleterious effects in aquatic ecosystems such as osteoporosis in vertebrates, developmental impairments in molluscs and reduced fecundity and growth in cladocerans. Apart from these handful of studies, the effects of GCs on aquatic biota are largely unknown. The present study is a first of its kind aiming to assess the multi-generational exposure effects of DEX and PDS on the life history parameters of Ceriodaphnia dubia (C. dubia). Multigenerational studies have proved to be an advantage in assessing the cumulative damage caused by aquatic toxicants at the population level of the exposed organisms over a period of successive generations using multiple biological endpoints. Test results demonstrated that C. dubia exhibited varied sensitivities towards both the studied chemicals however were more sensitive to DEX with 48-h EC50 (95% confidence interval) of 0.75 mg/L (CI: 0.59-0.92) in comparison to PDS [19 mg/L (CI: 15-23)]. EC10 values for F0 in a multigenerational chronic bioassays were 48 mu g/L (CI: 37.4 61) for DEX and 460 mu g/L (CI: 341-606) for PDS and in F3 were 2.21 mu g/L (CI: 1.6-3.1) for DEX and 31 mu g/L (CI: 19.4-46) for PDS. There was a positive trend of increased toxicity followed by reduced life history traits such as fecundity, brood size and time to first brood and intrinsic rate of population increase and body growth (length and area) of C dubia in the case of both studied chemicals. The results from the current work highlighted the importance of multigenerational studies in identifying the evolutionary responses of stressed non-target aquatic organisms, and data obtained can be further used in developing water quality guidelines.

During these times, use of a woodchip heavy-use area (HUA) presents advantages such as a soft, supportive, and dry foot surface for animals and protection of the pasture and pasture soils. However, woodchip HUAs can also be a centralized source of high nutrient loads due to their drainage outflows. A column study was conducted to assess the nutrient load reduction potential of: 1) six types of wood media (including torrefied wood media and biochar) that could be used in a woodchip HUA versus a gravel control, and 2) providing a 48 h retention time within the wood media to enhance nitrogen removal through denitrification. The woody media provided significant liquid waste volume reduction compared to the gravel in simulated events (53%-61% vs. 39% reductions, respectively), and there may be additional liquid storage capacity in the woodchips not utilized during these rapid events. Substantial total nitrogen removal by the wood treatments (mean removal efficiencies > 50%) was observed across the simulated events, although nitrate leaching also occurred. Nitrate removal was enhanced during the 48 h retention test which showed removal was governed by availability of labile carbon (i.e., fresh woodchips exhibited > 70% nitrate removal). The retention test also indicated biochar mixtures provided some of the best total phosphorus removal, but the greatest benefits across all parameters was provided by the Mixed Hardwood treatment.

Warming of Central European lakes and their response to the 1980s climate regime shift	CLIMATIC CHANGE												Lake surface water temperatures (LSWTs) are sensitive to atmospheric warming and have previously been shown to respond to regional changes in the climate. Using a combination of in situ and simulated surface temperatures from 20 Central European lakes, with data spanning between 50 and similar to 100 years, we investigate the long-term increase in annually averaged LSWT. We demonstrate that Central European lakes are warming most in spring and experience a seasonal variation in LSWT trends. We calculate significant LSWT warming during the past few decades and illustrate, using a sequential t test analysis of regime shifts, a substantial increase in annually averaged LSWT during the late 1980s, in response to an abrupt shift in the climate. Surface air temperature measurements from 122 meteorological stations situated throughout Central Europe demonstrate similar increases at this time. Climatic modification of LSWT has numerous consequences for water quality and lake ecosystems. Quantifying the response of LSWT increase to large-scale and abrupt climatic shifts is essential to understand how lakes will respond in the future.

However, few studies that assess the advances of diffuse pollution modeling and studies of trace diffuse pollutants have been conducted. The adaption and development of imported model systems based on local observations and climatic features have improved study skills and presented unique characteristics. In addition to traditional diffuse pollutants (e.g., nitrogen and phosphorus), modeling trace heavy metals and pesticide also provides insights for watershed management. We reviewed existing literature on diffuse pollution model applications and developments in China, attempting to provide a better understanding of the advances of diffuse pollution and new research directions for pollution modeling. Diverse methods have been adopted to express diffuse pollution formation, transport and environmental impacts using modeling as an effective tool for developing management guidelines in China. Model applications at different temporal-spatial scales, development of diffuse pollution modeling for emerging pollutants, and impacts of diffuse pollution on water quality in China were analyzed. Pollution loading decreased from east to west, coinciding with farmland distributions, tillage intensity, and economic levels. The temporal patterns of pollution loading have increased in recent decades due to increased fertilizer additions and climate warming which has put more pressure on water quality. This analysis indicated that enhancing existing models, with more field observations, is key for future diffuse pollution studies of trace organic pollutants and heavy metals. Establishing national databases and validating standard model parameters are essential and currently weak points at the national scale with respect to diffuse pollution modeling. Diffuse pollution has become a challenging issue in watershed management, and agricultural diffuse pollution poses the greatest risk to watershed management in China. However, the mechanisms involved in trace pollutant transport and the environmental consequences of these pollutants are largely unknown in China, where complicated tillage methods are used and climatic conditions vary throughout the country. Accumulated field observations at diverse temporal-spatial scales are important to accurately model and perform water risk assessments.																	1439-0108	1614-7480				JUN	2017	17	6					1527	1536		10.1007/s11368-017-1688-2								WOS:000401436200001

Microbial diversity is commonly used as a bioindicator of ecosystems functioning. However, there is a lack of sensitivity of microbial diversity indicators in the case of moderate and chronic environmental degradation, such as atmospheric deposition of pollutants, agricultural practices, diffuse pollution by wastewater and climate change. As a consequence, there is a need for alternative bioindicators of soils and water quality. Here, we discuss the interest of adopting a more integrative approach based on biotic interaction networks beyond the simple diversity indicators. We review how the various biotic interactions can be integrated in the various microbial networks such as trophic, mutualistic and co-occurrence networks. Then we discuss the efficiency of microbial networks and associated metrics to detect changes in microbial communities. We conclude that the connectance, the number of links and the average degree of co-occurrence networks could vary from 10 to 50% in response to minor perturbations when microbial diversity parameters remain stable. Finally, we analyze studies that aimed at linking microbial networks and activity to evaluate the potential of such networks for providing simple and operational indicators of ecosystem quality and functioning.

The framework conceptualizes GI practices using blocks (spatial features) and connectors (interfaces) representing functional components of a GI. The blocks represent spatial features with the ability to store water (e.g., pond, soil, benthic sediments, manhole, or a generic storage zone) and water quality constituents including chemical constituents and particles. The hydraulic module can solve a combination of Richards equation, kinematic/diffusive wave, Darcy, and other user-provided flow models. The particle transport module is based on performing mass-balance on particles in different phases, e.g., mobile and deposited in soil with constitutive theories controlling their transport, settling, deposition, and release. The reactive transport modules allow constituents to be in dissolved, sorbed, bound to particles, and undergo user-defined transformations. Four applications of the modeling framework are presented that demonstrate its flexibility for simulating urban GI performance. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Improved validation framework and R-package for artificial neural network models	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												Validation is a critical component of any modelling process. In artificial neural network (ANN) modelling, validation generally consists of the assessment of model predictive performance on an independent validation set (predictive validity). However, this ignores other aspects of model validation considered to be good practice in other areas of environmental modelling, such as residual analysis (replicative validity) and checking the plausibility of the model in relation to a priori system understanding (structural validity). In order to address this shortcoming, a validation framework for ANNs is introduced in this paper that covers all of the above aspects of validation. In addition, the validann R-package is introduced that enables these validation methods to be implemented in a user-friendly and consistent fashion. The benefits of the framework and R-package are demonstrated for two environmental modelling case studies, highlighting the importance of considering replicative and structural validity in addition to predictive validity.

An adjoint-based numerical method has been developed to determine the optimal placement of chlorine sensors in drinking water networks at a low computational cost. From a practical engineering perspective, the proposed optimal placement corresponds to the set of sensors that minimizes the area in which the unknown model parameters cannot be identified. The numerical strategy is implemented in the hydraulic software EPANET. Using the adjoint framework, we develop and apply an adaptive strategy in a French drinking water network that provides the optimal placement from 1 sensor to 6 sensors. We show that the highest reduction of the non-identifiable area is obtained at the first stages of the adaptive strategy. After 4 sensors, a plateau is reached. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Input variable selection with a simple genetic algorithm for conceptual species distribution models: A case study of river pollution in Ecuador	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												Species distribution models (SDMs) have received increasing attention in freshwater management to support decision making. Existing SDMs are mainly data-driven and often developed with statistical and machine learning methods but with little consideration of hypothetic ecological knowledge. Conceptual SDMs exist, but lack in performance, making them less interesting for decision management. Therefore, there is a need for model identification tools that search for alternative model formulations. This paper presents a methodology, illustrated with the example of river pollution in Ecuador, using a simple genetic algorithm (SGA) to identify well performing SDMs by means of an input variable selection (IVS). An analysis for 14 macroinvertebrate taxa shows that the SGA is able to identify well performing SDMs. It is observed that uncertainty on the model structure is relatively large. The developed tool can aid model developers and decision makers to obtain insights in driving factors shaping the species assemblage. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Water Quality Survey of Splash Pads After a Waterborne Salmonellosis Outbreak-Tennessee, 2014	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH												Waterborne outbreaks of salmonellosis are uncommon. The Tennessee Department of Health investigated a salmonellosis outbreak of 10 cases with the only common risk factor being exposure to a single splash pad. Risks included water splashed in the face at the splash pad and no free residual chlorine in the water system. We surveyed water quality and patron behaviors at splash pads statewide. Of the 29 splash pads participating in the water quality survey, 24 (83%) used a recirculating water system. Of the 24, 5 (21%) water samples were tested by polymerase chain reaction and found to be positive for E. coli, Giardia, norovirus, or Salmonella. Among 95 patrons observed, we identified common high-risk behaviors of sitting on the fountain or spray head and putting mouth to water. Water venue regulations and improved education of patrons are important to aid prevention efforts.																	0022-0892					JUN	2017	79	10					8	12										WOS:000401303700002	29154527

Multiple lines of evidence to identify sewage as the cause of water quality impairment in an urbanized tropical watershed	WATER RESEARCH												Indicator bacteria, which are conventionally used to evaluate recreational water quality, can originate from various non-human enteric and extra-enteric sources, hence they may not be indicative of human health risk nor do they provide information on the sources of contamination. In this study we utilized traditional (enterococci and Escherichia coli) and alternative (Clostridium perfringens) indicator bacteria, F-specific coliphage, molecular markers for microorganisms associated with human sewage (human associated Bacteroides and polyomaviruses), and microbial community analysis tools (16S rRNA gene fragment amplicon sequencing), to identify and evaluate human sewage-related impact in the Manoa watershed in Honolulu, Hawaii. Elevated concentrations of enterococci (geometric mean ranging from 1604 to 2575 CFU 100 mL(-1)) and C perfringens (45-77 CFU 100 mL(-1)) indicated impairment of the urbanized section of the stream, while indicator bacteria concentrations decreased downstream in the tidally influenced Ala Wai Canal. The threshold values triggering water quality violation notifications in Hawaii were exceeded in 33.3-75.0% of samples collected at sites in the urbanized section of Manoa Stream, but were not exceeded in any of the samples collected at an upstream site located in a forested area. Correlation between indicator bacteria concentrations and rainfall amounts was weak to moderate but significant (E. coli R = 0.251, P = 0.009; enterococci R = 0.369, P < 0.001; C. perfringens R = 0.343, P < 0.001), while concentrations of human fecal-associated molecular markers were not significantly correlated with rainfall (human-associated Bacteroides, R = 0.131, P = 0.256; human-associated polyomaviruses, R = 0.213, P = 0.464). Presence of human sewage was confirmed by detection of human associated Bacteroides and human polyomavirus in the urbanized section of Manoa Stream (83.3 -100% and 41.7-66.7% positive samples respectively). It was further confirmed by microbial community analyses which suggested that an average 2.4-3.4% of the total bacterial population in this section was associated with sewage. Microbial community profiles were significantly influenced by rainfall (R-2 = 0.4390, P < 0.001), pH (R-2 = 0.3077, P = 0.006), salinity (R-2 = 0.2614, P = 0.038), and conductivity (R-2 = 0.2676, P = 0.031). Although microbial diversity fluctuated throughout the watershed, it was lower in the impaired section. Leaking sewer systems and illegal cross-connections are implicated in the impairment of the watershed, hence both the sewer and the storm water lines should be routinely inspected. Collectively, our data suggest that information derived from the analysis of microbial communities complements current marker-based microbial source tracking techniques and environmental monitoring programs.

However, even though these elements lead to improved water quality, the water quality may be impacted during its distribution through piped networks due to the processes such as pipe material release, biofilm formation and detachment, accumulation and resuspension of loose deposits. Irregular changes in supply-water quality may cause physiochemical and microbiological de-stabilization of pipe material, biofilms and loose deposits in the distribution system that have been established over decades and may harbor components that cause health or esthetical issues (brown water). Even though it is clearly relevant to customers' health (e.g., recent Flint water crisis), until now, switching of supply-water quality is done without any systematic evaluation. This article reviews the contaminants that develop in the water distribution system and their characteristics, as well as the possible transition effects during the switching of treated water quality by destabilization and the release of pipe material and contaminants into the water and the subsequent risks. At the end of this article, a framework is proposed for the evaluation of potential transition effects. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Uncertainty analysis for effluent trading planning using a Bayesian estimation-based simulation-optimization modeling approach	WATER RESEARCH												In this study, a Bayesian estimation-based simulation-optimization modeling approach (BESMA) is developed for identifying effluent trading strategies. BESMA incorporates nutrient fate modeling with soil and water assessment tool (SWAT), Bayesian estimation, and probabilistic possibilistic interval programming with fuzzy random coefficients (PPI-FRC) within a general framework. Based on the water quality protocols provided by SWAT, posterior distributions of parameters can be analyzed through Bayesian estimation; stochastic characteristic of nutrient loading can be investigated which provides the inputs for the decision making. PPI-FRC can address multiple uncertainties in the form of intervals with fuzzy random boundaries and the associated system risk through incorporating the concept of possibility and necessity measures. The possibility and necessity measures are suitable for optimistic and pessimistic decision making, respectively. BESMA is applied to a real case of effluent trading planning in the Xiangxihe watershed, China. A number of decision alternatives can be obtained under different trading ratios and treatment rates. The results can not only facilitate identification of optimal effluent-trading schemes, but also gain insight into the effects of trading ratio and treatment rate on decision making. The results also reveal that decision maker's preference towards risk would affect decision alternatives on trading scheme as well as system benefit. Compared with the conventional optimization methods, it is proved that BESMA is advantageous in (i) dealing with multiple uncertainties associated with randomness and fuzziness in effluent-trading planning within a multi source, multi-reach and multi-period context; (ii) reflecting uncertainties existing in nutrient transport behaviors to improve the accuracy in water quality prediction; and (iii) supporting pessimistic and optimistic decision making for effluent trading as well as promoting diversity of decision alternatives.

To explore this, we combined iron-reducing or substrate-limited anaerobic conditions and aerobic pilot-scale reactors directly at a wastewater treatment plant. To investigate the detoxification by these processes, we applied two in vitro bioassays for baseline toxicity (Microtox) and reactive toxicity (AREc32) as well as in vivo bioassays with aquatic model species in two laboratory experiments (Desmodesmus subspicatus, Daphnia magna) and two on-site, flow-through experiments (Potamopyrgus antipodarum, Lumbriculus variegatus). Moreover, we analyzed 31 commonly occurring micropollutants and 10 metabolites. The baseline toxicity of raw wastewater was effectively removed in full-scale and reactor scale activated sludge treatment (>85%), while the oxidative stress response was only partially removed (>61%). A combination of an anaerobic pre-treatment under iron reducing conditions and an aerobic nitrification significantly further reduced the residual in vitro toxicities by 46-60% and outperformed the second combination consisting of an aerobic pre-treatment and an anaerobic post-treatment under substrate limiting conditions (27-43%). Exposure to effluents of the activated sludge treatment did not induce adverse in vivo effects in aquatic invertebrates. Accordingly, no further improvement in water quality could be observed. Compared to that, the removal of persistent micropollutants was increased. However, this observation was restricted to a limited number of compounds and the removal of the sum concentration of all target micropollutants was relative low (14-17%). In conclusion, combinations of strictly anaerobic and aerobic processes significantly enhanced the removal of specific and non-specific in vitro toxicities. Thus, an optimization of biological wastewater treatment can lead to a substantially improved detoxification. These otherwise hidden capacities of a treatment technology can only be uncovered by a complementary biological analysis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We aimed at filling this gap by assessing the relative effects of hydroclimatic and water quality factors on the trait composition of invertebrate assemblages over 30 years in the Middle Loire River (France). Using a priori predictions on the long-term variation of trait-based adaptations over the three decades, we evaluated the ability of invertebrate traits to indicate the effects of warming, discharge reduction and water quality improvement. Hydroclimatic and water quality factors contributed to up to 65% of the variation in trait composition. More than 70% of the initial trait response predictions made according to observed long-term hydroclimatic changes were confirmed. They supported a general climate-induced trend involving adapted resistance and resilience strategies. A partial confounding effect of water quality improvement acting on trophic processes was also highlighted, indicating that improved water quality management can significantly help to reduce some adverse effects of climate change. This trait-based approach can have wider implications for investigating long-term changes driven by multiple, potentially confounded factors, as frequently encountered in the context of global change.																	1354-1013	1365-2486				JUN	2017	23	6					2297	2307		10.1111/gcb.13575								WOS:000400445900015	27873443

Estuary-ocean connectivity: fast physics, slow biology	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Estuaries are connected to both land and ocean so their physical, chemical, and biological dynamics are influenced by climate patterns over watersheds and ocean basins. We explored climate-driven oceanic variability as a source of estuarine variability by comparing monthly time series of temperature and chlorophyll-a inside San Francisco Bay with those in adjacent shelf waters of the California Current System (CCS) that are strongly responsive to wind-driven upwelling. Monthly temperature fluctuations inside and outside the Bay were synchronous, but their correlations weakened with distance from the ocean. These results illustrate how variability of coastal water temperature (and associated properties such as nitrate and oxygen) propagates into estuaries through fast water exchanges that dissipate along the estuary. Unexpectedly, there was no correlation between monthly chlorophyll-a variability inside and outside the Bay. However, at the annual scale Bay chlorophyll-a was significantly correlated with the Spring Transition Index (STI) that sets biological production supporting fish recruitment in the CCS. Wind forcing of the CCS shifted in the late 1990s when the STI advanced 40 days. This shift was followed, with lags of 1-3 years, by 3- to 19-fold increased abundances of five ocean-produced demersal fish and crustaceans and 2.5-fold increase of summer chlorophyll-a in the Bay. These changes reflect a slow biological process of estuary-ocean connectivity operating through the immigration of fish and crustaceans that prey on bivalves, reduce their grazing pressure, and allow phytoplankton biomass to build. We identified clear signals of climate-mediated oceanic variability in this estuary and discovered that the response patterns vary with the process of connectivity and the timescale of ocean variability. This result has important implications for managing nutrient inputs to estuaries connected to upwelling systems, and for assessing their responses to changing patterns of upwelling timing and intensity as the planet continues to warm.

J	Arya, FK; Zhang, L				Arya, Farid Khalil; Zhang, Lan			Copula-Based Markov Process for Forecasting and Analyzing Risk of Water Quality Time Series	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING												This study applies the copula-based Markov process to model water quality time series. The bivariate copula is applied to investigate the first-order Markov processes. The D-Vine copula is applied to investigate the more complicated higher-order (k >= 2) Markov processes. The Value-at-Risk (VaR), computed using the best-fitted copula-based Markov process, is applied for the risk analysis. Using water quality time series at the Snohomish River watershed (Washington) and the Chattahoochee River watershed (Georgia), the results show that the copula-based Markov processes (1) are able to properly model the temporal dependence for dissolved oxygen (DO) series [i.e., forecast root-mean-square error (RMSE) <1 mg/L at both watersheds] and temperature (T) series (i.e., forecast RMSE = 1.5 degrees C at the Chattahoochee watershed); and (2) can only predict the overall trend for nitrate and conductivity series, due to the fact that these two series also depend heavily on other factors (e.g., runoff). Overall, the study indicates that the copula-based Markov process may be an efficient tool in the assessment of water quality and the associated risks with the following advantages: (1) constructing the transitional probability explicitly and properly; (2) studying the temporal dependence independently from the marginal distributions; (3) avoiding the strict assumptions of the classic time series modeling approach (e.g., the time series belonging to the Gaussian process); and (4) providing a reasonable risk measure through the VaR.

Deficits in water quality, mainly from diffuse pollution such as agricultural run-off, but also from wastewater treatment plants (WVVTPs), have been suggested as important drivers of this decline in ecological quality. We modelled six macroinvertebrate based metrics indicating ecological quality for 184 streams in response to a) PCA-derived water quality gradients, b) individual water quality variables and c) catchment land use and wastewater exposure indices as pollution drivers. The aim was to evaluate the relative importance of key water quality variables and their sources. Indicator substances (i.e. carbamazepine and caffeine indicating wastewater exposure; herbicides indicating agricultural run-off) represented micropollutants in the analyses and successfully related water quality variables to pollution sources. Arable and urban catchment land covers were strongly associated with reduced ecological quality. Electric conductivity, oxygen concentration, caffeine, silicate and toxic units with respect to pesticides were identified as the most significant in-stream predictors in this order. Our results underline the importance to manage diffuse pollution, if ecological quality is to be improved. However, we also found a clear impact of wastewater on ecological quality through caffeine. Thus, improvement of WWTPs, especially preventing the release of poorly treated wastewater, will benefit freshwater communities. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The impact of pre-restoration land-use and disturbance on sediment structure, hydrology and the sediment geochemical environment in restored saltmarshes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Saltmarshes are being lost or degraded as a result of human activity resulting in loss of critical ecosystem services including the provision of wild species diversity, water quality regulation and flood regulation. To compensate, saltmarshes are being restored or re-created, usually driven by legislative requirements for increased habitat diversity, flood regulation and sustainable coastal defense. Yet, there is increasing evidence that restoration may not deliver anticipated ecosystem services; this is frequently attributed to poor drainage and sediment anoxia. However, physical sediment characteristics, hydrology and the sediment geochemical environment are rarely examined in restoration schemes, despite such factors being critical for plant succession. This study presents the novel integration of 3D-computed X-ray microtomography to quantify sediment structure and porosity, with water level and geochemical data to understand the impact of pre-restoration land use and disturbance on the structure and functioning of restored saitmarshes. The study combines a broad-scale investigation of physical sediment characteristics in nine de-embanked saitmarshes across SE England, with an intensive study at one site examining water levels, sediment structure and the sediment geochemical environment. De-embankment does not restore the hydrological regime, or the physical/chemical framework in the saltmarshes and evidence of disturbance, includes a reduction in microporosity, pore connectivity and water storage capacity, a lack of connectivity between the sub-surface environment and overlying floodwaters, and impeded sub-surface water flow and drainage. This has significant consequences for the sediment geochemical environment. This disturbance is evident for at least two decades following restoration and is likely to be irreversible. It has important implications for plant establishment in particular, ecosystem services including-flood regulation, nutrient cycling and wild species diversity and for future restoration design.

Generally, As(III) has a higher toxicity than As(V) due to the different mechanisms in arsenic toxicity. However, there are few studies about the water quality criteria (WQC) of As (III) and As(V) respectively because of the deficiency of arsenic toxicity data coming from diverse taxonomic groups. In this research, eight native Chinese aquatic organisms were adopted to conduct toxicity tests for As (III) and As(V) to supplement the published toxicity data. The species sensitivity distribution (SSD) method on the basis of the Log-normal model which was the most optimal among eight models was applied to derive WQCs of As(III) and As(V). Results showed that crustaceans were the most sensitive to As(III) and As(V) among all tested species, thus they could be a biological indicator, and the influence of pH values on arsenic toxicity was complex and species-specific. Besides, the sensitivity differences between native and non-native species were observed. Finally, a criterion maximum concentration (CMC) of 167 and 384 mu g/L for As(III) and As(V), and a criterion continuous concentration (CCC) of 42 and 44 pg/L for As(III) and As(V) were derived using native species, regardless of pH values. The WQCs were also verified by other two methods of ETX 2.0 and species sensitivity rank. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

To date, however, the statistical basis for the design and recommended procedures for enumerating fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) concentrations from CBT results have not been formally documented. Here, we provide that documentation following protocols for communicating the evolution of similar water quality testing procedures. We begin with an overview of the statistical theory behind the CBT, followed by a description of how that theory was applied to determine an optimal CBT design. We then provide recommendations for interpreting CBT results, including procedures for estimating quantiles of the FIB concentration probability distribution, and the confidence of compliance with recognized water quality guidelines. We synthesize these values in custom user-oriented 'look-up' tables similar to those developed for other FIB water quality testing methods. Modified versions of our tables are currently distributed commercially as part of the CBT testing kit.

High throughput pyrosequencing technology was used to assess the shift in microbial community of leachate from animal carcass lysimeter. The leachate samples were collected monthly for one year and a total of 164,639 pyrosequencing reads were obtained and used in the taxonomic classification and operational taxonomy units (OTUs) distribution analysis based on sequence similarity. Our results show considerable changes in the phylum-level bacterial composition, suggesting that the microbial community is a sensitive parameter affected by the burial environment. The phylum classification results showed that Proteobacteria (Pseudomonas) were the most influential taxa in earlier decomposition stage whereas Firmicutes (Clostridium, Sporanaerobacter, and Peptostreptococcus) were dominant in later stage under anaerobic conditions. The result of this study can provide useful information on a time series of leachate profiles of microbial community structures and suggest patterns of microbial diversity in livestock burial sites. In addition, this result can be applicable to predict the decomposition stages under clay loam based soil conditions of animal livestock. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Nhiwatiwa, T; Dalu, T; Brendonck, L				Nhiwatiwa, Tamuka; Dalu, Tatenda; Brendonck, Luc			Impact of irrigation based sugarcane cultivation on the Chiredzi and Runde Rivers quality, Zimbabwe	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Agriculture is vital in sustaining human livelihoods. However, agriculture as it is currently practiced, is contributing to the degradation of freshwater ecosystems globally. We investigated impacts of irrigation return flows from sugarcane farming on water quality and health status of the Chiredzi and Runde Rivers, a biodiversity hotspot region in south-eastern Lowveld of Zimbabwe. The water quality at inlets from the crop field into the wetland system; wetland outlets into the river systems; and river sites upstream and downstream of wetland outlets were monitored during the dry and wet seasons. The wetland system formed naturally from excessive drainage from the cane fields but its purifying capacity was unknown to date. An assessment of the water physical chemical variables (at all sites) and macroinvertebrate communities (at river sites only) was carried out. Results showed that the wetland was deficient in its purifying capacity as it was already saturated by salts and nutrients from high irrigation return flow loads. A significant seasonal variation was observed for conductivity, reactive phosphorus (RP), pH and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations among the inlets to the wetland whereas among the river sites significant seasonal differences were observed for ammonium, dissolved oxygen, nitrate, RP, pH, TP and turbidity concentrations during the dry season. From the macroinvertebrate community data the impact of the irrigation return flows on the river system was apparent, as the good water quality sites were characterised by a high diversity of pollution sensitive macroinvertebrate taxa, while the irrigation impacted sites were characterised and dominated by pollution tolerant taxa. High ion concentration (conductivity and salinity) and pH were found to be important in structuring macroinvertebrate communities as determined using multivariate analysis in the river system. In conclusion, the river water quality was significantly impacted by irrigation return flows and this greatly reduced the ecological health as highlighted by low macroinvertebrate diversity and increases in physical-chemical variables.

Chlorine is a widely-used disinfectant and the key factor in the inactivation of T tubifex. This study investigated the inactivation kinetics of chlorine on T tubifex and the synergistic effect of the sequential use of chlorine and UV irradiation. The experimental results indicated that the Ct (concentration x time(reaction)) concept could be used to evaluate the inactivation kinetics of T. tubifex with chlorine, thus allowing for the use of a simpler Ct approach for the assessment of T. tubifex chlorine inactivation requirements. The inactivation kinetics of T tubifex by chlorine was found to be well-fitted to a delayed pseudo first-order Chick-Watson expression. Sequential experiments revealed that UV irradiation and chlorine worked synergistically to effectively inactivate T tubifex as a result of the decreased activation energy, Ea, induced by primary UV irradiation. Furthermore, the inactivation effectiveness of T. tubifex by chlorine was found to be affected by several drinking water quality parameters including pH, turbidity, and chemical oxygen demand with potassium permanganate (CODMO) concentration. High pH exhibited pronounced inactivation effectiveness and the decrease in turbidity and CODMn concentrations contributed to the inactivation of T. tubifex. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

For an adsorption-based method, mesoporous carbon can be a promising supplemental adsorbent. The effect of mesoporous carbon (MCI, MC2, and MC3) properties and water quality parameters on the adsorption of MC-LR were investigated and the results were analyzed by kinetic, isotherm, thermodynamic, Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO), and intraparticle diffusion models. MC1 was the most appropriate type for the removal of MC-LR with a maximum adsorption capacity of 35,670.49 mu g/g. Adsorption of MC-LR is a spontaneous reaction dominated by van der Waals interactions. Pore sizes of 8.5 14 nm enhance the pore diffusion of MC-LR from the surface to the mesopores of MC1. The adsorption capacity was not sensitive to changes in the pH (3.2-8.0) and the existence of organic matter (2-5 mg/L). Furthermore, the final concentration of MC-LR was below the WHO guideline level after a 10-min reaction with 20 mg/L of MC1 in the Nak-Dong River, a drinking water source. The MC-LR adsorption mainly competed with humic substances (500-1000 g/mole); however, they did not have a great effect on adsorption.

In this study, to assess seasonal changes in the sources of organic matter in Lake Sihwa (Korea), biodegradability, fluorescence property, and stable isotopic compositions (carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur) of the organic matter were determined. Water samples were collected from the inner lake (n = 9) and inland creeks (n = 10) in five separate events, from November 2012 to October 2013. Organic matter originating from rural, urban, and industrial areas was examined as the potential sources. The organic matter contents and biodegradability in the industrial area were the highest, whereas low concentrations and poor biodegradability of organic matter were found in the rural area, and moderate properties were observed in the urban area. In Lake Sihwa, a large concentration of total organic matter and enhanced biodegradability were observed during March and August. However, main source of organic matter differed between the sampling events. The largest contribution of organic matter, deriving from marine phytoplankton, was found in March. On the other hand, in August, the organic matter originating from the industrial area, which is characterized by high levels of heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants, was significantly increased. Our results could be useful to enhance the management of water bodies aimed at reducing the organic matter concentrations and improving the water quality of Lake Sihwa, and even that of the Yellow Sea.

Quality Problems in Hawaii	ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS												The economic value of water quality is poorly understood in Hawaii. Quantifying the economic value of coastal water quality would inform policy decisions that impact the coast and help justify expenditures in water quality improvements. We conducted a non-market valuation of beach recreationalists' preferences and willingness to pay for water quality and associated attributes at Oahu beaches. Using a discrete choice experiment analyzed by a conditional logit model, results suggest individuals were willing to pay $11.43 per day at the beach to reduce days of bacterial exceedance from 11 to 5 per year, a further $30.72 to reduce it to no bacterial exceedances at all. WTP to move from 15 ft to 30 ft of underwater visibility was $35.71, a further $14.80 to increase from 30 ft to 60 ft. Respondents were also willing to pay $15.33 to improve coral reef cover from 10% to 25%, a further $4.89 to improve to 45% cover. WTP for moving from 9 fish species to 18 species was $7.14, a further $2.47 to increase that to 27 fish species. These environmental improvements can improve Oahu recreationalists' welfare by $205 million, $550 million, $639 million, $265 million, $274 million, $88 million, $128 million, and $44 million per year, respectively. Welfare gains may justify increased spending in management and restoration of coastal ecosystems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The spatial patterns of delta N-15 corresponded to the urbanization level, and the nitrogen cycle was associated with the hydrological regime at the basin level. During the high flow season of summer, nonpoint sources from fertilizer/soils and atmospheric deposition constituted the highest proportion of the total nitrogen load. The point sources from sewage/manure, with high ammonium concentrations and high delta N-15 and delta O-18 contents in the form of nitrate, accounted for the largest inputs among all sources during the low flow season of winter. Hot spot areas with heavy point source pollution were identified, and the pollutant transport routes were revealed. Nitrification widely during the warm seasons, with decreased delta O-18 values; whereas great potential for denitrification existed during the low flow seasons of autumn and spring. The study showed that point source reduction could have effects over the short-term; however, long-term efforts to substantially control agriculture nonpoint sources are essential to eutrophication alleviation for the receiving lake, which clarifies the relationship between point and nonpoint source control.

However, the relative contribution of abiotic and biotic factors to riparian denitrification capacity remains elusive. Here we report the,spatioternporal dynamics of potential and unamended soil denitrification rates in 20 wetlands along the Han River, an important water source in central China. We also quantified the abundance Of soil denitrifying microorganisms using nirK and nirS genes. Results showed that soil denitrification rates were significantly different between riparian and reservoir Shoreline wetlands, but not between mountain and lowland wetlands. In addition, soil denitrification rates showed strong seasonality, with higher values in August (summer) and April (spring) but lower values in January (winter). The potential and unamended denitrification rates were positively correlated with edaphic conditions (moisture and carbon concentration), denitrifier abundance, and plant species richness. Path analysis further revealed that edaphic conditions could regulate denitrification rates both directly and indirectly through their effects on denitrifier abundance. Our findings highlight that not only environmental factors, but also biotic factors including denitrifying microorganisms and standing vegetation, play an important role in regulating denitrification rate and N removal capacity in riparian wetlands.

Variation of Bacterial Communities with Water Quality in an Urban Tropical Catchment	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												A major challenge for assessment of water quality in tropical environments is the natural occurrence and potential growth of Fecal Indicator Bacteria (FIB). To gain a better understanding of the relationship between measured levels of FIB and the distribution of sewage-associated bacteria, including potential pathogens, in the tropics this study compared the abundance of FIB (Total coliforms and E. coli) and the Bacteroidales (HF183 marker) with bacterial community structure determined by next-generation amplicon sequencing. Water was sampled twice over 6 months from 18 sites within a tropical urban catchment and reservoir, followed by extraction of DNA from microorganisms, and sequencing targeting the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Multivariate statistical analyses indicated that bacterial community composition (BCC) varied between reservoir and catchment, within catchment land-uses, and with E. coli concentration. B eta regression indicated that the proportion of sequences from sewage-associated taxa (SAT) or, pathogen-like sequences (PLS) were predicted most significantly by measured levels of E. coli(log MPN/100 mL) (chi(2) > 8.7; p < 0.003).

Predictive Power of Clean Bed Filtration Theory for Fecal Indicator Bacteria Removal in Stormwater Biofilters	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Green infrastructure (also referred to as low impact development, or LID) has the potential to transform urban stormwater runoff from an environmental threat to a valuable water resource. In this paper we focus on the removal of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB, a pollutant responsible for runoff associated inland and coastal beach closures) in stormwater biofilters (a common type of green infrastructure). Drawing on a combination of previously published and new laboratory studies of FIB removal in biofilters, we find that 66% of the variance in FIB removal rates can be explained by clean bed filtration theory (CBFT, 31%), antecedent dry period (14%), study effect (8%), biofilter age (7%), and the presence or absence of shrubs (6%). Our analysis suggests that, with the exception of shrubs, plants affect FIB removal indirectly by changing the infiltration rate, not directly by changing the FIB removal mechanisms or altering filtration rates in ways not already accounted for by CBFT. The analysis presented here represents a significant step forward in our understanding of how physicochemical theories (such as CBFT) can be melded with hydrology, engineering design, and ecology to improve the water quality benefits of green infrastructure.

J	Alosairi, Y; Pokavanich, T				Alosairi, Yousef; Pokavanich, Tanuspong			Residence and transport time scales associated with Shatt Al-Arab discharges under various hydrological conditions estimated using a numerical model	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Over the last several decades, concerns in the Northwest Arabian Gulf have risen regarding water quality and ecological conditions, particularly near Kuwait. This interest is mainly attributed to the reduction of freshwater discharge and its associated constituents from the Shatt Al Arab as a result of human activities at diverse scales. From the hydrological perspective, the reduction has also resulted in alteration to the dynamic regime and related residence time and transport conditions. Using a previously well-validated three-dimensional numerical model of the Northern Arabian Gulf (NAG) (Alosairi and Pokavanich, 2017), the residence and transport conditions of numerical tracers have been assessed through a series of numerical tests. The results indicate that density-driven circulations have played a key role in reducing the residence time in the Northwest Gulf by approximately 15% to 20% compared to tidal forces only. The transport conditions correlated well with the Shatt Al Arab discharges, but they were only significant along the Kuwait coast due to counter-clockwise circulations and alongshore currents. Arrival times and mixing processes varied reasonably with the Shatt Al Arab discharges; the results exhibited the enhancement in mixing and transport with increases in discharge. Residence times in the NAG associated with Shatt Al Arab discharge displayed spatial variations, particularly in Kuwait Bay, where the residence time increased by 60 days during low discharge compared to high discharge.

The study was carried out at One Tree Island, southern Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Rates of microbioerosion and external erosion by grazing were significantly higher at the enriched sites than at the control sites. Rates of accretion by coralline algae were also significantly higher at enriched sites. In contrast, rates of macroboring were not significantly different between enriched and control sites. This study highlights the importance of improving water quality on the reef to reduce rates of bioerosion given that quantities of dead coral substrates have recently substantially increased as a result of coral bleaching (Hughes et al., 2015) and several Crown of Thorns plagues (Fabricius et al., 2010; Death et al., 2012), on the Great Barrier Reef.

Stormwater runoff plumes in the Southern California Bight: A comparison study with SAR and MODIS imagery	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Stormwater runoff is the largest source of pollution in the Southern California Bight (SCB), resulting from untreated runoff and pollutants from urban watersheds entering the coastal waters after rainstorms. We make use of both satellite SAR and MODIS-Aqua ocean color imagery to examine two different components of runoff plumes, the surface slick and the sediment discharge. We expand on earlier satellite SAR studies by examining an extensive collection of multi-platform SAR imagery, spanning from 1992 to 2014, that provides a more comprehensive view of the plume surface slick characteristics, illustrated with distribution maps of the extent and flow direction of the plumes. The SAR-detected surface plumes are compared with coincident rain and runoff measurements, and with available measured shoreline fecal bacteria loads. We illustrate differences in the detection of SAR surface plumes with the sediment-related discharge plumes derived from MODIS imagery. A conceptual satellite stormwater runoff monitoring approach is presented. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We argue, however, that the direct negative effects on the symbiosis are not necessarily caused by the nutrient enrichment itself but by the phosphorus starvation of the algal symbionts that can be caused by skewed nitrogen (N) to phosphorus (P) ratios. We exposed corals to imbalanced N:P ratios in long-term experiments and found that the undersupply of phosphate severely disturbed the symbiosis, indicated by the loss of coral biomass, malfunctioning of algal photosynthesis and bleaching of the corals. In contrast, the corals tolerated an undersupply with nitrogen at high phosphate concentrations without negative effects on symbiont photosynthesis, suggesting a better adaptation to nitrogen limitation. Transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed that the signatures of ultrastructural biomarkers represent versatile tools for the classification of nutrient stress in symbiotic algae. Notably, high N:P ratios in the water were clearly identified by the accumulation of uric acid crystals. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Comparing different methods for fast screening of microbiological quality of beach sand aimed at rapid-response remediation	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												There is scientific evidence that beach sands are a significant contributor to the pathogen load to which visitors are exposed. To develop beach quality guidelines all beach zones must be included in microbiological evaluations, but monitoring methods for beach sand quality are relatively longstanding, expensive, laborious and require moderate laboratory infrastructure. This paper aimed to evaluate the microorganism activity in different beach zones applying and comparing a classical method of membrane filtration (MF) with two colorimetric screening methods based on fluorescein (FDA) and tetrazolium (TTC) salt biotransformation to evaluate a new rapid and low-cost method for beach sand microbiological contamination assessments. The colorimetric results can help beach managers to evaluate rapidly and at low cost the microbiological quality of different beach zones in order to decide whether remedial actions need to be adopted to prevent exposure of the public to microbes due to beach sand and/or water contamination.

However, some projects focus on a single impact on hydrodynamic conditions, water quality or marine organisms. In a case study in Xiamen, China, an integrated effects assessment framework centres on ecohydrology, using modeling of hydrodynamic conditions and statistical analysis of water quality, was developed to assess the effects of ecological restoration projects. The benefits of SDADO projects include improving hydrodynamic conditions and water quality, as a precursor to further marine biological improvements. This study highlights the need to comprehensively consider ecological effects of SDADO projects in the planning stage, and an integrative assessment method combining cumulative effects of hydrodynamic conditions, water quality and biological factors.

Although still little is known about the ecological consequences of altered hydromorphology, understanding the factors at play can contribute to sustainable environmental management. In this study we aimed to identify the hydromorphological features controlling a key ecosystem function and the spatial scales where such linkages operate. As hydromorphological and chemical pressures often occur in parallel, we examined the relative importance of hydromorphological and chemical factors as determinants of leaf breakdown. Leaf breakdown assays were investigated at 82 sites of rivers throughout the French territory. Leaf breakdown data were then crossed with data on water quality and with a multi-scale hydro morphological assessment (i.e. upstream catchment, river segment, reach and habitat) when quantitative data were available. Microbial and total leaf breakdown rates exhibited differential responses to both hydromorphological and chemical alterations. Relationships between the chemical quality of the water and leaf breakdown were weak, while hydromorphological integrity explained independently up to 84.2% of leaf breakdown. Hydrological and morphological parameters were the main predictors of microbial leaf breakdown, whereas hydrological parameters had a major effect on total leaf breakdown, particularly at large scales, while morphological parameters were important at smaller scales. Microbial leaf breakdown were best predicted by hydromorphological features defined at the upstream catchment level whereas total leaf breakdown were best predicted by reach and habitat level geomorphic variables. This study demonstrates the use of leaf breakdown in a biomonitoring context and the importance of hydromorphological integrity for the functioning of running water. It provides new insights for environmental decision-makers to identify the management and restoration actions that have to be undertaken including the hydromorphogical features that should be kept in minimal maintenance to support leaf breakdown.

J	Su, Y; Gao, B; Mao, L				Su, Yu; Gao, Bin; Mao, Liang			Concurrent agglomeration and straining govern the transport of C-14-labeled few-layer graphene in saturated porous media	WATER RESEARCH												Deposition of graphene on environmental surfaces will dictate its transport and risks. In this work, the deposition, mobilization, and transport of C-14-labeled few-layer graphene (FLG) in saturated quartz sand were systematically examined. Increasing solution ionic strength (IS) (1-100 mmol/L NaCl) resulted in greater retention of FLG (33-89%) in the sand and more hyper-exponential distribution of FLG along the sand column. Only a small fraction (<= 7.4%) of the retained FLG was remobilized due to perturbation of IS by deionized water. These results indicate that trapping in pore spaces (i.e., physical straining) plays a dominant role in FLG deposition rather than attachment onto the surfaces of the sand. When IS, FLG input concentration, and flow velocity favor particle-particle interaction over particle-collector interaction, concurrent agglomeration within the pores promotes straining. In addition, electrostatic and steric repulsion that derived from the adsorbed organic macromolecules on FLG effectively reduced agglomeration and thereby enhanced transport and release of FLG. Moreover, the recovery of FLG (that deposited at 100 mmol/L NaCl) in the effluent reached 33% after speeding up the deionized water flushing rate. These findings highlight the need for FLG management in view of variations in transport behavior when assessing water quality and associated risks. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Krueger, T				Krueger, Tobias			Bayesian inference of uncertainty in freshwater quality caused by low-resolution monitoring	WATER RESEARCH												Regulatory, low temporal resolution monitoring of freshwater quality does not fully capture the frequency distributions of the requisite parameters, particularly those that are highly skewed and heavy tailed. Hence the summary statistics ultimately compared to environmental standards are uncertain. Quantifying this uncertainty is crucial for robust water quality assessment and possible remediation, but requires strong assumptions. This paper compares three ways to model the missing data needed to fully characterise a frequency distribution in a Bayesian framework using multi-year/multi-location orthophosphate (arithmetic mean standard), dissolved oxygen (DO; 10th percentile standard) and ammonia (90th percentile standard) data from the Tamar catchment in Southwest England. First, fitting an assumed parametric model of the frequency distribution (lognormal or Weibull), there is appreciable uncertainty around the "best" model fit. Second, Bayesian Model Averaging is more general in accommodating cases where the data are ambiguous with regard to the best model, but does not take into account possibly missing data. Third, a quasi-nonparametric multinomial model of the monitoring process that places some weight on those missing data yields wider and heavier-tailed frequency distributions. One-at-a-time sensitivity analysis suggests that the multinomial model for mean orthophosphate is sensitive to the choice of support range and the prior weights given to the missing data. Sensitivity is lower for 10th percentile DO and 90th percentile ammonia. The resultant probability densities of ecological status under the EU Water Framework Directive span several status classes, meaning ecological status is more uncertain than previously acknowledged. For orthophosphate, the regulatory, empirical determination of ecological status is not only overly precise but also biased. (C) 2017 The Author.

This study analyzed the temporal trend (1979-2014) of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations and export from four adjacent coastal basins in south Florida where land and water resources are highly managed through an intricate canal network. The method of integrated seasonal-trend decomposition using LOESS (LOcally weighted regrESSion) was employed for trend detection. The results indicated that long-term trends in TN and TP concentrations (increasing/decreasing) varied with basins and nutrient species, reflecting the influence of basin specific land and water management practices. These long-term trends were intervened by short-term highs driven by high rainfall and discharges and lows associated with regional droughts. Seasonal variations in TP were more apparent than for TN. Nutrient export exhibited a chemostatic behavior for TN from all the basins, largely due to the biogenic nature of organic N associated with the ubiquity of organic materials in the managed canal network. Varying degrees of chemodynamic export was present for TP, reflecting complex biogeochemical responses to the legacy of long-term fertilization, low soil P holding capacity, and intensive stormwater management. The anthropogenic and hydro-climatic influences on nutrient concentration and export behavior had great implications in nutrient loading abatement strategies for aquatic ecosystem restoration of the downstream receiving waterbody.

With a global focus, the pertinent practical, theoretical and social aspects of RWH are reviewed in order to ascertain the state of the art. Avenues for future research are also identified. A major finding is that the degree of RWH systems implementation and the technology selection are strongly influenced by economic constraints and local regulations. Moreover, despite design protocols having been set up in many countries, recommendations are still often organized only with the objective of conserving water without considering other potential benefits associated with the multiple-purpose nature of RWH. It is suggested that future work on RWH addresses three priority challenges. Firstly, more empirical data on system operation is needed to allow improved modelling by taking into account multiple objectives of RWH systems. Secondly, maintenance aspects and how they may impact the quality of collected rainwater should be explored in the future as a way to increase confidence on rainwater use. Finally, research should be devoted to the understanding of how institutional and socio-political support can be best targeted to improve system efficacy and community acceptance.

GPs should be captured at source before the material clogs the drainage network, seals the infiltration capacity of side entry pits or affects the aquatic life in receiving waters. BMPs intended to reduce stormwater pollutants include oil and grit separators, grassed swales, vegetated filter strips, retention' ponds, and catch basin inserts (CBIs) are used to remove GP at the source and have no extra land use requirement because they are typically mounted within a catch basin (e.g. side entry pits; grate or gully pits). In this study, a new type of CBI, recently developed by Urban Stormwater Technologies (UST) was studied for its performance at a site in Gosnells, Western Australia. This new type of CBI can capture pollutants down to particle sizes of 150 pm while retaining its shape and pollutant capturing capacity for at least 1 year. Data on GP and associated water samples were collected during monthly servicing of CBIs for one year. The main component of GPs was found to be vegetation (93%): its accumulation showed a strong relationship (r(2) = 0.9) with rainfall especially during the wet season. The average accumulation of total GP load for each CBI was 384 kg/ha/yr (dry mass) with the GP moisture content ranging from 24 to 52.5%. Analysis of grain sizes of GPs captured in each CBI showed similar distributions in the different CBIs. The loading rate coefficient (K) calculated from runoff and GP load showed higher K-values for CBI located near trees. The UST developed CBI in this study showed higher potential to capture GPs down to 150 pm in diameter than similar CBI devices described in previous studies. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A 22-indicator system was established that was based on the major ecosystem services of Lake Biwa and its water courses, i.e., provisioning services regarding aquatic products and water; regulating services regarding floods and water quality; cultural services regarding recreation and tourism, scientific research, and environmental education; and supporting services regarding biodiversity. First, changes in the eight ecosystem services were discussed together with the considerable experience and difficult lessons that can be drawn from the development trajectory. Next, with the indicators rearranged according to sustainability principles, the regional sustainability over the past six plus decades was assessed. In general, this urban agglomeration has been progressing in terms of its sustainability, although economic and social development was achieved at the cost of environmental degradation in the past, and the current economic downturn is hurting the balanced development and integrated benefits. The results lead directly to recommendations for regional development, especially in terms of economic rejuvenation, from the perspective of improving management of Lake Biwa's water resources. Moreover, the relevant knowledge is educational and inspirational for other places in the world that are facing similar development issues. For example, the effective and even pioneering countermeasures that have been taken against environmental degradation, as well as the participation and collaboration of multiple stakeholders, could be useful as a model. Moreover, the study invites increased understanding of ecosystem vulnerability to anthropogenic devastation and emphasizes the priority of precautionary measures over countermeasures in the context of holistic urban planning and sustainable urban development.

Enteric viruses and adenovirus diversity in waters from 2016 Olympic venues	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Rio de Janeiro's inner and coastal waters are heavily impacted by human sewage pollution for decades. Enteric viruses, including human adenoviruses (HAdV), human enterovirus (EV), group A rotavirus (RV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV) are more likely to be found in contaminated surface waters. The present work aimed to assess the frequency and loads of EV, HAdV-C and -F species, RV and HAV in sand and water samples from venues used during the 2016 Summer Olympics and by tourists attending the event. Sixteen monthly collections were carried out from March 2015 to July 2016 in 12 different sites from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Total and thermotolerant coliform counting was performed along molecular detection of virus was performed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Analyses of all samples were further investigated by integrated cell culture PCR to check about the presence of HAdV infectious virus particles. The results show that 95.9% of water samples showed contamination with at least one type of virus. Regarding the viruses individually (% for water and sand respectively): HAdV-C (93.1%-57.8%), HAdV-F (25.3%-0%), RV (12.3%-4.4%), EV (26.7%-8.8%) and HAV (0%). The viral loads ranged from 103 gc/L up to 10(9) gc/L (water), and 10(3) gc/g to 10(6) gc/g (sand). In the phylogenetic tree, were classified into four main clusters, referring to species C, D, F and BAdV. And up to 90% of sites studied presented at least once presence of infectious HAdV-C. The most contaminated points were the Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon, where Olympic rowing took place, and the Marina da Gloria, the starting point for the sailing races, demonstrating serious problem of fecal contamination of water resources and threatens the health of Olympic athletes, tourists and residents.

A four-year study was conducted to determine the effects of cover crop (CC) (CC vs. no CC, NCC) and drainage water management (DWM) (controlled drainage with sub-irrigation, CDS, vs. regular free tile drainage, RFD) and their interaction on P loss through both surface runoff (SR) and tile drainage (ID) water in a day loam soil of the Lake Erie region. Cover crop reduced SR flow volume by 32% relative to NCC, regardless of DWM treatment. In contrast, CC increased ID flow volume by 57 and 9.4% with CDS and RFD, respectively, compared to the corresponding DWM treatment with NCC The total (SR + TD) field water discharge volumes were comparable amongst all the treatments. Cover crop reduced flow-weighted mean (FWM) concentrations of particulate P (PP) by 26% and total P (TP) by 12% in SR, while it didn't affect the FWM dissolved reactive P (DRP) concentration, regardless of DWM treatments. Compared with RFD, CDS reduced FWM DRP concentration in TD water by 19%, while CC reduced FWM PP and TP concentrations in ID by 21 and 17%, respectively. Total (SR + TD) soil TP loss was the least with CDS-CC followed by RFD-CC, CDS-NCC, and RFD-NCC. Compared with RFD-NCC, currently popular practice in the region, total TP loss Was reduced by 23% with CDS-CC The CDS-CC system can be an effective practice to ultimately mitigate soil P loading to water resource.

Therefore, effective assessment methods addressing multiple pressures are needed. In addition, these systems have to be harmonised (i.e. intercalibrated) to achieve common management objectives across Europe. Assessments of fish communities inform environmental policies on ecological conditions integrating the impacts of multiple pressures. However, the challenge is to ensure consistency in ecological assessments through time, across ecosystem types and across jurisdictional boundaries. To overcome the serious comparability issues between national assessment systems in Europe, a total anthropogenic pressure intensity (TAPI) index was developed as a weighted combination of the most common pressures in European lakes that is validated against 10 national fish-based Water quality assessment systems using data from 556 lakes. Multi-pressure indices showed significantly higher correlations with fish indices than single-pressure indices. The best-performing index combines eutrophication, hydromorphological alterations and human use intensity of lakes. For specific lake types also biological pressures may constitute an important additional pressure. The best-performing index showed a strong correlation with eight national fish-based assessment systems. This index can be used in lake management for assessing total anthropogenic pressure on lake ecosystems and creates a benchmark for comparison of fish assessments independent of fish community composition, size structure and fishing-gear. We argue that fish-based multiple-pressure assessment tools should be seen as complementary to single-pressure tools offering the major advantage of integrating direct and indirect effects of multiple pressures over large scales of space and time.

Specimens of the Neotropical fish, Astyanax altiparanae, were confined for 168 h in three lakes along the stream. Additionally, during the weeks of in situ exposure, wild specimens of this species were collected from the same sites. Biochemical biomarkers were analyzed, such as phase I biotransformation enzyme 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and phase II biotransformation enzyme glutathione S-transferase, and we also determined hepatic and branchial levels of non-protein thiols (NPSH), oxidative damage such as lipid peroxidation (LPO), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in muscle and brain. Genetic biomarkers such as DNA breaks (comet assay), frequency of micronuclei (MN) and erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENA) were also examined. The results indicate that the most sensitive biomarkers for discriminating contamination levels are DNA breaks, LPO and AChE activity. Similar results were obtained for both caged and feral fish. The biomarkers that reflect the results of cumulative events, such as ENA, were more discriminative for chronically exposed specimens (feral fishes). Analyzing biomarkers using an integrated response index showed that both approaches (using feral and caged A. altiparanae) were effective for discriminating contamination levels along the stream, corroborating the results of chemical analyses for selected pesticides. Taken together, these results highlight the importance of biomarker selection and show that both approaches (caged and feral fish) are satisfactory for evaluating Water quality in streams impacted by agricultural activities.

These measures were: buffer strips, pernianent grassland in the lowest 7% of arable fields, dry detention bunds, wetlandS, and temporary barriers such as sediment fences. Baseline field P export was estimated using export coefficients (low risk crops) or a modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (high risk crops). The impact of measures Was estimated using simple equations. Costs were estimated from gross margin losses or local data on grants. We used a net cost:benefit (NCB) factor to normalise the costs and impacts of each measure over time. Costs minimisation for target impact was done using PuLP, a linear programming module for Pythoh, across 1634 riparian and non-riparian fields in the Lunan Water, a mixed arable catchment in Eastern Scotland. With all measures in place, average cost-effectiveness increases from 9 pound to 48 pound/kg P as target P mitigation increases from 500 to 2500 kg P across the catchment. Costs increase significantly when the measures available are restricted only to those currently eligible for government grants (buffers, bunds and wetlands). The assumed orientation of the average field slope makes a strong difference to the potential for storage of water by bunds and overall cost-effectiveness, but the non-funded measures can substitute for the extra expense incurred by bunds, where the slope orientation is not suitable. Economic discounting over time of impacts and costs of measures favours those measures, such as sediment fences, which are strongly targeted both spatially and temporally. This tool could be a useful guide for dialogue with land users about the potential fields to target for mitigation to achieve catchment targets. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Geochemical and mineralogical characterization of sulfur and iron in coal waste rock, Elk Valley, British Columbia, Canada	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Exposure of coal waste rock to atmospheric oxygen can result in the oxidation of sulfide minerals and the release of sulfate (SO42-) and associated trace elements (e.g., Se, As, Cd, and Zn) to groundwaters and surface waters. Similarly, reduced iron minerals such as siderite, ankerite, and the sulfide, pyrite, present in the waste rock can also undergo oxidation, resulting in the formation of iron oxyhydroxides that can adsorb trace elements released from the oxidation of the sulfide minerals. Characterization and quantification of the distribution of sulfide and iron minerals, their oxidation products, as well as leaching rates are critical to assessing present-day and future impacts of SO42- and associated trace elements on receiving waters. Synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopic analysis of coal waste rock samples from the Elk Valley, British Columbia showed Fe present as pyrite (mean 6.0%), siderite (mean 443%), goethite (mean 35.4%), and lepidocrocite (mean 14.3%) with S present as sulfide (mean 26.9%), organic S (mean 58.7%), and SO42- (mean 14.4%). Squeezed porewater samples from dump solids yielded mean concentrations of 0.28 mg/L Fe and 1246 mg/L SO42-. Geochemical modeling showed the porewaters in the dumps to be supersaturated with respect to Fe oxyhydroxides and undersaturated with respect to gypsum, consistent with solids analyses. Coupling Fe and S mineralogical data with long-term water quality and quantity measurements from the base of one dump suggest about 10% of the sulfides (which represent 2% of total S) in the dump were oxidized over the past 30 years. The S from these oxidized sulfides was released to the receiving surface water as SO42- and the majority of the Fe precipitated as secondary Fe oxyhydroxides (only 3.0 x 10(-5)% of the Fe was released to the receiving waters over the past 30 years). Although the data suggest that the leaching of SO42- from the waste rock dump could continue for about 300 years, assuming no change in the rate of oxidation of sulfides, SO42- is currently not a concern in receiving surface waters as the concentration levels are below regulatory limits.

Eight catchments were included: three mesotrophic (one undrained control, two treatments), two ombrotrophic (one drained control, one treatment) and three oligotrophic catchments (one undrained control, two treatments). Three calibration years and four post-restoration years were included in the data from seven catchments, for which runoff was recorded. For one mesotrophic treatment catchment only one year of pre-restoration and two years of post-restoration water quality data is reported. Restoration was done by filling in and damming the ditches. Water samples were collected monthly-biweekly during the snow-free period; runoff was recorded continuously during the same period. Water quality was estimated for winter using ratios derived from external data. Runoff for non-recorded periods were estimated using the FEMMA model. A high impact on DOC, nitrogen (N) and phosporus (P) was observed in the mesotrophic catchments, and mostly no significant impact in the nutrient-poor catchments. The DOC load from one catchment exceeded 1000 kg (restored-ha)(-1) in the first year; increase of DOC concentration from 50 to 250 mg l(-1) was observed in the other mesotrophic treatment catchment. Impact on total nitrogen export of over 30 kg (restored-ha)(-1) was observed in one fertile catchment during the first year. An impact of over 5 kg (restored-ha()-1) on ammonium export was observed in one year in the mesotrophic catchment. Impact on P export from the mesotrophic catchment was nearly 5 kg P (restored-ha)(-1) in the first year. The results imply that restoration of nutrient-rich forestry-drained peatlands poses significant risk for at least short term elevated loads degrading the water quality in receiving water bodies. Restoration of nutrient-poor peatlands poses a minor risk in comparison. Research is needed regarding the factors behind these risks and how to mitigate them. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Despite diatom-based indices are known to respond fastly to water quality degradation, they are not designed to precisely identify the nature of pressures co-occurring in the environment. Based on large scale monitoring data, we aimed at building models able to estimate the risk of stream impairment by many types of anthropogenic pressures from taxonomy based and trait-based characteristics of diatom assemblages. Random forest models were built to individually evaluate the impairment risk of diatom assemblages for six chemical and five hydromorphological or land-use related pressure categories. Eight models provided good impairment risk assessment (Area Under the Curve >= 0.70). Under multi-pressure scenarios, models built for chemical pressures exhibited a better accuracy than hydromorphological or land-use related ones. Models were able to detect both ecological restoration and degradation, based on long-term surveys. These models have been implemented in a R user-friendly routine, to help stream managers to early identify degrading processes and prioritize management actions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Increasing agricultural land use is associated with the spread of an invasive fish (Gambusia affinis)	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Land-use change and invasive species pose major threats to ecosystems globally. These stressors can act together, with disturbance due to changes in land-use facilitating invasion. We examined the potential for agricultural land use to facilitate the establishment and population growth (abundance) of a globally invasive fish (Gambusia affinis). To achieve this we examined Gambusia presence, abundance, and life history traits in 31 streams spanning an agricultural land use gradient in the North Island of New Zealand. We used regression models to quantify the relationship between agricultural land use and in-stream physiochemical and habitat variables, and zero-inflated models to explore the relationship among physiochemical, habitat and catchment-scale variables and Gambusia's distribution and abundance. The percentage of the catchment in agricultural land use was associated with changes to physiochemical and habitat conditions. Increasing agricultural land use was associated with increasing macrophyte cover and water temperature and decreasing velocity in streams. Catchment-scale variables (land use and site position in the network) and water temperature were the most important determinants of whether Gambusia dccurred at a site. Local in-stream habitat (macrophyte cover and Water velocity) and nutrient conditions were the most influential predictors of Gambusia abundance given Gambusia were present. Gambusia life-history traits, sex ratio and body length varied among sites but were not predicted by physiochemical gradients. The distribution of Gambusia in streams in New Zealand is partially controlled by catchment-scale conditions via a combination of dispersal limitation and environmental filtering, both of which are affected by agricultural land use. Agricultural land use alters local in-stream conditions, resulting in systems that are similar to those in Gambusia's natural range; these altered systems have the potential to support an increased abundance of Gambusia. This study provides preliminary quantitative evidence that agricultural land use is related to the spread of a globally invasive freshwater fish. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Intra-annual variation of the association between agricultural best management practices and stream nutrient concentrations	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Temporal variation may influence the ability of best management practices (BMPs) to Mitigate the loss of agricultural pollutants to streams. Our goal was to assess variation in mitigation effects of BMPs by examining the associations between instream nutrient concentrations and the abundance and location of four structural BMPs over a hydrologic year. Water samples were collected monthly (Nov. 2013-Oct. 2014) in 15 headwater streams representing a gradient of BMP use in Southern Ontario, Canada. Partial least squares (PLS) regression models were used to associate two groups of collinear nutrient forms with the abundance and location of BMPs, antecedent precipitation and time of year. BMP metrics in PLS models were associated with instream concentrations of major phosphorus forms and ammonium throughout the year. In contrast, total nitrogen and nitrate-nitrite were only associated with BMPs during snowmelt. BMP metrics associated with reductions of phosphorus and ammonium included greater abundances of riparian buffers and manure storage structures, but not livestock restriction fences. Likewise, the abundance and location riparian vegetation in areas capturing more surface runoff were associated With decreased stream nitrogen concentrations during snowmelt. However, the amount of tile drainage was associated with increased nitrogen concentrations following snowmelt, as well as with greater phosphorUs and ammonium concentrations throughout the year. Overall, our findings indicate that increasing the abundance of riparian buffers and manure storage structures may decrease instream nutrient concentrations in agricultural areas. Additionally, the implementation of these structural BMPs appear to be an effective yearround strategy to assist management objectives in reducing phosphorus concentrations in small agricultural streams and thus loadings to downstream tributaries. Further mitigation measures, such as managerial BMPs and controlled tile drainage, may be required to further reduce instream nutrient concentrations during baseflow periods and snowmelt events.

This study evaluates differences in water quality due to land use in the upper transboundary catchment of the river Nisa (694 km(2)) in the Czech German-Polish triangle. Water samples collected weekly from the river and its tributaries at 29 sampling sites were analysed for a total of 25 parameters, including nutrients, major ions, major elements and traces of heavy metals. Each sampling site represents a sub catchment characterized by a specific composition of 8 land-use categories. Cluster analysis has been applied to divide the sub catchments into five land-use classes. When all measured parameters were taken into account, this statistical method resulted in six groups of sampling sites that are similar in their chemical water composition and that, at the same time, reflects the land use, regardless of sub-catchment size. Water quality was particularly affected by the portions of settlement areas and arable land. Sub catchments which were mainly forested (above 70%) show the smallest level of concentration for all monitored parameters (except Cd, Mn, SO4). Densely populated areas reduce water quality despite high proportions of forest. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Cui, WH; Chui, TFM				Cui, Wenhui; Chui, Ting Fong May			Temporal variations in water quality in a brackish tidal pond: Implications for governing processes and management strategies	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Brackish tidal ponds have been constructed along coastal areas in many parts of the world for aqua culture, including some Ramsar Sites. Such ponds are considered a sustainable, wise use of wetlands if managed properly, but they can also pose serious environmental problems if mismanaged. To understand the governing processes and to promote sustainable management strategies, this study examines the different temporal variations in water quality parameters in a brackish tidal pond located within the wetland complex of the Mai Po Ramsar Site in Hong Kong, China. The variations are compared with those of the receiving bay, and the water channel that connects the pond and the bay. Equations are then developed to link the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in the pond with the governing processes, and to analyze their relative contributions to DO levels. Field data show seasonal patterns in water temperature and salinity in response to the seasonal variations in solar radiation and rainfall. For the pond and the channel, DO, chlorophyll and pH exhibit fortnightly variations due to the bi-weekly water exchange between the pond and the bay. There were also diurnal variations in water temperature and DO in response to changes in solar radiation for both locations, and the tidal flushing for the water channel. Analysis of the findings indicates that water exchange influences the DO concentration more strongly than solar radiation. The DO equation links pond water quality with the time of day, and the time in a water exchange cycle, and thus provides some guidance for determining water exchange and water sampling schedules. The study sheds light on the governing processes and management strategies related to the sustainable management of a brackish tidal pond. The results are thus beneficial in elucidating and promoting the sustainable management and wise use of wetlands in other locations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Clogging in permeable concrete: A review	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Permeable concrete (or "pervious concrete" in North America) is used to reduce local flooding in urban areas and is an important sustainable urban drainage system. However, permeable concrete exhibits reduction in permeability due to clogging by particulates, which severely limits service life. This paper reviews the clogging mechanism and current mitigating strategies in order to inform future research needs. The pore structure of permeable concrete and characteristics of flowing particulates influence clogging, which occurs when particles build-up and block connected porosity. Permeable concrete requires regular maintenance by vacuum sweeping and pressure washing, but the effectiveness and viability of these methods is questionable. The potential for clogging is related to the tortuosity of the connected porosity, with greater tortuosity resulting in increased potential for clogging. Research is required to develop permeable concrete that can be poured on -site, which produces a pore structure with significantly reduced tortuosity.(C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Temporal performance assessment of wastewater treatment plants by using multivariate statistical analysis	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												For most water treatment plants, a significant number of performance data variables are attained on a time series basis. Due to the interconnectedness of the variables, it is often difficult to assess over -arching trends and quantify operational performance. The objective of this study was to establish simple and reliable predictive models to correlate target variables with specific measured parameters. This study presents a multivariate analysis of the physicochemical parameters of municipal wastewater. Fifteen quality and quantity parameters were analyzed using data recorded from 2010 to 2016. To determine the overall quality condition of raw and treated wastewater, a Wastewater Quality Index (WWQI) was developed. The index summarizes a large amount of measured quality parameters into a single water quality term by considering pre -established quality limitation standards. To identify treatment process performance, the interdependencies between the variables were determined by using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The five extracted components from the 15 variables accounted for 75.25% of total dataset information and adequately represented the organic, nutrient, oxygen demanding, and ion activity loadings of influent and effluent streams. The study also utilized the model to predict quality parameters such as Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), Total Phosphorus (TP), and WWQI. High accuracies ranging from 71% to 97% were achieved for fitting the models with the training dataset and relative prediction percentage errors less than 9% were achieved for the testing dataset.

The stormwater tool to estimate load reductions (TELR) employs a semi distributed approach, where landscape characteristics and process representation are spatially -lumped within urban catchments on the order of 100 acres (40 ha). Hydrologic computations use a set of metrics that describe a 30 -year rainfall distribution, combined with well -tested algorithms for rainfall runoff transformation and routing to generate average annual runoff estimates for each catchment. User inputs include the locations and specifications for a range of structural best management practice (BMP) types. The model was tested in a set of urban catchments within the Lake Tahoe Basin of California, USA, where modeled annual flows matched that of the observed flows within 18% relative error for 5 of the 6 catchments and had good regional performance for a suite of performance metrics. Comparisons with continuous simulation models showed an average of 3% difference from TELR predicted runoff for a range of hypothetical urban catchments. The model usually identified the dominant BMP outflow components within 5% relative error of event -based measured flow data and simulated the correct proportionality between outflow components. TELR has been implemented as a web -based platform for use by municipal stormwater managers to inform prioritization, report program benefits and meet regulatory reporting requirements (www.swtelr.com).(C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.																	0301-4797	1095-8630				MAY 15	2017	193						257	269		10.1016/jjenvman.2017.02.007								WOS:000397687100026	28226262

The most effective strategy under given conditions is often unclear to these stakeholders as it requires insight into several aspects of the contaminants such as sources, properties, and mitigation options. Furthermore the various parties in the urban water cycle are not always aware of each other's requirements and priorities. Processes to set priorities and come to agreements are lacking, hampering the articulation and implementation of possible solutions. To support decision makers with this task, a decision support system was developed to serve as a point of departure for getting the relevant stakeholders together and finding common ground. The decision support system was iteratively developed in stages. Stakeholders were interviewed and a decision support system prototype developed. Subsequently, this prototype was evaluated by the stakeholders and adjusted accordingly. The iterative process lead to a final system focused on the management of contaminants of emerging concern within the urban water cycle, from wastewater, surface water and groundwater to drinking water, that suggests mitigation methods beyond technical solutions. Possible wastewater and drinking water treatment techniques in combination with decentralised and nontechnical methods were taken into account in an integrated way. The system contains background information on contaminants of emerging concern such as physical/chemical characteristics, toxicity and legislative frameworks, water cycle entrance pathways and a database with associated possible mitigation methods. Monitoring data can be uploaded to assess environmental and human health risks in a specific water system. The developed system was received with great interest by potential users, and implemented in an international water cycle network. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

An economic inquisition of water quality trading programs, with a case study of Jordan Lake, NC	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												A water quality trading (WQT) program was promulgated in North Carolina to address water quality issues related to nutrients in the highly urbanizing Jordan Lake Watershed. Although WQT programs are appealing in theory, the concept has not proved feasible in several attempts between point and nonpoint polluters in the United States. Many application hurdles that create wedges between success and failure have been evaluated in the literature. Most programs, however, face multiple hurdles; eliminating one may not clear a pathway to success. Therefore, we identify and evaluate the combined impact of four different wedges including baseline, transaction cost, trading ratio, and trading cost in the Jordan Lake Watershed program. Unfortunately, when applied to the Jordan Lake program, the analysis clearly shows that a traditional WQT program will not be feasible or address nutrient management needs in a meaningful way. The hurdles individually would be difficult to overcome, but together they appear to be unsurmountable. This analysis shows that there is enough information to pre-identify potential hurdles that could inform policy makers where, and how, the concept might work. It would have saved time, energy, and financial resources if North Carolina had done so before embarking to implement their program in the Jordan Lake Watershed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Evaluating the impacts of agricultural land management practices on water resources: A probabilistic hydrologic modeling approach	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Evaluating the effectiveness of agricultural land management practices in minimizing environmental impacts using models is challenged by the presence of inherent uncertainties during the model development stage. One issue faced during the model development stage is the uncertainty involved in model parameterization. Using a single optimized set of parameters (one snapshot) to represent baseline conditions of the system limits the applicability and robustness of the model to properly represent future or alternative scenarios. The objective of this study was to develop a framework that facilitates model parameter selection while evaluating uncertainty to assess the impacts of land management practices at the watershed scale. The model framework was applied to the Lake Creek watershed located in southwestern Oklahoma, USA. A two-step probabilistic approach was implemented to parameterize the Agricultural Policy/Environmental eXtender (APEX) model using global uncertainty and sensitivity analysis to estimate the full spectrum of total monthly water yield (WYLD) and total monthly Nitrogen loads (N) in the watershed under different land management practices. Twenty-seven models were found to represent the baseline scenario in which uncertainty of up to 29% and 400% in WYLD and N, respectively, is plausible. Changing the land cover to pasture manifested the highest decrease in N to up to 30% for a full pasture coverage while changing to full winter wheat cover can increase the N up to 11%. The methodology developed in this study was able to quantify the full spectrum of system responses, the uncertainty associated with them, and the most important parameters that drive their variability. Results from this study can be used to develop strategic decisions on the risks and tradeoffs associated with different management alternatives that aim to increase productivity while also minimizing their environmental impacts.

Despite its numerous advantages over culture-based monitoring approaches, qPCR monitoring has yet to become widely used in the US or elsewhere. Considering qPCR results obtained on a given day as the best available measure of that day's water quality, we evaluated the frequency of correct vs. incorrect beach management decisions that are driven by culture testing. Methods: Beaches in Chicago, USA, were monitored using E. coli culture and enterococci qPCR methods over 894 beach-days in the summers of 2015 and 2016. Agreement in beach management using the two methods, after taking into account agreement due to chance, was summarized using Cohen's kappa statistic. Results: No meaningful agreement (beyond that expected by chance) was observed between beach management actions driven by the two pieces of information available to beach managers on a given day: enterococci qPCR results ofsamples collected that morning and E. coli culture results of samples collected the previous day. The E. coli culture beach action value was exceeded 3.4 times more frequently than the enterococci qPCR beach action value (22.6 vs. 6.6% of beach-days). Conclusions: The largest evaluation of qPCR-based beach monitoring to date provides little scientific rationale for continued E. coli culture testing of beach water in our setting. The observation that the E. coli culture beach action value was exceeded three times as frequently as the enterococci qPCR beach action value suggests that, although the beach action values for bacteria using different measurement methods are thought to provide comparable information about health risk, this does not appear to be the case in all settings.

Potential of floating production for delta and coastal cities	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												The disruption of nutrient cycles caused by human activities such as agriculture and burning fossil fuels is impacting ecosystem services on global and local scales. The increasing concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere contributes to rising global temperatures and ocean acidification, whereas the accumulation of nutrients in water systems is leading to degradation of water quality and biodiversity. City populations play a major role in carbon dioxide and nutrient emissions as 'end consumers' of resources. The current challenge towards more resource-efficient cities is to transform urban metabolism from linear to cyclical. Discharged nutrients and carbon dioxide can be used as input for algae, which fixate carbon very efficiently into energetic storage compounds as starch or lipids. However, cities often lack the space to implement large-scale algae production. This article evaluates the potential of reusing nutrients and carbon dioxide to produce algae, food and biofuel on water nearby coastal and delta cities. First, nutrients and carbon dioxide discharge is estimated and two scenarios are developed. From the cities nutrient production, the potential algal yield is evaluated and translated into feed, food and oil yields. Two delta cities are chosen as case studies: Rotterdam and Metro Manila. The conclusion of this article is that Floating Production can help cities increasing their resilience in the field of food and energy. Floating Production can also contribute to a solution for global land shortage. The combination of food and energy production with floating urban development provides a climate-proof urban expansion in delta and coastal areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Detailed NMR investigation of cyclodextrin-perfluorinated surfactant interactions in aqueous media	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS												Perfluorochemicals (PFCs) are contaminants of serious concern because of their toxicological properties, widespread presence in drinking water sources, and incredible stability in the environment. To assess the potential application of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-cyclodextrins for PFC remediation, we investigated their complexation with linear fluorinated carboxylic acids, sulfonates, and a sulfonamide with carbon backbones ranging from C4-C9. F-19 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy studies demonstrated beta-CD formed the strongest complexes with these PFCs. The polar head group had a modest influence, but for PFCs with backbones longer than six carbons, strong association constants are observed for 1:1 (K-1:1 similar to 10(5) M-1) and 2:1 (K-2:1 similar to 10(3) M-1) beta-CD:PFC complexes. Excess beta-CD can be used to complex 99.5% of the longer chain PFCs. Competition studies with adamantane-carboxylic acid and phenol confirmed the nature and persistence of the beta-CD:PFC complex. Detailed analyses of the individual NMR chemical shifts and Job plots indicate the favored positions of the beta-CD along the PFC chain. Solution pH, ionic strength, and the presence of humic acid have modest influence on the 13-CD:PFC complexes. The strong encapsulation of PFCs by (beta-CD under a variety of water quality conditions demonstrates the tremendous potential of CD-based materials for the environmental remediation of PFCs.

Application of Moringa Oleifera seed extract to treat coffee fermentation wastewater	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS												Wastewater generated from wet processing of coffee cherries degrades stream water quality downstream of processing mills and impacts human health. The widespread popularity of coffee as an export makes this a global problem, although the immediate impact is local. Approximately 40% of all coffee around the world is wet processed, producing wastewater rich in organic nutrients that can be hazardous to aquatic systems. Moringa Oleifera Seed Extract (MOSE) offers promise as a local and affordable "appropriate" coagulation technology for aiding in the treatment of coffee wastewater. Field research was conducted at the Kauai Coffee Company to investigate the application of MOSE to treat coffee fermentation wastewater (CFW). Coagulation tests were conducted at five pH CFW levels (3-7) and MOSE doses (0-4 g/L). After settling, TSS, COD, nitrate, nitrite, total nitrogen, and pH of supernatant from each test were measured. MOSE reduced TSS, COD, nitrate, and nitrite in CFW to varying degrees dependent on pH and dose applied. TSS removal ranged from 8% to 54%. Insoluble COD removal ranged from 26% to 100% and total COD removal ranged from 1% to 25%. Nitrate and nitrite reduction ranged from 20% to 100%. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Comparison of three corrosion inhibitors in simulated partial lead service line replacements	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS												Partial lead service line replacements (PLSLR) were simulated using five recirculating pipe loops treated with either zinc orthophosphate (1 mg/L as P), orthophosphate (1 mg/L as P) or sodium silicate (10 mg/L). Two pipe loops served as "inhibitor-free" (Pb-Cu) and "galvanic free" (Pb-PVC) controls. Changes in water quality (CSMR [0.2 or 1], conductivity[approximate to 330 mu S/cm or approximate to 560 mu S/cm], chlorine [1.4mg/L]) were not observed to provide a significant impact on lead or copper release, although galvanic corrosion was shown to be a driving factor. Generally, both orthophosphate and zinc orthophosphate provided better corrosion control for both total and dissolved lead (30 min, 6 h, 65 h) and copper (30 min, 6 h), when compared to either the inhibitor-free control or the sodium silicate treated system. This work highlights the importance of understanding the complex interplay of corrosion inhibitors on particulate and dissolved species when considering both lead and copper. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Path to Impact for Autonomous Field Deployable Chemical Sensors: A Case Study of in Situ Nitrite Sensors	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Natural freshwater systems have been severely affected by excess loading of macronutrients (e.g., nitrogen and phosphorus) from fertilizers, fossil fuels, and human and livestock waste. In the USA, impacts to drinking water quality, biogeochemical cycles, and aquatic ecosystems are estimated to cost US$210 billion annually: Field-deployable nutrient sensors (FDS) offer potential to support research and resource management efforts by acquiring higher resolution data than are currently supported by expensive conventional sampling methods. Following nearly 40 years of research and development, FDS instruments are now starting to penetrate commercial markets. However, instrument uncertainty factors (high cost, reliability, accuracy, and precision) are key drivers impeding the uptake of FDS by the majority of users. Using nitrite sensors as a case study, we review the trends, opportunities, and challenges in producing and implementing FDS from a perspective of innovation and impact. We characterize the user community and consumer needs, identify trends in research roaches, tabulate state-of-the-art examples and specifications, and, discuss data life, cycle considerations. With further development of FDS through prototyping and testing in real-world applications, these tools can deliver information for protecting and restoring natural waters, enhancing process control for industrial operations and water treatment, and providing novel research insights.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				MAY 2	2017	51	9					4755	4771		10.1021/acs.est.6b06171								WOS:000400723200004	28332819

Occurrence and In Vitro Bioactivity of Estrogen, Androgen, and Glucocorticoid Compounds in a Nationwide Screen of United States Stream Waters	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												In vitro bioassays are sensitive, effect-based tools used to quantitatively screen for chemicals with nuclear receptor activity in environmental samples. We measured in vitro estrogen (ER), androgen (AR), and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activity, along with a broad suite of chemical analytes, in streamwater from 35 well-characterized sites (3 reference and 32 impacted) across 24 states and Puerto Rico. ER agonism was the most frequently detected with nearly all sites (34/35) displaying activity (range, 0.054(-1)16 ng E2Eq L-1). There was a strong linear relationship (r2 = 0.917) between in vitro ER activity and concentrations of steroidal estrogens after correcting for the in vitro potency of each compound. AR agonism was detected in 5/35 samples (range, 1.6-4.8 ng DHTEq L-1) but concentrations of androgenic compounds were largely unable to account for the in vitro activity. Similarly, GR agonism was detected in 9/35 samples (range, 6.0-43 ng DexEq L-1); however, none of the recognized GR-active compounds on the target-chemical analyte list were detected. The utility of in vitro assays in water quality monitoring was evident from both the quantitative agreement between ER activity and estrogen concentrations, as well as the detection of AR and GR activity for which there were limited or no corresponding target-chemical detections to explain the bioactivity. Incorporation of in vitro bioassays as complements to chemical analyses in standard water quality monitoring efforts would allow for more complete assessment of the chemical mixtures present in many surface waters.

Use of Multiple Linear Regression Models for Setting Water Quality Criteria for Copper: A Complementary Approach to the Biotic Ligand Model	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Biotic Ligand Models (BLMs) for metals are widely applied in ecological risk assessments and in the development of regulatory water quality guidelines in Europe, and in 2007 the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) recommended BLM-based water quality criteria (WQC) for Cu in freshwater. However, to-date, few states have adopted BLM-based Cu criteria into their water quality standards on a state-wide basis, which appears to be due to the perception that the BLM is too complicated or requires too many input variables. Using the mechanistic BLM framework to first identify key water chemistry parameters that influence Cu bioavailability, namely dissolved organic carbon (DOC), pH, and hardness, we developed Cu criteria using the same basic methodology used by the USEPA to derive hardness-based criteria but with the addition of DOC and pH. As an initial proof of concept, we developed stepwise multiple linear regression (MLR) models for species that have been tested over wide ranges of DOC, pH, and hardness conditions. These models predicted acute Cu toxicity values that were within a factor of +/- 2 in 77% to 97% of tests (5 species had adequate data) and chronic Cu toxicity values that were within a factor of +/- 2 in 92% of tests (1 species had adequate data). This level of accuracy is comparable to the BLM. Following USEPA guidelines for WQC development, the species data were then combined to develop a linear model with pooled slopes for each independent parameter (i.e., DOC, pH, and hardness) and species-specific intercepts using Analysis of Covariance. The pooled MLR and BLM models predicted species-specific toxicity with similar precision; adjusted R2 and R2 values ranged from 0.56 to 0.86 and 0.66-0.85, respectively. Graphical exploration of relationships between predicted and observed toxicity, residuals and observed toxicity, and residuals and concentrations of key input parameters revealed many similarities and a few key distinctions between the performances of the two models. The pooled MLR model was then applied to the species sensitivity distribution to derive acute and chronic criteria equations similar in form to the USEPAs current hardness-based criteria equations but with DOC, pH, and hardness as the independent variables. Overall, the MLR is less responsive to DOC than the BLM across a range of hardness and pH conditions but more responsive to hardness than the BLM. Additionally, at low and intermediate hardness, the MLR model is less responsive than the BLM to pH, but the two models respond comparably at high hardness. The net effect of these different response profiles is that under many typical water quality conditions, MLR- and BLM-based criteria are quite comparable. Indeed, conditions where the two models differ most (high pH/low hardness and low pH/high hardness) are relatively rare in natural aquatic systems. We suggest that this MLR-based approach, which includes the mechanistic foundation of the BLM but is also consistent with widely accepted hardness-dependent WQC in terms of development and form, may facilitate adoption of updated state-wide Cu criteria that more accurately account for the parameters influencing Cu bioavailability than current hardness-based criteria.

It integrates numerical simulation, meta-modeling analysis, and fuzzy programming within a general framework. A set of models between remediation strategies and remediation performance can well guarantee the mitigation in computational efforts in the simulation and optimization process. In order to prevent the occurrence of over-optimistic and pessimistic optimization strategies, a high satisfaction level resulting from the implementation of a flexible standard can indicate the degree to which the environmental standard is satisfied. The proposed approach is applied to a naphthalene-contaminated site in China. Results show that a longer remediation period corresponds to a lower total pumping rate and a stringent risk standard implies a high total pumping rate. The wells located near or in the down-gradient direction to the contaminant sources have the most significant efficiency among all of remediation schemes.																	1061-4303	1554-7531				MAY 1	2017	89	5					456	465		10.2175/106143017X14839994523541								WOS:000411925000008	28442006

The objective of this paper is to identify a new technical solution that contributes to the increase of DO level in the water passing through the turbine. The current technical solutions improve the DO level but affect the hydraulic efficiency of the turbine. There is no general technical solution for aeration of water used by hydraulic turbines, and every implementation of the aeration devices needs a specific design. Available studies are done directly in site, on Francis turbines which are equipped with different aeration devices. The air injection methods used until now have different energetic characteristics, aeration efficiency and influence over the flow in the turbine draft tube. They are described in the literature, analysed and compared, focused on turbine geometry, injected air quantity and the place of injection. The main parameters important for the aeration process (the air bubbles size, bubble distribution and shape) and its effect over the DO transfer in the turbulent flow cannot be determined from in site investigations because onerous. The paper presents an experimental set-up for the study of air bubble injection parameters over the water aeration process, which is designed to operate with similar parameters of the turbine draft tube flow. Also, aeration parameters are measured and analysed from energetic and ecological point of view.

The numerical model of Buzau's DWDN was set up in EPANET, considering the main pipes of the network that interconnect 4 pumping stations and 45 booster stations (viewed here as end-users). The calibration of the numerical model was based on real-time recordings available for January and July 2014. The chlorination scheduling was simulated at each reservoir supplying a pumping station, by a variable injection pattern added to the EPANET DWDN model. The injected amount of chlorine was determined by values of the chlorine concentration obtained at 4 key monitoring points, spread over the network. The simulations were performed over an extended time period of 72 hours. The system behaviour has been analysed for two cases: with all pumping stations in operation, and with the biggest pumping station shutdown. For each case, the proposed schedule corresponds to the injection in the network of less chlorine than the corresponding recorded values for January and July 2014, and yet obtaining at the 4 key points a chlorine concentration variation similar to the recorded one, while the chlorine concentration at the end users was within the admissible range, across the whole DWDN.

New ocean, new needs: Application of pteropod shell dissolution as a biological indicator for marine resource management	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Pteropods, planktonic marine snails with a cosmopolitan distribution, are highly sensitive to changing ocean chemistry. Graphical abstract shows pteropod responses to be related to aragonite saturation state, with progressing decrease in Omega(ar) causing deteriorating biological conditions. Under high saturation state (Omega(ar) > 1.1; zone 0), pteropods are healthy with no presence of stress or shell dissolution. With decreasing Oar (zone 1), pteropod stress is demonstrated through increased dissolution and reduced calcification. At Omega(ar) < 0.8 (zones 2 and 3), severe dissolution and absence of calcification prevail: the impairment is followed by significant damages. Pteropods responses to OA are closely correlated to shell dissolution that is characterized by clearly delineated thresholds. Yet the practical utility of these species as indicators of the status of marine ecosystem integrity has been overlooked. Here, we set out the scientific and policy rationales for the use of pteropods as a biological indicator appropriate for low-cost assessment of the effect of anthropogenic ocean acidification (OA) on marine ecosystems. While no single species or group of species can adequately capture all aspects of ecosystem change, pteropods are sensitive, specific, quantifiable indicators of OA's effects on marine biota. In an indicator screening methodology, shell dissolution scored highly compared to other indicators of marine ecological integrity. As the socioeconomic challenges of changing ocean chemistry continue to grow in coming decades, the availability of such straightforward and sensitive metrics of impact will become indispensable. Pteropods can be a valuable addition to suites of indicators intended to support OA water quality assessment, ecosystem based management, policy development, and regulatory applications.

J	Brill, G; Anderson, P; O'Farrell, P				Brill, Gregg; Anderson, Pippin; O'Farrell, Patrick			Methodological and empirical considerations when assessing freshwater ecosystem service provision in a developing city context: Making the best of what we have	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												This study contributes to both the methodological and empirical literature by developing an integrative approach to assessing temporal and spatial change in riparian ecosystem service delivery by drawing on available and diverse data sets.These data sets act as multiple lines of evidence in supporting comparisons between data sets to test the validity of developed methods and the application of such methods. In order to synthesise these data as well as to determine the fluctuations in riparian ecosystem service provision a scoring system was developed. Methodologically, the scoring system proved informative across the majority of ecosystem services categories, showing close to 80% similarity in outcomes when comparing the scoring method to trends in long-term water quality measurements. Other benefits of the scoring system included its design simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and applicability and replicability across various urban settings. Empirically, the data sets used support the findings of the ecosystem services scoring exercise and suggests that fluctuations in ecosystem service delivery through time and across the river reaches are linked to land-use change and other human activities. Findings suggest that as water leaves an urban protected area and travels across transformed and impacted landscapes, the results are poor water quality and diminished ability of rivers to yield ecosystem services the further the river flows into the urban setting. Urbanisation and changes in land-uses in developing city contexts is therefore shown to affect potential ecosystem services benefits, necessitating increasing management interventions.

A new tool for the assessment of severe anthropogenic eutrophication in small shallow water bodies	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Unlike in deep stratified lakes, the assessment of eutrophication in shallow aquatic systems (i.e., wetlands, marshes, ponds) should be based on the interaction between water and sediment. The availability of P to primary producers is naturally higher in shallow systems, because the sediment plays an active part via adsorption, precipitation and release processes. Thus, many wetlands in protected areas are naturally eutrophic and have a high trophic status due to intrinsic features and thus, display a high concentration of total-P in the water without necessarily implying pollution or poor quality. We have provided a diagnostic tool based on the chemical equilibrium of dissolved reactive P (operationally-defined as o-P) between water and sediment that distinguish anthropogenic eutrophication from a background of natural eutrophy. When the P-binding capacity of the sediment becomes saturated, the o-P concentration increases in the water as long as both the biological uptake and the sediment adsorption are unable to cope with the rate of P-release from the sediment under a long-term P load (or severe anthropogenic eutrophication). In such conditions, we have found that the ratio of total-P/particulate-P exceeds 2.0 in the water, and have used this threshold to validate this tool in other sets of wetlands.

However, few studies have considered the interactions between the mining industry and water resources on a global scale. These interactions are often complex and site specific, and so an understanding of the local water contexts of individual mining projects is required before associated risks can be adequately assessed. Here, we address this important issue by providing the first quantitative assessment of the contextual water risks facing the global base metal mining industry, focusing on the location of known copper, lead, zinc and nickel resources. The relative exposure of copper, lead-zinc and nickel resources to water risks were assessed by considering a variety of spatial water indices, with each providing a different perspective of contextual water risks. Provincial data was considered for water criticality (CRIT), supply risk (SR), vulnerability to supply restrictions (VSR) and the environmental implications (El) of water use. Additionally, watershed or sub-basin scale data for blue water scarcity (BWS), the water stress index (WSI), the available water remaining (AWaRe), basin internal evaporation recycling (BIER) ratios and the water depletion index (WDI) were also considered, as these have particular relevance for life cycle assessment and water footprint studies. All of the indices indicate that global copper resources are more exposed to water risks than lead-zinc or nickel resources, in part due to the large copper endowment of countries such as Chile and Peru that experience high water criticality, stress and scarcity. Copper resources are located in regions where water consumption is more likely to contribute to long-term decreases in water availability and also where evaporation is less likely to re-precipitate in the same drainage basin to cause surface-runoff or groundwater recharge. The global resource datasets were also assessed against regional Koppen-Geiger climate classifications for the observed period 1951-2000 and changes to 2100 using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's AlFI, A2, B1 and B2 emission scenarios. The results indicate that regions containing copper resources are also more exposed to likely changes in climate than those containing lead-zinc or nickel resources. Overall, regions containing 27-32% (473-574 Mt Cu) of copper, 17-29% (139-241 Mt Pb + Zn) of lead-zinc and 6-13% (19-39 Mt Ni) of nickel resources may have a major climate re-classification as a result of anthropogenic climate change. A further 15-23% (262-412 Mt) of copper, 23-32% (195-270 Mt) of lead-zinc and 29-32% (84-94 Mt) of nickel are exposed to regional precipitation or temperature sub-classification changes. These climate changes are likely to alter the water balance, water quality and infrastructure risks at mining and mineral processing operations. Effective management of long-term changes to mine site water and climate risks requires the further adoption of anticipatory risk management strategies.

Long-term Changes in Grassland Soil Phosphorus with Fertilizer Application and Withdrawal	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Long-term phosphorus (P) applications can increase soil P concentrations in excess of agronomic optima, posing a risk to water quality. Once fertilization stops, however, it may take time for soil P concentrations to decline. Whereas P fertilization adds orthophosphate, little is known about changes in other soil P forms during P buildup and drawdown. This study examined changes in P pools (total P, Olsen P, Mehlich P, and waterextractable P) and P forms determined by P-31-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (P-NMR) in grazed grassland plots from Northern Ireland. Between 1994 and 1999, all plots received 8.3 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1) with variable rates of nitrogen (100-500 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)). From 2000 to 2005, plots received 0, 20, 40, or 80 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1) and 250 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1); from 2005 to 2010, no P fertilizer was applied to any plots. In 2005, soil P pool concentrations at the highest P fertilization rates were significantly elevated compared with those in 2000 but had decreased to 2000 concentrations by 2010. In soils receiving no P, soil P pool concentrations were significantly lower than those in 1994 only in 2010. There were few changes in P forms determined by P-NMR. Orthophosphate followed the same trend observed for the soil P pools; total organic P, total inositol phosphates, and total orthophosphate monoesters and diesters were highest in 2010 in the soil receiving no P fertilizer for 10 yr. For these soils, fertilizer application and cessation influenced inorganic P more than organic P.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				MAY-JUN	2017	46	3					537	545		10.2134/jeq2016.09.0373								WOS:000404385100008	28724086

Nitrate Leaching from Winter Cereal Cover Crops Using Undisturbed Soil-Column Lysimetersle	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Cover crops are important management practices for reducing nitrogen (N) leaching, especially in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, which is under total maximum daily load (TMDL) restraints. Winter cereals are common cool-season crops in the Bay watershed, but studies have not directly compared nitrate-N (NO3-N) leaching losses from these species. A 3-yr cover crop lysimeter study was conducted in Beltsville, MD, to directly compare NO3-N leaching from a commonly grown cultivar of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), rye (Secale cereale L.), and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), along with a no-cover control, using eight tension-drained undisturbed soil column lysimeters in a completely randomized design with two replicates. The lysimeters were configured to exclude runoff and to estimate NO3-N leaching and flow-weighted NO3-N concentration (FWNC). The temporal pattern of NO3-N leaching showed a consistent highly significant (p < 0.001) effect of lower NO3-N leaching with cover crops compared with no cover but showed only small and periodically significant (p < 0.05) effects among the cultivars of barley, rye, and wheat covers. Nitrate-N leaching was more affected by the quantity of establishmentseason (mid-October to mid-December) precipitation than by cover crop species. For example, compared with no cover, winter cereal covers reduced NO3-N leaching 95% in a dry year and 50% in wet years, with corresponding reductions in FWNC of 92 and 43%, respectively. These results are important for scientists, nutrient managers, and policymakers because they directly compare NO3-N leaching from winter cereal covers and expand knowledge for developing management practices for winter cereals that can improve water quality and increase N efficiency in cropping systems.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				MAY-JUN	2017	46	3					576	584		10.2134/jeq2016.09.0372								WOS:000404385100013	28724087

Hydrology and Soil Manipulations of Iron-Rich Ditch Mesocosms Provide Little Evidence of Phosphorus Capture within the Profile	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Agricultural drainage ditches function as first-order streams and affect nutrient management. Soil mesocosms from a ditch featuring a vertical (increasing upward) gradient in iron (Fe) and phosphorus (P) were subjected to hydraulic and soil treatments. These manipulations mimicked aspects of dredging and controlled drainage and inspected the soil release and retention of P. Treatments did not remove P from simulated groundwater. Throughput water either gained in P (lack of dredging, especially under Fe-reducing conditions) or had P concentrations indistinguishable from input water (dredging). Undredged mesocosms, when Fe-reducing, released Fe and P simultaneously. Simultaneous release of P and Fe from our Fereducing mesocosms indicates a mechanism whereby P capture occurs by Fe precipitation upon emergence to aerated surficial waters. Upwelling and surficial phases of ditch hydrology and the lowering of the ditch surface on dredging complicate interpretation of traditional means of describing ditch P retention and release.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				MAY-JUN	2017	46	3					596	604		10.2134/jeq2016.10.0397								WOS:000404385100015	28724096

The Chinese government established national total emission control (TEC) policies related to the nation's surface water quality over the past 10 yr to restore, protect, and promote healthy water quality. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of China's TEC policies by analyzing three water quality constituents (ammonium nitrogen [NH4-N], dissolved oxygen [DO], and the permanganate index [CODMn]) at 73 monitoring stations, which account for most of the surface waters of eastern China. The seasonal Mann-Kendall test revealed that approximately 60, 50, and 65% of stations had nonsignificant trends for CODMn, NH4-N, and DO, respectively. Concentrations of CODMn and NH4-N significantly (a = 0.05) decreased by 27.4 and 38.4% at the monitoring stations over the 11-yr study period, whereas DO significantly (a = 0.05) increased by 24.7%. Correlation analysis indicated that the water quality improved at approximately 30% (CODMn) and 20% (NH4-N) of monitoring sites with the reduction of water pollutant emissions from industrial sources. A seasonal pattern was observed for the three water quality parameters at most of the stations but not at a regional scale. Results also indicated that CODMn concentrations decreased significantly (alpha = 0.05) at most river stations but increased significantly (alpha = 0.05) at nearly all lake stations, suggesting that TEC in China might be more effective for rivers than for lakes and reservoirs. Although there are many nonsignificant relationships with the water quality constituents selected as top pollutants in China, a few noticeable significant relationships were established.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				MAY-JUN	2017	46	3					605	613		10.2134/jeq2016.10.0404								WOS:000404385100016	28724101

Yellow Perch (Perca flavescens) Mercury Unaffected by Wildland Fires in Northern Minnesota	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Wildland fire can alter mercury (Hg) cycling on land and in adjacent aquatic environments. In addition to enhancing local atmospheric Hg redeposition, fire can influence terrestrial movement of Hg and other elements into lakes via runoff from burned upland soil. However, the impact of fire on water quality and the accumulation of Hg in fish remain equivocal. We investigated the effects of fire-specifically, a low-severity prescribed fire and moderate-severity wildfire-on youngof- the-year yellow perch (Perca flavescens) and lake chemistry in a small remote watershed in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in northeastern Minnesota. We used a paired watershed approach: the fire-affected watershed was compared with an adjacent, unimpacted (reference) watershed. Prior to fire, upland organic horizons in the two study watersheds contained 1549 mu g Hg m(-2) on average. Despite a 19% decrease in upland organic horizon Hg stocks due to the moderate severity wildfire fire, fish Hg accumulation and lake productivity were not affected by fire in subsequent years. Instead, climate and lake water levels were the strongest predictors of lake chemistry and fish responses in our study lakes over 9 yr. Our results suggest that low-to moderate-severity wildland fire does not alter lake productivity or Hg accumulation in young-of-the-year yellow perch in these small, shallow lakes in the northern deciduous and boreal forest region.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				MAY-JUN	2017	46	3					623	631		10.2134/jeq2016.10.0418								WOS:000404385100018	28724108

Land Use and Field Boundary Database Development and Structure	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Conservation planning information is important for identifying options for watershed water quality improvement and can be developed for use at field, farm, and watershed scales. Translation across scales is a key issue impeding progress at watershed scales because watershed improvement goals must be connected with implementation of farm-and field-level conservation practices to demonstrate success. This is particularly true when examining alternatives for "trap and treat" practices implemented at agricultural-field edges to control (or influence) water flows through fields, landscapes, and riparian corridors within agricultural watersheds. We propose that database structures used in developing conservation planning information can achieve translation across conservation-planning scales, and we developed the Agricultural Conservation Planning Framework (ACPF) to enable practical planning applications. The ACPF comprises a planning concept, a database to facilitate field-level and watershed-scale analyses, and an ArcGIS toolbox with Python scripts to identify specific options for placement of conservation practices. This paper appends two prior publications and describes the structure of the ACPF database, which contains land use, crop history, and soils information and is available for download for 6091 HUC12 watersheds located across Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, and parts of Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, and Wisconsin and comprises information on 2.74 x 10(6) agricultural fields (available through http://northcentralwater.org/acpf/). Sample results examining land use trends across Iowa and Illinois are presented here to demonstrate potential uses of the database. While designed for use with the ACPF toolbox, users are welcome to use the ACPF watershed data in a variety of planning and modeling approaches.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				MAY-JUN	2017	46	3					676	686		10.2134/jeq2016.09.0363								WOS:000404385100024	28724111

Microcystis and Cylindrospermopsis are two common harmful cyanobacterial genera detected in freshwater lakes and reservoirs, with microcystins (MCs) and cylindrospermopsin (CYN) as their important metabolites, respectively. In this study, two sets of duplex qPCR systems were developed, one for quantifying potentially-toxigenic Microcystis and Microcystis, and the other one for cylindrospermopsin-producing cyanobacteria and Cylindrospermopsis. The duplex qPCR systems were developed and validated in the laboratory by using 338 samples collected from 29 reservoirs in Taiwan and her offshore islands. Results show that cell numbers of Microcystis and Cylindorspermopsis enumerated with microscopy, and MCs and CYN concentrations measured with the enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay method, correlated well with their corresponding gene copies determined with the qPCR systems (range of coefficients of determination R-2 = 0.392-0.740). The developed qPCR approach may serve as a useful tool for the water industry to diagnose the presence of harmful cyanobacteria and the potential presence of cyanotoxins in source waters.

A water quality index (WQI) is an available tool to approximate the quality of water and facilitate the work of decision-makers by grouping and analyzing numerous parameters with a single numerical classification system. The objective of this study was to develop a WQI for a dam used for irrigation of about 5000 ha of agricultural land. The dam, La Vega, is located in Teuchitlan, Jalisco, Mexico. Seven sites were selected for water sampling and samples were collected in March, June, July, September, and December 2014 in an initial effort to develop a WQI for the dam. The WQI methodology, which was recommended by the Mexican National Water Commission (CNA), was used. The parameters employed to calculate the WQI were pH, electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO), total dissolved solids (TDS), total hardness (TH), alkalinity (Alk), total phosphorous (TP), Cl-, NO3, SO4, Ca, Mg, K, B, As, Cu, and Zn. No significant differences in WQI values were found among the seven sampling sites along the dam. However, seasonal differences in WQI were noted. In March and June, water quality was categorized as poor. By July and September, water quality was classified as medium to good. Quality then decreased, and by December water quality was classified as medium to poor. In conclusion, water treatment must be applied before waters from La Vega dam reservoir can be used for irrigation or other purposes. It is recommended that the water quality at La Vega dam is continually monitored for several years in order to confirm the findings of this short-term study.

The Occurrence and Diversity of Waterborne Fungi in African Aquatic Systems: Their Impact on Water Quality and Human Health	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH												Currently, there is a worldwide growing interest in the occurrence and diversity of fungi and their secondary metabolites in aquatic systems, especially concerning their role in water quality and human health. However, this concern is hampered by the scant information that is available in the literature about aquatic fungi and how they affect water quality. There are only few published reports that link certain species of aquatic fungi to human health. The common aquatic fungal species that have been reported so far in African aquatic systems belong to the hyphomycetes kingdom. This paper thus aims to survey the information about the occurrence and factors that control the distribution of different species of fungi in African aquatic systems, as well as their effect on water quality and the possible metabolic pathways that lead to the formation of toxic secondary metabolites that are responsible for the deterioration of water quality. This review will also investigate the analytical and bioanalytical procedures that have been reported for the identification of different species of waterborne fungi and their secondary metabolites.

Levels and Distribution of Pollutants in the Waters of an Aquatic Ecosystem in Northern Mexico	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH												The availability of good quality water resources is essential to ensure healthy crops and livestock. The objective of this study was to evaluate the level of pollution in Bustillos Lagoon in northern Mexico. Physical-chemical parameters like sodium, chloride, sulfate, electrical conductivity, nitrates, and the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) were analyzed to determine the water quality available in the lagoon. Although DDT has been banned in several countries, it is still used for agricultural purposes in Mexico and its presence in this area had not been analyzed previously. Bustillos Lagoon was divided into three zones for the evaluation: (1) industrial; (2) communal lands; and (3) agricultural. The highest concentrations of sodium (2360 mg/L) and SAR (41 meq/L) reported in the industrial zone are values exceeding the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) irrigation water quality guidelines. DDT and its metabolites were detected in all of the 21 sites analyzed, in the agricultural zone Sigma DDTs = 2804 ng/mL, this level is much higher than those reported for other water bodies in Mexico and around the world where DDT has been used heavily. The water in the communal zone is the least contaminated, but can only be recommended for irrigation of plants with high stress tolerance and not for crops.																	1660-4601					MAY	2017	14	5							456	10.3390/ijerph14050456								WOS:000404106400004

However, describing the overall groundwater quality condition-particularly in a mining basin-is more complicated due to the spatial variability of multiple contaminants and the wide range of indicators found in these areas. This study applies a geographic information system (GIS)-based groundwater quality index (GQI) to assess water quality in a mining basin. The study synthesized nine different water quality parameters available-nitrate, sulphate, chloride, sodium, magnesium, calcium, dissolved mineral solids, potassium, and floride (NO3-, SO42-, Cl-, Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, DMS, K+ and F-)-from 90 boreholes across the basin by indexing them numerically relative to the World Health Organization standards. The study compared data from 2006 and 2011. The produced map indicated a lower GQI of 67 in 2011 compared to 72 in 2006. The maximum GQI of 84.4 calculated using only three parameters (Mg2+, K+ and F-) compared well with the GQI of 84.6 obtained using all nine parameters. A noticeable declining groundwater quality trend was observed in most parts of the basin, especially in the south-western and the northern parts of the basin. The temporal variation between the GQIs for 2006 and 2011 indicated variable groundwater quality (coefficient of variation = 15-30%) in areas around the mining field, and even more variability (coefficient of variation >30%) in the south-western and eastern parts of the basin.																	2071-1050					MAY	2017	9	5							823	10.3390/su9050823								WOS:000404127800148

In this study, a long-term (3.7 years) investigation experiment was conducted to estimate the sustainability of a constructed wetland (CW) under the impact of aquatic organisms overloading. The situation of aquatic organisms overloading in this study meant that around 27,000 kg of fishes had to be moved and accommodated in a 4 ha water area of wetland for six months. Experimental results indicated that the pH value of CW water was slightly acidic and the Dissolved Oxygen (DO) level decreased under the impact. On the other hand, the levels of Electrical Conductivity (EC), Suspended Solids (SS), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), and Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN) of CW water were increased under the impact. The pathogen analysis revealed that total coliforms, Salmonella spp., Enterococcus spp., and Escherichia coli, in the wetland water increased under the impact. The analyzed factors of water quality and amount of pathogens were all returned to their original statuses soon after the impact ended. Eventually, the results of microbial community structure analysis showed that overloading of aquatic organisms slightly increased the specific richness (R) of wetland bacteria, whereas higher structural biodiversity (H) of CW could stabilize the whole microbial community and prevent the pathogens or other bacteria from increasing to become the dominant strains. These results were novel and could be possible to conclude that a CW environment could not only stabilize the water quality and amount of pathogens resulting from the impact of aquatic organisms overloading, but also they could stabilize the microbial community structures, allowing the biogeochemical cycles of the CW to function. They could provide the useful information for wetland sustainability.

Optimum Returns from Greenhouse Vegetables under Water Quality and Risk Constraints in the UAE	SUSTAINABILITY												Greenhouses have been used in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to produce vegetables that contribute toward UAE food security, including offering fresh vegetable produce in the off-season. However, to manage such greenhouses, farmers face both technical and environmental limitations (i.e., high water scarcity), as well as vegetable market price instability. The objective of this study is to explore tradeoffs between returns (i.e., gross margin) of selected vegetables (tomato, pepper, and cucumber), risk (deviation from gross margin means), and an environmental constraint (water salinity) using a unique target MOTAD (minimization of total absolute deviations) approach to support UAE farmer decision-making processes. The optimal target MOTAD solution included all three vegetables and no corner solution. The results showed tradeoffs between returns and risks, and confirmed that product diversification reduces overall risk. The analysis was consistent with farmer perceptions based on a survey of 78 producers in the region. The search for the optimal mix of vegetable production under UAE greenhouse conditions revealed that reduction in tomato production should be offset by an increase in cucumber production while maintaining a constant level of pepper production. In other words, risk is reduced as cucumber production increases due to the high level of tomato and lettuce price volatility as the alternative to cucumber. The results also demonstrated the importance of the water salinity environmental constraint, as it was found to have a positive marginal value in the optimal vegetable mix solution (i.e., important factor). Thus the optimal solution was highly sensitive to changes in the crop water salinity constraint. The study results also demonstrate that the target MOTAD approach is a suitable optimization methodology. As a practical approach, a decision-maker in the UAE can consider gross margin (total revenue-variable costs) maximization with risk and water quality constraints to find the optimal vegetable product mix under greenhouse conditions.

An Analysis of Multiyear Measurements	SUSTAINABILITY												It has become increasingly important to study the urban heat island phenomenon due to the adverse effects on summertime cooling energy demand, air and water quality and most importantly, heat-related illness and mortality. The present article analyses the magnitude and the characteristics of the urban heat island in Sydney, Australia. Climatic data from six meteorological stations distributed around the greater Sydney region and covering a period of 10 years are used. It is found that both strong urban heat island (UHI) and oasis phenomena are developed. The average maximum magnitude of the phenomena may exceed 6 K. The intensity and the characteristics of the phenomena are strongly influenced by the synoptic weather conditions and in particular the development of the sea breeze and the westerly winds from the desert area. The magnitude of the urban heat island varies between 0 and 11 degrees C, as a function of the prevailing weather conditions. The urban heat island mainly develops during the warm summer season while the oasis phenomenon is stronger during the winter and intermediate seasons. Using data from an extended network of stations the distribution of Cooling Degree Days in the greater Sydney area is calculated. It is found that because of the intense development of the UHI, Cooling Degree Days in Western Sydney are about three times higher than in the Eastern coastal zone. The present study will help us to better design and implement urban mitigation strategies to counterbalance the impact of the urban heat island in the city.

Chemical depletion-enrichment profiles of soils, combined with regolith thickness and groundwater data indicate the importance to stream hydrochemistry of incongruent dissolution of silicate minerals during deep bedrock weathering, which is primarily limited by water fluxes, in this highly fractured, young volcanic terrain. Under high flow conditions (e.g., spring snowmelt), wetting of soil and regolith surfaces and presence of organic acids promote mineral dissolution and provide a constant supply of base cations, Si, and DIC to soil water and groundwater. Mixing of waters from different hydrochemical reservoirs in the near stream environment during wet periods leads to the chemostatic behavior of DIC, base cations, and Si in stream flow. Metals transported by organic matter complexation (i.e., Ge, Al) and/or colloids (i.e., Al) during periods of soil saturation and lateral connectivity to the stream display a positive relationship with Q. Variable Si-Q relationships, under all but the highest flow conditions, can be explained by nonconservative transport and precipitation of clay minerals, which influences long versus short-term Si weathering fluxes. By combining measurements of the CZ obtained across different spatial and temporal scales, we were able to constrain weathering processes in different hydrological reservoirs that may be flushed to the stream during hydrologic events, thereby informing C-Q relationships.

Toward mountains without permanent snow and ice	EARTHS FUTURE												The cryosphere in mountain regions is rapidly declining, a trend that is expected to accelerate over the next several decades due to anthropogenic climate change. A cascade of effects will result, extending from mountains to lowlands with associated impacts on human livelihood, economy, and ecosystems. With rising air temperatures and increased radiative forcing, glaciers will become smaller and, in some cases, disappear, the area of frozen ground will diminish, the ratio of snow to rainfall will decrease, and the timing and magnitude of both maximum and minimum streamflow will change. These changes will affect erosion rates, sediment, and nutrient flux, and the biogeochemistry of rivers and proglacial lakes, all of which influence water quality, aquatic habitat, and biotic communities. Changes in the length of the growing season will allow low-elevation plants and animals to expand their ranges upward. Slope failures due to thawing alpine permafrost, and outburst floods from glacier-and moraine-dammed lakes will threaten downstream populations.Societies even well beyond the mountains depend on meltwater from glaciers and snow for drinking water supplies, irrigation, mining, hydropower, agriculture, and recreation. Here, we review and, where possible, quantify the impacts of anticipated climate change on the alpine cryosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere, and consider the implications for adaptation to a future of mountains without permanent snow and ice.

Understanding the dominant processes shaping eutrophication processes is crucial to sustainable water management in lake catchments. The aim of the study was to determine the importance of elements of lake-catchment system structures in the processes of shaping lake water quality. The values of loads delivered to the lake basins from their catchments as well as nutrient output were calculated on the basis of stream discharge and nutrient concentration. A range of hydro-chemical influences of each stream was presented by means of a range of a radius. A model of nutrient transport (prepared in GIS software) was used in the catchment of a lake without tributaries. Additionally, phytoplankton abundance and water quality indices were calculated. The results showed a clear pattern for the following lakes, Syczynskie > Pniowno > Chuteckie > Tarnowskie, in terms of nutrient load as well as water quality. The hydrochemical influence of lake tributaries was determined by runoff processes, which reflected catchment geology, relief, and flushing time. The Q index showed a good ecological status for lakes Chuteckie and Tarnowskie, moderate for Lake Pniowno, and poor for Lake Syczynskie.

Water samples were collected between 2007 and 2008 from 8 sites along a 510 km downstream transect of the NR, and chemical and isotopic compositions of the water samples were evaluated to identify natural and anthropogenic sources contributing to the water chemistry of the NR. The results showed that the major ion concentrations were mainly controlled by chemical weathering that occurred in the watershed, in which a silicate weathering is more dominant than a carbonate weathering. The Sr-87/(86) Sr ratios of the water samples were in a range from 0.71043 to 0.71520 within those of the Mesozoic volcanogenic sedimentary rocks long developed in the watershed, thereby supporting the fact that the water chemistry is governed by a chemical weathering. The delta S-34 values varied in a narrow range of 1.8-3.1%, regardless of spatial and seasonal variations. Mass balance calculations indicated that the contributions of chemical weathering and anthropogenic sources during summer time increased along a downstream transect, from 67.3 +/- 1.3 to 73.6 +/- 0.5% and from 6.0 to 15.7%, respectively. In contrast, the contribution of chemical weathering during winter time decreased from 82.7 +/- 0.8 to 72.5 +/- 0.3%, while anthropogenic contribution increased up to 22.2%. These results indicated that the water chemistry of the NR was mainly caused by a chemical weathering, followed by anthropogenic inputs and rainwater. This study will provide baseline information for comparing the water quality issue before and after the implementation of the Four Rivers Restoration Project of South Korea.

To determine the environmental benefit of lowering soil P fertility, a meta-analysis of the relationship between soil test P (measured as Olsen-P) and P concentrations in agricultural drainflow and surface runoff in mostly UK soils was undertaken in relation to current eutrophication control targets (30-35 mu g P L-1). At agronomic-optimum Olsen P (16-25 mg kg(-1)), concentrations of soluble reactive P (SRP), total dissolved P (TDP), total P (TP) and sediment-P (SS-P) in runoff were predicted by linear regression analysis to vary between 24 and 183 mu g L-1, 38 and 315 mu g L-1, 0.2 and 9.6 mg L-1, and 0.31 and 3.2 g kg(-1), respectively. Concentrations of SRP and TDP in runoff were much more sensitive to changes in Olsen-P than were TP and SS-P concentrations, which confirms that separate strategies are required for mitigating the mobilisation of dissolved and particulate P forms. As the main driver of eutrophication, SRP concentrations in runoff were reduced on average by 60 mg L-1 (71%) by lowering soil Olsen-P from optimum (25 mg kg(-1)) to 10 mg kg(-1). At Olsen-P concentrations below 12 mg kg(-1), dissolved hydrolysable P (largely organic) became the dominant form of soluble P transported. We concluded that maintaining agronomic-optimum Olsen-P could still pose a eutrophication risk, and that a greater research focus on reducing critical soil test P through innovative agro-engineering of soils, crops and fertilisers would give long-term benefits in reducing the endemic eutrophication risk arising from legacy soil P. Soil P testing should become compulsory in priority catchments suffering, or sensitive to, eutrophication to ensure soil P reserves are fully accounted for as part of good fertiliser and manure management.																	1748-9326					MAY	2017	12	6							063001	10.1088/1748-9326/aa69fc								WOS:000402550800001

Biofilm composition in the Olt River (Romania) reservoirs impacted by a chlor-alkali production plant	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS												Freshwater biofilms can be useful indicators of water quality and offer the possibility to assess contaminant effects at the community level. The present field study examines the effects of chlor-alkali plant effluents on the community composition of biofilms grown in the Olt River (Romania) reservoirs. The relationship between ambient water quality variables and community composition alterations was explored. Amplicon sequencing revealed a significant modification of the composition of microalgal, bacterial and fungal communities in the biofilms collected in the impacted reservoirs in comparison with those living in the uncontaminated control reservoir. The abundance corrected Simpson index showed lower richness and diversity in biofilms collected in the impacted reservoirs than in the control reservoir. The biofilm bacterial communities of the impacted reservoirs were characterized by the contaminant-tolerant Cyanobacteria and Bacteroidetes, whereas microalgal communities were predominantly composed of Bacillariophyta and fungal communities of Lecanoromycetes and Paraglomycetes. A principal component analysis revealed that major contaminants present in the waste water of the chlor-alkali production plant, i.e. Na+, Ca2+, Cl- and Hg, were correlated with the alteration of biofilm community composition in the impacted reservoirs. However, the biofilm composition was also influenced by water quality variables such as NO3-, SO42-, DOC and Zn from unknown sources. The results of the present study imply that, even when below the environmental quality standards, typical contaminants of chlor-alkali plant releases may affect biofilm composition and that their impacts on the microbial biodiversity might be currently overlooked.

The extent of water eutrophication of this segment was also assessed using a universal index formula for eutrophic evaluation and a logarithmic power function. The results showed that the average concentration of total N (TN) was 27.2 mg/L (NH3-N, 63.5%), total P (TP) was 2.0 mg/L (solution reactive phosphorus, 68.8%). Temporal and spatial variations of N and P in this segment were observed. Concentrations of N and P in the arid season were higher than those in the rainy season. Spatially, the N and P concentrations followed the same trend; i.e., higher in the city segment than in the suburbs, and decreasing along the river. The water eutrophication in the studied segment reached extremely high levels at all times (eutrophication index >76.3). Spatially, its trend was clearly linked with N and P. Water shortage, pollution accumulation and a weak self-purification function are the main reasons for the prominent eutrophication in this segment.

The fruits' physical attributes, physicochemical attributes, nutritional attributes, mineral content as well as consumers' acceptance were evaluated. The properties of the different water sources and their effect, on both the soil and the quality of the fruits, were evaluated. Analysis of the irrigation water revealed that treated waste water was of acceptable quality with reference to irrigation water quality guidelines, while the lake water used for irrigation fell short in several aspects. The different water sources used for irrigation in the farms affected the soil geochemical properties significantly. The quality of guavas harvested from the farms that were irrigated with different water sources was significantly different.

Alternative futures of dissolved inorganic nitrogen export from the Mississippi River Basin: influence of crop management, atmospheric deposition, and population growth	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Nitrogen (N) export from the Mississippi River Basin contributes to seasonal hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). We explored monthly dissolved inorganic N (DIN) export to the GOM for a historical year (2002) and two future scenarios (year 2022) by linking macroeonomic energy, agriculture market, air quality, and agriculture land management models to a DIN export model. Future scenarios considered policies aimed at encouraging bioenergy crop production and reducing atmospheric N-emissions, as well as the effect of population growth and the states' infrastructure plans on sewage fluxes. Model-derived DIN export decreased by about 9% (from 279 to 254 kg N km(-2) year(-1)) between 2002 and 2022 due to a 28% increase in area planted with corn, 24% improvement in crop N-recovery efficiency (NRE, to 0.52), 22% reduction in atmospheric N deposition, and 23% increase in sewage inputs. Changes in atmospheric and sewage inputs had a relatively small effect on DIN export and the effect of bioenergy crop production depended on nutrient management practices. Without improved NRE, increased production of corn would have increased DIN export by about 14% (to 289 kg N km(-2) year(-1)) between 2002 and 2022. Model results suggest that meeting future crop demand while reducing the areal extent of hypoxia could require aggressive actions, such improving basin-level crop NRE to 0.62 or upgrading N-removal capabilities in waste water treatment plants beyond current plans. Tile-drained cropland could contribute up to half of DIN export; thus, practices that reduce N losses from tile drains could also have substantial benefit.

Impact of seasonal changes in stream metabolism on nitrate concentrations in an urban stream	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Nitrate (NO3-) dynamics in urban streams differ from many natural streams due to stormwater runoff, sewage inputs, decreased groundwater discharge, often limited hyporheic exchange, increased primary productivity, and limited carbon input. We investigated NO3- dynamics in a first-order urban stream in Syracuse, NY, which has urbanized headwaters and a geomorphologically natural downstream section. Twice-monthly water sampling, NO3- injection tests, NO3- isotopic analysis, filamentous algae mat density, and riparian shading were used to identify processes regulating NO3- dynamics in the stream over a 12-month period. The urban headwater reach had low NO3- (0.006-0.2 mg N/L) in the spring through fall, with a minimum uptake length of 900 m, no canopy cover, and high algae mat density. The downstream natural reach (100% canopy cover during the summer and low algae mat density) had nitrate concentrations between 0.6 and 1.2 mg N/L from winter to summer, which decreased during autumn leaf-off. In the urban reach, autotrophic uptake by filamentous green algae is a major NO3- sink in summer. In the natural reach, the addition of organic matter to the stream at leaf-off led to a decrease in NO3- concentration followed by an increase in NO3- concentration in winter as gross primary productivity decreased. This study shows that the balance between autotrophy and heterotrophy in urban streams is variable and depends on an interplay of drivers such as temperature, light, and carbon inputs that are mediated by the riparian ecosystem.

THE MECHANISMS OF NICKEL TOXICITY IN AQUATIC ENVIRONMENTS: AN ADVERSE OUTCOME PATHWAY ANALYSIS	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Current ecological risk assessment and water quality regulations for nickel (Ni) use mechanistically based, predictive tools such as biotic ligand models (BLMs). However, despite many detailed studies, the precise mechanism(s) of Ni toxicity to aquatic organisms remains elusive. This uncertainty in the mechanism(s) of action for Ni has led to concern over the use of tools like the BLM in some regulatory settings. To address this knowledge gap, the authors used an adverse outcome pathway (AOP) analysis, the first AOP for a metal, to identify multiple potential mechanisms of Ni toxicity and their interactions with freshwater aquatic organisms. The analysis considered potential mechanisms of action based on data from a wide range of organisms in aquatic and terrestrial environments on the premise that molecular initiating events for an essential metal would potentially be conserved across taxa. Through this analysis the authors identified 5 potential molecular initiating events by which Ni may exert toxicity on aquatic organisms: disruption of Ca2+ homeostasis, disruption of Mg2+ homeostasis, disruption of Fe2+/3+ homeostasis, reactive oxygen species-induced oxidative damage, and an allergic-type response of respiratory epithelia. At the organ level of biological organization, these 5 potential molecular initiating events collapse into 3 potential pathways: reduced Ca2+ availability to support formation of exoskeleton, shell, and bone for growth; impaired respiration; and cytotoxicity and tumor formation. At the level of the whole organism, the organ-level responses contribute to potential reductions in growth and reproduction and/or alterations in energy metabolism, with several potential feedback loops between each of the pathways. Overall, the present AOP analysis provides a robust framework for future directed studies on the mechanisms of Ni toxicity and for developing AOPs for other metals.

THE TOXICITY OF CREOSOTE-TREATED WOOD TO PACIFIC HERRING EMBRYOS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS NEAR CREOSOTED PILINGS IN JUNEAU, ALASKA	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from creosote exposure in the laboratory resulted in deleterious effects in developing Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) embryos, and potentially toxic concentrations of PAHs were measured using passive water samplers at 1 of 3 harbor field sites in Juneau, Alaska, USA. Aqueous total PAH concentrations of 4.6 mu g/L and 8.4 mu g/L from creosote exposure resulted in skeletal defects and ineffective swimming in hatched larvae in the laboratory (10% effective concentrations) and were the most sensitive parameters measured. Hatch rates also suffered from creosote exposure in a dose-dependent manner: at exposures between 5 mu g/L and 50 mu g/L total PAH, 50% of the population failed to hatch. Comparisons between laboratory and field deployed passive samplers suggested that for at least 1 harbor in Juneau, concentrations sufficient to induce teratogenic effects were found directly on creosoted pilings, within 10 cm of them, and sometimes at a distance of 10 m. Total PAH concentrations generally decreased with distance from creosoted pilings. Creosote pilings contribute to the PAH load within a marina and can rise to PAH concentrations that are harmful to fish embryos, but at a scale that is localized in the environment.

It analyses the temporal and spatial distributions and utilisation of underground water according to the main components and corresponding water quality standards for underground water. Thereby, it can provide a scientific basis for the development, utilisation, planning, and management of groundwater resources. Set pair analysis (SPA), based on the improved five-element connectivity degree, was used in this research to establish a comprehensive evaluation model of water quality, so as to evaluate the groundwater quality in XuChang, Henan Province, China. Meanwhile, fuzzy evaluation was also used to measure groundwater quality. As demonstrated in the research results, SPA is proven to be convenient and useful with objective and stable results, it therefore is an effective approach with which to evaluate groundwater quality. In addition, the results obtained using SPA matched those from fuzzy comprehensive evaluation; it was concluded, based on the analysis, that the groundwater in XuChang was severely polluted. The groundwater quality at the observation points located in the lower reaches is poorer than that of the upper reaches; hazardous substances permeate underground to pollute shallow groundwater through decomposition and loss due to weathering and rainfall.																	1606-9749					MAY	2017	17	3					632	642		10.2166/ws.2016.135								WOS:000401654600002

However, little information exists on the effects of cistern materials and construction methods on water quality. This study assessed the quality of rainwater and harvested rainwater stored in different types of cisterns, using multivariate statistical analysis techniques. The harvesting system consisted of ditches underground to direct the water stream collected by catchments through pipes to the two-stage grit chambers, the rainwater runoff ultimately being fed into the cisterns. Water samples were collected monthly over 6 months from October 2008 to April 2009. The harvested rainwater generally did not meet drinking water standards due to severe bacterial contamination. To determine the factors affecting water quality, principal components and factor analysis divided the water's physicochemical composition into four principal components: ions, suspended pollutants, reducing substances, and acidity-alkalinity, which collectively accounted for 80.4% of the total variance. Cluster analysis confirmed the results. It was determined that pollutants in harvested rainwater were mainly derived from the catchments, surrounding fields, and local atmosphere. Furthermore, factor scores ranked water quality to select the optimum material and construction method. It was concluded that cement was superior to stabilized soil for rainwater storage. However, considering water quality, cost, and environmental friendliness the stabilized soil cistern using the stiff construction method was worthy of consideration.

In-stream detection of waterborne priority pollutants, and applications in drinking water contaminant warning systems	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												Advancements in real-time water monitoring technologies permit rapid detection of in-stream, inpipe water quality, and alert of threats from waste loads. Legislation mandating the establishment of water resources monitoring, presence of hazardous contaminants in effluents, and perception of the vulnerability of the water distribution system to attacks, have spurred technical and economic interest. Alternatively to traditional analyzers, chemosensors operate according to physical principles, without sample collection (online), and are capable of supplying parameter values continuously and in real-time. This review paper contains a comprehensive survey of existing and expected online monitoring technologies for measurement/detection of pollutants in water. The state-of-the-art in online water monitoring and contaminant warning systems is presented. Application examples are reported. Monitoring costs will become a lesser part of a water utility budget due to the fact that automation and technological simplification will abate human cost factors, and reduce the complexity of laboratory procedures.																	1606-9749					MAY	2017	17	3					707	725		10.2166/ws.2016.168								WOS:000401654600009

Removal of aluminium and iron from surface water by conventional water treatment	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												Detailed source water monitoring showed large variations in the total concentrations of aluminium and iron in the Vaal Dam, South Africa, which were highlighted as a specific concern for one of the largest drinking water treatment plants in South Africa. This study aimed to better understand the presence of these metals in the source water, removal of these metals through the conventional treatment process, and final water quality trends, for the period 2008 to 2014. Aluminium and iron concentrations were highly variable and showed significant influence on colour and turbidity in source water. Sedimentation performed well, and removed over 70% of the metal concentration from the raw water. Filtration removed 15% of the remaining aluminium and iron concentrations. The pH and turbidity of the final water had minor effects on the metal concentration in the final water. The conventional treatment process was shown to be capable of removing aluminium and iron from the source water as both were within water quality limits in the final water. This study highlighted the importance of source water quality monitoring and treatment plant efficacy in evaluating whether the current treatment technology is appropriate for current and future challenges.																	1606-9749					MAY	2017	17	3					733	744		10.2166/ws.2016.170								WOS:000401654600011						
J	Abo-Monasar, A; Al-Zahrani, M				Abo-Monasar, Amin; Al-Zahrani, Muhammad			Framework for water quality monitoring system in water distribution networks based on vuinerability and population sensitivity risks	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												Delivering water in sufficient quantity and acceptable quality is the main objective of water distribution networks (WDN) and at the same time is the main challenge. Many factors affect the delivery of water through distribution networks. Some of these factors are relevant to water quality, quantity and the condition of the infrastructure itself. The deterioration of water quality in the WDN leads to failure at the water quality level, which can be critical because it is closest to the point of delivery and there are virtually no safety barriers before consumption. Accordingly, developing a powerful monitoring system that takes into consideration water demand distribution, the vulnerability of the distribution system and the sensitivity of the population to the deterioration of water quality can be very beneficial and, more importantly, could save lives if there was any deterioration of water quality due to operational failure or cross-contamination events. In this paper, a framework for a water quality monitoring system that considers water demand distribution, the vulnerability of the system and the sensitivity of the population using fuzzy synthetic evaluation and optimization algorithms is developed. The proposed approach has been applied to develop a monitoring system for a real WDN in Saudi Arabia.																	1606-9749					MAY	2017	17	3					811	824		10.2166/ws.2016.174								WOS:000401654600019						
J	Parsaie, A; Haghiabi, AH				Parsaie, Abbas; Haghiabi, Amir Hamzeh			Numerical routing of tracer concentrations in rivers with stagnant zones	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												Modeling pollution transmission in rivers is an important subject in environmental engineering studies. Numerical approaches to modeling pollution transmission in rivers are useful tools for managing the water quality. The advection-dispersion equation is the governing equation in the transport of pollution in rivers. Recently, due to advances in fractional calculus in engineering modeling, the simulation of pollution transmission in rivers has been improved using the fractional derivative approach. In this study, by solving the fractional advection-dispersion equation (FRADE), a numerical model was developed for the simulation of pollution transmission in rivers with stagnant zones. To this purpose, both terms of the FRADE equation (advection and fractional dispersion) were discretized separately and the results were connected using a time-splitting technique. The analytical solution of a modified advection-dispersion equation (MADE) model and observed data from the Severn River in the UK were used to demonstrate the model capabilities. Results indicated that there is a good agreement between observed data, the analytical solution of the MADE model, and the results of the developed numerical model. The developed numerical model can accurately simulate the long-tailed dispersion processes in a natural river.

We manufactured filter disks with varied clay, burn-out material, burn-out material sieved with different mesh sizes, and burn-out material to clay ratios and calculated filter characteristics, including porosity, density, shrinkage, and flow rate. Water was run through filters daily for 4 weeks, and flow rate and Escherichia coli reduction, as measured by log reduction value (LRV), were tested twice weekly. Our results suggest: (1) the first and last LRV test results do not correlate strongly (R-2 = 0.38, p < 0.010); (2) there is not a strong association between flow rate and first, average, or last LRV results (R-2 = 0.17, p = 0.090; R-2 = 0.30, p = 0.020; R-2 = 0.24, p = 0.040); and (3) first and average LRV are associated with burn-out material (R-2 = 0.68, p < 0.001; R-2 = 0.60, p < 0.001), and last LRV is associated with burn-out material and mesh size (R-2 = 0.54, p < 0.050). Recommendations for filter factories, are to: (1) verify filtration efficacy with repeated bacteria reduction tests when materials, processing, or filter characteristics vary; (2) carefully control production variables; and (3) continue flow rate testing each filter to evaluate within and across batch production consistency.																	1606-9749					MAY	2017	17	3					859	869		10.2166/ws.2016.176								WOS:000401654600024

Hydrochemical characterization and suitability assessment of groundwater in Baga-Calangute stretch of Goa, India	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The present study is the first attempt to determine the suitability of groundwater for drinking and irrigation in the Baga-Calangute stretch of Goa. The suitability of groundwater for potable use was assessed by comparing observed values against standards prescribed by the Bureau of Indian Standards, and the quality was classified based on the Weighted Arithmetic Water Quality Index. Most of the groundwater samples (90%) were found to be suitable for drinking except for hardness, chlorides, and nitrates. The percent sodium (%Na), residual sodium carbonate, soluble sodium percentage, sodium adsorption ratio, Kelly's ratio, and Permeability Index were found to be within the prescribed limits for irrigation purposes. The major mechanism controlling groundwater chemistry, i.e., rock-water interaction, was also studied, and it was found that silicate weathering plays a major role in the dissolution of minerals. Based on the hydrochemical characterization, the water was observed to be of the Ca-Na-SO4 composition type except for one sample which was of the Na-Cl composition type. Classification of the meteoric genesis suggested that the groundwater in surficial aquifers in the region had a deep meteoric percolation, and its chemistry is regulated by rock-water interaction.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				MAY	2017	76	9							341	10.1007/s12665-017-6679-5								WOS:000401323600013

Multivariate statistical analysis for the assessment of groundwater quality under different hydrogeological regimes	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Multivariate statistical analysis has been widely used for hydrogeochemical characterization of groundwater quality. In this study, hydrochemical data from three hydrological basins were used and two methods (factor and cluster analyses) were applied. The first area is the coastal area of Eastern Thermaikos Gulf where groundwater is influenced by seawater intrusion and geothermal fluids. The other two areas are the inland basins of Gallikos and Perdikas in which agricultural and industrial activities constitute the main anthropogenic pollution sources of groundwater. Initially, the aforementioned methods were applied for each area separately and resulted in a different number of significant factors and clusters, while the natural and anthropogenic influences were spatially determined in each area. Additionally, factor and cluster analyses were applied coupling data from all areas. Therefore, five clusters and three major factors were determined distinguishing the hydrochemical processes and impacts from anthropogenic activities in more detail. It is worth mentioning that the application of cluster analysis in the coupled groundwater samples of all studied areas resulted beneficially in the most hydrochemically complex area. Salinization dominates in the coastal area, while in Gallikos and Perdikas basins high concentrations of NO3 occur mainly due to agricultural activities and small livestock units. The numerous hydrochemical samples are identified as the main issue for the higher discretization and reliability of the second approach. Nevertheless, this study is associated with a number of limitations of multivariable statistical analysis regarding extreme concentrations of Cl and Na. This issue stimulates further research in overcoming and understanding these drawbacks.

All major groundwater quality descriptors and selected trace elements (iron, manganese, arsenic, and aluminum) were studied. The study demonstrated evidence of higher concentrations of bicarbonates (60-590 mg/L), total iron (2.2-5336 mu g/L), total manganese (0.1-804 mu g/L) and total arsenic (0.4-14.5 mu g/L) in certain samples with low values of Eh (-32.0 to +25.8) and NO3- (<= 8.2 mg/L) against WHO standards. Thirty-six percent of samples were rated as poor using the water quality index (WQI) criteria. No scaling potential was observed using the Langelier analysis. The majority of samples were of the mixed-bicarbonate type with the abundance order of cations as Ca2+>Na+>Mg2+>K+. Carbonate dissolution, silicate weathering and cation exchange were identified as possible main geochemical control mechanisms. The sources responsible for fluoride and nitrate include anthropogenic activities and rock-water interaction. Dissolution/precipitation and pH control the levels of As, Fe and Mn.

Large tracts of the Selenga River Basin have been developed for industry, urbanization, mining, and agriculture, resulting in the release of suspended solids (SS) that affect downstream water quality and primary productivity. This study addressed SS as the main factor controlling pollutant transport and the primary indicator of land degradation in the Selenga River system. Tributaries with larger areas dedicated to agricultural use had higher SS concentrations, reaching 862 mg L-1, especially during the high runoff and intensive cultivation season. Although the large SS flux was detected in the main river, the small tributaries were distinguished by high SS concentrations. The high SS concentration corresponded to widespread development in the watershed. Watersheds with high potential of SS release are sensitive to intensive land uses. SS in the river system had a constant elemental composition consisting mainly of Fe and Al oxides, indicating that surface soils were major constituents of the tributary SS. Three heavymetals (Zn, Cu, and Cr) appeared in high concentrations downstream of urban and mining areas (two-to sixfold increases), indicating that these contaminants are carried by SS. At two tributary junctions, the concentration of contaminants on the SS decreased due to a large influx of SS with low heavy metal contents. Changes in electric conductivity and pH at downstream of tributary junctions enhanced the sedimentation of SS and the removal of contaminants from the water phase after aggregation of the SS. Land use changes in the tributary watersheds are major controlling factors for the fate of contaminants in the river system.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				MAY	2017	76	9							346	10.1007/s12665-017-6664-z								WOS:000401323600018

Assessment of the quality of groundwater from different parts of southeastern Nigeria for potable use	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Groundwater samples from three different states of southeastern Nigeria were analyzed for a range of physicochemical parameters and heavy metal constituents in order to determine their potability as drinking water sources. The results indicate that the physicochemical parameters (pH, temperature, TDS, TH, electrical conductivity, Cl-, NO3- and SO42-) tested for have most of their values fall within the permissible limits given by the Nigerian and World Health Organization standards for drinking water quality. The results also reveal that apart from Cu and Pb the rest of the tested heavy metals (As, Zn, Ni, total Fe, Cd and Mn) recorded values that are significantly above the maximum permissible limits for drinking water purposes and therefore have the potential to cause health impacts for long-term potable use. On the basis of principal component analysis, the sources of the measured chemical constituents are likely to be predominantly geogenic (weathering of soluble minerals in the formations) and partly anthropogenic (industrial effluent, agricultural practices and mining activities). Single-factor ANOVA tests indicated insignificant differences in the datasets within/between states or geological units. Caution or adequate treatment is generally required when utilizing the groundwater from the area for drinking purpose due to the elevated metal concentrations and rating as poor to unsuitable water quality.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				MAY	2017	76	9							344	10.1007/s12665-017-6680-z								WOS:000401323600016

Stormwater is a carrier of non-point source pollutants and contains VOCs from land surfaces and air. Samples of stormwater and influent to sewage treatment plants were collected and analyzed for 61 VOCs, while the VOCs in emission sources, air and groundwater were investigated through literature reviews for comparison. The results showed that the most frequently detected VOCs in stormwater were similar to those in air. However, the atmospheric concentrations of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX), and methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) were too low to explain their frequent detection and high concentrations in stormwater. As a result, land surfaces seem to be a primary source of these VOCs in stormwater. Comparison of the VOCs in stormwater and groundwater showed that toluene and MTBE were frequently detected in both media, but more often and at higher concentrations in stormwater. This finding indicates that stormwater recharge is a source of toluene and MTBE in groundwater. Regarding groundwater, land surfaces seem to be a primary source of toluene, while urban air is the primary source in the case of MTBE. Specifically, the MTBE values in air were sufficiently high to explain its levels in groundwater, which had continually increased and remained low afterward. Furthermore, the high ratios of TEX (toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes) to benzene and MTBE in stormwater indicated that TEX had additional sources other than vehicles, most likely hydrocarbon solvents. These solvents seem to be a primary source of TEX and other frequently detected VOCs in stormwater. However, trichloroethylene (TCE), tetrachloroethylene (PCE) and their dechlorination intermediates were far more frequently detected and at higher concentrations in groundwater than in stormwater. Additionally, their concentrations frequently exceeded the water- quality criteria. It seems that halogenated solvents had produced contamination plumes of these chlorinated VOCs in the Seoul aquifer. Based on VOCs detected in Seoul, stormwater was mixed with groundwater in combined sewers and flowed into sewage treatment plants. The results imply that organic solvents should be handled with extreme care to protect groundwater quality.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				MAY	2017	76	9							338	10.1007/s12665-017-6666-x								WOS:000401323600010

UV-visible spectra were analyzed using the maximum of the second derivative at 225 nm (related to nitrates), specific absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA(254)), and the spectral slope between 275 and 295 nm (S275-295) (related to the aromaticity and molecular weight of dissolved organic carbon). The synchronous fluorescence spectra (wavelength difference = 50 nm) exhibited a high variability in the composition of dissolved organic material between the upstream and downstream sections and also versus time. The principal components analysis of the entire set of synchronous fluorescence spectra helped to define three river sections with different pollution characteristics. Spectral decomposition was applied to the two most upstream sections: five fluorophores, classical in rivers impacted by domestic sewage and related to protein-like (lambda(ex) = 280 nm) and humic-like fluorescence (M-type with lambda(ex) approximate to 305-310 nm and C-type with lambda(ex) >= 335 nm), were identified. The irregular shape of the synchronous fluorescence spectra in the most downstream section is likely due to organic pollutants of industrial origin; however, their variability and the complexity of the spectra did not allow the further elucidation of their nature.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				MAY	2017	189	5							229	10.1007/s10661-017-5933-3								WOS:000401010900026	28435997

Unconventional natural gas development did not result in detectable changes in water chemistry (within the South Fork Little Red River)	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The Fayetteville Shale within north central Arkansas is an area of extensive unconventional natural gas (UNG) production. Recently, the Scott Henderson Gulf Mountain Wildlife Management Area (GMWMA) was leased from the state of Arkansas for NG exploration, raising concerns about potential impacts on water resources. From November 2010 through November 2014, we monitored four reaches of the South Fork Little Red River (SFLRR), within the GMWMA, establishing baseline physico-chemical characteristics prior to UNG development and assessing trends in parameters during and after UNG development. Water samples were collected monthly during baseflow conditions and analyzed for conductivity, turbidity, ions, total organic carbon (TOC), and metals. All parameters were flow-adjusted and evaluated for monotonic changes over time. The concentrations of all constituents measured in the SFLRR were generally low (e.g., nitrate ranged from <0.005 to 0.268 mg/l across all sites and sample periods), suggesting the SFLRR is of high water quality. Flow-adjusted conductivity measurements and sodium concentrations increased at site 1, while magnesium decreased across all four sites, TOC decreased at sites 1 and 3, and iron decreased at site 1 over the duration of the study. With the exception of conductivity and sodium, the physico-chemical parameters either decreased or did not change over the 4-year duration, indicating that UNG activities within the GMWMA have had minimal or no detectable impact on water quality within the SFLRR. Our study provides essential baseline information that can be used to evaluate water quality within the SFLRR in the future should UNG activity within the GMWMA expand.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				MAY	2017	189	5							209	10.1007/s10661-017-5904-8								WOS:000401010900006	28386869

Because of the statistical design, the results of our analyses of Secchi depths (SD) apply to a population of 45,265 lakes. We found statistically significant differences in mean Secchi depths between natural (1.57 m) and man-made lakes (1.18 m). The most important variable correlated with SD was turbidity, an optical measure related to suspended particles in the water column. For most lakes, chlorophyll a was highly correlated with both turbidity and SD, but several lakes had more turbidity and lower SD than expected based on chlorophyll a alone, indicating that non-algal suspended solids were an important factor. On an ecoregion basis, the non-algal suspended solids in the lake waters were related to the average levels of suspended solids in streams located in that ecoregion, and the non-algal suspended solids were more important in man-made than natural lakes. Phosphorus and nitrogen were directly correlated with chlorophyll a and turbidity and inversely correlated with SD. Based on diatom-inferred Secchi depths for the tops and bottoms of sediment cores from lakes in Ecoregions VIII and VII (excluding lakes in Minnesota) representing 40% of the natural lakes in the US, there has been no decrease in water transparency in that population of lakes in the past 70 or more years when the US population increased by 134%. We do not have information to determine if the other 60% of lakes have or have not changed.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				MAY	2017	189	5							206	10.1007/s10661-017-5911-9								WOS:000401010900003	28374189					
J	Karacaoglu, D; Dalkiran, N				Karacaoglu, Didem; Dalkiran, Nurhayat			Epilithic diatom assemblages and their relationships with environmental variables in the Nilufer Stream Basin, Bursa, Turkey	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Patterns of epilithic diatom species distribution in relation to environmental variables from 12 sampling sites on the main stream and some of its tributaries in the Nilufer Stream Basin were determined using multivariate statistical techniques. The stream basin has been heavily influenced by anthropogenic effects. The upper part of the basin that is distant from pollution sources mostly has a spring water quality, while the lower part where the stream flows through the urban area and receives domestic and industrial wastewater has a quite low quality. Ordination techniques using both diatom taxa and 21 environmental variables revealed non-to slightly polluted upper basin sites and highly polluted lower basin sites along the stream. The results showed that the stream catchment is polluted gradually from upstream to downstream and that most of the downstream sites have very low water quality especially in summer months. A total of 134 epilithic diatom taxa belonging to 50 genera were recorded for 12 sample sites. Partial CCA results indicated that water temperature (T), discharge (Q), and total phosphorus (TP) were the most important variables affecting the distribution of diatom species. Unpolluted or slightly polluted upper basin sites were dominated by Achnanthidium minutissimum, Cocconeis placentula var. euglypta, Gomphonema olivaceum, and Navicula tripunctata. Highly polluted lower basin sites were characterized by high levels of organic and inorganic matters and low dissolved oxygen (DO) values. Species widespread in the highly polluted lower basin sites such as Nitzschia umbonata, Nitzschia amphibia, Nitzschia capitellata, Nitzschia palea, Nitzschia paleacea, Luticola mutica, and Stephanodiscus niagarae were mostly related to pollution indicator variables such as ammonium nitrogen (NH4(+)-N), sodium (Na+), total phosphorus (TP), and total organic matter (TOM).																	0167-6369	1573-2959				MAY	2017	189	5							227	10.1007/s10661-017-5929-z								WOS:000401010900024	28432510

However, previous assessments of the urban water quality were predominantly conducted by measuring physical and chemical factors rather than biological monitoring. The purpose of this study was to develop an urban stream multimetric index (USMI) based on benthic macroinvertebrates to assess the health of aquatic ecosystem in Jinan City. Two hundred and eighty-eight samples were collected during two consecutive years (2014-2015) from 48 sites located within the city. Metrics related to the benthic macroinvertebrate richness, diversity, composition and abundance, and functional feeding groups were selected by using box-plots and the Kruskal-Wallis test. The final index derived from selected metrics was divided into five river quality classes (excellent, good, moderate, poor, and bad). A validation procedure using box- plots and the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test showed that the USMI was useful to assess the health of urban streams.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				MAY	2017	189	5							205	10.1007/s10661-017-5920-8								WOS:000401010900002	28374188

Monitoring for a specific management objective: protection of shorebird foraging habitat adjacent to a waste water treatment plant	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Intertidal invertebrates are often used in environmental monitoring programs as they are good indicators of water quality and an important food source for many species of fish and birds. We present data from a monitoring program where the primary aim is to report on the condition of the potential invertebrate prey abundance, biomass and diversity for migrating shorebirds on mudflats adjacent to a waste water treatment plant in a Ramsar listed wetland in Victoria, Australia. A key threat to the foraging habitat at this site has been assessed as a reduction in potential prey items as a result of the changes to the waste water treatment processes. We use control charts, which summarise data from intertidal mudflats across the whole shoreline of the adjacent waste water treatment plant, to elicit a management response when trigger levels are reached. We then examine data from replicate discharge and control sites to determine the most appropriate management response. The monitoring program sits within an adaptive management framework where management decisions are reviewed and the data is examined at different scales to evaluate and modify our models of the likely outcomes of management actions. This study provides a demonstration of the process undertaken in a year when trigger levels were reached and a management decision was required. This highlights the importance of monitoring data from a range of scales in reducing uncertainty and improving decision making in complex systems.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				MAY	2017	189	5							208	10.1007/s10661-017-5924-4								WOS:000401010900005	28386868

T.; Kumar, Arun			Estimation of environmental flow incorporating water quality and hypothetical climate change scenarios	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Environmental flows (Eflow, hereafter) are the flows to be maintained in the river for its healthy functioning and the sustenance and protection of aquatic ecosystems. Estimation of Eflow in any river stretch demands consideration of various factors such as flow regime, ecosystem, and health of river. However, most of the Eflow estimation studies have neglected the water quality factor. This study urges the need to consider water quality criterion in the estimation of Eflow and proposes a framework for estimating Eflow incorporating water quality variations under present and hypothetical future scenarios of climate change and pollution load. The proposed framework is applied on the polluted stretch of Yamuna River passing through Delhi, India. Required Eflow at various locations along the stretch are determined by considering possible variations in future water quantity and quality. Eflow values satisfying minimum quality requirements for different river water usage classes (classes A, B, C, and D as specified by the Central Pollution Control Board, India) are found to be between 700 and 800 m(3)/s. The estimated Eflow values may aid policymakers to derive upstream storagerelease policies or effluent restrictions. Generalized nature of this framework will help its implementation on any river systems.

This article provides a general overview of the previous works that have been completed in monitoring and analyzing heavy metals. The intention of this review is to introduce the historical studies to distinguish and understand the previous challenges faced by researchers in analyzing heavy metal accumulation. In addition, this review introduces a survey on the importance of time increment sampling (monthly and/or seasonally) to comprehend and determine the rate of change of different parameters on a monthly and seasonal basis. Furthermore, suggestions are made for future research to achieve more understandable figures on heavy metal accumulation by considering climate conditions. Thus, the intent of the current study is the provision of reliable models for predicting future heavy metal accumulation in water bodies in different climates and pollution conditions so that water management can be achieved using intelligent proactive strategies and artificial neural network (ANN) techniques.

The collection period was from March to July 2015 at an urban area, Jubaiha, which is located in the northern part of the capital city Amman, Jordan. The obtained results indicated the predominance of Ca2+ and SO42- ions (ratio 2.2: 1) that originated from Saharan soil dust; where the collected samples were alkaline (mean pH = 7.35) with high mineralization (429.22 mg/L) exceeding the previously reported dew values in Amman-Jordan. A relocation of NaCl and to a less extent Mg2+ from sea to land by Saharan wind is indicated by the percent sea-salt fraction calculations (over 100 and 52, respectively). The collected samples exhibited high total organic carbon (TOC) values ranging from 11.86 to 74.60 mg/L, presence of particulate settled material with turbidity ranging from 20.10 to 520.00 NTU, and presence of undesired elements like boron (mean = 1.48 mg/L) that made it different in properties from other dew water collections at clean surfaces, and exceeding the standard limits for drinking water for these parameters set by Jordanian Drinking Water standards (JS286/2015)/WHO standard. The quality of this water is more close to that for raw or agricultural water but if it is meant to be used as potable source of water, at least sand and activated charcoal filters are needed to purify it.

The aim of this pilot-scale study was to investigate current RHRW practices in American Samoa (AS) and to evaluate and compare the quality of water from common potable water sources including RHRW stored in tanks, untreated stream water, untreated municipal well water, and treated municipal tap water samples. Samples were analyzed using culture-based methods, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and 16S amplicon sequencing-based methods. Based on indicator bacteria (total coliform and Escherichia coli) concentrations, the quality of RHRW was slightly lower than well and chlorinated tap water but exceeded that of untreated stream water. Although no Giardia or Leptospira spp. were detected in any of the RHRW samples, 86% of the samples were positive for Cryptosporidium spp. All stream water samples tested positive for Cryptosporidium spp. Opportunistic pathogens (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Mycobacterium intracellulare) were also detected in the RHRW samples (71 and 21% positive samples, respectively). Several potentially pathogenic genera of bacteria were also detected in RHRW by amplicon sequencing. Each RHRW system was characterized by distinct microbial communities, 77% of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were detected only in a single tank, and no OTU was shared by all the tanks. Risk of water-borne illness increased in the following order: chlorinated tap water/well water < RHRW< stream water. Frequent detection of opportunistic pathogens indicates that RHRW should be treated before use. Stakeholder education on RHRW system design options as well as on importance of regular cleaning and proper management techniques could improve the quality of the RHRWin AS.

J	Gray, CW; Chrystal, JM; Monaghan, RM; Cavanagh, JA				Gray, Colin William; Chrystal, Jane Marie; Monaghan, Ross Martin; Cavanagh, Jo-Anne			Subsurface cadmium loss from a stony soil-effect of cow urine application	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Cadmium (Cd) losses in subsurface flow from stony soils that have received cow urine are potentially important, but poorly understood. This study investigated Cd loss from a soil under a winter dairy-grazed forage crop that was grazed either conventionally (24 h) or with restricted grazing (6 h). This provided an opportunity to test the hypothesis that urine inputs could increase Cd concentrations in drainage. It was thought this would be a result of cow urine either (i) enhancing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations via an increase in soil pH, resulting in the formation of soluble Cd-organic carbon complexes and, or (ii) greater inputs of chloride (Cl) via cow urine, promoting the formation of soluble Cd-Cl complexes. Cadmium concentrations in subsurface flow were generally low, with a spike above the water quality guidelines for a month after the 24-h grazing. Cadmiumfluxes were on average 0.30 g Cd ha(-1) year(-1) (0.27-0.32 g Cd ha-1 year-1), in line with previous estimates for agricultural soils. The mean Cd concentration in drainage from the 24-h grazed plots was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than 6-h plots. No increase in DOC concentrations between the treatments was found. However, Cl concentrations in drainage were significantly higher (P < 0.001) from the 24-h than the 6-h grazed treatment plots, and positively correlated with Cd concentrations, and therefore, a possible mechanism increasing Cd mobility in soil. Further study is warranted to confirm the mechanisms involved and quantities of Cd lost from other systems.

To simulate the effects of rural household livelihood transition on non-point source (NPS) pollution, a model combining an agent-based model (ABM) and an improved export coefficient model (IECM) was developed. The ABM was adopted to simulate the dynamic process of household livelihood transition, and the IECM was employed to estimate the effects of household livelihood transition on NPS pollution. The coupled model was tested in a small catchment in the Dongting Lake region, China. The simulated results reveal that the transition of household livelihood strategies occurred with the changes in the prices of rice, pig, and labor. Thus, the cropping system, land-use intensity, resident population, and number of pigs changed in the small catchment from 2000 to 2014. As a result of these changes, the total nitrogen load discharged into the river initially increased from 6841.0 kg in 2000 to 8446.3 kg in 2004 and then decreased to 6063.9 kg in 2014. Results also suggest that rural living, livestock, paddy field, and precipitation alternately became the main causes of NPS pollution in the small catchment, and the midstream region of the small catchment was the primary area for NPS pollution from 2000 to 2014. Despite some limitations, the coupled model provides an innovative way to simulate the effects of rural household livelihood transition on NPS pollution with the change of socioeconomic factors, and thereby identify the key factors influencing water pollution to provide valuable suggestions on how agricultural environmental risks can be reduced through the regulation of the behaviors of farming households in the future.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				MAY	2017	24	14					12899	12917		10.1007/s11356-017-8812-0								WOS:000400765900040	28365845

The assessment was based on the dynamics and relationships between microbiological and chemical indicators of water quality throughout the major rivers of this region-Dunajec, Czarny Dunajec, Bialy Dunajec, and Bialka. Another aim was to assess the effect of land use on the quality of water in the studied rivers. The study was conducted over 1 year at 21 sampling sites distributed from the uppermost sections of rivers in the Tatra National Park through main tourist resorts until mouths of the considered rivers to the Czorsztynskie Lake. Microbiological analysis comprised the prevalence of total and fecal types of coliforms and Escherichia coli, mesophilic, and psychrophilic bacteria. Chemical assays determined the concentrations of Na+, K+, NH4+, Cl-, NO3-, and PO43-. Temperature, electrical conductivity, and pH were measured onsite. It was demonstrated that there is a significant relationship between the predominant types of land use within individual catchments, which results in evident differences in the pollution of waters between the catchments. The results showed that increased share of built up areas and arable land results in significant deterioration of water quality. Thus, waters of Czarny Dunajec were the cleanest, while Bialy Dunajec was the most heavily contaminated. Also, spatial diversity in water quality was shown-the cleanest waters were sampled in the Tatra National Park and the pollution increased with the course of rivers. Point sources of pollution such as effluents from treatment plants or discharge of untreated sewage from households proved to be more important than non-point sources, such as surface runoff. Moreover, the important role of the Czorsztynskie Lake in the purification of water was demonstrated.

This review article was constructed to report the latest research progress of groundwater quality in western China where groundwater quality is undergoing fast deterioration because of fast economic development and extensive anthropogenic activities. The opportunities brought by increasing public awareness of groundwater quality protection were also highlighted and discussed. To guide and promote further development of groundwater quality research in China, especially in western China, ten key groundwater quality research fields were proposed. The review shows that the intensification of human activities and the associated impacts on groundwater quality in China, especially in western China, has made groundwater quality research increasingly important, and has caught the attention of local, national, and international agencies and scholars. China has achieved some progress in groundwater quality research in terms of national and regional laws, regulations, and financial supports. The future of groundwater quality research in China, especially in western China, is promising reflected by the opportunities highlighted.

J	Re, V; Sacchi, E				Re, V.; Sacchi, E.			Tackling the salinity-pollution nexus in coastal aquifers from arid regions using nitrate and boron isotopes	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Salinization and nitrate pollution are generally ascertained as the main issues affecting coastal aquifers worldwide. In arid zones, where agricultural activities also result in soil salinization, both phenomena tend to co-exist and synergically contribute to alter groundwater quality, with severe negative impacts on human populations and natural ecosystems' wellbeing. It becomes therefore necessary to understand if and to what extent integrated hydrogeochemical tools can help in distinguishing among possible different salinization and nitrate contamination origins, in order to provide adequate science-based support to local development and environmental protection. The alluvial plain of Bou-Areg (North Morocco) extends over about 190 km(2) and is separated from the Mediterranean Sea by the coastal Lagoon of Nador. Its surface is covered for more than 60% by agricultural activities, although the region has been recently concerned by urban population increase and tourismexpansion. All these activities mainly rely on groundwater exploitation and at the same time are the main causes of both aquifer and lagoon water quality degradation. For this reason, it was chosen as a case study representative of the typical situation of coastal aquifers in arid zones worldwide, where a clear identification of salinization and pollution sources is fundamental for the implementation of locally oriented remedies and long-term management strategies. Results of a hydrogeochemical investigation performed between 2009 and 2011 show that the Bou-Areg aquifer presents high salinity (often exceeding 100 mg/L in TDS) due to both natural and anthropogenic processes. The area is also impacted by nitrate contamination, with concentrations generally exceeding the WHO statutory limits for drinking water (50 mg/L) and reaching up to about 300 mg/L, in both the rural and urban/peri-urban areas. The isotopic composition of dissolved nitrates (delta N-15(NO3) and delta O-18(NO)) was used to constrain pollution drivers. The results indicate two main origins for human-induced pollution: (i) manure and septic effluents, especially in urban areas, and (ii) synthetic fertilizers in agricultural areas. In the latter, delta N-15-enriched values highlight a mixture of those sources, possibly related to unbalanced fertilization and agricultural return flow. Boron isotopes (delta B-11) were hence studied to further distinguish the nitrate origin in the presence of multiple sources and mixing processes. The results indicate that in the study area, the high geochemical background for B and Cl, associated to the complex waterrock interaction processes, limit the application of the coupled delta B-11 and delta N-15 isotopic systematics to the detection of sources of groundwater pollution. In fact, despite the exceedingly high nitrate contents, the depleted delta B-11 values that characterize synthetic fertilizers and sewage leakages could not be detected. Therefore, even if in saline groundwater the anthropogenic contribution has a negligible effect in terms of salinity input, with both sewage and irrigation water not very charged, the associated nitrate content fuels up water-rock interaction processes, eventually leading to a mineralization increase.

This river is highly polluted with organic substances, nutrients, and total iron. An important problem of the river is the inhibition of the nitrification. For the evaluation, different statistical techniques including cluster analysis (CA), discriminant analysis (DA), and principal component analysis (PCA) were applied. CA clustered 10 water quality stations into three groups corresponding to extreme, high, and moderate pollution. DA used only seven parameters to differentiate the defined clusters. The PCA resulted in four principal components. The first PC is related to conductivity, NH4-N, PO4-P, and TP and determines nutrient pollution. The second PC represents the organic pollution. The iron pollution is illustrated in the third PC having strong positive loadings for TSS and total Fe. The fourth PC explains the dependence of DO on the nitrate production. The nitrification inhibition was further investigated by PCA. The results showed a clear negative correlation between DO and NH4-N and a positive correlation between DO and NO3-N. The influence of pH on the NH4-N oxidation could not be detected by PCA because of the very low nitrification rate due to the constantly low pH of the river and because of the effect of wastewater discharge with very high NH4-N concentrations. The results are deepening the understanding of the governing water quality processes and hence to manage the river basins sustainably.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				MAY	2017	24	15					13845	13862		10.1007/s11356-017-8989-2								WOS:000401566600060	28409429					
J	Abraham, J; Dowling, K; Florentine, S				Abraham, Joji; Dowling, Kim; Florentine, Singarayer			The Unquantified Risk of Post-Fire Metal Concentration in Soil: a Review	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Forest fire is a natural disturbance that occurs in many terrestrial ecosystems specifically in the semi-arid environments and is considered to be an important cause of environmental change. Though many causes of fire are identified, including lightning, volcanic eruption, power line sparks, etc., human involvement is the most significant factor. Fire events are able to alter the physical, chemical and biogeochemical properties of the soil and surface materials and are able to release major and trace metals into the environment. This may be more significant in mining-affected and industrial landscapes, where elevated concentrations of metals present in the soil. After the fire event, metals become more mobile due to the increase in soil surface exposure and the mobility associated with ash dispersal. This mobility may increase the bioavailability of the metals, which may generate water quality issues and may contribute to human and environmental health concerns. Even though, the influences of fire on many soil properties are well established, the behaviour of metals with respect to fire is not well investigated. However, a few studies report that major and trace metals include Cd, Cr, Co, Cu, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn and As are mobilized after fire with increased concentrations in soil and water resources and this might pose a risk to human health and ecosystems. Climate change may increase the intensity, frequency and areal extend of fire events and hence increase the metal concentrations and their potential health impacts.

We hypothesized that the disappearance of algal blooms by dilution could be explained by flow regime, nutrient concentrations, and their interaction. This study investigated the effects of daily renewal rate (d), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentration, and their interaction on the domination between Microcystis aeruginosa and Cyclotella sp. through a monoxenic culture experiment. The simulation model as functions of the N: P mass ratio and dilution rate (D) (calculated from d) was constructed, and the dominant characteristics of both species were predicted based on the model using parameters obtained in a monoculture experiment and our previous study. Results of monoxenic culture experiment revealed that M. aeruginosa dominated in all conditions (d = 5 or 15%; N = 1.0 or 2.5 or 5.0 mg-N L-1; P = 0.1 or 0.5 mg-P L-1) and the predicted cell densities were substantially correspondent to experimental data. Under various N: P ratios and D values, characteristics of domination for each species were predicted, indicating that Cyclotella sp. tended to be dominant under high P concentrations (P = 0.36 mg-P L-1) when the N: P ratio was less than 7.0, and M. aeruginosa could not form algal blooms at the N: P ratio = 7.0 (N = 0.7 mg-N L-1). It was also suggested that the dilution rate leading to the Cyclotella sp. domination required 0.20 day(-1) or higher regardless of the N: P ratios.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				MAY	2017	228	5							174	10.1007/s11270-017-3343-3								WOS:000401070100006

The methodology provides suitable information to generate strategies focusing on health problems. Giardia cysts (GC) and Cryptosporidium oocysts (CO) are considered emerging pathogens that can infect human and animals by ingesting contaminated food or water, where food and water are transport vehicles for these parasites. Studies for GC and CO have reported occurrences for these parasites in water up to 100%, and some of these studies documented a number of cases, about 403,000 people, infected worldwide. This review is focused on compiling the most relevant works assessing the risk for GC and CO and their presence in different water samples that are susceptible for direct and indirect human consumption. The annual risk infection probability for these parasites has been reported from different water sources, with a range between 1 x 10(-6) and 1, while the world standard regulation is 1 x 10(-4). The infection probability depends not only on water quality but also on water treatment implementations.

Twelve of the 15 urban lakes investigated were eutrophic, of which five were hypertrophic, while only seven of the 16 suburban lakes were eutrophic. The Trophic Index (TRIX) was the best predictive index to identify the eutrophication level of the lakes. Classification trees (CTs) were applied to study the trophic status of lakes and identify the driving variables. The results demonstrated that eutrophication in the lakes of Hanoi was driven by nutrients and organic enrichment, as well as by inappropriate management such as unplanned embankment and water uses. DIN, BOD, lake size and embankment were the key parameters controlling eutrophication in the lakes of Hanoi.																	1747-6585	1747-6593				MAY	2017	31	2					176	183		10.1111/wej.12231								WOS:000401235100005

Determination of volatilisation rate constants of trihalomethanes from heated distilled and finished tap water	WATER AND ENVIRONMENT JOURNAL												Disinfection of drinking water is one of the major responsibilities facing cities, towns and rural areas around the world. However, most disinfectants react with organic material in the water to produce a wide variety of by-products. Halogenated methane compounds (THMs) are among these by-products and have been linked to adverse health effects in humans. The human exposure pathway includes: ingestion, inhalation and dermal adsorption, and THM volatilisation plays a role in all three. This paper examines the volatilisation of four trihalomethane compounds and relates their volatilisation rate constants to temperature, concentration and solvent matrix. Volatilisation rate constants were incorporated into a first-order model that will allow resulting THM exposure concentrations to be calculated for household uses that involve heating of drinking water. Utilisation of the THM volatilisation rate constants developed in this manuscript should improve future exposure estimates.																	1747-6585	1747-6593				MAY	2017	31	2					252	261		10.1111/wej.12246								WOS:000401235100014

Field campaign on sediment transport behaviour in a pressure main from pumping station to wastewater treatment plant in Berlin	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												As part of the project KURAS, the Berliner Wasserbetriebe realized a field campaign in 2015 in order to increase the process knowledge regarding the behaviour of transported sediment in the pressure main leading from the pumpstation to the wastewater treatment plant. The field campaign was conducted because of a lack of knowledge about the general condition of the pressure main due to its bad accessibility and the suspicion of deposits caused by hydraulic underload. The practical evidence of the sediment transport performance of this part of the sewer system, dependent on different load cases, should present a basis for further analysis, for example regarding flushing measures. A positive side-effect of the investigation was the description of the amount of pollutants caused by different weather conditions in combined sewer systems and the alterations of the sewage composition due to biogenic processes during transport. The concept included the parallel sampling of the inflow at the pumpstation and the outflow at the end of the pressure main during different weather conditions. By calculating the inflow to the pressure main, as well as its outflow at different flow conditions, it was possible to draw conclusions in regard to the transport behaviour of sediment and the bioprocesses within an 8.5 km section of the pressure main. The results show clearly that the effects of sedimentation and remobilization depend on the flow conditions. The balance of the total suspended solids (TSS) load during daily variations in dry weather shows that the remobilization effect during the run-off peak is not able to compensate for the period of sedimentation happening during the low flow at night. Based on the data for dry weather, an average of 238 kg of TSS deposits in the pressure main remains per day. The remobilization of sediment occurs only due to the abruptly increased delivery rates caused by precipitation events. These high pollution loads lead to a sudden strain at the wastewater treatment plant. It was found that the sediment transport behaviour is characterized by sedimentation up to a flow velocity of 0.35 m/s, while remobilization effects occur above 0.5 m/s. The assumption of bad sediment transport performance in the pressure main was confirmed. Therefore, the results can be used as a basis for further analysis, for example regarding periodical flushing as a means of cleaning the pressure main. The findings, especially regarding the methods and processes, are transferable and can be applied to other pressure mains in combined sewer systems. Besides the outlined evaluation of the sediment transport behaviour of the pressure main, the collected data were used in the project to calibrate a sewer system model, including a water quality model for the catchment area, and as a contribution towards an early physically based sediment transport modelling in InfoWorks CS.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				MAY	2017	75	9					2025	2033		10.2166/wst.2017.044								WOS:000401150500004	28498115

However, the use of filter-feeding aquatic animals to control eutrophic water bodies remains debatable. As such, more work is needed to understand the combined effects of submerged macrophytes and aquatic animals on the restoration of eutrophic water bodies. In this study, we first conducted a mesocosm experiment to evaluate the combined effects of submerged macrophytes and aquatic animals on water body restoration, and then applied these results in the field. We found that silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) deteriorated water quality by increasing nutrient and total suspended solid concentrations, and decreased the biomass of submerged macrophytes. However, triangle sail mussels (Hyriopsis cumingii) promoted the establishment of a clear-water state by grazing on phytoplankton and detritus, and stimulating submerged macrophyte growth. In practical ecological engineering, we suggest that silver carp can be used at low density (20 g/m(3)) as a biomanipulation tool, despite their potential to deteriorate water quality. Furthermore, stocking mussels in nets at a biomass of 150 g/m3 can be effectively used to restore eutrophicated water bodies. Finally, Hydrilla verticillata and Potamogeton malaianus, in combination with filter-feeding aquatic animals, are suitable submerged macrophyte species for the restoration of eutrophicated lakes.

ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												While phosphorus (P) is a vital element in freshwater systems, excessive P loads will induce eutrophication. Large inputs of various pollutants, including P, to rivers in semi-arid regions result in complex environmental problems. In this study, we investigate dissolved oxygen (DO), ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3), chemical oxygen demand (CODcr), soluble reactive P (SRP) in surface water and pore water, and sediment P in the Niuwei River, within the Hai River Basin. From our results we developed and tested a theory for P release in semi-arid regions driven by DO. The results show that NH3 and CODcr can cause variations in DO in surface water. The presence of pollutants at high concentrations caused seasonal hypoxia. Hypoxic river water induced adsorption and hydrolysis of NaOH-Pi and labile organic P (L-Po), which then resulted in increased SRP concentrations in pore water and surface water. Overall, our results illustrate that NH3 and CODcr may be important for P adsorption and desorption and for management of water quality problems in rivers in semi-arid regions.

Performance of a hybrid pilot-scale constructed wetland system for treating oil sands process-affected water from the Athabasca oil sands	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Mining leases in the Athabasca oil sands (AOS; near Ft. McMurray, Canada) produce large volumes of oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) that contain potentially problematic constituents requiring treatment prior to surface water discharge into receiving aquatic systems. The aim of this research was to identify constituents of concern (COCs) in OSPW sourced from an AOS external tailings facility and design a hybrid pilot-scale constructed wetland treatment systems (CWTS) to decrease concentrations of COCs and subsequently mitigate risks. COCs were identified based on comparisons to ambient water quality thresholds for the protection of aquatic life (i.e. Canadian Environmental Quality Guidelines [CEQGs], Alberta Environment Water Quality Guidelines [Alberta WQGs], and United States Environmental Protection Agency Water Quality Criteria [USEPA WQC]) and toxicity endpoints. Performance of the hybrid pilot-scale CWTS was evaluated by rate and extent of COC removal and change in toxicity as measured by an aquatic invertebrate Ceriodaphnia dubia. Following characterization of OSPW, specific COCs were identified as: naphthenic acids (NAs), oil and grease (O/G), metals/metalloids (Al, B, Cu, Ni, Se, and Zn), chloride, and total suspended solids (TSS). A hybrid pilot-scale CWTS was designed to promote treatment processes to alter (transfer and transform) COCs using sequential reducing and oxidizing wetland reactors and a solar photocatalytic treatment reactor using fixed film titanium dioxide (TiO2). Performance criteria were achieved as the CWTS decreased concentrations of NM, O/G, and metals below protective thresholds and decreased toxicity to C. dubia. Results from this study provide proof-of-concept data to inform hybrid passive or semi-passive treatment approaches (i.e. constructed wetlands) that could be used to mitigate COCs contained in OSPWs.

It ultimately affects the water quality of large shallow lakes through sediment resuspension and nutrient diffusion. Impacts of the wind field, hence needed to be studied, especially; (1) the impacts of wind field on the vertical profile, and (2) on the generation of the reverse flow field at large shallow wind exposed lakes. The present study investigated the wind field impacts on the water flow field at different water depths in the large shallow Taihu Lake by using precise wind and velocity profile data acquired at Dongtaihu bay. The results revealed that wind speed and direction have dominant effects on water movement in the large shallow lake. High frequency of wind direction generates more frequent reverse flow field at each layer of the water column. The dominant wind directions found with a high probability of Contribution in the generation of reverse flows at the surface (42.4%), upper middle (38.4%) and bottom (51.5%) layers with large-scale shear of the flow field. Similarly, probability statistics showed that dominant wind speeds have more contributions in the generation of compensation currents at the lower middle (42.6%) layer of the vertical water profile with medium scale shear of the flow field. High wind speeds play a major role in the generation of large flows at all layers of flow profile, but long-term steady wind speeds with consistent wind direction generate stable current in the large shallow lake which reduce the diffusion and nutrient resuspension in the large shallow Taihu Lake. Results of the current study provide a novel ground to study sediment/nutrient resuspension, transport and water quality scenarios in large shallow wind exposed lakes while considering reverse flow field in shallow waters.

Effects of submerged zone, media aging, and antecedent dry period on the performance of biochar-amended biofilters in removing fecal indicators and nutrients from natural stormwater	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Biochar has demonstrated promising performance as an amendment to biofilter soil media in removing fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) from simulated stormwater. However, there is no study that investigates its efficacy in treating natural stormwater runoff. Additional information, including the effects of antecedent dry period, microbial biofilm, and presence of a saturation zone on the performance of biochar-augmented biofilters are needed to inform their field implementation. This study uses laboratory column experiments to monitor FIB (enterococci and Escherichia coli) and nutrient removal capacity of biochar-amended biofilters for 140 days using natural stormwater. Our study also investigates the effects of antecedent dry days (ADD) and the presence of a saturation zone (SZ) on the performance of lab-scale biochar-amended biofilters. The results suggest insignificant influence of the ADD and SZ on FIB removal performance, however biofilters with a SZ perform significantly better in removing nitrate-nitrogen compared to those without a SZ. In addition, it appears that the presence of biofilm augments nutrient removal capacity but reduces FIB removal capacity. Our observations indicate that biochar-amended biofilters are able to treat (to comply with recreational water quality standard for FIB) urban stormwater runoff for the duration of the experiment. Nitrate- and ammonium-nitrogen removal in the biologically aged biofilters is found to be 50-60% while the total dissolved phosphorus and the organic nitrogen removal is 20-30%. Our results inform full-scale design of biochar-amended biofilters in order to meet the total maximum daily load (TMDL) and municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) permitting requirement for FIB and nutrients.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in Australian stormwater biofilters	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Stormwater biofilters are important tools for managing runoff in urban watersheds. To the authors' knowledge, there have been no accounts examining the presence of mycorrhizal fungi in biofilters. This plant-fungi relationship is an important interaction in most terrestrial ecosystems, playing a role in nutrient dynamics, water cycling, and soil organic matter decomposition. The presence of mycorrhiza in biofilters could have implications for nutrient and metal uptake in plants, and thus enhance removal of target pollutants. Additionally, the establishment, growth, and survivability of plants could be enhanced when roots are colonized by mycorrhizae. The aim of this study was to determine the extent of colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in biofilters of varying ages in three Australian cities: Melbourne, Perth, and Sydney. The 32 biofilters surveyed supported 56 plant species, with dominant species belonging to the Cyperaceae, Iridaceae, Juncaceae, Onagraceae, Poaceae, and Xanthorrhoeaceae families. Mycorrhizal associations were identified from 4 of the 11 most dominant plant species from 9 different biofilters, but relatively low percentages of mycorrhizal colonization (3-25% colonization) were observed in biofilter plant roots. Mycorrhizal colonization was not related to biofilter age. These results demonstrate that mycorrhizal fungi colonize plant roots growing in biofilters. These findings provide useful evidence of the presence of mycorrhizal fungi in stormwater biofilters that support subsequent investigation into their roles in these systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Potential of using immobilizing agents in aided phytostabilization on simulated contamination of soil with lead	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Lead (Pb) is one of the key heavy metals which have a significant influence on the individual components of the natural environment. A glasshouse pot experiment was designed to evaluate the potential use of different amendments as immobilizing agents in the aided phytostabilization of Pb-contaminated soil, using Lolium perenne L The research aimed to determine the influence of Pb in doses of 0, 100, 200, 400 and 800 mg/kg of soil, as well as diatomite, chalcedonite, dolomite, limestone, and activated carbon amendments on the content of trace elements in the above-ground parts and roots of L. perenne. The study utilised analysis of variance (ANOVA), principal component analysis (PCA) and Factor Analysis (FA). The content of trace elements in plants, pseudo-total and extracted by 0.01 M CaCl2, were determined using the method of spectrophotometry. All of the investigated element contents in the tested parts of L perenne were significantly different in the case of applying reactive amendments to the soil, as well as increasing concentrations of Pb. The greatest average above-ground biomass was observed when diatomite and chalcedonite were amended into the soil. Activated carbon, limestone and chalcedonite caused significant increases of Pb concentrations in the roots. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study presents results from one of the best-documented long-term monitoring projects in Poland, based on three periods of electrofishing: 1986-88 (TI),1996-98 (T2) and 2011-12 (T3). After decades of severe point-source pollution, water quality has been improving since the early 1990s. However, the recovery of fish assemblages was recorded with a considerable delay, i.e. not in T2 but in T3. Species richness in T3 increased by >= 50% in relation to T2. The recovery process proceeded at a different pace in the upper (section X), middle (section Y) and lower (section Z) river courses. The good status recorded in X in T3 was qualitatively different from the good status observed in TI as migratory and/or lithophilic species were less common. Section X, with relatively clean tributaries, was isolated from the rest of the Warta system by the Jeziorsko Reservoir constructed between X and Y in 1986 (without fish passage). Ichthyofauna in Y was not only in the poorest condition but was also recovering very slowly because of migration barriers and polluted tributaries, resulting in a severe shortage of sources of recolonizers. The quickest positive changes were recorded in Z because of the beneficial role played by certain less degraded tributaries and the direct connection to the recipient Odra River. Significant increases in biomass were recorded in Z for both limnophilic and rheophilic species; the former may be linked to zones of stagnant water existing between groynes and the latter to fast-flowing water near groyne heads.

Life Cycle Assessment of a Commercial-Scale Freshwater Aquaponic System	ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE												Life cycle assessment was used to evaluate environmental impacts of simultaneous fish and plant production through the aquaculture practice of aquaponics. In aquaponics, hydroponic plant production replaces the conventional water treatment processes of microbial nitrification and water exchanges required in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) to maintain water quality. The system expansion method was used to assess potential avoided burdens from coproduction of recovered solids, plant production, and water treatment. Results indicated that electricity and feed were the main contributing factors to environmental impact. Impact assessment results were highly sensitive to changes in electricity inputs, suggesting that a small reduction in electricity could contribute to a correspondingly large change in the environmental impact. Avoided burdens associated with coproducts contributed to a moderate reduction in environmental impact compared to reducing total electricity inputs or sourcing electricity from renewable sources. Of the coproducts considered, avoided water treatment contributed greatest to reductions in environmental impact due to reductions in energy use, water use, and eutrophication potential. The large reduction in water use suggests that plant production can contribute to increased recirculation rates and further reduce water inputs associated with aquaculture. Aquaponics, similar to other RASs, essentially eliminates local ecological impacts at the cost of high energy use and the addition of industrial fish feeds. Development of sustainable land-based aquaculture will encompass many production systems, including aquaponics; however, all systems will benefit from improved energy efficiency, increased accessibility to renewable energy sources, and development of sustainable fish feeds.																	1092-8758	1557-9018				MAY	2017	34	5					299	311		10.1089/ees.2015.0510								WOS:000400894800001						
J	Alonso, A; Figueroa, R; Castro-Diez, P				Alonso, Alvaro; Figueroa, Ricardo; Castro-Diez, Pilar			Pollution Assessment of the Biobio River (Chile): Prioritization of Substances of Concern Under an Ecotoxicological Approach	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The water demand for human activities is rapidly increasing in developing countries. Under these circumstances, preserving aquatic ecosystems should be a priority which requires the development of quality criteria. In this study we perform a preliminary prioritization of the risky substances based on reported ecotoxicological studies and guidelines for the Biobio watershed (Central Chile). Our specific aims are (1) reviewing the scientific information on the aquatic pollution of this watershed, (2) determining the presence and concentration of potential toxic substances in water, sediment and effluents, (3) searching for quality criteria developed by other countries for the selected substances and (4) prioritizing the most risky substances by means of deterministic ecotoxicological risk assessment. We found that paper and mill industries were the main sources of point pollution, while forestry and agriculture were mostly responsible for non-point pollution. The most risky organic substances in the water column were pentachlorophenol and heptachlor, while the most relevant inorganic ones were aluminum, copper, unionized ammonia and mercury. The most risky organic and inorganic substances in the sediment were phenanthrene and mercury, respectively. Our review highlights that an important effort has been done to monitor pollution in the Biobio watershed. However there are emerging pollutants and banned compounds-especially in sediments-that require to be monitored. We suggest that site-specific water quality criteria and sediment quality criteria should be developed for the Biobio watershed, considering the toxicity of mixtures of chemicals to endemic species, and the high natural background level of aluminum in the Biobio.

Both global production of chemicals and global water withdrawal grow faster than human population. This implies increased chemical threats to water, and creates a strong driver for mitigation to protect human health, ecosystem integrity and ecosystem services. Here we connect the perspectives of the water cycle and the chemical life cycle and review possible mitigation options. We categorize mitigation options in various stages of the chemicals' life cycle, taking various sectors and environmental pathways into account. More technologically oriented versus other types of mitigation options are discerned, and their relevance on spatial and temporal scale is discussed. We review various water treatment techniques in relation to physical-chemical properties of chemicals. Finally we discuss how a mitigation database can be used to assess the effectiveness of interventions, by coupling them to regional or global hydrological models. A solution-focused and systems-oriented perspective combined with a mitigation database offers a common perspective amongst actors on the effects for water quality of possible mitigation options throughout the chemical's life cycle, in various sectors and at various places in the water system. This can stimulate coherent implementation of effective mitigation options, cross-sectoral learning and further innovations to improve water quality.				van Wezel, Annemarie/N-9758-2013	van Wezel, Annemarie/0000-0002-6875-957X; Posthuma, Leo/0000-0003-0399-5499												2053-1400	2053-1419				MAY 1	2017	3	3					403	414		10.1039/c7ew00077d								WOS:000400932400003

To address this limitation, this study provides a new transient-state operation mode for an MFC sensor, which is proved applicable for three kinds of detections with higher sensitivity. Under the transient-state mode, the sensitivity increases by 50% to 247% when testing organic matter, acidic toxicants and heavy metals, compared to that of an MFC sensor in conventional constant external resistance connected mode. The mechanism for the improvement is analyzed both experimentally and with an equivalent circuit model. To obtain a higher sensitivity, the output signal of Uon (connected to the external resistance) is more adapted for organic matter monitoring with a wider range, while the output signal of Uoff (disconnected to the external resistance) is better for toxicity monitoring.

Water quality and filter performance of nutrient-, oxidant- and media-enhanced drinking water biofilters	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY												Nutrient, oxidant and media enhancement strategies were applied to pilot-scale biofilters with the objective of enhancing biodegradation to improve effluent water quality (e.g., TOC, DOC, SUVA, THMfp, HAAfp) and filter performance (e.g., effluent turbidity and head loss). While some statistically significant (alpha = 0.05) differences in DOC removal and DBPfp were identified as a result of specific enhancement strategies, enhancement strategies did not result in improvements in water quality (as measured by TOC, DOC, SUVA and DBPfp) that could be considered of practical operational importance. Water quality improvements were either operationally inconsistent, small in magnitude and/or within the deviation that would be expected from the biofilters when operated under equivalent ambient (i.e., not enhanced) conditions. With respect to filter performance, enhancement strategies also occasionally resulted in a statistically significant difference in effluent turbidity and head loss. However, when identified, statistically significant mean differences in effluent turbidity were deemed not meaningful given the instrument accuracy (i.e., perpendicular to 0.02 NTU), the relatively small magnitude of the mean differences, or the magnitude of the mean difference observed between biofilters operated under equivalent ambient conditions. With respect to head loss, statistically significant mean differences in head loss that were also considered meaningful given the magnitude of the deviation between ambient biofilters and the accuracy of the pressure transmitters, were largely consistent with the literature; however, the magnitude of the mean differences that showed improvement to head loss were small (10-18 cm), and likely would not be sufficient to substantially extended filter run times to have any practical operational importance.

Trophic transfer of microplastics in aquatic ecosystems: Identifying critical research needs	INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT												To evaluate the process of trophic transfer of microplastics, it is important to consider various abiotic and biotic factors involved in their ingestion, egestion, bioaccumulation, and biomagnification. Toward this end, a review of the literature on microplastics has been conducted to identify factors influencing their uptake and absorption; their residence times in organisms and bioaccumulation; the physical effects of their aggregation in gastrointestinal tracts; and their potential to act as vectors for the transfer of other contaminants. Limited field evidence from higher trophic level organisms in a variety of habitats suggests that trophic transfer of microplastics may be a common phenomenon and occurs concurrently with direct ingestion. Critical research needs include standardizing methods of field characterization of microplastics, quantifying uptake and depuration rates in organisms at different trophic levels, quantifying the influence that microplastics have on the uptake and/or depuration of environmental contaminants among different trophic levels, and investigating the potential for biomagnification of microplastic-associated chemicals. More integrated approaches involving computational modeling are required to fully assess trophic transfer of microplastics. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2017;13:505-509.

This keeps the advantages of an automatic irrigation system but avoiding their operational complexity. In the FEADM 's first stage, the Fuzzy Analytical Process weigh five fuzzified environmental inputs used as assessment criteria. These criteria are used by a selective assessment stage, where only the relevant criteria for each alternative are assessed. As result, the best assessments of each alternative and the best assessed alternative are obtained. In the second stage, an output membership function is assigned to every alternative for its forward aggregation and defuzzification. This process reaches a soil moisture estimate. Unlike other models, FEADM allows estimating a quantitative value from a decision making process. Furthermore, its computational cost is lower than conventional fuzzy estimation models due to the selective assessment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Solute transport modelling for assessing the duration of river flow to improve the groundwater quality in an intensively irrigated deltaic region	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Groundwater modelling is an important management tool to study the behaviour of aquifer system under various hydrological stresses. Present study was carried out in deltaic regions of the Cauvery river, with an objective of estimating the minimum river flow required to improve the groundwater quality by numerical modelling. Cauvery river delta is the most productive agricultural plains of south India, but the agricultural activities during the last few decades have decreased due to limited flow in the river and increasing concentration of solutes in groundwater in the eastern parts. In order to understand the causes for increasing concentration, a three-layered finite-difference flow model was formulated to simulate the groundwater head and solute transport. The model was used to simulate the groundwater flow and solute transport for 5 years from July 2007 to June 2012. There was a fairly good agreement between the computed and observed groundwater heads. The chloride and nitrate ions were considered for solute transport modelling. Observed and simulated temporal variation in chloride and nitrate concentrations were comparable. The simulated solute concentrations from July 2007 to June 2012 showed an accumulation of solutes in groundwater of coastal part of the study area. The model was used to find the flow to be maintained in the river and rainfall recharge required to flush the ions into the sea. This can be achieved by maintaining minimal flow in the river and through regulation of fertilizer use as well as by creating awareness of sustainable use of groundwater in this area.

However, the comprehensive understanding of urban environmental change in China based on multi-source remote sensing data remains inadequate because current studies have mainly focused on a single aspect of the urban environment using a specific source of remote sensing data. In this study, we developed a comprehensive evaluation index (CEI) combining the remote sensing data of the fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration, land surface temperature (1ST) and vegetation cover (VC) to assess the urban environmental change in China at the national scale, among urban agglomerations and across the rapidly urbanized regions. We found a trend of environmental degradation in the urban areas of China between 2000 and 2012. Environmentally degraded and moderately degraded urban areas accounted for 48.14% of the total urban area in China. In particular, the expanded urban areas exhibited the most extensive environmental degradation, with 52.33% of the total expanded urban areas from 1992 to 2012 exhibiting environmental degradation or moderately environmental degradation. The increase in the PM2.5 concentration was one of the main manifestations of the environmental degradation in the expanded urban areas. We suggest that more attention should be paid to urban environmental issues during future urban development in China. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

J	Gao, L; Wang, ZW; Shan, JJ; Chen, JY; Tang, CY; Yi, M				Gao, Lei; Wang, Zhuowei; Shan, Jiju; Chen, Jianyao; Tang, Changyuan; Yi, Ming			Aquatic environmental changes and anthropogenic activities reflected by the sedimentary records of the Shima River, Southern China	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Reconstructing historical sedimentary records is essential for better understanding the effects of anthropogenic activities on river environments. We used lead-210 to date riverine sediment core from the Shima River in China. We obtained a sedimentary history of 34 years (1982-2015) for core S2, which had a length of 34 cm. The sedimentation rate of 0.304-2.04 cm y(-1) was controlled by both flood events and anthropogenic activities. The conservative element content depth profiles remained relatively constant, suggestive of a relatively stable sediment provenance; therefore, the increase in the sedimentation rate over time was mainly the result of domestic and industrial wastewater effluent and the construction of a rubber dam at the middle and lower reach of the Shima River. From 1982 to 2015, the nutrient and trace metal depth profiles could be divided in three periods based on their trends. From 1982 to 1993, the vertical profiles of nutrients (organic carbon, total phosphorus, and total nitrogen) and three trace metals (nickel, zinc, and manganese) were relatively stable; however, the gradual decrease in copper and cadmium was likely associated with a reduction in agricultural chemical application. From 1993 to 2003, a population explosion and rapid industrialization were responsible for an increase in the input of pollutants into the Shima River, which was partly attenuated by water from the Dong River, leading to a gradual increase in nutrient and trace metal contents. Finally, from 2003 to 2015, the Shima River stopped being used as a source of water due to its deteriorating water quality. The relatively lower velocity of the water flow after the recovery of its flow direction and the reconstruction of the rubber dam in 2009 provided advantageous sedimentary conditions, promoting nutrient accumulation and significant trace metal enrichment.

They are now frequently detected in aquatic ecosystems at concentrations susceptible to harm aquatic invertebrates at individual and population levels. This study intent was to document surface runoff and subsurface tile drain losses of two common neonicotinoids (thiamethoxam and clothianidin) compared to those of companion herbicides (atrazine, glyphosate, S-metolachlor and mesotrione) at the edge of a 22.5-ha field under a corn-soybean rotation. A total of 14 surface runoff and tile drain discharge events were sampled over two years. Events and annual unit mass losses were computed using flow-weighted concentrations and total surface runoff and tile drain flow volumes. Detection frequencies close to 100% in edge-of-field surface runoff and tile drain water samples were observed for thiamethoxam and clothianidin even though only thiamethoxam had been applied in the first year. In 2014, thiamethoxam median concentrations in surface runoff and tile drain samples were respectively 0.46 and 0.16 mu g/L, while respective maximum concentrations of 2.20 and 0.44 mu g/L were measured in surface runoff and tile drain samples during the first post-seeding storm event. For dothianidin, median concentrations in surface runoff and tile drain samples were 0.02 and 0.01 mu g/L, and respective maximum concentrations were 0.07 mu g/L and 0.05 mu g/L. Surface runoff and tile drain discharge were key transport mechanisms with similar contributions of 53 and 47% of measured mass losses, respectively. Even if thiamethoxam was applied at a relatively low rate and had a low mass exportation value (0.3%), the relative toxicity was one to two orders of magnitude higher than those of the other chemicals applied in 2014 and 2015. Companion herbicides, except glyphosate in tile drains, exceeded their water quality guideline during one sampling campaign after application but rapidly resumed below these limits.

However, limited attention has so far been directed towards how plastics are regulated in a life cycle perspective and how regulatory gaps can be addressed in order to limit and prevent environmental exposure and hazards of macro- and microplastics. In this paper, we map European regulation taking outset in the life cycle perspective of plastic carrier bags: from plastic bag production to when it enters the environment. Relevant regulatory frameworks, directives and authorities along the life cycle are identified and their role in regulation of plastics is discussed. Most important regulations were identified as: the EU chemical Regulation, the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive including the amending Directive regarding regulation of the consumption of lightweight plastic carrier bags, the Waste Framework Directive and the Directive on the Landfill of Waste. The main gaps identified relate to lack of clear definitions of categories of polymers, unambitious recycling rates and lack of consideration of macro- and microplastics in key pieces of legislation. We recommend that polymers are categorized according to whether they are polymers with the same monomer constituents (homopolymers) or with different monomer constituents (copolymers) and that polymers are no longer exempt from registration and evaluation under REACH. Plastics should furthermore have the same high level of monitoring and reporting requirements as hazardous waste involving stricter requirements to labelling, recordkeeping, monitoring and control over the whole lifecycle. Finally, we recommend that more ambitious recycle and recovery targets are set across the EU. Regulation of the consumption of lightweight plastic carrier bags should also apply to heavyweight plastic carrier bags. Last, the Marine and Water Framework Directives should specifically address plastic waste affecting water quality. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Acute water quality criteria for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, pesticides, plastic additives, and 4-Nonylphenol in seawater	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Probabilistic environmental quality criteria for Naphthalene (Nap), Phenanthrene (Phe), Fluoranthene (Flu), Pyrene (Pyr), Triclosan (TCS), Tributyltin (TBT), Chlorpyrifos (CPY), Diuron (DUR), gamma-Hexaclor-ocyclohexane (gamma-HCH), Bisphenol A (BPA) and 4-Nonylphenol (4-NP) were derived from acute toxicity data using saltwater species representative of marine ecosystems, including algae, mollusks, crustaceans, echinoderms and chordates. Preferably, data concerns sublethal endpoints and early life stages from bioassays conducted in our laboratory, but the data set was completed with a broad literature survey. The Water Quality Criteria (WQC) obtained for TBT (7.1.10-(3) mu g L-1) and CPY (6.6.10(-3) mu g L-1) were orders of magnitude lower than those obtained for PAHs (ranging from 3.75 to 45.2 mu g L-1), BPA (27.7 mu g L-1), TCS (8.66 mu g L-1) and 4-NP (1.52 mu g L-1). Critical values for DUR and HCH were 0.1 and 0.057 mu g L-1 respectively. Within this context, non-selective toxicants could be quantitatively defined as those showing a maximum variability in toxicity thresholds (TT) of 3 orders of magnitude across the whole range of marine diversity, and a cumulative distribution of the TT fitting to a single log-logistic curve, while for selective toxicants variability was consistently found to span 5 orders of magnitude and the TT distribution showed a bimodal pattern. For the latter, protective WQC must be derived taking into account the SSD of the sensitive taxa only. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Impacts of climate and land use changes on the water quality of a small Mediterranean catchment with intensive viticulture	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Studies that address the potential effects of climate and land use changes on surface water quality are scarce in the Mediterranean region. In the present work, the impacts of climate and land use changes on nutrient and copper exports from a humid Mediterranean catchment (Sao Lourenco) were evaluated using the SWAT model. SWAT reproduced reasonably well total nitrogen (TN), phosphorus (TP) and copper (Cu) exports in Sao Lourenco, providing an adequate baseline scenario as well as a suitable model parameterization for assessing the impacts of climate and land use changes under the A1 B and B1 emission scenarios for the end of the 21st century (2071-2100). Land use changes scenarios were generated along the same storylines as climate change scenarios to assess the combined effects of the two stressors. Climate changes itself led to a decline in annual TN and TP exports under both emission scenarios mostly due to a decrease in runoff and erosion induced by a reduction in rainfall, but it hardly affected Cu exports largely due to its strong immobilization in soils. Land use changes per se resulted in an increase in streamflow, but the changes in water quality varied markedly according to the scenarios. A substantial decrease in TN, TP and Cu exports was observed under scenario A1B, due to a reduction in vineyard areas. Under scenario Bl, however, TP exports decreased much less while TN exports hardly changed, reflecting differences in the preferential transport pathways of these compounds. Cu exports also remained the same, as no changes occurred in the vineyard areas. The combination of climate and land use change scenarios revealed additive impacts on the exports of all three contaminants, emphasizing the importance of integrated approaches to define adaptive land management practices that can ensure the future sustainability of Mediterranean water resources.

Biosolids provide nutrients in the form of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and increases organic matter. It is also an economic way for a country to dispose of its municipal waste. However, biosolids may potentially contain a wide range of pathogens, and following rainfall events, may be transported in surface runoff and pose a potential risk to human health. Thus, a quantitative risk assessment model was developed to estimate potential pathogens in surface water and the environmental fate of the pathogens following dilution, residence time in a stream, die-off rate, drinking water treatment and human exposure. Surface runoff water quality data was provided by project partners. Three types of biosolids, anaerobically digested (AD), lime stabilised (LS), and thermally dried (TD)) were applied on micro plots. Rainfall was simulated at three time intervals (24, 48 and 360 h) following land application. It was assumed that this water entered a nearby stream and was directly abstracted for drinking water. Consumption data for drinking water and body weight was obtained from an Irish study and assigned distributions. Two dose response models for probability of illness were considered for total and faecal coliform exposure incorporating two different exposure scenarios (healthy populations and immuno-compromised populations). The simulated annual risk of illness for healthy populations was below the US EPA and World Health Organisation tolerable level of risk (10(-4) and 10(-6), respectively). However, immuno-compromised populations may still be at risk as levels were greater than the tolerable level of risk for that subpopulation. The sensitivity analysis highlighted the importance of residence time in a stream on the bacterial die-off rate. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Operating conditions such as feed gas quality and especially cooling conditions are of utmost importance. Cooling of ozone generators is absolutely necessary, since ozone destruction reactions increase exponentially with temperature. The most common way to cool an ozone generator is water flowing in close contact to the electrodes. The heat removal out of the discharge gap depends on different parameters. Electrical input power, cooling water flow conditions, electrode geometry and material properties are some of them. Simultaneously lowering cooling water temperature, applied power density and gap width, leads to a lower gas temperature in the discharge gap and thus to increased ozone production efficiency. Minimizing the temperature difference between the cooling water inlet and outlet improves the ozone production efficiency as well. This measure, however, results in high cooling water flows and requires additional cooling water chilling, resulting in higher operational costs and capital expenses. Cooling associated costs rise disproportionally with increasing cooling water flow. Simultaneously, energy consumption of ozone generators decreases as the average cooling water temperature goes down. As a result, there exists an optimum between the operational and capital expenses for the combination of ozone generator and cooling water system related expenses, offering significant cost savings for the customer.																	0191-9512	1547-6545				MAY-JUN	2017	39	3					196	201		10.1080/01919512.2017.1289466								WOS:000399644600006

Currently four of the treatment plants utilize ozone as the primary disinfectant. The Metropolitan ozone contactors are over-under baffled and include 10 chambers, an afterbay, and an effluent channel. Ozone is generally added in either the first countercurrent gas/liquid flow chamber (Chamber 1) or the first and second (co-current gas/liquid flow) chambers. Disinfection credit is received from ozone residuals in Chambers 2 through 6. An ozone destruct system collects and destroys ozone off-gases from Chambers 1 through 9 and an ozone quenching system is used to minimize dissolved ozone from leaving the contactors. Severe drought in California, and resulting water supply limitations, have created significant operational issues ranging from reduced plant flows to source water changes and water quality challenges. The combination of reduced flow and different source water conditions resulted in the ozone systems being operated occasionally under unfamiliar conditions. This article discusses some of the challenges faced in operating the ozone plants at low flows and low ozone production rates. Further, water quality issues required prudent management of operations to meet regulatory requirements. From the lessons learned, several recommendations are offered in preparation for similar conditions in the future.																	0191-9512	1547-6545				MAY-JUN	2017	39	3					202	208		10.1080/01919512.2017.1289467								WOS:000399644600007

Though physically-based hydrodynamic models are the most detailed means to simulate salinity processes, they are commonly restricted by data insufficiency issues both in spatial resolution and temporal lasting. This motivates us to build a statistical model enable simulation and scenario analysis for coastal salinity change with limited observations. A Bayesian neural network (BNN) model is built hereby to simulate salinity. It offers more precise estimation compared with the conventional artificial neural network. Meanwhile, the model gives the uncertainty behaviors of the final salinity simulation which is not available for other methods. Future scenarios of salinity change are constructed and analyzed in different time periods on the basis of the validated BNN model. Results indicate that the water quality over lower Pearl River is degrading along with more significant uncertainties. Further analysis suggests that streamflow alteration has a more direct impact on salinity variations than the sea-level change does. The method allows a profound analysis of the potential influence on water quality degradation in coastal and low-lying regions in support of water management and adaptation toward global climate change.																	1436-3240	1436-3259				MAY	2017	31	4					981	991		10.1007/s00477-017-1399-7								WOS:000399692500010

Local and landscape scale determinants of macroinvertebrate assemblages and their conservation value in ponds across an urban land-use gradient	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Urbanisation represents a growing threat to natural communities across the globe. Small aquatic habitats such as ponds are especially vulnerable and are often poorly protected by legislation. Many ponds are threatened by development and pollution from the surrounding landscape, yet their biodiversity and conservation value remain poorly described. Here we report the results of a survey of 30 ponds along an urban land-use gradient in the West Midlands, UK. We outline the environmental conditions of these urban ponds to identify which local and landscape scale environmental variables determine the biodiversity and conservation value of the macroinvertebrate assemblages in the ponds. Cluster analysis identified four groups of ponds with contrasting macroinvertebrate assemblages reflecting differences in macrophyte cover, nutrient status, riparian shading, the nature of the pond edge, surrounding land-use and the availability of other wetland habitats. Pond conservation status varied markedly across the sites. The richest macroinvertebrate assemblages with high conservation value were found in ponds with complex macrophyte stands and floating vegetation with low nutrient concentrations and little surrounding urban land. The most impoverished assemblages were found in highly urban ponds with hard-engineered edges, heavy shading and nutrient rich waters. A random forest classification model revealed that local factors usually had primacy over landscape scale factors in determining pond conservation value, and constitute a priority focus for management.																	0960-3115	1572-9710				MAY	2017	26	5					1065	1086		10.1007/s10531-016-1286-4								WOS:000399235300004

Influence of the Amazon Hydrological Regime on Eutrophication Indicators of a Hydroelectric Power Plant Reservoir	BULLETIN OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												Dam constructions in the Amazon have increased exponentially in the last decades, causing several environmental impacts and serious anthropogenic impacts in certain hydroelectric power plant reservoirs in the region have been identified. The assessment of the trophic status of these reservoirs is of interest to indicate man-made changes in the environment, but must take into account the hydrological cycle of the area. This can be relevant for environmental management actions, aiding in the identification of the ecological status of water bodies. In this context, physico-chemical parameters and eutrophication indicators were determined in a hydroelectric power plant reservoir in the Brazilian Amazon to assess trophic variations during the regional hydrological regime phases on the reservoir, namely dry, filling, full and emptying stages. The local hydrological regimes were shown to significantly influence TSS and turbidity, as well as NH4, NO3, PO4, with higher values consistently observed during the filling stage of the reservoir. In addition, differences among the sampling stations regarding land use, population and anthropogenic activities were reflected in the PO4 (3-) values during the different hydrological phases.

Growth rates of all nine species, but especially Lemna gibba, Cladophora and Myriophyllum verticillatum were best in undiluted domestic sewage as opposed to a mixture of domestic sewage. Performance of species to accumulate nutrients was not only species-specific, but was also affected by both sewage treatments. Removal efficiency of nutrients was dependent on both plant species and treatment. Uptake kinetic parameters were significantly affected by both nutrient form and plant species. The maximum uptake rate (Vmax) of NH4-N was higher than NO3-N. Similarly, Km values for NH4-N were greater than NO3-N. These results could be used to identify plants for sewage treatment efficiency and enhance water quality in eco-ditch treatment systems.

Coastal marshes provide flood abatement, carbon and nutrient sequestration, water quality maintenance, and habitat for fish, shellfish, and wildlife, including species of concern, such as the saltmarsh sparrow (Ammodramus caudacutus). We present a climate change adaptation strategy (CCAS) adopted by scientific, management, and policy stakeholders for managing coastal marshes and enhancing system resiliency. A common adaptive management approach previously used for restoration projects was modified to identify climate-related vulnerabilities and plan climate change adaptive actions. As an example of implementation of the CCAS, we describe the stakeholder plans and management actions the US Fish and Wildlife Service and partners developed to build coastal resiliency in the Narrow River Estuary, RI, in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy. When possible, an experimental BACI (before-after, control-impact) design, described as pre- and post-sampling at the impact site and one or more control sites, was incorporated into the climate change adaptation and implementation plans. Specific climate change adaptive actions and monitoring plans are described and include shoreline stabilization, restoring marsh drainage, increasing marsh elevation, and enabling upland marsh migration. The CCAS provides a framework and methodology for successfully managing coastal systems faced with deteriorating habitat, accelerated sea level rise, and changes in precipitation and storm patterns.

J	Hawkins, G				Hawkins, Gay			The impacts of bottled water: an analysis of bottled water markets and their interactions with tap water provision	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER												The phenomenal recent growth of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottled water is distinctively different from previous bottled mineral water markets that have been around for centuries. Plastic bottled water (hereafter BW) has been marketed as a fast moving consumer good, as a healthy drinking choice and, increasingly, as a safer alternative to existing drinking water. BW markets emerged in response to several key factors: changes in consumer drinking practices; opportunistic strategies on the part of beverage companies to diversify into water; the development of PET bottles; the intensification of sophisticated branding techniques; and various drinking water scares ranging from state failure to water quality controversies. In many cities with safe drinking water BW has faced significant opposition. While this opposition appears to have done little to halt market growth it has prompted a whole new terrain of drinking water politics. These politics foreground the effects of representing and delivering drinking water as an individualized good versus distribution via reticulated networks in which consumers gain access to a collective service. However, activist critiques of BW can sometimes miss the subtle ways in which bottles are ontologically interfering with the political and public health values of safe tap water. These impacts are complex and highly variable according to the specific context of existing drinking water provision and hydrocultures and the ways in which bottles interact with these. Understanding these interactions could help limit the capacity of bottled water markets to undermine the ongoing commitment to safe collective water provision in the interest of the common good.

Prediction tests are completed to predict the water quality associated with the deposition of mining wastes. Static tests can quickly assess the acid-generating potential (AP) and the neutralization potential (NP). Whereas some studies recommend to take into account a mineral reactivity factor for the NP determination, the reactivity rates of acidifying minerals are not considered in the AP calculation. The aim of this study is to bring contribution to the improvement of the static test determination by adding kinetic factors in the AP determination. Eight sulfides (pyrite, Ni-pyrite, pyrrhotite, Ni-pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, galena, sphalerite, arsenopyrite) and a sulfosalt (gersdorffite) were separately submitted to kinetic tests in modified weathering cells. This test was selected for its rapidity of results and for the low amount of material used, as it is somewhat difficult to obtain pure minerals samples. Five synthetic tailings were composed by mixing pure sulfides in various proportions and submitted to the same kinetic tests. The oxidation rates of synthetic tailings were compared with the weighted combined oxidation rates of individual pure sulfides. The oxidation rates of the synthetic tailings calculated from those of pure sulfides are within the same order of magnitude than those obtained through the kinetic experiments. The AP of synthetic tailings were calculated according to standard equations of the literature and compared with the new method. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Singh, UK; Kumar, B				Singh, Umesh Kumar; Kumar, Balwant			Pathways of heavy metals contamination and associated human health risk in Ajay River basin, India	CHEMOSPHERE												The sources of heavy metals and their loads in the Ajay River were investigated based on the seasonal and spatial variations. To identify variation and pathways of heavy metals, seventy-six water samples were estimated for 2 years at nineteen sampling sites. The multifaceted data were applied to evaluate statistical relation between variables and arithmetic calculation of the indices. Fickling plot suggested that the acidic pollutants do not affect the water quality because all samples lie within the neutral pH range. Further, OC showed significant relation with Fe, Mn, Ni and Co. Compositional analysis identified weathering of rocks, mobility of soil and sediment, atmospheric deposition and numerous anthropogenic inputs as major sources of heavy metals. The mean values of heavy metal pollution index (HPI) and pollution index (PI) were found above the critical index and strong loadings respectively due to higher values of Cd, Pb and Fe. Similarly, assessment of human risk revealed that the high load of Cd, Pb and Fe in water body could harm the population. Majority of the samples showed high concentration of heavy metals as compared to regulatory standard and background values, which suggests that the water is highly contaminated through numerous geogenic and anthropogenic sources.

J	Hara, RV; Marin-Morales, MA				Hara, Raquel Vaz; Marin-Morales, Maria Aparecida			In vitro and in vivo investigation of the genotoxic potential of waters from rivers under the influence of a petroleum refinery (Sao Paulo State - Brazil)	CHEMOSPHERE												In recent years concern about the chemical composition of wastewater generated by the oil refining industry has increased, even after its treatment. These wastewaters contain substances that can harm both the entire aquatic ecosystem and the health of any exposed organisms. The aim of this study was to evaluate the genotoxic and mutagenic potentials of the effluent generated by the largest Brazilian petroleum refinery, the effectiveness of the treatments used by the refinery, and whether its effluent can compromise the water quality of the river where it is discarded. Chromosomal aberration and micronucleus assays were performed in Allium cepa and micronucleus test in mammalian cell culture (CHOK1). The samples were collected in three sites at the refinery: one site on the Jaguari River and two sites on the Atibaia Rivers (upstream and downstream of the discharged effluent), under three different climatic conditions. Tests with A. cepa showed increased frequencies of chromosomal aberrations and micronuclei in meristematic cells for the effluent after physico-chemical treatment, but the samples after treatment biological and stabilization pond presented none of these abnormalities. It was observed that the induced damage in the meristematic cells was not observed in the F-1 cells of A. cepa roots. The micronucleus test performed with mammalian cell culture also indicated that the effluent, after physicochemical treatment, induced a significant increase in micronucleus frequencies. Plant and hamster cells exposed to the other samples collected inside the refinery and in the Jaguari and Atibaia Rivers did not present evidence of genotoxicity and mutagenicity in the tests performed. This study showed that the effluent treated carried out by the refinery (biological treatment followed by a stabilization pond) proved to be efficient for the removal of the toxic load still present after the physico-chemical treatment, since no change in the quality of the Atibaia River was observed. However, because this is an industry with a high production of effluent with toxic potential, its effluents must be constantly monitored, so that there is no compromise of the water quality of the receiving river.

J	Gora, SL; Andrews, SA				Gora, Stephanie L.; Andrews, Susan A.			Adsorption of natural organic matter and disinfection byproduct precursors from surface water onto TiO2 nanoparticles: pH effects, isotherm modelling and implications for using TiO2 for drinking water treatment	CHEMOSPHERE												Titanium dioxide is a photocatalyst that can remove organic contaminants of interest to the drinking water treatment industry, including natural organic matter (NOM) and disinfection byproduct (DBP) precursors. The photocatalytic reaction occurs in two steps: adsorption of the contaminant followed by degradation of the adsorbed contaminant upon irradiation with UV light. The second part of this process can lead to the formation of reactive intermediates and negative impacts on treated water quality, such as increased DBP formation potential (DBPfp). Adsorption alone does not result in the formation of reactive intermediates and thus may prove to be a safe way to incorporate TiO2 into drinking water treatment processes. The goal of this study was to expand on the current understanding of NOM adsorption on TiO2 and examine it in a drinking water context by observing NOM adsorption from real water sources and evaluating the effects of the resulting reductions on the DBPfp of the treated water. Bottle point isotherm tests were conducted with raw water from two Canadian water treatment plants adjusted to pH 4, pH 6 and pH 8 and dosed with TiO2 nanoparticles. The DOC results were a good fit to a modified Freundlich isotherm. DBP precursors and liquid chromatography with organic carbon detection NOM fractions associated with DBP formation were removed to some extent at all pHs, but most effectively at pH 4.

Assessing Future River Environments in the Seomjin River Basin due to Climate Change	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												Environmental impacts in the Seomjin River Basin were evaluated based on watershed characteristics and climate change using Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios provided by the Korea Meteorological Administration. Future dam and tributary inflow from 2000 to 2100 were estimated using a hydrology model. Dam safety evaluation and downstream flow duration curve analyses were performed using a hydraulic structure operation model based on hydrology model flow results. Water quality trends were analyzed through a seasonal Kendall test method using 19 years of water quality data. Dam discharge, tributary inflow, and water quality estimated by hydrology, hydraulic structure operation, and water quality model were used to analyze future influences on water quality trends. New guidelines for managing river environments and climate change issues are provided, allowing a preemptive response. The inflow increase during the flood season was smaller than that during the dry season because of climate change. Furthermore, the water stage of Seomjin or Juam Dam exceeded the designed flood level. It is therefore necessary to study the long-term effects and changes in water quality with regards to future flow rate changes.

Characterization and Land Application of Hydrodemolition and Diamond Grinding Slurries	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												Hydrodemolition and grinding of highway surfaces create large volumes of a water and concrete slurry that must be safely disposed of or reused. This project evaluated the effect of applying the slurry as a liming agent to vegetated areas. Results of two controlled greenhouse studies documented that the incorporation of concrete slurry at up to twice the recommended liming rate had no detrimental effect on the soils or the germination and establishment of fescue and bahiagrass. Further, surface application of concrete slurry to small field plots at rates recommended to correct low soil pH resulted in no detrimental effect on soils or vegetation including bermudagrass. In addition, the water quality of rainfall runoff from the plots with concrete slurry application was not different than runoff from a plot with no slurry application. Thus, these results showed that the application of hydrodemolition and concrete grinding slurry at rates to correct soil pH had no detrimental effect on the soils, vegetation, or surface runoff monitored in this study.

Nutrient and Sediment Reduction through Upflow Filtration of Stormwater Retention Pond Effluent	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												Wet ponds have often been installed to detain runoff with the intention of mitigating peak flow. However, significant current drivers exist to improve their ability to mitigate pollutants, and simple retrofits to existing ponds could help to meet total maximum daily load regulations. A review of past studies showed that ponds struggle to treat dissolved pollutants, which are often the most bioavailable. The present study evaluated the nutrient and sediment treatment performance of a retrofitted upflow filter (UF) attached to the drawdown orifice of an existing wet retention pond in Durham, North Carolina. The pond was studied during three periods: (1) control, where baseline pond performance was established; (2) after retrofit with floating treatment wetlands (FTWs); and (3) after retrofit with FTWs and an UF on the pond's drawdown orifice. The added UF was unable to improve the pond's retention of nitrogen. Further reduction of the TSS effluent concentrations by the UF may have been hampered by the low effluent concentrations during the FTW period (13 mg/L); however, the variability of TSS effluent concentrations was substantially reduced following UF retrofit. The UF significantly reduced mean effluent concentrations of orthophosphate (OP) to less than 0.01 mg/L. Effluent concentrations of OP and total phosphorus from the UF were similar to those from bioretention systems. Clogging of the filter media occurred in intervals of 5 to 9 months prior to breakthrough of OP. Future designs of UFs should incorporate microscale pretreatment and/or filter media cartridges that (1) are easy to remove and (2) provide a method to flush accumulated sediment from the media.

Specifically, the parameters of sedimentation and filtration effluent quality such as turbidity, color, organic matter [e.g.,dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total organic carbon (TOC)], ultraviolet absorbance at 254nm (UV254), Trihalomethane formation potentials (THMFPs), and metallic elements (e.g., Fe, Al, and Mn) were measured. The experimental results indicate that the continuous direct recycling of the CRS is a feasible method for not only reducing the required coagulant dosage but also improving the contaminant removal efficiency. The coagulant usage was reduced by up to 33.33% at 20 degrees C and 25.00% at 4 degrees C compared to control trials. Over the entire operation period, there was no significant accumulation of contaminants. The temperature exerted a significant impact on the required coagulant dosage and treatment efficiency. Additionally, this study proposes that the continuous operation periods are at the range of 10 to 12days. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

A combination of regression analysis and genetic algorithm (GA) techniques are applied to develop spectral relationships between Tu-L5, TSS-T,, and each HV-TSS. The STARFM algorithm and all the developed relationship models are evaluated satisfactorily by various performance evaluation measures to develop heavy metal pollution index-based vulnerability maps at 1-km resolution in the Brahmani River in eastern India. The Monte-Carlo simulation based analysis of the developed formulations reveals that the uncertainty in estimating Zn and Cd is the minimum (1.04%) and the maximum (5.05%), respectively. Hence, the remote sensing based approach developed herein can effectively be used in many world rivers for real-time monitoring of heavy metal pollution. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This study presents a methodology to optimize manure management within a hydrologic region to minimize agricultural phosphorus (P) loss associated with winter manure application. Spatial and non-spatial data representing livestock, crop, soil, terrain and hydrography were compiled to determine manure P production rates, crop P uptake, existing manure storage capabilities, and transportation distances. Field slope, hydrologic soil group (HSG), and proximity to waterbodies were used to classify crop fields according to their runoff risk for winter-applied manure. We use these data to construct a comprehensive optimization model that identifies optimal location, size, and transportation strategy to achieve environmental and economic goals. The environmental goal was the minimization of daily hauling of manure to environmentally sensitive crop fields, i.e., those classified as high P-loss fields, whereas the economic goal was the minimization of the transportation costs across the entire study area. A case study encompassing two contiguous 10-digit hydrologic unit subwatersheds (HUC-10) in South Central Wisconsin, USA was developed to demonstrate the proposed methodology. Additionally, scenarios representing different management decisions (storage facility maximum volume, and project capital) and production conditions (increased milk production and 20-year future projection) were analyzed to determine their impact on optimal decisions.

Decision-making procedures about how to list, or delist, water bodies as impaired, or not, per Clean Water Act 303(d) differ across states. In states such as California, whether or not a particular monitoring sample suggests that water quality is impaired can be regarded as a binary outcome variable, and California's current regulatory framework invokes a version of the exact binomial test to consolidate evidence across samples and assess whether the overall water body complies with the Clean Water Act. Here, we contrast the performance of California's exact binomial test with one potential alternative, the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT). The SPRT uses a sequential testing framework, testing samples as they become available and evaluating evidence as it emerges, rather than measuring all the samples and calculating a test statistic at the end of the data collection process. Through simulations and theoretical derivations, we demonstrate that the SPRT on average requires fewer samples to be measured to have comparable Type I and Type II error rates as the current fixed-sample binomial test. Policymakers might consider efficient alternatives such as SPRT to current procedure. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Experimental pipe loops with different iron corrosion scales were set up to simulate the actual DWDS. The effects of sulfate levels on heavy metal release were systemically investigated. Heavy metal releases of Mn, Ni, Cu, Pb, Cr and As could be rapidly triggered by sulfate addition but the releases slowly decreased over time. Heavy metal release was more severe in pipes transporting groundwater (GW) than in pipes transporting surface water (SW). There were strong positive correlations (R-2 > 0.8) between the releases of Fe and Mn, Fe and Ni, Fe and Cu, and Fe and Pb. When switching to higher sulfate water, iron corrosion scales in all pipe loops tended to be more stable (especially in pipes transporting GW), with a larger proportion of stable constituents (mainly Fe3O4) and fewer unstable compounds ((beta-FeOOH, gamma-FeOOH, FeCO3 and amorphous iron oxides). The main functional iron reducing bacteria (IRB) communities were favorable for the formation of Fe3O4. The transformation of corrosion scales and the growth of sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) accounted for the gradually reduced heavy metal release with time. The higher metal release in pipes transporting GW could be due to increased Fe-6(OH)(12)CO3 content under higher sulfate concentrations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Water quality effects of intermittent water supply in Arraijan, Panama	WATER RESEARCH												Intermittent drinking water supply is common in low- and middle-income countries throughout the world and can cause water quality to degrade in the distribution system. In this study, we characterized water quality in one study zone with continuous supply and three zones with intermittent supply in the drinking water distribution network in Arraijan, Panama. Low or zero pressures occurred in all zones, and negative pressures occurred in the continuous zone and two of the intermittent zones. Despite hydraulic conditions that created risks for backflow and contaminant intrusion, only four of 423 (0.9%) grab samples collected at random times were positive for total coliform bacteria and only one was positive for E. coli. Only nine of 496 (1.8%) samples had turbidity >1.0 NTU and all samples had >0.2 mg/L free chlorine residual. In contrast, water quality was often degraded during the first-flush period (when supply first returned after an outage). Still, routine and first-flush water quality under intermittent supply was much better in Arraijan than that reported in a previous study conducted in India. Better water quality in Arraijan could be due to better water quality leaving the treatment plant, shorter supply outages, higher supply pressures, a more consistent and higher chlorine residual, and fewer contaminant sources near pipes. The results illustrate that intermittent supply and its effects on water quality can vary greatly between and within distribution networks. The study also demonstrated that monitoring techniques designed specifically for intermittent supply, such as continuous pressure monitoring and sampling the first flush, can detect water quality threats and degradation that would not likely be detected with conventional monitoring.

Living in close proximity to the Bay improves access to these amenities and should be capitalized into local housing markets. We investigate these impacts in the largest hedonic analysis of water quality ever completed, with over 200,000 property sales across 14 Maryland counties. We use a spatially explicit water quality dataset, along with a wealth of landscape, economic, geographic, and demographic variables. These data allow a comprehensive exploration of the value of water quality, while controlling for a multitude of other influences. We also estimate several variants of the models most popular in current literature, with a focus on the temporal average of water quality. In comparing 1 year and 3 year averages, the 3 year averages generally have a larger implicit price. Overall, results indicate that water quality improvements in the Bay, such as those required by EPA's Total Maximum Daily Load, could yield significant benefits to waterfront and near-waterfront homeowners.																	0921-8009	1873-6106				MAY	2017	135						103	113		10.1016/j.ecolecon.2016.12.014								WOS:000395597700010						
J	Wolf, D; Klaiber, HA				Wolf, David; Klaiber, H. Allen			Bloom and bust: Toxic algae's impact on nearby property values	ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS												Over the past decade harmful algal blooms (HABs) have become a nationwide environmental concern. HABs are likely to increase in frequency and intensity due to rising summer temperatures caused by climate change and higher nutrient enrichment from increased urbanization. Policymakers need information on the economic costs of HABs to design optimal management policies in the face of limited budgets. Using a detailed, multi lake hedonic analysis across 6 Ohio counties between 2009 and 2015 we show capitalization losses associated with near lake homes between 11% and 17% rising to above 22% for lake adjacent homes. In the case of Grand Lake Saint Marys, we find one-time capitalization losses exceeding $51 million for near lake homes which dwarfs the State of Ohio's cleanup expenditure of $26 million.

J	Shah, A; Garg, A				Shah, Arpit; Garg, Amit			Urban commons service generation, delivery, and management: A conceptual framework	ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS												Urban commons are currently not studied holistically under the rationale used by the ecosystem cascade framework In this paper, we build on the ecosystem cascade framework to present a conceptual model that provides a comprehensive view of urban common resources and allows decision-makers to develop suitable interventions to meet objectives of sustainability and equity. The model looks at the role of and explains the linkages between urban commons' biophysical structures, user population characteristics, power dynamics, use behavior, benefits generated, and management strategies. The model adds to existing literature by focusing on direct benefits and equity and by elaborating on the role of transaction costs and management strategies in governing urban commons. Considering direct benefits allows for a complete picture of overall benefits while making governance decisions, as opposed to considering benefits received only through human effort. Focusing on power asymmetries between stakeholders highlights the inequities created in accessing benefits from urban commons. Elaborating on management strategies provides greater insight into the complexities of managing urban commons and the impacts that governance decisions can have. Finally, including transaction costs highlights the factors that influence costs of managing resources. We illustrate the use of the model with literature from urban India. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

It has been detected in various environmental media and has been shown toxic to aquatic life. The toxic effects of HBCD to aquatic organisms in Chinese freshwater ecosystems are discussed here. Experiments were conducted with nine types of acute toxicity testing and three types of chronic toxicity testing. After comparing a range of species sensitivity distribution models, the optimal model of Bull III was used to derive the safety thresholds for HBCD. The acute safety threshold and the chronic safety threshold of HBCD for Chinese freshwater organisms were found to be 2.32 mg/L and 0.128 mg/L respectively. Both values were verified by the methods of the Netherlands and the United States. HBCD was found to be less toxic compared to other widely used brominated flame retardants. The present results provide valuable information for revision of the water quality standard of HBCD in China.																	0147-6513	1090-2414				MAY	2017	139						43	49		10.1016/j.econv.2017.01.005								WOS:000396640600006	28109902

Arsenic in stream waters is bioaccumulated but neither biomagnified through food webs nor biodispersed to land	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												Human activities such as mining have contributed substantially to the increase of metals in aquatic environments worldwide. These metals are bioaccumulated by aquatic organisms and can be biomagnified along trophic webs. The dispersal of contaminants from water to land has been little investigated, even though most aquatic invertebrates in streams have aerial stages. We used field and laboratory approaches to investigate the effects of arsenic pollution on stream invertebrate assemblages, and its bioaccumulation, biomagnification and trophic transfer from aquatic to terrestrial environments by emergent insects. We conducted the study in an arsenic impacted stream (40 mu g L-1 As at the most polluted site) and a reference stream (0.3 gil-As). Invertebrate abundance and richness were lowest at the most impacted site. Arsenic in biofilm and in invertebrates increased with the arsenic content in the water. The highest arsenic accumulators were bryophytes (1760 mu g mu g(-1)), followed by the biofilm (449 mu g mu g(-1)) and shredder invertebrates (313 mu g mu g(-1)); predators had the lowest arsenic concentration. Insects emerging from water and spiders along streambanks sampled from the reference and the impacted stream did not differ in their body arsenic concentrations. In the laboratory, the shredder Sericostoma vittaturn had reduced feeding rates when exposed to water from the impacted stream in comparison with the reference stream (15.6 vs. 19.0 mg leaves mg body mass(-1) day(-1); p < 0.05), but they grew faster in the polluted water (0.16 0.04% day(-1) vs. 0.05 0.01% day(-1), p < 0.05). S. vittatum exposed to contaminated stream water accumulated arsenic from food, not through contact with water. We concluded that although arsenic is bioaccumulated, mainly by food ingestion, it is not biomagnified through food webs and is not transported from the aquatic to terrestrial environment when insects leave the stream water.

The combined effect of several stressors (deterioration of habitats appropriate for reproduction and growth, invasive species and poor water quality) seems to exert considerable influence on the yellow perch population in LSP, characterized by low recruitment. To better understand possible stressor effects at the biochemical level, LSP yellow perch were compared with other sites along a gradient of increasing human influences from upstream to downstream along the St. Lawrence River. Morphometry (size, weight, circumference and Fulton's condition factor) and biomarkers associated to the peroxidation of lipids, lipophilic antioxidants (a-tocopherol and carotenoids), along with retinoids (vitamins Aland A2) and proteins were compared between sites at the larval, juvenile and adult stages. Fulton's condition factor was similar between sites for juveniles but was significantly lower in LSP adults, suggesting a weakened physiological condition. In most contaminated sites as LSP, lipid peroxidation tended to be higher in juveniles and adults whereas the lipophilic antioxidant lycopene and proteins content were lower. Retinyl esters were significantly lower for LSP fish compared to other sites, not only in larvae but also in the livers of juveniles and adults. These results are consistent with possible altered metabolism in the retinoid system of LSP yellow perch. The overall results reflect the "pressure" gradient tested, where the yellow perch from the most affected sites located downstream had impaired physiological and biochemical conditions compared to the upstream sectors.

By analyzing long-term data from 110 mountainous streams draining into German drinking water reservoirs, nitrate concentrations indeed declined in the majority of catchments. Furthermore, our meta-analysis indicates that the declining nitrate levels are linked to the release of dissolved iron to streams likely due to a reductive dissolution of iron(III) minerals in riparian wetland soils. This dissolution process mobilized adsorbed compounds, such as phosphate, dissolved organic carbon and arsenic, resulting in concentration increases in the streams and higher inputs to receiving drinking water reservoirs. Reductive mobilization was most significant in catchments with stream nitrate concentrations < 6 mg L-1. Here, nitrate, as a competing electron acceptor, was too low in concentration to inhibit microbial iron(III) reduction. Consequently, observed trends were strongest in forested catchments, where nitrate concentrations were unaffected by agricultural and urban sources and which were therefore sensitive to reductions of atmospheric nitrogen depositions. We conclude that there is strong evidence that the decline in nitrogen deposition toward pre-industrial conditions lowers the redox buffer in riparian soils, destabilizing formerly fixed problematic compounds, and results in serious implications for water quality.

J	Coats, ER; Wilson, PI				Coats, Erik R.; Wilson, Patrick I.			Toward Nucleating the Concept of the Water Resource Recovery Facility (WRRF): Perspective from the Principal Actors	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Wastewater resource recovery has been advocated for decades; necessary structural pathways were long-ago articulated, and established and emerging technologies exist. Nevertheless, broad wastewater valorization remains elusive. In considering implementation barriers, the argument is made that decision-makers focus on avoiding permit violations and negative publicity by embracing a conservative/safe approach seemingly ignoring research on economic/environmental benefits. Conversely positing that economics is a primary barrier, we investigated, characterized, and described nontechnical socio-political barriers to realizing wastewater resource recovery. Principal actors in the Pacific NW region of the U.S. (representing a progressive populace facing stringent water quality regulations) were interviewed. Results revealed that economics were, indeed, the primary barrier to implementation/expansion of the WRRF concept. Consistent throughout interviews was a prevalent sense that the "cost of doing something (different)" was a principal consideration in resource recovery actions/policies. Moreover, "economics drives decisions," and "95% the bottom line is money. Show return on investment, it will get people's attention." Who pays was also a concern: "Government isn't going to pay. The states and Federal government won't give any grants, and we can't raise rates." Applying business case evaluations was seen as a pathway to actualizing resource recovery. Most encouragingly, the consensus was that resource recovery is a necessary future paradigm, and that real barriers are surmountable.

We investigated the short-term (2 days) vertical and diel variations in bacterial community structure and microbially derived secondary metabolites during a cyanobacterial bloom that emerged in a highly urbanized tropical reservoir. The waterbody was largely dominated by the cyanobacteria Planktothricoides spp., together with the Synechococcus, Pseudanabaena, Prochlorothrix, and Limnothrix. Spatial differences. (i.e., water depth) rather than temporal differences (i.e., day versus night) better-explained the short-term variability in water quality parameters and bacterial community composition. Difference in bacterial structure suggested a resource-driven distribution pattern for the community. We found that the freshwater bacterial community associated with cyanobacterial blooms is largely conserved at the phylum level, with Proteobacteria (beta-proteobateria), Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria as the main taxa despite the cyanobacterial species present and geographical (Asia, Europe, Australia, and North America) or climatic distinctions. Through multivariate statistical analyses of the bacterial community, environmental parameters, and secondary metabolite concentrations, we observed positive relationships between the occurrences of cyanobacterial groups and off-flavor compounds (2-methyisoborneol and beta-ionone), suggesting a cyanobacterial origin. This study demonstrates the potential of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing as a supporting tool in algal bloom monitoring or water-resource management.

In order to increase sediment P retention, we injected dissolved aluminum into the anoxic sediment of a eutrophic semienclosed bay in the Baltic Sea, thereby inhibiting P recycling and further eutrophication (B). The P concentration in the bay remained at half, as did phytoplankton biomass (C), compared to pretreatment conditions and compared to the reference bay. Four years after treatment the water column transparency was increased, allowing submerged vegetation to penetrate deeper, and the habitat suitable for fish and benthic fauna had expanded (D). The lowered P concentration in the bay decreased the P export to the surrounding archipelago. This is the first full-scale marine remediation project using a geo-engineering method that demonstrates a quick recovery. For successful remediation in coastal areas, permanent binding of mobile P in anoxic sediments may be needed together with measures in the catchment area to obtain faster recovery of eutrophicated marine ecosystems.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				APR 18	2017	51	8					4559	4566		10.1021/acs.est.6b06187								WOS:000399859700046	28350961

In this way we can evaluate how these control actions can be combined in order to achieve a global positive effect on the plant operation. Also, this paper proposes an integral indicator for performance evaluation, which takes into account all three indicators mentioned for plant assessment. This indicator has been defined in a manner which tries to capture the overall performance of the plant, without relying on the subjectivity in granting different weights to the constituent elements of the evaluation criteria. The control of nitrate in the second anoxic tank using internal recirculation flow rate and control of the suspended solids concentration in the fifth tank using wastage flow rate offers the best compromise on the three elements considered for performance evaluation of a wastewater treatment plant: water quality, operational cost and CO2 emissions.

With the Gamtoos Estuary experiencing regular high flow conditions, a key difference between the two systems is the propensity for natural flushing events to occur; a mechanism largely eliminated from the highly-regulated Sundays Catchment. Phytoplankton blooms (>20 Chl-alpha mu g l(-1)) were persistent and seasonal in the Sundays, inducing summer bottom-water hypoxia (<2 mg l(-1)), whilst those in the Gamtoos were episodic and flow-dependent. Of concern in the Sundays Estuary, was the magnitude (>550 mu g l(-1)) and recurrent nature of two harmful algal bloom (HAB) species. This study provides the first account of HAB persistence and seasonal hypoxia in a South African estuary, demonstrating the possible consequences of shifting an ecosystem into a new stable state.

No effects were observed at any sediment concentrations when applied alone. All corals in the lowest light treatments lost chlorophyll a and discoloured (bleached) after a week. Coral mortality only occurred in the two lowest light treatments and was higher when simultaneously exposed to elevated SSCs. Compared to water quality data collected during large dredging programs and natural resuspension events (and in the absence of sediment deposition as a cause-effect pathway) these data suggest the light reduction associated with turbidity poses a proportionally greater risk than effects of elevated SSCs alone.

The current study investigated the use of a new method for measuring valve behaviour responses in mussels (Mytilus edulis) exposed to dispersed crude oil (DCO). Results confirmed that valve gape is a sensitive parameter; at the high DCO concentration (0.25 mg L-1) the mean valve gape was reduced from 49 to 31%, and mussels increased shell movement (measured as distance travelled) or spent more time closed to avoid contact with the oil. At the low DCO concentration (0.015 mg L-1) the distance travelled parameter was the most sensitive endpoint. Results also demonstrated that valve gape behaviour is a valid endpoint when monitoring mussels for exposure to DCO. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

These stressors impact the environmental quality of the Baltic Sea. Each Baltic Sea country contributes to the stressors and, at the same time, is affected by their negative impacts on water quality. Knowledge about benefits from improvements in coastal and marine waters is key to assessing public support for policies aimed at achieving such changes. We propose a new approach to account for variability in benefits related to differences in Socio-demographics of respondents, by using a structural model of discrete choice. Our method allows to incorporate a wide range of socio-demographics as explanatory variables in conditional multinomial logit models Without the risk of collinearity; the model is estimated jointly and hence more statistically efficient than the alternative, typically used approaches. We apply this new technique to a study of the preferences of Latvian citizens towards improvements of the coastal and marine environment quality. We find that overall, Latvians are willing to pay for reducing losses of biodiversity, for improving water quality for recreation by reduced eutrophication, and for reducing new occurrences of invasive alien species. However a significant group within the sample seems not to value environmental improvements in the Baltic Sea, and, thus, is unwilling to support costly measures for achieving such improvements.

Due to plan for obtaining drinking water from the Karacaoren-1 Dam Lake for Antalya Province, this study has great importance. In this study, physical and chemical analyses of water samples taken from 21 locations (in October 2011 and May 2012, two periods) through flow path of the river were investigated. The analysis results were compared with maximum permissible limit values recommended by World Health Organization and Turkish drinking water standards. The water quality for drinking purpose was evaluated using the water quality index (WQI) method. The computed WQI values are between 35.6133 and 337.5198 in the study. The prepared WQI map shows that Karacaoren-1 Dam Lake generally has good water quality. However, Water quality is poor and very poor in the north and south of the river basin. The effects of punctual and diffuse pollutants dominate the water quality in these regions. Furthermore, the most effective water quality parameters are COD and Mg on the determination of WQI for the present study. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Nunes, JP; Jacinto, R; Keizer, JJ				Nunes, Joao Pedro; Jacinto, Rita; Keizer, Jan Jacob			Combined impacts of climate and socio-economic scenarios on irrigation water availability for a dry Mediterranean reservoir	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The impacts of climate and associated socio-economic changes on water availability, including supply and demand, quality, and storage volume, were evaluated for the Vale do Gaio reservoir in southern Portugal, located in a dry Mediterranean climate and already under drought stress. The SWAT model was applied with 6 scenarios for 2071-2100, involving two storylines (A1B and B1) with individual changes in climate (9% rainfall, increasing in winter by +28 to +30%), socio-economic conditions (an increase in irrigation demand by 11%, and a replacement of cereals and pastures by sunflower), and a combination of both. Most future scenarios resulted in lower water availability, due to lower supply (19 to 27%) combined with higher irrigation demand (+3 to + 21%). This resulted in more years with limited irrigation supplies (presently: 28%; scenarios: 37 to 43%), although limitations were mitigated by lower losses to excess discharge. Land-use changes also decreased quality by increasing P concentrations (+29 to +93%). Impacts were more severe in scenario A1B than in Bl, and in combined changes than in climate or socio-economic changes only. Water availability was resilient to climate change, as impacts led only to a moderate aggravation Of present-day conditions. Lower future water availability could be addressed by supply and demand management strategies and, in the most extreme scenario, by water transfers from regional water reserves; water quality issues could be addressed through land-use policies. Results also highlighted the importance of taking the characteristics of water supply systems into account when designing adaptation measures for future changes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Whilst existing research has examined the factors influencing ambient air pollutant concentrations, previous studies have failed to adequately explore the determinants of such concentrations from either a source or diffusion perspective. This study addressed both source (specifically, anthropogenic emissions) and diffusion (namely, meteorological conditions) indicators, in order to detect their respective impacts on the spatial variations seen in the distribution of air pollution. Spatial panel data for 113 major cities in China Was processed using a range of global regression models the ordinary least square model, the spatial lag model, and the spatial error model as well as a local, geographic weighted regression (GWR) model. Results from the study suggest that in 2014, average SO2 concentrations exceeded China's first-level target. The most polluted cities were found to be predominantly located in northern China, while less polluted cities were located in southern China. Global regression results indicated that precipitation exerts a significant effect on SO2 reduction (p < 0.001) and that a regional increase of 1 mm in precipitation can reduce SO2 concentrations by 0.026 mu g/m(3). Both emission and temperature factors were found to aggravate SO2 concentrations, although ho such significant correlation was found in relation to wind speed. GWR results suggest that the association between SO2 and its factors varied over space. Increased emissions were found to be able to produce more pollution in the northwest than in other parts of the country. Higher wind speeds and temperatures in northwestern areas were shown to reinforce SO2 pollution, while in southern regions, they had the opposite effect. Further, increased precipitation was found to exert a greater inhibitory effect on SO2 pollution in the country's northeast than that in other areas. Our findings could provide a detailed reference for formulating regionally specific emission reduction policies in China. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Most of this expansion has occurred over low-intensity pasture and is considered sustainable because it does not involve deforestation of natural vegetation. However, the impacts on the water quality of headwater streams are poorly understood, especially with regard to the influence of land use patterns in the watershed. In this study, we investigated the effects of land-use conversion on the water quality of streams draining sugarcane fields and examined whether the preservation of forested areas at the top of the headwaters would help mitigate the negative impacts of intensive agriculture. Water samples were collected in two paired catchments in southeastern Brazil, which is one of the largest sugarcane production regions in the world. Our results show significant differences in the water quality of streams predominantly draining the pasture or the sugarcane field. SeVeral parameters commonly used to indicate water quality, such as the concentrations of nitrate and suspended solids, were significantly higher in the sugarcane than in the pasture stream. Differences in water quality between the streams draining predominantly pasture or sugarcane fields were accentuated during the wet season. The preservation of forests surrounding the headwater streams was associated with overall better water quality conditions, such as lower nitrate concentrations and temperature of the stream water. We concluded that forest conservation in the headwater agricultural catchments is an important factor preventing water quality degradation in tropical streams. Therefore, we strongly recommend the preservation of robust riparian forests in the headwaters of tropical watersheds with intensive agriculture. More studies on the effects of best agricultural practices in bioenergy crops can greatly improve our capacity to prevent the degradation of water quality in the tropical waterways as intensive agriculture continues to expand in this region of the world.

An Imhoff tank was followed by three stages of CWs (two 1.5m(2) vertical subsurface flow (VF) beds alternating feed-rest cycles, a 2-m(2) horizontal (HF) and a 2-m2 free water surface (FWS) wetland in series). A fraction of the final effluent was recycled back to the Imhoff tank with a recirculation rate of 50% (hydraulic loading rate = 0.37 m d(-1)). The system's performance varied throughout the study. In Period I (summer) consistently high load removal efficiencies of TN (89 +/- 5%) and a removal rate of 6.6 +/- 1.4 g TN m(-2) d(-1) were exhibited. In Period II (fall), the poor performance of the FWS during the senescence of macrophytes caused a large increase in organic matter, solids and nutrient concentrations, drastically deteriorating water quality. The determination of PPCPs was conducted during this period. Recalcitrant compounds, namely sulfamethoxazole, carbamazapine, TCEP and sucralose were negligibly removed in all CWs. However, noteworthy was the;approximate to 30%removal of sucralose in the VF wetland. Caffeine (80%) and fluoxetine (27%) showed similar elimination rates in both VF and HF units, whereas trimethoprim and DEET were significantly better removed in the VF than in the HF. The concentration of the four latter compounds showed a severe increase in the FWS, indicating possible desorption from the sediment/biomass during adverse conditions. Harvesting of the aboveground biomass in this unit returned the system 's performance back to normality (Period III), achieving 77 +/- 7% TN removal despite the winter season, proving effluent recirculation as an effective strategy for TN removal in hybrid CW systems when stringent restrictions are in place.

Long-term assessment at field scale of Floating Treatment Wetlands for improvement of water quality and provision of ecosystem services in a eutrophic urban pond	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Pollution of urban water bodies requires stringent control measures and the development of low-cost and highly efficient alternative technologies. In contrast to Constructed Wetlands, Floating Treatment Wetlands (FTWs) have the advantage of not requiring large surface of land since they operate in situ. However, there is limited information about their long-term evaluation while operating at field scale. The aim of this work was to assess the performance of FTWs using a combination of Pontederia sagittata and Cyperus papyrus for the improvement of the water quality and provision of ecosystem services of a eutrophic urban pond. The FTWs were built with low-cost material easy to acquire and to ensemble. Two FTWs (175 m(2) and 33 m(2)) located in Pond 1 within a complex of 4 urban artificial ponds were evaluated for two years. They promoted an increase in the dissolved oxygen (DD.) within a range of 15 to 67%, a removal of fecal coliforms in the range of 9 to 86% and a nitrate removal in the range of 9 to 76%. The plant productivity reached a maximum of 363 g(dm) m(-2) d(-1) in the FTWI and 536 g(dm) m(-2) d(-1) in the FTW2 during the period March-June 2016. The TKN and the TP content in the plant were in the range of 183 to 28.1 and of 0.05 to 0.196 g kg(-1) city matter, respectively. In conclusion, the tested FTWs have proved to be a very beneficial low-cost technology for the improvement of water quality and provision of ecosystem services. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, studies on phytoplankton growth in tropical lotic systems are still limited. Citizen science approaches use trained volunteers to collect environmental data. We combined data on urban streams collected by volunteers with data obtained by professional scientists to identify potential drivers of phytoplankton community and determine thresholds for Cyanobacteria development. We combined datasets (n = 117) on water quality and environmental observations in 64 Brazilian urban streams with paired data on phytoplankton. Sampling activities encompassed dry (July 2013 and July 2015) and warm (February and November 2014) seasons. Volunteers quantified phosphate (PO43-), nitrate (NO3-) and turbidity in each stream using colorimetric and optical methods and recorded environmental conditions in the immediate surroundings of the sites through visual observations. We used non-parametric statistics to identify correlations among nutrients, turbidity and phytoplankton. We also looked for thresholds with respect to high Cyanobacteria abundance (>50,000 cells/mL). The streams were characterized by relatively high nutrient concentrations (PO43- : 0.11 mg/L; NO3-: 2.6 mg/L) and turbidity (49 NTU). Phytoplanlcton densities reached 189,000 cells/mL, mainly potentially toxic Cyanobacteria species. Moderate but significant (p < 0.05) correlations were observed between phytoplankton density and turbidity (rho = 0.338, Spearman) and PO43- (rho = 0292), but not with NO3-. Other important variables (river flow, temperature and light) were not assessed. Volunteers' observations covaried with phytoplankton density (p < 0.05, Krusl<alWallis), positively with increasing number of pollution sources and negatively with presence of vegetation in the riparian zone. Our results indicate that thresholds for PO43- (0.11 mg/L) can be used to separate systems with high Cyanobacteria density. The number of pollution sources provided a good indicator of waterbodies with potential cyanobacteria problems. Our findings reinforced the need for nutrient abatement and restoration of local streams and highlighted the benefits of volunteer-based monitoring to support decision-making. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, there is only limited information to evaluate the spatial and temporal changes to the Huangpu River and its many tributaries. In the present study, 400 citizen scientists were trained to monitor water quality and environmental conditions on a monthly basis over three years in the lower (high urbanized) Huangpu River catchment. Their data were integrated with high resolution land cover data using GIS techniques to characterize water quality dynamics of the Huangpu River system with respect to main environmental drivers. Environmental driver analysis indicated that up-catchment conditions dominate river dynamics while typical urban impacts (first flush, impermeable land cover...) have only limited influence. According to these results, the city's investments to improve wastewater treatment and mitigate lower river impacts need to be extended throughout the catchment to reduce nutrient concentrations that are near or above thresholds for rivers and streams. The positive impact of in-stream vegetatibn pointed to the possibilities that local scale ecological remediation activities to reduce runoff could be viable approaches to improve river conditions throughout the catchment.

We present a comprehensive dataset of arsenic concentrations from drinking water wells in rural Burkina Faso (n = 1498), of which 14.6% are above 10 mu g/L. Included in this dataset are 269 new samples from regions where no published water quality data existed. We used multivariate logistic regression with arsenic measurements as calibration data and maps of geology and mineral deposits as independent predictor variables to create arsenic prediction models at concentration thresholds of 5,10 and 50 mu/L. These hazard maps delineate areas vulnerable to groundwater arsenic contamination in Burkina Faso. Bedrock composed of schists and volcanic rocks of the Birimian formation, potentially harbouring arsenic-containing sulphide minerals, has the highest probability of yielding groundwater arsenic concentrations >10 mu g/L. Combined with population density estimates, the arsenic prediction models indicate that -560,000 people are potentially exposed to arsenic-contaminated groundwater in Burkina Faso. The same arsenic-bearing geological formations that are positive predictors for elevated arsenic concentrations in Burkina Faso also exist in neighbouring countries such as Mali, Ghana and Ivory Coast. This study's results are thus of transboundary relevance and can act as a trigger for targeted water quality surveys and mitigation efforts. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Fluorescence spectroscopy and parallel factor analysis as a dissolved organic monitoring tool to assess treatment performance in drinking water trains	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Fluorescence excitation emission matrix (FEEM) spectroscopy was used to evaluate its applicability as a tool to track dissolved organic matter (DOM) in a drinking water treatment plant (DWTP) that incorporates a conventional line (consisting in ozonation and GAC filtration) and a membrane-based line (consisting in ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis and mineralization) Working in parallel. Seven sampling points within the different process stages were characterized monthly during 2014. A global Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) was used to pull out underlying organic fractions from the fluorescence spectra. Accordingly a five components model was selected to describe the system and the pros and cons of the model were discussed by analysis of the residuals. Among the five fluorescent components, those associated to humic-like matter (C1, C3 and C4) showed a similar season variability in the river water feeding the DWTP (which resembled that of UV254 and TOC), whereas the two components associated to protein-like matter (C2 and C5) exhibited a different behavior. The maximum fluorescence intensity values (Fmax) were used to quantify DOM removals across the plant. Compared to the conventional line, water from the UF/RO membrane-based line showed between 6 and 14 times lower fluorescence intensity signal for the humic-like components and between 1 and 3 for the protein-like components as compared to the conventional line. The differences in DOM composition due to seasonal variations and along the treatment trains point out the suitability of using fluorescence measurements over other parameters such as UV254 as a monitoring tool to help optimize operation conditions of each treatment stage and improve produced water quality in a DWFP.

Prioritising local action for water quality improvement using citizen science; a study across three major metropolitan areas of China	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Streams in urban areas are prone to degradation. While urbanization-induced poor water quality is a widely observed and well documented phenomenon, the mechanism to pinpoint local drivers of urban stream degradation, and their relative influence on water quality, is still lacking. Utilizing data from the citizen science project FreshWater Watch, we use a machine learning approach to identify key indicators, potential drivers, and potential controls to water quality across the metropolitan areas of Shanghai, Guangzhou and Hong Kong. Partial dependencies were examined to establish the direction of relationships between predictors and water quality. A random forest classification model indicated that predictors of stream water colour (drivers related to artificial land coverage and agricultural land use coverage) and potential controls related to the presence of bankside vegetation were found to be important in identifying basins with degraded water quality conditions, based on individual measurements of turbidity and nutrient (N-NO3 and P-PO4) concentrations.

Loss of ecosystem services due to chronic pollution of forests and surface waters in the Adirondack region (USA)	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Sustaining recent progress in mitigating acid pollution could require lower emissions caps that will give rise to real or perceived tradeoffs between healthy ecosystems and inexpensive energy. Because most impacts of acid rain affect ecosystem functions that are poorly understood by policy-makers and the public, an ecosystem services (ES) framework can help to measure how pollution affects human wellbeing. Focused on the Adirondack region (USA), a global 'hot-spot' of acid pollution, we measured how the chronic acidification of the region's forests, lakes, and streams has affected the potential economic and cultural benefits they provide to society. We estimated that acid-impaired hardwood forests provide roughly half of the potential benefits of forests on moderate to well-buffered soils an estimated loss of $10,000 ha(-1) in net present value of wood products, maple syrup, carbon sequestration, and visual quality. Acidic deposition has had only nominal impact relative to the effects of surficial geology and till depth on the capacity of Adirondack lakes and streams to provide water suitable for drinking. However, as pH declines in lakes, the estimated value of recreational fishing decreases significantly due to loss of desirable fish such as trout. Hatchery stocking programs have partially offset the pollution-mediated losses of fishery value, most effectively in the pH range 4.8-5.5, but are costly and limited in scope. Although any estimates of the monetary 'damages' of acid rain have significant uncertainties, our findings highlight some of the more tangible economic and cultural benefits of pollution mitigation efforts, which continue to face litigation and political opposition.

A macroalgae-based biotechnology for water remediation: Simultaneous removal of Cd, Pb and Hg by living Ulva lactuca	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Metal uptake from contaminated waters by living Ulva lactuca was studied during 6 days, under different relevant contamination scenarios. In mono-metallic solutions, with concentrations ranging from 10 to 100 mu g L-1 for Hg, 10-200 mu g L-1 for Cd, and 50-1000 mu g L-1 for Pb, macroalgae (500 mg L-1, d.w.) were able to remove, in most cases 93-99% of metal, allowing to achieve water quality criteria regarding both surface and drinking waters. In multi-metallic solutions, comprising simultaneously the three metals, living macroalgae still performed well, with Hg removal (c.a. 99%) not being significantly affected by the presence of Cd and Pb, even when those metals were in higher concentrations. Removal efficiencies for Cd and Pb varied between 57 and 96%, and 34-97%, respectively, revealing an affinity of U. lactuca toward metals: Hg > Cd > Pb. Chemical quantification in macroalgae, after bioaccumulation assays demonstrated that all Cd and Hg removed from solution was really bound in macroalgae biomass, while only half of Pb showed to be sorbed on the biomass. Overall, U. lactuca accumulated up to 209 mu g g(-1) of Hg, up to 347 mu g g(-1) of Cd and up to 1641 mu g g(-1) of Pb, which correspond to bioconcentration factors ranging from 500 to 2200, in a dose-dependent accumulation. Pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order and Elovich models showed a good performance in describing the kinetics of bioaccumulation, in the whole period of time. In the range of experimental conditions used, no mortality was observed and U. lactuca relative growth rate was not significantly affected by the presence of metals.

J	Kenari, SLD; Barbeau, B				Kenari, Seyedeh Laleh Dashtban; Barbeau, Benoit			Integrated pyrolucite fluidized bed-membrane hybrid process for improved iron and manganese control in drinking water	WATER RESEARCH												Newly developed ceramic membrane technologies offer numerous advantages over the conventional polymeric membranes. This work proposes a new configuration, an integrated pyrolucite fluidized bed (PFB)-ceramic MOH hybrid process, for improved iron and manganese control in drinking water. A pilot-scale study was undertaken to evaluate the performance of this process with respect to iron and manganese control as well as membrane fouling. In addition, the fouling of commercially available ceramic membranes in conventional preoxidation-MF/UF process was compared with the hybrid process configuration. In this regard, a series of experiments were conducted under different influent water quality and operating conditions. Fouling mechanisms and reversibility were analyzed using blocking law and resistance-in-series models. The results evidenced that the flux rate and the concentration of calcium and humic acids in the feed water have a substantial impact on the filtration behavior of both membranes. The model for constant flux compressible cake formation well described the rise in trans membrane pressure. The compressibility of the filter cake substantially increased in the presence of 2 mg/L humic acids. The presence of calcium ions caused significant aggregation of manganese dioxide and humic acid which severely impacted the extent of membrane fouling. The PFB pretreatment properly alleviated membrane fouling by removing more than 75% and 95% of iron and manganese, respectively. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Keupers, I; Willems, P				Keupers, Ingrid; Willems, Patrick			Development and testing of a fast conceptual river water quality model	WATER RESEARCH												Modern, model based river quality management strongly relies on river water quality models to simulate the temporal and spatial evolution of pollutant concentrations in the water body. Such models are typically constructed by extending detailed hydrodynamic models with a component describing the advection-diffusion and water quality transformation processes in a detailed, physically based way. This approach is too computational time demanding, especially when simulating long time periods that are needed for statistical analysis of the results or when model sensitivity analysis, calibration and validation require a large number of model runs. To overcome this problem, a structure identification method to set up a conceptual river water quality model has been developed. Instead of calculating the water quality concentrations at each water level and discharge node, the river branch is divided into conceptual reservoirs based on user information such as location of interest and boundary inputs. These reservoirs are modelled as Plug Flow Reactor (PFR) and Continuously Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) to describe advection and diffusion processes. The same water quality transformation processes as in the detailed models are considered but with adjusted residence times based on the hydrodynamic simulation results and calibrated to the detailed water quality simulation results. The developed approach allows for a much faster calculation time (factor 10(5)) without significant loss of accuracy, making it feasible to perform time demanding scenario runs.

Effect of advanced oxidation on N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) formation and microbial ecology during pilot-scale biological activated carbon filtration	WATER RESEARCH												Water treatment combining advanced oxidative processes with subsequent exposure to biological activated carbon (BAC) holds promise for the attenuation of recalcitrant pollutants. Here we contrast oxidation and subsequent biofiltration of treated wastewater effluent employing either ozone or UV/ H202 followed by BAC during pilot-scale implementation. Both treatment trains largely met target water quality goals by facilitating the removal of a suite of trace organics and bulk water parameters. Nnitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) formation was observed in ozone fed BAC columns during biofiltration and to a lesser extent in UV/H2O2 fed columns and was most pronounced at 20 min of empty bed contact time (EBCT) when compared to shorter EBCTs evaluated. While microbial populations were highly similar in the upper reaches, deeper samples revealed a divergence within and between BAC filtration systems where EBCT was identified to be a significant environmental predictor for shifts in microbial populations. The abundance of Nitrospira in the top samples of both columns provides an explanation for the oxidation of nitrite and corresponding increases in nitrate concentrations during BAC transit and support interplay between nitrogen cycling with nitrosamine formation. The results of this study demonstrate that pretreatments using ozone versus UV/H2O2 impart modest differences to the overall BAC microbial population structural and functional attributes, and further highlight the need to evaluate NDMA formation prior to full-scale implementation of BAC in potable reuse applications.

Flow cytometric bacterial cell counts challenge conventional heterotrophic plate counts for routine microbiological drinking water monitoring	WATER RESEARCH												Drinking water utilities and researchers continue to rely on the century-old heterotrophic plate counts (HPC) method for routine assessment of general microbiological water quality. Bacterial cell counting with flow cytometry (FCM) is one of a number of alternative methods that challenge this status quo and provide an opportunity for improved water quality monitoring. After more than a decade of application in drinking water research, FCM methodology is optimised and established for routine application, supported by a considerable amount of data from multiple full-scale studies. Bacterial cell concentrations obtained by FCM enable quantification of the entire bacterial community instead of the minute fraction of cultivable bacteria detected with HPC (typically < 1% of all bacteria). FCM measurements are reproducible with relative standard deviations below 3% and can be available within 15 min of samples arriving in the laboratory. High throughput sample processing and complete automation are feasible and FCM analysis is arguably less expensive than HPC when measuring more than 15 water samples per day, depending on the laboratory and selected staining procedure(s). Moreover, many studies have shown FCM total (TCC) and intact (ICC) cell concentrations to be reliable and robust process variables, responsive to changes in the bacterial abundance and relevant for characterising and monitoring drinking water treatment and distribution systems. The purpose of this critical review is to initiate a constructive discussion on whether FCM could replace HPC in routine water quality monitoring. We argue that FCM provides a faster, more descriptive and more representative quantification of bacterial abundance in drinking water. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Reservoirs are suspected to be particularly vulnerable to microplastic pollution. However, very limited information is currently available on pollution characteristics of microplastics in reservoir ecosystems. This work studied the distribution and characteristics of micro plastics in the backwater area of Xiangxi River, a typical tributary of the Three Gorges Reservoir. Microplastics were detected in both surface water and sediment with concentrations ranging from 0.55 X 10(5) to 342 X 10(5) items km(-2) and 80 to 864 items m(-2), respectively. Polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene were identified in surface water, whereas polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyethylene terephthalate, and pigments were observed in sediment. In addition, microplastics were also detected in the digestion tracts of 25.7% of fish samples, and polyethylene and nylon were identified. Redundancy analysis indicates a weak correlation between microplastics and water quality variables but a negative correlation with water level of the reservoir and Secchi depth. Results from this study confirm the presence of high abundance microplastics in reservoir impacted tributaries, and suggest that water level regulated hydrodynamic condition and input of nonpoint sources are important regulators for microplastic accumulation and distribution in the backwater area of reservoir tributaries.

MACEDONIA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOSYSTEMS AND ECOLOGY SCIENCE-IJEES												Biochemical and histopathological analysis for the assessment of the exposure of the aquatic organisms towards the environmental pollution has found a great use in biomonitoring studies of aquatic ecosystems. Biochemical markers, concretely, the liver enzymes of the first phase of transformation of xenobiotics-cytochrome P450 (CYP450), ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and the histological markers, concretely, histopathological changes in the liver parenchyma were used in this study to assess the aquatic environmental pollution of the locations of the river Vardar in the Republic of Macedonia. The selected locations of this river were Vardar river near Vrtok - control station (L1), Vardar river in Jegunovce (L2), Vardar river on the outskirts of Skopje (L3) and Vardar river on the outskirts of Veles (L4). As an indicator species was selected Barbus peloponnesius V. High levels of catalytic activity of EROD in the liver of this fish was highlighted in the Vardar river in Jegunovce (141.71 +/- 7.59 pmol min(-1) mg-1 protein), in the Vardar river on the outskirts of Skopje (132.43 +/- 7.16 pmol min(-1) mg(-1) protein) and in the Vardar river on the outskirts of Velesit (104.34 +/- 8.86 pmol min(-1) mg(-1) protein), compared to the catalytic level of EROD in the liver of this fish of the control group (2.41 +/- 0.23 pmol min(-1) mg(-1) protein). From the histopathological analysis of the fragments analyzed in the liver parenchyma of these fish which were collected in the bottom flows of the river Vardar were ascertained many histopathological changes. The results of this study authenticate the pollution in localities along the downstream of the river Vardar. The results show that the use of chemical and histological markers for assessing water quality is an appropriate method that can fit with the classical methods of monitoring the pollutants.																	2224-4980					APR	2017	7	2					235	244										WOS:000417182700006

Facilities to foster nature-based and heritage-based tourism exist but the area is suffering from a lack of profile and declining market interest, and the very important domestic market in each country is increasingly holidaying elsewhere. There have been many tourism-related support initiatives in the area in the past, but their sustainability is mostly questionable. There is a need for projects to be more strongly embedded in local institutions which take responsibility for continuing them. The accommodation base in Albania is weak, with some developments in community-based tourism. Solid waste issues undermine tourism potential in Albania especially. National Parks are the area's strongest tourism asset at present and sustainable tourism capacity is strongest within some of these organizations. Seasonality is a major challenge not only in Albania but in all three countries and products and events have not been developed to address this. There is an expanding tourist information Centre (TIC) network that can be built upon. There is no real trans-boundary tourism on offer at present and there are very few private sector tour operations in the area, although some small activity tour operators are developing actually.																	2224-4980					APR	2017	7	2					327	330										WOS:000417182700019

Numerical modeling of simultaneous tracer release and piscicide treatment for invasive species control in the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, Chicago, Illinois	ENVIRONMENTAL FLUID MECHANICS												In December 2009, during a piscicide treatment targeting the invasive Asian carp in the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, Rhodamine WT dye was released to track and document the transport and dispersion of the piscicide. In this study, two modeling approaches are presented to reproduce the advection and dispersion of the dye tracer (and piscicide), a one-dimensional analytical solution and a three-dimensional numerical model. The two approaches were compared with field measurements of concentration and their applicability is discussed. Acoustic Doppler current profiler measurements were used to estimate the longitudinal dispersion coefficients at ten cross sections, which were taken as reference for calibrating the longitudinal dispersion coefficient in the one-dimensional analytical solution. While the analytical solution is fast, relatively simple, and can fairly accurately predict the core of the observed concentration time series at points downstream, it does not capture the tail of the breakthrough curves. These tails are well reproduced by the three-dimensional model, because it accounts for the effects of dead zones and a power plant which withdraws nearly 80 % of the water from the canal for cooling purposes before returning it back to the canal.

Interconnectivity oxbow lakes emerge after complex regulating works for the protection of the shores and bottom of the lakes. Research has analyzed the influence of the hydraulic connectivity of three lakes located in northern Poland on the structure of associated bottom invertebrates - elements that monitor the conditions in habitats. The structure and functioning of ecosystems in wetlands, including in oxbow lakes, are direct or indirect in connection to fluctuations in water levels during floods or flow pulsations. Hydrological processes cause changes in the chemical composition of the water in oxbow lakes and sediment dispersion due to the exchange between water and sediments. In the lentic habitats (disconnected from the main river), the retention time is longer than in the semi-and lotic oxbow lakes whereas the productivity of the ecosystem is only internal and limited. The use of macrozoobenthos as bioindicators in re-connected oxbow lakes in small river valleys indicates that, on the long-term period (5 years), it does not have as a result the improvement of the environmental conditions of those habitats. This is shown by the monitoring indicators. The main reason seems to be the loss of the full connectivity between the oxbow lakes and the main river channel within 3 to 4 years, having as a result only systems of semi-lotic oxbow lakes and rivers. This hampers the free exchange of waters between ecosystems, the washing out of nutrients accumulated in sediments, the removal of bottom sediments, as well as the migration of hydrobionts. Therefore, the improvement of the ecological condition of the oxbow lake habitats and the permanence of those changes depend on the possibility of keeping the full hydrological connectivity to the river.

Thus, one of the proposed measures for the next 5 years is encouraging the wastes exploitation for energy recovery. In this context, the main goal of our study was to evaluate the level of pollution considering 5 closed municipal waste dump sites from the North-East region of Romania over the period 2013-2015,having in mind at a first glance, the possibility of methane emissions valorization in the form of biogas. Rapid Impact Assessment Matrix and Leopold's Matrix were used for the environmental impact assessment. The results of the environmental impact assessment showed that the impact on environmental quality was very high for Vaslui and Iasi counties, due to pollution migration from North to South of the studied region, and from one environmental component to another (e.g. from soil to ground water). On the other side, the results obtained by monitoring the emissions generated by the waste dump sites from Botosani County revealed there is a major impact an air quality. The overall impact, quantified by two conventional methods shows that at regional level, heavy metals are the most contributing pollutants to environmental impact, thus it is necessary to implement measures to remediate and protect soil and ground water quality. The results of this study revealed that there are no major negative impacts or fire risks directly generated by waste dump sites, and biogas is not valuable for energy recovery goals.																	1582-9596	1843-3707				APR	2017	16	4					1017	1026										WOS:000405831300027

It values the improvement of water quality in Switzerland in terms of the reduction in environmental and public health risks that would result from implementing new wastewater treatment technologies that substantially reduce micropollutant discharges into water bodies.

Such neonicotinoid use may pose a risk to non-target insects, including pollinators and natural enemies of crop pests, and ecosystems. This study assessed neonicotinoid residues in groundwater, surface runoff water, soil, and native plants adjacent to corn and soybean crop fields with a history of being planted with neonicotinoid-treated seeds from 2008 to 2013. Data from six sites with the same crop management history, three with and three without in-field prairie strips, were collected in 2015-2016, 2-3 years after neonicotinoid (clothianidin and imidacloprid) seed treatments were last used. Three of the six neonicotinoids analyzed were detected in at least one environmental matrix: the two applied as seed coatings on the fields (clothianidin and imidacloprid) and another widely used neonicotinoid (thiamethoxam). Sites with prairie strips generally had lower concentrations of neonicotinoids: groundwater and footslope soil neonicotinoid concentrations were significantly lower in the sites with prairie strips than in those without; mean concentrations for groundwater were 11 and 20 ng/L (p = 0.048) and <1 and 6 ng/g (p = 0.0004) for soil, respectively. Surface runoff water concentrations were not significantly (p = 0.38) different for control sites (44 ng/L) or sites with prairie strips (140 ng/L). Consistent with the decreased inputs of neonicotinoids, concentrations tended to decrease over the sampling timeframe. Two sites recorded concentration increases, however, potentially due to disturbance of previous applications or influence from nearby fields where use of seed treatments continued. There were no detections (limit of detection: 1 ng/g) of neonicotinoids in the foliage or roots of plants comprising prairie strips, indicating a low likelihood of exposure to pollinators and other insects visiting these plants following the cessation of seed coating use. Offsite transport of neonicotinoids to aquatic systems through the groundwater and surface water were furthermore reduced with prairie strips. This study demonstrates the potential for prairie strips comprising 10% of an agricultural catchment to mitigate the non-target impacts of neonicotinoids.

Preferences for policy attributes and willingness to pay for water quality improvements under uncertainty	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												When exploring environmental policy options, sometimes neither the current state of the environmental good being analyzed nor the effectiveness of the proposed policy is known with certainty. This is the case with privately owned, residential, onsite wastewater treatment systems (septic systems)-there is ample evidence that they can contribute to water quality impairment, but their contribution is generally stochastic in nature and the efficacy of technological solutions is uncertain. Furthermore, the benefits of ameliorating water quality impairments are public in nature. Septic system owners are legally responsible for maintaining their systems, but requiring them to upgrade otherwise properly functioning tanks is outside the scope of water quality regulations. An incentive structure is necessary to induce private homeowners to invest in septic upgrades that deliver both private benefits in addition to the positive externality for the wider public and environment. The question for policy makers is how these private incentives should be financed, and whether public support can be garnered. Results of a choice experiment in Gwinnett County, Georgia, accounting for both sources of uncertainty-the current state of water quality and the efficacy of the intervention-in the design of water quality policy are presented. We find baseline water quality conditions and policy efficacy significantly affect public support for a policy transferring public funds to private homeowners, in terms of both sentiment and willingness to pay. The manner in which costs are shared across stakeholders also affects the selection of a policy option, but not willingness to pay for it.

Biofuel as an Integrated Farm Drainage Management crop: A bioeconomic analysis	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Irrigated agricultural lands in arid regions often suffer from soil salinization and lack of drainage, which affect environmental quality and productivity. Integrated Farm Drainage Management (IFDM) systems, where drainage water generated from higher-valued crops grown on high quality soils are used to irrigate salt-tolerant crops grown on marginal soils, is one possible strategy for managing salinity and drainage problems. If the IFDM crop were a biofuel crop, both environmental and private benefits may be generated; however, little is known about this possibility. As such, we develop a bioeconomic programming model of irrigated agricultural production to examine the role salt-tolerant biofuel crops might play within an IFDM system. Our results, generated by optimizing profits over land, water, and crop choice decisions subject to resource constraints, suggest that based on the private profits alone, biofuel crops can be a competitive alternative to the common practices of land retirement and nonbiofuel crop production under both low to high drainage water salinity. Yet IFDM biofuel crop production generates 30-35% fewer GHG emissions than the other strategies.

We also estimated the self-purification capability of TN and TP in Dianshan Lake. The results showed that interannual variability of the average concentration of TN in Dianshan Lake changed significantly, showing a characteristic increase before a decline, and the average concentration of TN showed an obvious downward trend, especially after 2007. Interannual variability of the average concentration of TP in Dianshan Lake fluctuated, and the average concentration of TP showed a downward trend after 2007. The seasonal variations of TN and TP in Dianshan Lake were similar. Higher TN concentration occurred in winter and spring, while higher TP concentration appeared in summer, autumn, and winter. The spatial distribution of TN and TP in Dianshan Lake were similar, showing a characteristic which decreased from north to south and west to east. The highest TN and TP values were mainly distributed in the inlet monitoring sites, while the lowest TP values were distributed in the outlet monitoring sites. The self-purification capability of TN and TP were about 2289.97 t/yr and 112.16 t/yr, which suggested a deterioration of natural water quality. Our research showed that Dianshan Lake was highly eutrophic and that water quality showed a substantial improvement from 1996 to 2015.																	2071-1050					APR	2017	9	4							500	10.3390/su9040500								WOS:000402090300023

Sustainable Ecosystem Services Framework for Tropical Catchment Management: A Review	SUSTAINABILITY												The monsoon season is a natural phenomenon that occurs over the Asian continent, bringing extra precipitation which causes significant impact on most tropical watersheds. The tropical region's countries are rich with natural rainforests and the economies of the countries situated within the region are mainly driven by the agricultural industry. In order to fulfill the agricultural demand, land clearing has worsened the situation by degrading the land surface areas. Rampant land use activities have led to land degradation and soil erosion, resulting in implications on water quality and sedimentation of the river networks. This affects the ecosystem services, especially the hydrological cycles. Intensification of the sedimentation process has resulted in shallower river systems, thus increasing their vulnerability to natural hazards (i.e., climate change, floods). Tropical forests which are essential in servicing their benefits have been depleted due to the increase in human exploitation. This paper provides an overview of the impact of land erosion caused by land use activities within tropical rainforest catchments, which lead to massive sedimentation in tropical rivers, as well as the effects of monsoon on fragile watersheds which can result in catastrophic floods. Forest ecosystems are very important in giving services to regional biogeochemical processes. Balanced ecosystems therefore, play a significant role in servicing humanity and ultimately, may create a new way of environmental management in a cost-effective manner. Essentially, such an understanding will help stakeholders to come up with better strategies in restoring the ecosystem services of tropical watersheds.

Ten districts in rural areas of Beijing, China were selected to study the effects of urbanization on drinking water quality. The relation between the urbanization index and drinking water quality indicators were explored. The influence of the urbanization process on drinking water quality showed that housing construction, population urbanization, energy consumption, and industrialization during urban development were closely related to drinking water quality. The paired t-test showed the total electricity consumption, living electricity consumption, tertiary industry, and the GDP growth rate had boundary (p = 0.06) or significantly positive (p < 0.05) relations with the qualified rate of rural drinking water. The grey correlation analysis showed that the growth rates of the value-added of housing construction areas were the most important factor affecting comprehensive water quality of Beijing rural areas, followed by the growth rates of the value-added by secondary industry and total electricity consumption, and then the growth rates of the value-added by the tertiary industry and GDP. Urbanization had a significant impact on individual water quality indicators. The results of this study provided some supports for drinking water security in the face of urbanization.																	2071-1050					APR	2017	9	4							461	10.3390/su9040461								WOS:000402090300002

Identification and Quantification of Nitrogen in a Reservoir, Jiaodong Peninsula, China	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												Identification of nitrogen (N) sources is important in water quality control and management. Nitrogen pollution can lead to eutrophication of waterbodies and high concentrations of nitrate in drinking water can pose potential health problems. The N-15 isotope and nitrogen fluxes budget approach is useful for determining the source of NO3- to surface waters. In this study, mass balance and N-15 isotope approaches and nitrogen flux budgets were applied to identify total nitrogen (TN) sources and nitrogen transformation processes in the Menlou Reservoir (MR), Jiaodong Peninsula, China. The different fractions of nitrogen and their N-15 isotope signatures were analyzed in the reservoir water, river water, groundwater, soil, and atmospheric precipitation. The results indicate that surface runoff pollution (e.g., fertilizer and animal manure) is the main source of NO3- in MR. High concentrations of TN in MR are caused by low nitrogen self-purification (denitrification) rate, low sediment adsorption capacity, and the influx of NO3- rich groundwater.

There has been a recent increase in the necessity of combining methods and tools to create interdisciplinary evaluations of water ecosystem services, especially in developing countries where there is a lack of systematized and updated socioenvironmental information. We propose a framework for the assessment of water supply ecosystem services that includes environmental, social and economic dimensions. We describe and develop each of these dimensions with a particular focus on identifying the key variables that are needed to answer them. First, we performed research of the literature regarding the evaluation methods that are sufficiently flexible to apply them to local scales in countries where information is limited. Then, we chose the Magdalena River Watershed to apply this perspective because it is an illustrative area of vital importance to Mexico City's ecosystem services. We believe that this proposal has outlined basic guidelines to help decision makers improve water management and may provide an opportunity to change public policies on peri-urban ecosystems.

Carbonate buffering and metabolic controls on carbon dioxide in rivers	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Multiple processes support the significant efflux of carbon dioxide (CO2) from rivers and streams. Attribution of CO2 oversaturation will lead to better quantification of the freshwater carbon cycle and provide insights into the net cycling of nutrients and pollutants. CO2 production is closely related to O-2 consumption because of the metabolic linkage of these gases. However, this relationship can be weakened due to dissolved inorganic carbon inputs from groundwater, carbonate buffering, calcification, and anaerobic metabolism. CO2 and O-2 concentrations and other water quality parameters were analyzed in two data sets: a synoptic field study and nationwide water quality monitoring data. CO2 and O-2 concentrations were strongly negatively correlated in both data sets (rho = -0.67 and rho = -0.63, respectively), although the correlations were weaker in high-alkalinity environments. In nearly all samples, the molar oversaturation of CO2 was a larger magnitude than molar O-2 undersaturation. We used a dynamically coupled O-2-CO2 model to show that lags in CO2 air-water equilibration are a likely cause of this phenomenon. Lags in CO2 equilibration also impart landscape-scale differences in the behavior of CO2 between high- and low-alkalinity watersheds. Although the concept of carbonate buffering and how it creates lags in CO2 equilibration with the atmosphere is well understood, it has not been sufficiently integrated into our understanding of CO2 dynamics in freshwaters. We argue that the consideration of carbonate equilibria and its effects on CO2 dynamics are primary steps in understanding the sources and magnitude of CO2 oversaturation in rivers and streams. Plain Language Summary Carbon dioxide (CO2) emission from streams and rivers is known to be large. The source of CO2 in these systems is of high interest to researchers because it provides important clues about the carbon cycle and the overall biogeochemical functioning of freshwaters. The scientific questions surrounding CO2 emissions from freshwaters have focused on whether CO2 is produced within the aquatic environment through the decomposition of organic material or whether CO2 is produced mostly in soil and groundwater and then delivered to freshwater environments where it is passively emitted to the atmosphere. Both explanations have a basis in reality, and yet neither fully explains the magnitude of estimated CO2 emissions. We examined how CO2 interacts with the rest of the carbonate buffering system to structure CO2 emission to the atmosphere. We found that daily cycles in photosynthesis and decomposition can create continuous CO2 oversaturation because of lags created through carbonate buffering. At the landscape scale, differences were evident in CO2 excess between watersheds having high versus low carbonate buffering. Our conclusions highlight that carbonate buffering is the primary control on CO2 concentration in surface waters and needs to be considered to understand the observations of CO2 excess in freshwaters.

This study identified key factors influencing consumers' perception of water quality in a highly urbanized coastal city, experiencing chronic water shortages, overexploitation of groundwater, and accelerated saltwater intrusion. Household surveys were administered to residents to capture views and perceptions of consumed water. Concomitantly, groundwater and tap water samples were collected and analyzed at each residence for comparison with perceptions. People's rating of groundwater quality was found to correlate to the measured water quality both in the dry and wet seasons. In contrast, perceptions regarding the water quality of the public water supply network did not show any correlation with the measured tap water quality indicators. Logistic regression models developed to predict perception based on salient variables indicated that age, apartment ownership, and levels of total dissolved solids play a significant role in shaping perceptions regarding groundwater quality. Perceptions concerning the water quality of the public water supply network appeared to be independent of the measured total dissolved solids levels at the tap but correlated to those measured in the wells. The study highlights misconceptions that can arise as a result of uncontrolled cross-connections of groundwater to the public supply network water and the development of misaligned perceptions based on prior consumption patterns, water shortages, and a rapidly salinizing groundwater aquifer.

As a result, the realism of objectives and the attainment of related ecological standards are under doubt. This paper gets to the bottom of a river basin management plan of a eutrophic lake in Finland and presents the ecological and economic impacts of environmental and societal drivers and planned management measures. For these purposes, we performed a Monte Carlo simulation of a diffuse nutrient load, lake water quality and cost-benefit models. Simulations were integrated into a Bayesian influence diagram that revealed the basic uncertainties. It turned out that the attainment of good ecological status as qualified in the Water Framework Directive of the European Union is unlikely within given socio-economic constraints. Therefore, management objectives and ecological and economic standards need to be reassessed and reset to provide a realistic goal setting for management. More effort should be put into the evaluation of the total monetary benefits and on the monitoring of lake phosphorus balances to reduce the uncertainties, and the resulting margin of safety and costs and risks of planned management measures.																	0364-152X	1432-1009				APR	2017	59	4					584	593		10.1007/s00267-016-0806-z								WOS:000400444400005	27981355

A Bayesian spatial durbin probit model is used to survey data collected from farmers in the Waikato region of New Zealand. The results show that farmers located near each other exhibit similar choice behaviour, indicating the importance of farmer interactions in adoption decisions. The results also address that information acquisition is the most important determinant of farmers' adoption of best management practices. Financial problems are considered a significant barrier to adopting best management practices. Overall, the existence of distance decay effect and spatial dependence in farmers' adoption decisions highlights the importance of accounting for spatial effects in farmers' decision-making, which emerges as crucial to the formulation of sustainable agriculture policy.

Characterizing the Effects of Stormwater Mitigation on Nutrient Export and Stream Concentrations	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Urbanization increases nutrient loading and lowers residence times for processing of reactive solutes, including nitrate, total dissolved nitrogen, orthophosphate, and dissolved organic carbon), which leads to increased stream concentrations and mass export. Stormwater control measures mitigate the impacts of urbanization, and have the potential to improve stream water quality, however the net effect instream is not well understood. We monitored two urban and two suburban watersheds in Charlotte, NC to determine if mitigation controlled the fraction of total mass export during storm, if development classification as either urban or suburban (defined by the age, density and distribution of urban development) controlled storm nutrient and carbon dynamics, and if stormwater control measures were able to change stream water chemistry. While average concentrations during stormflow were generally greater than baseflow, indicating that storms are important times of solute export, the fraction of storm-derived export was unrelated to mitigation by stormwater control measures. Development classification was generally not an important control on export of N and dissolved organic carbon. However, event mean concentrations of orthophosphate were higher at the suburban sites, possibly from greater fertilizer application. Stormwater control measures influenced instream water chemistry at only one site, which also had the greatest mitigated area, but differences between stormwater control measure outflow and stream water suggest the potential for water quality improvements. Together, results suggest stormwater control measures have the potential to decrease solute concentrations from urban runoff, but the type, location, and extent of urban development in the watershed may influence the magnitude of this effect.

Mowing Submerged Macrophytes in Shallow Lakes with Alternative Stable States: Battling the Good Guys?	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Submerged macrophytes play an important role in maintaining good water quality in shallow lakes. Yet extensive stands easily interfere with various services provided by these lakes, and harvesting is increasingly applied as a management measure. Because shallow lakes may possess alternative stable states over a wide range of environmental conditions, designing a successful mowing strategy is challenging, given the important role of macrophytes in stabilizing the clear water state. In this study, the integrated ecosystem model PCLake is used to explore the consequences of mowing, in terms of reducing nuisance and ecosystem stability, for a wide range of external nutrient loadings, mowing intensities and timings. Elodea is used as a model species. Additionally, we use PCLake to estimate how much phosphorus is removed with the harvested biomass, and evaluate the long-term effect of harvesting. Our model indicates that mowing can temporarily reduce nuisance caused by submerged plants in the first weeks after cutting, particularly when external nutrient loading is fairly low. The risk of instigating a regime shift can be tempered by mowing halfway the growing season when the resilience of the system is highest, as our model showed. Up to half of the phosphorus entering the system can potentially be removed along with the harvested biomass. As a result, prolonged mowing can prevent an oligo-to mesotrophic lake from becoming eutrophic to a certain extent, as our model shows that the critical nutrient loading, where the lake shifts to the turbid phytoplankton-dominated state, can be slightly increased.

Chemical, Physical, and Biological Factors Shape Littoral Invertebrate Community Structure in Coal-Mining End-Pit Lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Aquatic invertebrates form the base of the consumer food web in lakes. In coal-mining end-pit lakes, invertebrates are exposed to an environment with potentially challenging physical and chemical features. We hypothesized that the physical and chemical features of end-pit lakes reduce critical littoral habitat and thus reduce invertebrate diversity, thereby limiting the potential for these lakes to be naturalized. We used a multivariate approach using principle component analysis and redundancy analysis to study relationships between invertebrate community structure, habitat features, and water quality in five end-pit lakes and five natural lakes in the Rocky Mountain foothills of west-central Alberta, Canada. Results show a significantly different invertebrate community structure was present in end-pit lakes as compared with reference lakes in the same region, which could be accounted for by water hardness, conductivity, slope of the littoral zone, and phosphorus concentrations. Habitat diversity in end-pit lakes was also limited, cover provided by macrophytes was scarce, and basin slopes were significantly steeper in pit lakes. Although water chemistry is currently the strongest influencing factor on the invertebrate community, physical challenges of habitat homogeneity and steep slopes in the littoral zones were identified as major drivers of invertebrate community structure. The addition of floating wetlands to the littoral zone of existing pit lakes can add habitat complexity without the need for large-scale alterations to basing morphology, while impermeable capping of waste-rock and the inclusion of littoral habitat in the planning process of new pit lakes can improve the success of integrating new pit lakes into the landscape.

Rainfall effects on inflow and infiltration in wastewater treatment systems in a coastal plain region	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Aging wastewater collection and treatment systems have not received as much attention as other forms of infrastructure, even though they are vital to public health, economic growth, and environmental quality. Inflow and infiltration (I&I) are among potentially widespread problems facing central sewage collection and treatment systems, posing risks of sanitary system overflows (SSOs),system degradation, and water quality impairment, but remain poorly quantified. Whole-system analyses of I& I were conducted by regression analyses of system flow responses to rainfall and temperature for 93 wastewater treatment plants in 23 counties in eastern North Carolina, USA, a coastal plain region with high water tables and generally higher rainfalls than the continental interior. Statistically significant flow responses to rainfall were found in 92% of these systems, with 2-year average I& I values exceeding 10% of rainless system flow in over 40% of them. The effects of rainfall, which can be intense in this coastal region, have region-wide implications for sewer system performance and environmental management. The positive association between rainfall and excessive I& I parallels the effects of storm water runoff on water quality, in that excessive I& I can also drive SSOs, thus confounding water quality protection efforts.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				APR	2017	75	8					1909	1921		10.2166/wst.2017.072								WOS:000400374700017	28452783

Youth-focused citizen science: Examining the role of environmental science learning and agency for conservation	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Citizen science by youth is rapidly expanding, but very little research has addressed the ways programs meet the dual goals of rigorous conservation science and environmental science education. We examined case studies of youth-focused community and citizen science (CCS) and analyzed the learning processes and outcomes, and stewardship activities for youth, as well as contributions to site and species management, each as conservation outcomes. Examining two programs (one coastal and one water quality monitoring) across multiple sites in the San Francisco Bay Area, CA, in-and out-of-school settings, we qualitatively analyzed in-depth observations and pre- and post-program interviews with youth and educators. First, we examined evidence from the programs' impacts on conservation in the form of contribution to site and species management. We found that youth work informed regional resource management and local habitat improvement. Second, we examined the youth participants' environmental science agency (ESA). ESA combines not only understanding of environmental science and inquiry practices, but also the youths' identification with those practices and their developing belief that the ecosystem is something on which they act. We found that youth developed different aspects of environmental science agency in each context. We identify three key CCS processes through which many of the youth developed ESA: ensuring rigorous data collection, disseminating scientific findings to authentic external audiences, and investigating complex social-ecological systems. Our findings suggest that when CCS programs for youth support these processes, they can foster youth participation in current conservation actions, and build their capacity for future conservation actions.

J	Batabyal, AK				Batabyal, Asit Kumar			Hydrogeochemical processes and contaminants enrichment with special emphasis on fluoride in groundwater of Birbhum district, West Bengal, India	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The hydrogeochemistry of groundwater in rural parts of Birbhum district, West Bengal, India, has been studied to understand the contaminants and prime processes involved in their enrichment with a focus on F- concentration. The lithological units consist of Quaternary alluviums with underlying Rajmahal basaltic rocks of Middle Jurassic age. Groundwater occurs in the alluviums, weathered residuum and fracture zone of Rajmahal rocks. Studies show elevated concentration of Cl-, SiO2, Fe and F-; excess Cl- is attributed to anthropogenic inputs, SiO2 is ascribed to high degree of weathering of silica rich host rocks, and high Fe is due to the interaction of water with Fe-rich sediments under reducing condition. The F- concentration is found high (>1.20 mg/L) mainly in water from Rajmahal rocks revealing a lithological control on F- enrichment. The weathering of silicates and ion exchange are the leading controlling processes for major ions in groundwater. The F- enrichment is due to the dissolution of F--bearing minerals and perhaps also through anion exchange (OH- for F-) on clay minerals at high alkaline conditions; precipitation of CaCO3 favours CaF2 dissolution leading to elevated F- concentration. CaHCO3, the dominant water type, contains low F- while NaHCO3 and NaCl types exhibit high F- concentrations. Among the three spatial associations, Cluster-1 and Cluster-2 are CaHCO3 type; Cluster-3 shows NaHCO3 and NaCl waters with low Ca2+ and Mg2+ and high Na+ contents. Cluster-1 and Cluster-2 waters are, in general, drinkable barring the elevated Fe content, while Cluster-3 water is unsafe for drinking due to the high F- concentration.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				APR	2017	76	7							285	10.1007/s12665-017-6584-y								WOS:000399674700022

Serpentine geology links to water quality and heavy metals in sediments of a stream system in central Queensland, Australia	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Serpentinite soils, common throughout the world, are characterized by low calcium-to-magnesium ratios, low nutrient levels and elevated levels of heavy metals. Yet the water quality and heavy metal concentrations in sediments of streams draining serpentine geology have been little studied. The aim of this work was to collect baseline data on the water quality (for both wet and dry seasons) and metals in sediments at 11 sites on the Marlborough Creek system, which drains serpentine soils in coastal central Queensland, Australia. Water quality of the system was characterized by extremely hard waters (555-698 mg/L as CaCO3), high dissolved salts (684-1285 mg/L), pH (8.3-9.1) and dissolved oxygen (often >110% saturation). Cationic dominance was Mg > Na > Ca > K and for anions HCO3 > Cl > SO4. Al, Cu and Zn in stream waters were naturally high and exceeded Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council guidelines. Conductivity displayed the highest seasonal variability, decreasing significantly after wet season flows. There was little seasonal variation in pH, which often exceeded regional guidelines. Stream sediments were enriched with concentrations of Ni, Cr, Co and Zn up to 35, 21, 10 and 2 times the world average for shallow sediments, respectively. Concentrations for Ni and Cr were up to 60 and 16 times those of the relevant Interim Sediment Quality Guidelines Low Trigger Values, respectively. The distinctive nature of the water and sediment data suggests that it would be appropriate to establish more localized water quality and sediment guidelines for the creek system for the water quality parameters conductivity, Cu and Zn (and possibly Cr and Cd also), and for sediment concentrations of Cd, Cr and Ni.

Thermal groundwater contributions of arsenic and other trace elements to the middle Provo River, Utah, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Groundwater inputs can impact river water quality but are difficult to disentangle from agricultural, urban, and storm runoff. To better understand the multiple processes affecting water quality, we used major solute and trace element concentrations with continuous measurements of flow rates and specific conductance to track temporal and spatial changes in surface water and groundwater solute inputs into the middle Provo River, located in northern Utah, USA. Thermal groundwater was the most important source of major solutes and trace elements to the middle Provo River, with concentrations of As, B, Cs, Li, Sr, and Rb increasing dramatically (twofold to tenfold) downstream of thermal water inputs in the Snake Creek tributary. Snake Creek accounted for only 20% of the flow to the Provo River but increased the As concentrations similar to four-fold. Diffuse groundwater inputs, including thermal water, along the Provo River also contributed a measureable increase in solute concentrations. Mixing calculations indicate that groundwater contributed up to 10% of the total streamflow to the middle Provo River, causing an increase in thermal groundwater- derived trace element concentrations. In addition to natural groundwater inputs, water quality was impacted by anthropogenic trace and major element inputs from surface water tributaries. Nitrate, Ba, and V concentrations increased substantially downstream of agricultural/urban inputs. Specific conductance data showed that tributaries added solutes to the Provo River during runoff events, likely from the washoff of road salts. With evidence of both natural and anthropogenic inputs of trace and major elements to the middle Provo River, our study has implications for understanding water quality in complex coupled human-natural systems and demonstrates the influence of thermal groundwater inputs on water quality where such systems discharge.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				APR	2017	76	7							268	10.1007/s12665-017-6594-9								WOS:000399674700006

In order to prevent the expert judgments of the parameters weight that occurs when the Water Quality Index (WQI) method is used, the entropy method was used. Entropy and its weight were calculated, and parameters spatial autocorrelation was then determined. The spatial autocorrelation assessment confirmed the entropy theory results. The maximum spatial autocorrelation, minimum entropy and therefore the highest effectiveness rate on groundwater quality of Azarshahr Plain were found to be associated with bicarbonate. Using the entropy weighted WQI, the groundwater quality was classified into five categories: excellent, good, moderate, poor and extremely poor. According to the entropy weighted WQI, the groundwater quality of study area can be classified into "good'' to "poor'' domains.

Hierarchical approach to hydrological model calibration	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Hydrological models have been widely used for water resources management. Successful application of hydrological models depends on careful calibration and uncertainty analysis. Spatial unit of water balance calculations may differ widely in different models from grids to hydrological response units (HRU). The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) software uses HRU as the spatial unit. SWAT simulates hydrological processes at sub-basin level by deriving HRUs by thresholding areas of soil type, land use, and slope combinations. This may ignore some important areas, which may have great impact on hydrological processes in the watershed. In this study, a hierarchical HRU approach was developed in order to increase model performance and reduce computational complexity simultaneously. For hierarchical optimization, HRUs are first divided into two-HRU types and are optimized with respect to some relevant influence parameters. Then, each HRU is further divided into two. Each child HRU inherits the optimum parameter values of the parent HRU as its initial value. This approach decreases the total calibration time while obtaining a better result. The performance of the hierarchical methodology is demonstrated on two basins, namely Sarisu-Eylikler and Namazgah Dam Lake Basins in Turkey. In Sarisu-Eylikler, we obtained good results by a combination of curve number (CN2), soil hydraulic conductivity, and slope for generating HRUs, while in Namazgah use of only CN2 gave better results.

Uncontrolled flows from poorly constructed and uncapped artesian wells over the last 30 years have caused the deterioration of the quality of shallow groundwater and surface water. They also have been accelerating the discharge of saline water from deep aquifers and have caused the loss of shallow fresh groundwater resources through the downward percolation of fresh water to replace the extracted deep salty groundwater. A lack of adequate controls on the construction and maintenance of artesian wells is leading to widespread water quality problems in the region, which limits the ability of future generations to access high-quality water, a clear breach of the principle of intergenerational equity.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				APR	2017	76	7							291	10.1007/s12665-017-6610-0								WOS:000399674700028

Anoxia stimulates microbially catalyzed metal release from Animas River sediments	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS												The Gold King Mine spill in August 2015 released 11 million liters of metal-rich mine waste to the Animas River watershed, an area that has been previously exposed to historical mining activity spanning more than a century. Although adsorption onto fluvial sediments was responsible for rapid immobilization of a significant fraction of the spill-associated metals, patterns of longer-term mobility are poorly constrained. Metals associated with river sediments collected downstream of the Gold King Mine in August 2015 exhibited distinct presence and abundance patterns linked to location and mineralogy. Simulating riverbed burial and development of anoxic conditions, sediment microcosm experiments amended with Animas River dissolved organic carbon revealed the release of specific metal pools coupled to microbial Fe-and SO42--reduction. Results suggest that future sedimentation and burial of riverbed materials may drive longer-term changes in patterns of metal remobilization linked to anaerobic microbial metabolism, potentially driving decreases in downstream water quality. Such patterns emphasize the need for long-term water monitoring efforts in metal-impacted watersheds.

Impact of Shrub Willow (Salix spp.) as a Potential Bioenergy Feedstock on Water Quality and Greenhouse Gas Emissions	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												The development of shrub willow as a bioenergy feedstock contributes to renewable energy portfolios in many countries with temperate climates and marginal croplands. As willow is developed commercially in the US Northeast, there is a need to better understand its impact on water quality and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to alternative land uses (e.g., corn, hay). We measured the impact of cultivated willow of various ages (2 and 5 years) and management strategies (fertilized vs. unfertilized) compared to corn and hay on water table depth, soil water NO3- and PO43- concentrations, and (NO)-O-2, CH4, and CO2 fluxes at the soil-atmosphere interface during a drier than normal year in heavy clay soils with marginal agricultural value in upstate New York, USA. Soil water concentrations resulted in higher PO43- in willow and higher NO3- in corn and hay, although willow is unlikely to negatively impact water quality with respect to phosphorus due to shorter periods of hydrologic connectivity in willow and hay than in corn. Gas fluxes varied spatially and temporally with hot moments of CH4 and N2O in corn and hay and seasonally variable CO2 in willow. While CH4 did not vary between fields, N2O was higher in corn and hay, and CO2 in willow, resulting in no net difference between CO2 equivalent (CH4, CO2, and N2O) emissions between fields. Converting marginal cropland on clay soils from corn or hay to willow left overall GHG emissions unaffected, slightly increased PO43-, and decreased NO3- concentrations in soil water.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				APR	2017	228	4							170	10.1007/s11270-017-3350-4								WOS:000399872600049

A Mechanistic Model for Secchi Disk Depth, Driven by Light Scattering Constituents	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												An optics theory-based mechanistic model for Secchi disk depth (Z(SD)) is advanced, tested, and applied for Cayuga Lake, NY. Robust data sets supported the initiative, including for (1) Z(SD), (2) multiple light attenuation metrics, most importantly the beam attenuation (c) and particulate scattering (b(p)) coefficients, and (3) measures of constituents responsible for contributions to b(p) by phytoplankton (b(o)) and minerogenic particles (b(m)). The model features two serially connected links. The first link supports predictions of b(p) from those for b(o) and b(m). The second link provides predictions of Z(SD) based on those for b(p), utilizing an earlier optical theory radiative transfer equation. Recent advancements in mechanistically strong estimates of b(m), empirical estimates of b(o), and more widely available bulk measurements of c and b(p) have enabled a transformation from a theory-based conceptual to this implementable Z(SD) model for lacustrine waters. The successfully tested model was applied to quantify the contributions of phytoplankton biomass, and minerogenic particle groups, such as terrigenous clay minerals and autochthonously produced calcite, to recent b(p) and Z(SD) levels and dynamics. Moreover, it has utility for integration as a submodel into larger water quality models to upgrade their predictive capabilities for Z(SD).

Water Use and Treatment in Container-Grown Specialty Crop Production: A Review	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												While governments and individuals strive to maintain the availability of high-quality water resources, many factors can "change the landscape" of water availability and quality, including drought, climate change, saltwater intrusion, aquifer depletion, population increases, and policy changes. Specialty crop producers, including nursery and greenhouse container operations, rely heavily on available high-quality water from surface and groundwater sources for crop production. Ideally, these growers should focus on increasing water application efficiency through proper construction and maintenance of irrigation systems, and timing of irrigation to minimize water and sediment runoff, which serve as the transport mechanism for agrichemical inputs and pathogens. Rainfall and irrigation runoff from specialty crop operations can contribute to impairment of groundwater and surface water resources both on-farm and into the surrounding environment. This review focuses on multiple facets of water use, reuse, and runoff in nursery and greenhouse production including current and future regulations, typical water contaminants in production runoff and available remediation technologies, and minimizing water loss and runoff (both on-site and off-site). Water filtration and treatment for the removal of sediment, pathogens, and agrichemicals are discussed, highlighting not only existing understanding but also knowledge gaps. Container-grown crop producers can either adopt research-based best management practices proactively to minimize the economic and environmental risk of limited access to high-quality water, be required to change by external factors such as regulations and fines, or adapt production practices over time as a result of changing climate conditions.

Sources and Persistence of Fecal Indicator Bacteria and Bacteroidales in Sand as Measured by Culture-Based and Culture-Independent Methods: a Case Study at Santa Monica Pier, California	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												This study investigated causes of persistent fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) in beach sand under the pier in Santa Monica, CA. FIB levels were up to 1000 times higher in sand underneath the pier than that collected from adjacent to the pier, with the highest concentrations under the pier in spring and fall. Escherichia coli (EC) and enterococci (ENT) under the pier were significantly positively correlated with moisture (rho = 0.61, p < 0.001, n = 59; rho = 0.43, p < 0.001, n = 59, respectively), and ENT levels measured by qPCR (qENT) were much higher than those measured by membrane filtration (cENT). Microcosm experiments tested the ability of EC, qENT, cENT, and general Bacteroidales (GenBac) to persist under in situ moisture conditions (10 and 0.1%). Decay rates of qENT, cENT, and GenBac were not significantly different from zero at either moisture level, while decay rates for EC were relatively rapid during the microcosm at 10% moisture (k = 0.7 days(-1)). Gull/pelican marker was detected at 8 of 12 sites and no human-associated markers (TaqHF183 and HumM2) were detected at any site during a 1-day site survey. Results from this study indicate that the high levels of FIB observed likely stem from environmental sources combined with high persistence of FIB under the pier.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				APR	2017	228	4							124	10.1007/s11270-017-3291-y								WOS:000399872600003

The maintenance of high quality of inland water status necessitates development of means for rapid quality monitoring. Imaging spectrometry techniques are proven technology that can provide useful information for the estimation of inland water quality attributes due to fast speed, noninvasiveness, ease of use, and in situ operation. Although there have been many studies conducted on the use of imaging spectrometry for marine water quality monitoring and assessment, relatively few studies have considered inland water bodies. The aim of this review is to present an overview of imaging spectrometry technologies for the monitoring of inland waters including spaceborne and airborne and field or ground-based hyperspectral systems.

Watershed-scale simulation models can provide useful and convenient tools for this evaluation, but simulated conservation practice effectiveness should be responsive to parameter values used to represent the practices in the modeling. The objectives of this study were to (1) assess the impacts of a set of conservation practices on hydrology and water quality of a watershed and (2) evaluate the sensitivity of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) modeling outputs and simulated conservation practice effectiveness to parameters. The modeling study was conducted in an agricultural watershed, the subwatershed K (16.9 km(2)) of the Little River Experimental watershed located in the South Atlantic Coastal Plain of the USA. Sensitivity analysis showed that hydrologic response unit (HRU) and watershed-scale simulations for water quality were most sensitive to CN and FILTERW parameters. Load reduction rates as a function of increased aerial coverage of the conservation practices were greatest for total phosphorus (TP), followed by sediment and total nitrogen (TN). The results indicated that conservation practices would have a limited impact on stream flow volume but could have a significant impact on sediment and TP loads within this region. Watershed-scale TN and TP loads were also sensitive to an in-stream nutrient transformation process represented using the QUAL2E algorithm in SWAT. The study clearly demonstrated the most sensitive model parameters and the optimal conservation practices for this watershed.

The bacterial community dynamics of two drinking water supply systems (traditional and advanced treatment processes) in this plant were studied from the source to the product water. Analysis by 454 pyrosequencing was conducted to characterize the bacterial diversity in each step of the treatment processes. The bacterial communities in these two treatment processes were highly diverse. Proteobacteria, which mainly consisted of beta-proteobacteria, was the dominant phylum. The two treatment processes used in the plant could effectively remove organic pollutants and microbial polution, especially the advanced treatment process. Significant differences in the detection of the major groups were observed in the product water samples in the treatment processes. The treatment processes, particularly the biological pretreatment and O-3-biological activated carbon in the advanced treatment process, highly influenced the microbial community composition and the water quality. Some opportunistic pathogens were found in the water. Nitrogen-relative microorganisms found in the biofilm of filters may perform an important function on the microbial community composition and water quality improvement.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				APR	2017	24	10					8924	8932		10.1007/s11356-015-5116-0								WOS:000399239800005	26250817

However, more than one billion people worldwide currently lack access to safe drinking water, and a diversity of waterborne outbreaks caused by pathogens is reported in nations at all levels of economic development. Spatio-temporal distribution of conventional pollutants and five pathogenic microorganisms were discussed for the Haihe River Basin. Land use and socio-economic assessments were coupled with comprehensive water quality monitoring. Physical, chemical, and biological parameters were measured at 20 different sites in the watershed for 1 year, including pH, temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, chemical oxygen demand, ammonia-N, total and fecal coliforms, E. coli, and Enterococcus. The results highlighted the high spatio-temporal variability in pathogen distribution at watershed scale: high concentration of somatic coliphages and fecal indicator bacteria in March and December and their very low concentration in June and September. All pathogens were positively correlated to urban/rural residential/industrial land and negatively correlated to other four land use types. Microbial pollution was greatly correlated with population density, urbanization rate, and percentage of the tertiary industry in the gross domestic product. In the future, river microbial risk control strategy should focus more on the effective management of secondary effluent of wastewater treatment plant and land around rivers.

Influence of livestock activities on residue antibiotic levels of rivers in Hong Kong	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Occurrence of 10 antibiotics in the Yuen Long (YLR), Kam Tin (KTR), and Shing Mun (SMR) rivers of Hong Kong and possible influence of livestock activities on the concentrations of antibiotics were investigated. Tetracycline (30-497 ng/L), sulfadiazine (2-80 ng/L), sulfamethoxazole (2-152 ng/L), ofloxacin (5-227 ng/L), and erythromycin (1-315 ng/L) were detected in all the three rivers; chlortetracycline (23-227 ng/L), oxytetracycline (7-104 ng/L), ciprofloxacin (12-68 ng/L), and roxithromycin (1-105 ng/L) were detected in YLR and KTR, whereas norfloxacin (3-34 ng/L) was detected in KTR only. Significant correlation between livestock population and antibiotic contamination was observed in YLR only, indicating the influences of other sources in KTR and SMR. Among the antibiotics, significant correlation was observed between tetracyclines and sulfonamides indicating the major influence of livestock farms, whereas tetracyclines/sulfonamides were negatively correlated with fluoroquinolones/macrolides implying the differential origin of the latter class of antibiotics. Water quality of KTR and YLR were highly influenced by the non-point source pollutions, while of SMR was relatively good. Particularly, Escherichia coli populations of the YLR and KTR were 3-4 logs higher than those of the SMR indicating the involvement of livestock farms and sewerages. Good correlation between tetracyclines (TCs)/sulfonamides (SAs) and number of livestock farms and a negative correlation between TCs/SAs and fluoroquinolones (FQs)/macrolides (MLs) could be used as an indicator to trace the possible source of pollution.

Toxicological endpoints such as survival rates of P. major embryos or larvae and the rates of hatching and of malformation (oedema, condensed blood, spinal curvatures or eye abnormalities) were noted and described within 48 h of exposure. The LC50, EC50, no-observed-effect concentration (NOEC) and lowest-observed-effect concentration (LOEC) were calculated, based on the dose-response relationship. The results showed that exposures to all of the selected organic pollutants except for methyl parathion produced acute toxic effects on P. major embryos and larvae, at different levels of exposure. The levels of acute toxicity of the eight typical organic pollutants for P. major embryos and larvae showed the following trend: benzo(a) pyrene > malathion > PCB 126 > pyrene > nonylphenol > phenanthrene > monocrotophos > methyl parathion. However, the larvae were more sensitive to these pollutants than embryos, according to the calculated LC50, EC50, NOEC and LOEC. This increased sensitivity of larvae could have resulted from losing the natural barrier function of the egg shell membrane. Benzo(a) pyrene, malathion, nonylphenol and monocrotophos delayed the development of P. major for both embryos and larvae, and decreased the hatching rate of the embryos. These results implied that the development of fish embryos and larvae could serve as potential biomarkers for evaluating organic contamination in the aquatic environment. The marine economic fish P. major was more sensitive to PAHs than the model fish, marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma). The estimated safe concentrations (SCs) for marine economic fish, as determined in our research, could provide a reference for the formulation of water quality criteria.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				APR	2017	24	10					9067	9078		10.1007/s11356-016-6282-4								WOS:000399239800018	27130341

This was followed by the parametric level analysis of the water chemistry parameters, and finally, the aquatic environment index (AEI) was calculated, which provided general information on the quality of water regarding the water chemistry parameters.

Evaluating the performance of buffers for a range of pesticides and environmental conditions can be very expensive. Recent studies suggested that the fluorescent dyes uranine and sulforhodamine B could be used as cost-effective surrogates of herbicides to evaluate buffer performance. However, while transformation mechanisms in buffers have been extensively documented, sorption processes of both dyes have rarely been investigated. In this study, we measured the adsorption, desorption, and kinetic sorption coefficients of uranine and sulforhodamine B for a diverse range of buffer zone materials (soils, litters, plants) and compared the adsorption coefficients (Kd) to those of selected herbicides. We also compared the global sorption capacity of 6 ditches, characterized by varying proportions of the aforementioned materials, between both dyes and a set of four herbicides using the sorption-induced pesticide retention indicator (SPRI). We found that both the individual Kd of uranine for the diverse buffer materials and the global sorption capacity of the ditches are equivalent to those of the herbicides diuron, isoproturon, and metolachlor. The Kd of sulforhodamine B on plants and soils are equivalent to those of glyphosate, and the global sorption capacities of the ditches are equivalent for both molecules. Hence, we demonstrate for the first time that uranine can be used as a proxy of moderately hydrophobic herbicides to evaluate the performance of buffer systems, whereas sulforhodamine B can serve as a proxy for more strongly sorbing herbicides.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				APR	2017	24	12					11752	11763		10.1007/s11356-017-8703-4								WOS:000399399700078	28337625

Jmaiff; Wang, Wei; Vemula, Sai; Jaeger, Benjamin T.; Li, Xing-Fang			Sweetened Swimming Pools and Hot Tubs	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY LETTERS												Nitrogenous organics in urine can react with chlorine in swimming pools to form volatile and irritating N-Cl-amines. A urinary marker is desirable for the control of pool water quality. The widespread consumption of acesulfame-K (ACE), a stable synthetic sweetener, and its complete excretion in urine, makes it an ideal urinary marker. Here we report the occurrence of ACE and its potential application in swimming pools and hot tubs. First, we developed a new method for achieving high-throughput analysis of ACE without preconcentration or large-volume injection. Analysis of more than 250 samples from 31 pools and tubs from two Canadian cities showed ACE in all samples. Concentrations ranged from 30 to 7110 ng/L, up to 570-fold greater than in the input tap water. The level of dissolved organic carbon was significantly greater in all pools and tubs than in the input water. Finally, we determined the levels of ACE over 3 weeks in two pools (110000 and 220000 U.S. gallons) and used the average ACE level to estimate the urine contribution as 30 and 75 L. This study clearly shows the human impact in pools and tubs. This work is useful for future studies of the human contribution to DBP formation, epidemiological assessment of exposure, and adverse health effects in recreational facilities.

In addition, it may promote the development of movable/portable containerized MBRs for a diverse range of wastewater treatment applications. Applications may include the provision of municipal/industrial wastewater treatment in remote areas without sewerage, and the provision of sanitation services under challenging site-specific conditions such as after the occurrence of a human-made or a natural disaster. The reduction of the footprint requirements of MBRs is constrained by the maximum amount of biomass that can be accommodated in the aerobic basin. The biomass concentration is mainly limited by the extremely low oxygen transfer efficiency (OTE) experienced by conventional aeration bubble diffuser systems at mixed liquor total suspended solids (MLSS) concentrations higher than 20 g L-1. Another potential limitation for the operation of MBRs at such high MISS concentrations is the reduction on the membrane permeability due to excessive fouling. A pilot MBR with a treatment capacity of one m(3) d(-1) was installed at the research hall facilities at the Harnaschpolder wastewater treatment plant in Delft, The Netherlands. The MBR was operated at MISS concentrations of up to 28 g L-1 at sludge retention times (SRT)s ranging from 30 to 35 days. The MBR was provided with a Speece cone concentrated oxygen delivery system to overcome the oxygen transfer limitations of conventional bubble diffuser aeration systems at high MLSS concentrations. The MBR performance was evaluated by monitoring the influent and effluent water quality, the membrane permeability, the sludge filterability, the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, and the oxygen uptake rate (OUR). The Speece cone proved to be effective in delivering enough oxygen to maintain DO concentrations in the MBR of approximately 2 mg L-1 at MISS concentrations of up to 22 g L-1. OUR values above 200 mg L-1 h(-1) were observed at 14 g L-1 MISS and higher than 300 mg L-1 h(-1) at 22 g L-1 MISS. The MBR exhibited chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiencies of up to 99% even at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) as low as 3.7 h. A reduction in permeability from 33 to 11 lmh bar(-1) was observed when the MISS concentrations increased from 18.7 to 27.8 g L-1. Sludge filterability values expressed as the added resistance (Delta R-20) fell in the range of "poor filterability" for all the evaluated operational conditions; however, a lower filtration resistance in the range of "moderate filterability" at approximately 23 g L-1 MLSS was noticed. The experimental results suggest that at the evaluated experimental conditions the existent limitations on poor oxygen transfer and low permeability when operating a MBR at high MLSS concentrations can be overcome; therefore, the footprint requirements of MBR systems may be further reduced.

J	Sharma, SK; Kennedy, MD				Sharma, Saroj K.; Kennedy, Maria D.			Soil aquifer treatment for wastewater treatment and reuse	INTERNATIONAL BIODETERIORATION & BIODEGRADATION												Soil aquifer treatment (SAT) is a managed aquifer recharge system in which the quality of the feed water (stormwater or wastewater treatment plant effluent) is further improved during soil passage. This paper provides an overview of SAT systems for wastewater treatment and reuse, and summarises design, removal efficiencies and pre- and post-treatment options as well as cost aspects of SAT using infiltration basins. SAT is an environment-friendly and robust multi-contaminant removal system which is effective in removing pathogens, nitrogen, bulk organic matter and the majority of organic micropollutants. The contaminant removal efficiency of SAT system, however, depends on several factors including source water quality, local hydrogeological conditions and process conditions applied. The performance of SAT system can be further improved by proper site selection and appropriate design of its components including pre- and post-treatment. SAT serves as an environmental and psychological barrier for water reuse applications. It is equally attractive for developed as well as developing countries and flexible enough to allow adaptation to local requirements by combining it with conventional (above the ground) natural or engineered water and wastewater treatment technologies.

Stream-aquifer and in-stream processes affecting nitrogen along a major river and contributing tributary	JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY												This study assesses the spatio-temporal patterns of water and nutrient mass exchange in a stream-riparian system of a major river and a contributing tributary in an irrigated semi-arid region. Field monitoring is performed along reaches of the Arkansas River (4.7 km) and Timpas Creek (2.0 km) in southeastern Colorado during the 2014 growing season, with water quantity and water quality data collected using a network of in-stream sampling sites and groundwater monitoring wells. Mass balance approaches were used to identify temporal and spatial trends in flow, nitrogen (N), and salinity in stream-aquifer exchange. In the Arkansas River, percent decrease of N concentration along the study reach averaged 36% over the period, with results from a stochastic mass balance simulation indicating a 90% probability that 44% to 50% of NO3-N mass in the study reach (109-124 kg/day/km) was removed by in-stream processes between 1 September and 8 November. Results suggest that contact with organic-rich river bed sediments has a strong impact on N removal. A greater decrease in concentrations of NO3-N along the reach during the low flow period suggests the effect of both in-stream processes and dilution by inflowing groundwater that undergoes denitrification as it flows through the riparian and hyporheic zones into the river. In contrast, N concentration decreases in the smaller Timpas Creek were negligible. Results for the Arkansas River also are in contrast with other large agriculturally-influenced rivers, which have not exhibited capacity to remove N at significant rates. Results provide important insights across spatial and temporal scales and point to the need for investigating nutrient dynamics in large streams draining agriculturally-dominated watersheds.

Between nine and 15 of the 23 selected sites along the river were sampled fortnightly over three rounds. In all, 307 E. coli were typed using the PhP typing method and were grouped into common (C) or single (S) biochemical phenotypes (BPTs). A representative from each of the 31 identified C-BPTs was tested for 58 virulence genes (VGs) associated with intestinal and extra-intestinal E. coli, resistance to 22 antibiotics, production of biofilm and cytotoxicity to Vero cells. The number of E. coli in the first sampling round was significantly (P< 0.01) higher than subsequent rounds, whereas the number of VGs was significantly (P< 0.05) higher in isolates from the last sampling round when compared to previous rounds. Comparison of the C-BPTs with an existing database from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in the same catchment showed that 40.6% of the river isolates were identical to the WWTP isolates. The relatively high number of VGs and antibiotic resistance among the C-BPTs suggests possessing and retaining these genes may provide niche advantages for those naturalised and/or persistent E. coli populations which may pose a health risk to the community.																	1477-8920					APR	2017	15	2					196	208		10.2166/wh.2016.285								WOS:000399317700003	28362301

Rapid molecular identification of fecal origin-colonies growing on Enterococcus spp.-specific culture methods	JOURNAL OF WATER AND HEALTH												The mEI, Chromocult (R) enterococci, and m-Enterococcus culture-based methods used to assess water quality by the detection of Enterococcus spp. were first compared in terms of sensitivity using (1) 41 different type strains of Enterococcus spp. and (2) environmental colonies identified by 16S rRNA sequencing. Then, two specific-rtPCR assays targeting Enterococcus spp. and Enterococcus faecalis/faecium were tested for their ability to confirm the identity of putative enterococcal colonies. The mEI, Chromocult (R) enterococci, and m-Enterococcus methods detected beta-glucosidase activity for 28 (68.3%), 32 (78.0%), and 12 (29.3%) of the 41 reference enterococcal strains tested, respectively. Analysis with environmental colonies showed that mEI and Chromocult (R) enterococci media had false positive rates of 4.3% and 5.0%, respectively. Finally, the two rtPCR assays showed a specificity of 100%. Only two (2/19) colonies of E. faecium isolated from mEI agar were not detected by the Enterococcus faecium rtPCR assay, for a sensitivity of 89.5%. Our results showed that Chromocult (R) enterococci medium recovered more E. faecalis/faecium cells than the two other methods. Thus, the use of Chromocult (R) enterococci combined with the Enterococcus faecalis/faecium rtPCR assay showed the best combination to decrease the high false-positive rate obtained when the entire Enterococcus genus is targeted.																	1477-8920					APR	2017	15	2					239	250		10.2166/wh.2016.199								WOS:000399317700007	28362305

In order to study the hydrochemical characteristics and trace element contents of the natural waters of this region, 62 water samples were collected from Lan'gao area in the NDM. The hydrochemical composition was principally characterized by Ca center dot Mg-HCO3 center dot SO4. F and As concentrations ranged from 0.01 to 0.67 mg/L and from 0.33 to 6.29 mu g/L, respectively, lower than Chinese national standard and international guidelines for drinking water quality. One year of monitoring proved that F and As in natural water were not the sources of the local fluorosis and arseniasis in the NDM. The average Se concentration in fissure water was 5.20 mu g/L. The average Se content of river water was 2.82 mu g/L, 14 times that of the world's surface level (0.2 mu g/L). The Se content in eight samples reached the Chinese national standards for mineral drinking water quality (> 10 mu g/L). Contrasting the water samples of May, July, and September in 2015 shows that the Se content is relatively stable and the increase of humidity might be beneficial to increase the content of selenium and strontium in water.																	1477-8920					APR	2017	15	2					273	287		10.2166/wh.2016.132								WOS:000399317700010	28362308

Updating national standards for drinking-water: a Philippine experience	JOURNAL OF WATER AND HEALTH												The latest version of the Philippine National Standards for Drinking-Water (PNSDW) was issued in 2007 by the Department of Health (DOH). Due to several issues and concerns, the DOH decided to make an update which is relevant and necessary to meet the needs of the stakeholders. As an output, the water quality parameters are now categorized into mandatory, primary, and secondary. The ten mandatory parameters are core parameters which all water service providers nationwide are obligated to test. These include thermotolerant coliforms or Escherichia coli, arsenic, cadmium, lead, nitrate, color, turbidity, pH, total dissolved solids, and disinfectant residual. The 55 primary parameters are site-specific and can be adopted as enforceable parameters when developing new water sources or when the existing source is at high risk of contamination. The 11 secondary parameters include operational parameters and those that affect the esthetic quality of drinking-water. In addition, the updated PNSDW include new sections: (1) reporting and interpretation of results and corrective actions; (2) emergency drinking-water parameters; (3) proposed Sustainable Development Goal parameters; and (4) standards for other drinking-water sources. The lessons learned and insights gained from the updating of standards are likewise incorporated in this paper.																	1477-8920					APR	2017	15	2					288	295		10.2166/wh.2016.177								WOS:000399317700011	28362309

Toxicity of Chromium (VI) to Two Mussels and an Amphipod in Water-Only Exposures With or Without a Co-stressor of Elevated Temperature, Zinc, or Nitrate	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												The objectives of the present study were to develop methods for propagating western pearlshell (Margaritifera falcata) for laboratory toxicity testing and evaluate acute and chronic toxicity of chromium VI [Cr(VI)] to the pearlshell and a commonly tested mussel (fatmucket, Lampsilis siliquoidea at 20 A degrees C or in association with a co-stressor of elevated temperature (27 A degrees C), zinc (50 A mu g Zn/L), or nitrate (35 mg NO3/L). A commonly tested invertebrate (amphipod, Hyalella azteca) also was tested in chronic exposures. Newly transformed pearlshell (similar to 1 week old) were successfully cultured and tested in acute 96 h Cr exposures (control survival 100%). However, the grow-out of juveniles in culture for chronic toxicity testing was less successful and chronic 28-day Cr toxicity tests started with 4 month-old pearlshell failed due to low control survival (39-68%). Acute median effect concentration (EC50) for the pearlshell (919 A mu g Cr/L) and fatmucket (456 A mu g Cr/L) tested at 20 A degrees C without a co-stressor decreased by a factor of > 2 at elevated temperature but did not decrease at elevated Zn or elevated NO3. Chronic 28-day Cr tests were completed successfully with the fatmucket and amphipod (control survival 83-98%). Chronic maximum acceptable toxicant concentration (MATC) for fatmucket at 20 A degrees C (26 A mu g Cr/L) decreased by a factor of 2 at elevated temperature or NO3 but did not decrease at elevated Zn. However, chronic MATC for amphipod at 20 A degrees C (13 A mu g Cr/L) did not decrease at elevated temperature, Zn, or NO3. Acute EC50s for both mussels tested with or without a co-stressor were above the final acute value used to derive United States Environmental Protection Agency acute water quality criterion (WQC) for Cr(VI); however, chronic MATCs for fatmucket at elevated temperature or NO3 and chronic MATCs for the amphipod at 20 A degrees C with or without elevated Zn or NO3 were about equal to the chronic WQC. The results indicate that (1) the elevated temperature increased the acute Cr toxicity to both mussel species, (2) fatmucket was acutely more sensitive to Cr than the pearlshell, (3) elevated temperature or NO3 increased chronic Cr toxicity to fatmucket, and (4) acute WQC are protective of tested mussels with or without a co-stressor; however, the chronic WQC might not protect fatmucket at elevated temperature or NO3 and might not protect the amphipod at 20 A degrees C with or without elevated Zn or NO3.																	0090-4341	1432-0703				APR	2017	72	3					449	460		10.1007/s00244-017-0377-x								WOS:000398698400011	28238046

(2016) recently developed a water quality index (WQI) for assessing water quality of five typical reservoirs. Despite all the merits of the practical WQI, it suffers from lack of uncertainty consideration; a fact that motivated the present discussion focusing on mitigation of uncertainty in water quality assessment. In this regard, superiority of employing fuzzy WQI (FWQI) rather than crisp WQI is emphasized. Due to robustness of FWQI in handling uncertainties surrounding data acquisition, employment of fuzzy concept can improve water quality assessment and monitoring to generate results which are more consistent with real world conditions.

Little is known about terrestrial diatoms' ecological behaviour and sensitivity to environmental factors. We hypothesise that terrestrial diatom communities can serve as a proxy of anthropic disturbance levels in terrestrial sites. To test our hypothesis, we apply an aquatic index to soil communities that is to deliver new information on the physiographic controls on soil diatoms. Diatom and soil samples were collected in the Attert River basin in Luxembourg during three seasons, in sites characterised by different combinations of geological, soil (schist, marl and sandstone) and land use (forest, grassland and agriculture) features. We found an effect of seasonality on soil diatom communities, reflected by different species dominance and abundances in samples during the three seasons. Soil pH and land use (which translates in a different amount of total carbon and nitrogen in soil) were identified as the variables having the largest impact in structuring the communities and as among the features with the highest importance in defining the ecological status of the sites (i.e. disturbed farmlands having higher pH and lower carbon and nitrogen content). However, the lack of information about the sensitivity of some of the most abundant terrestrial species in our study area caused some discrepancies between the expected (i.e. forested areas with low anthropic disturbance) and the obtained results, with several forested sites classified as having high anthropic disturbance. These results suggest that soil communities are likely to contain information about soil ecological status and highlight the importance of a better characterisation of terrestrial diatom species for developing a quality index based on soil communities.

Automatic identification of rainfall in acoustic recordings	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The rainfall regime is one of the main abiotic components that can cause modifications in the breeding activity of animal species. It has a direct effect on the environmental conditions, and acts as a modifier of the landscape and soundscape. Variations in water quality and acidity, flooding, erosion, and sound distortion are usually related with the presence of rain. Thereby, ecological studies in populations and communities would benefit from improvements in the estimation of rainfall patterns throughout space and time. In this paper, a method for automatic detection of rainfall in forests by using acoustic recordings is proposed. This approach is based on the estimation of the mean value and signal to noise ratio of the power spectral density in the frequency band in which the sound of the raindrops falling over the vegetation layers of the forest is more prominent (i.e. 600-1200 Hz). The results of this method were compared with human auditory identification and data provided by a pluviometer. We achieved a correlation of 95.23% between the data provided by the pluviometer and the predictions of a regression model. Furthermore, we attained a general accuracy between 92.90% and 99.98% when identifying different intensity levels of rainfall on recordings. Nowadays, passive monitoring recorders have been extensively used to study of acoustic-based breeding processes of several animal species. Our method uses the signals acquired by these recorders in order to identify and quantify rainfall events in short and long time spans. The proposed approach will automatically provide information about the rainfall patterns experienced by target species based on audio recordings. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, macrophyte overgrowth in shallow lakes may lead to deterioration and a consequent necessity for restoration treatments. We assumed that a major threat to the increased trophic level in the Jankovac flow-through system arises from the sediment, where the accumulation of deciduous leaf litter and decayed macrophyte fragments could generate anoxic conditions. The integrated Water Quality Model (WQM) and the Submerged Aquatic Vegetation Model (SAVM) were combined in the Jankovac Model (JanM) and applied during the vegetated season in 2008 and 2014, with the aim to offer a possible approach to the maintenance of good water quality. The impacts of flow velocity and epiphyton growth on submerged macrophyte coverage and biomass were simulated. Biocenotic analyses suggested that epiphyton growth was more extensive in 2014 in comparison to 2008. The results of JanM indicated that increased flow velocities enhanced macrophyte growth and dissolved oxygen concentrations concurrently with the decline of epiphyton biomass. Furthermore, results suggested that epiphyton growth rate of 0.4 d(-1) maintained macrophyte coverage and biomass at a satisfactory level of 70% reservoir coverage. Considering the proposed scenarios hydraulic treatment could be applied to regulate submerged macrophytes in shallow reservoirs, as an efficient and less invasive approach than sediment removal, especially in sensitive karst areas.

To efficiently prevent water quality (WQ) deterioration, the relationships among the C-DIN in JZB with anthropogenic pressure indicators (APIs) and coastal carrying indicators (CCIs) were identified using long-term series data (1962-2012). First, the control indicators (CIs) were obtained by the application of a conceptual model analysis, and potential sources were identified by a factor analysis. Second, the key Cls were identified by a regression analysis. Finally, the effects of the key CIs on WQ were quantitatively assessed by numerical model experiments. The results showed that the CIs for the C-DIN variation contained both APIs, including terrigenous total nitrogen flux (F-TN) discharged into JZB, river runoff, sea area of reclamation, and the CCIs, including the water area of JZB (S-JZB), chlorophyll-a, dissolved oxygen, pH, salinity and seawater temperature. The APIs on WQ variation were greater than the CCIs. The FTN and Sin were identified as the key CIs responsible for the variation in the C-DIN. The WQ simulation results showed that the increasing trend of the C-DIN was caused by the increase in the F-TN and the decrease in the Sin, and the combined effects induced by the two key CIs on the C-DIN variation was as high as 79%, higher their separate effects, indicating a synergistic interaction of the two key CIs on the WQ of JZB during the last 50 years.

Using the Analytic Hierarchy Process to identify parameter weights for developing a water quality index	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												One of the most common approaches used to evaluate the state of water quality in a water body is through the use of water quality indices (WQIs). This paper presents one of the most important steps in the development of a WQI, which is that of establishing the weights of the water quality parameters. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was employed to calculate weights based on 13 selected parameters from within 7 water quality groupings for rivers in West Java, Indonesia. Thus, two AHP models were employed in this study, the first had 13 pairwise questionnaires to be compared (individual form) and the second model had 7 comparisons (group form). A pool of respondents from related stakeholders with different backgrounds in West Java was surveyed to obtain their judgement independently. In the first AHP model, both chemical oxygen demand (weights in the range 0.102-0.185) and dissolved oxygen (weights in the range 0.103-0.164) consistently received relatively high weights, compared to other water quality parameters. Meanwhile, in the second model, oxygen depletion (weights in the range 0.160-0.233) and microbiology (weights in the range 0.098-0.249) had high weights. Thus, both models estimated relatively high weights for COD, DO and FC. However, considering that the second AHP model. can provide individual weights as well as weights of parameter groupings, this model was preferred in this study. Therefore the results of the second AHP model will be used for the remaining steps in the development of the West Java WQI in the future. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Variations in macroalgae abundances and functional diversity were compared with older data to test the hypothesis that their diversity decreases following anthropogenic stress that negatively impact environmental characteristics. Four field sampling excursions were undertaken at two different sites from December/2012 to May/2014. Destructive sampling per effort used six box cores (25 x 25 cm) distributed randomly along a shallow sublittoral rocky shore. Biomass was used to quantify macroalgae assemblages identified to the species level. Multivariate analyses demonstrated decreases in total biomass at both sites as well as changes in community physiognomies. The predominant corticated algae found were classified as Ecological Status Group IIA, characteristic of sites in the process of degradation and indicating that anthropogenic stress had negatively affected the macroalgae communities as evaluated by the Ecological Evaluation Index.

In the present study, an attempt was made to investigate the concurrent conditions of corrosion scales and the drinking water quality in selected water supply schemes (WSS) in districts Chitral, Peshawar, and Abbottabad, northern Pakistan. Characterization analyses of the corrosion by-products revealed the presence of alpha-FeOOH, gamma-FeOOH, Fe3O4, and SiO2 as major constituents with different proportions. The constituents of all the representative XRD peaks of Peshawar WSS were found insignificant as compared to other WSS, and the reason could be the variation of source water quality. Well-crystallized particles in SEM images indicated the formation of dense oxide layer on corrosion by-products. A wider asymmetric vibration peak of SiO2 appeared only in Chitral and Abbottabad WSS, which demonstrated higher siltation in the water source. One-way ANOVA analysis showed significant variations in pH, turbidity, TDS, K, Mg, PO4, Cl, and SO4 values, which revealed that these parameters differently contributed to the source water quality. Findings from this study suggested the implementation of proper corrosion prevention measures and the establishment of international collaboration for best corrosion practices, expertise, and developing standards.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				APR	2017	189	4							194	10.1007/s10661-017-5907-5								WOS:000398714200060	28357720

Macrophytes can be efficient in the treatment of this wastewater due to the removal of the main pollutants. The genotoxicity of sewage-polluted water discharging into La Choza stream was evaluated by testing with Allium cepa. Also, a phytoremediation assay with continuous recirculation of the residual water was conducted for 12 days. Three treatments were carried out. One treatment (Hr) was performed with a macrophyte (Hydrocotyle ranunculoides), and two treatments were conducted without macrophytes: with lighting (Ai) and without lighting (Ao). The wastewater was toxic according to all the evaluated indexes (mitotic index, frequency of chromosomal aberrations and micronucleus). High concentrations of ammonium, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), total (TP) and soluble reactive phosphorous (SRP) and indicators of faecal contamination were determined in the wastewater. The ammonium, DIN, SRP and TP loads at the end of the assay were significantly lower in the treatments with light (Hr and Ai). So, the nutrient removal was due to their absorption and adsorption by the periphyton and H. ranunculoides. Our results lead us to recommend the maintenance and planting of macrophytes in lowland streams subject to sewage pollution.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				APR	2017	189	4							182	10.1007/s10661-017-5892-8								WOS:000398714200048	28342050

Pesticide and nitrate transport in an agriculturally influenced stream in Indiana	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Agrochemicals can be transported from agricultural fields into streams where they might have adverse effects on water quality and ecosystems. Three enrichment experiments were conducted in a central Indiana stream to quantify pesticide and nitrogen transport dynamics. In an enrichment experiment, a compound solution is added at a constant rate into a stream to increase compound background concentration. A conservative tracer (e.g., bromide) is added to determine discharge. Water and sediment samples are taken at several locations downstream to measure uptake metrics. We assessed transport of nitrate, atrazine, metolachlor, and carbaryl through direct measurement of uptake length (S-w), uptake velocity (V-f), and areal uptake (U). S-w measures the distance traveled by a nutrient along the stream reach. V-f measures the velocity a nutrient moves from the water column to immobilization sites. U represents the amount of nutrient immobilized in an area of streambed per unit of time. S-w varied less than one order of magnitude across pesticides. The highest S-w for atrazine suggests greater transport to downstream ecosystems. Across compounds, pesticide S-w was longest in August relative to October and July. V-f varied less than one order of magnitude across pesticides with the highest V-f for metolachlor. U varied three orders of magnitude across pesticides with the highest U associate with sedimentbound carbaryl. Increasing nitrate S-w suggests a lower nitrate demand of biota in this stream. Overall, pesticide transport was best predicted by compound solubility which can complement and improve models of pesticide abundance used by water quality programs and risk assessments.

However, they are losing their vigor at alarming rate due to unwise management. Hence, there is an urgent need to monitor and assess these resources so as to identify the major drivers of its degradation and to provide information for management decisions. In this context, we aimed to assess the effects of human activities on macroinvertebrate assemblages of wetlands in Lake Tana Watershed. Biotic and abiotic data were collected from 46 sampling sites located in eight wetlands. A total of 2568 macroinvertebrates belonging to 46 families were recorded. Macroinvertebrate metrics such as Biological Monitoring Working Party score, Shannon diversity index, Ephemeroptera and odonata family richness, and total family richness portrayed a clear pattern of decreasing with increasing in human disturbances, whereas Family biotic index score, which is an indicator of organic pollution, increased with increasing in human disturbances. The regression analysis also revealed that livestock grazing, leather tanning, and eucalyptus plantation were important predictors of macroinvertebrate metrics (p < 0.05). In conclusion, human activities in and around the wetlands such as farming, leather tanning, solid waste dumping, and effluent discharges were contributed to the degradation of water quality and decreasing in the macroinvertebrate richness and diversity. These alterations could also reduce the availability of wetland products (sedges, craft materials, etc.) and the related ecosystem services. This in turn has an adverse effect on food security and poverty alleviation with considerable impact on communities who heavily depend on wetland products for their livelihood. Therefore, it is essential to formulate wetland policy for achieving wise use goals and necessary legal and institutional backup for sustainable wetland management in Ethiopia.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				APR	2017	189	4							152	10.1007/s10661-017-5853-2								WOS:000398714200018	28275984

Seasonal distribution of phytoplankton and its association with physico-chemical parameters in coastal waters of Malvan, west coast of India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Malvan coast is one of the Marine Protected Area (MPA) of Maharashtra because of its rich coral reef and biodiversity. The study investigated on phytoplankton assemblage and their diversity with respect to physico-chemical parameters covering protected and unprotected area of Malvan coast. Physico-chemical parameters such as salinity, nitrite, nitrate, and ammonia did not display seasonality due to inadequate fresh water influx and allochthonous nutrient input. Positive correlation of phosphate (r = 0.96, p < 0.0001) and silicate (r = 0.91, p < 0.0001) with Total Suspended Solids (TSS) confirmed their autochthonous origin as a result of resuspension of bottom sediments during monsoon. A total of 57 phytoplankton species were identified mostly dominated by Bascillariophyceae (40 species), followed by Dinophyceae (9 species), Chlorophyceae (5 species), Cyanophyceae (2 species), and Dictyochophyceae (1 species) from Malvan coast. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) revealed that water temperature and TSS were the most significant parameters influencing the distribution and seasonal shift in phytoplankton species such as Skeletonema costatum and Chaetoceros sp. during pre-monsoon and Psedo-nitzschia sp., Streptotheca thamensis, Eucampia zodiacus, and Lithodesmium undulatum during post-monsoon. Silicate and phosphate had minor influence on phytoplankton distribution. Shannon-Wiener diversity index as a pollution index suggested that the study area was incipiently polluted except at bay stations. Despite of various human interventions the water quality and phytoplankton assemblage of this area has not reached to an alarming situation. The current study provides a valuable baseline data on phytoplankton assemblage from Malvan coast.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				APR	2017	189	4							151	10.1007/s10661-017-5835-4								WOS:000398714200017	28275985

Land use impacts on river health of Uma Oya, Sri Lanka: implications of spatial scales	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Human actions on landscapes are a principal threat to the ecological integrity of river ecosystems worldwide. Tropical landscapes have been poorly investigated in terms of the impact of catchment land cover alteration on water quality and biotic indices in comparison to temperate landscapes. Effects of land cover in the catchment at two spatial scales (catchment and site) on stream physical habitat quality, water quality, macroinvertebrate indices and community composition were evaluated for Uma Oya catchment in the upper Mahaweli watershed, Sri Lanka. The relationship between spatial arrangement of land cover in the catchment and water quality, macroinvertebrate indices and community composition was examined using univariate and multivariate approaches. Results indicate that chemical water quality variables such as conductivity and total dissolved solids are mostly governed by the land cover at broader spatial scales such as catchment scale. Shannon diversity index was also affected by catchment scale forest cover. In stream habitat features, nutrients such as N-NO3-, macroinvertebrate family richness, %shredders and macroinvertebrate community assemblages were predominantly influenced by the extent of land cover at 200 m site scale suggesting that local riparian forest cover is important in structuring macroinvertebrate communities. Thus, this study emphasizes the importance of services provided by forest cover at catchment and site scale in enhancing resilience of stream ecosystems to natural forces and human actions. Findings suggest that land cover disturbance effects on stream ecosystem health could be predicted when appropriate spatial arrangement of land cover is considered and has widespread application in the management of tropical river catchments.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				APR	2017	189	4							192	10.1007/s10661-017-5863-0								WOS:000398714200058	28357718

In this paper, multivariate techniques, such as factor analysis (FA) and cluster analysis (CA), were applied to analyze the water quality datasets for 19 rivers in Liangjiang New Area (LJNA), China, collected in April (dry season) and September (wet season) of 2014 and 2015. In most sampling rivers, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, and fecal coliform exceeded the Class V guideline (GB3838-2002), which could thereby threaten the water quality in Yangtze and Jialing Rivers. FA clearly identified the five groups of water quality variables, which explain majority of the experimental data. Nutritious pollution, seasonal changes, and construction activities were three key factors influencing rivers' water quality in LJNA. CA grouped 19 sampling sites into two clusters, which located at sub-catchments with high-and low-level urbanization, respectively. One-way ANOVA showed the nutrients (total phosphorus, soluble reactive phosphorus, total nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen, and nitrite), fecal coliform, and conductivity in cluster 1 were significantly greater than in cluster 2. Thus, catchment urbanization degraded rivers' water quality in Liangjiang New Area. Identifying effective buffer zones at riparian scale to weaken the negative impacts of catchment urbanization was recommended.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				APR	2017	189	4							174	10.1007/s10661-017-5884-8								WOS:000398714200040	28324277

An assessment of subsurface contamination of an urban coastal aquifer due to oil spill	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Incidences of leakages of chemicals from underground oil storage tanks or oil-carrying pipelines have posed huge threat to the coastal aquifers around the world. One such leak was recently identified and notified by the people of Tondiarpet, Chennai, India. The assessment of the contamination level was done by obtaining electrical resistivity maps of the subsurface, drilling of 20 new borewells for soil and water analysis, and testing the water quality of 30 existing borewells. Samples were collected from the borewells, and observations were made that included parameters such as odor, moisture, contamination characteristics, lithology, groundwater level, thickness of the free product that are used to demarcate the extent of soil, and water contamination. Furthermore, a multigas detector was used to detect hydrocarbon presence as soil vapor. Moreover, to capture the transport of dissolved hydrocarbons, 10 samples were collected in the periphery of the study area and were analyzed for the presence of petroleum hydrocarbon and polyaromatic hydrocarbon. Analysis of the data indicated the presence of free-phase hydrocarbon in soil and groundwater close to the junction of Thiruvottiyur high (TH) road (TH) and Varadaja Perumal Koil (VPK) street. Although the contaminant plume is confined to a limited area, it has spread more to the southern and eastern side of the pipeline possibly due to continuous abstraction of groundwater by residential apartments. After cutting a trench along the VPK street and plotting of the plume delineation map, observations indicated that the source of the hydrocarbon leak is present in VPK street close to TH road. A multipronged strategy was suggested targeting the remediation of oil in various phases.

Various physico-chemical parameters like pH, EC, TS, TSS, TDS, TH, cations (Na1+, K1+, Li1+, Ca2+, Mg2+), anions (Cl1-, F1-, HCO31-, NO31-, SO42-), and heavy metals (Cr, Fe, Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd) were determined. The data indicated wide ranges of variation in all the parameters. Concentration of physico-chemical properties such as EC, TS, TSS, TH, Li1+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and HCO31- and heavy metals (Cr, Fe, Cu, and Cd) exceeded WHO permissible limits. The distribution of heavy metals in two sampling areas followed the increasing order as Fe > Cr > Cd > Cu > Pb > Zn. The Piper diagram showed that water in the region was of alkaline type. Strong positive correlations were observed among most of the parameters; however, pH was negatively correlated with most of the parameters. According to principle component analysis, parameters causing variations in water quality were mainly EC, TDS, TS, TSS, TH, Na1+, K1+, Ca2+, Mg2+, F1-, NO31- , SO42-, Cr, Fe, Cu, and Zn. Linear regression analysis revealed that heavy metals like Cr, Fe, and Cu concentrations were strongly correlated having an R-2 value of 0.92 at P <= 0.001 with pH. Overall, the results suggested that irrigation water of the area was not fit for irrigation purposes and might cause serious threats for safe, healthy food and feed production. Proper monitoring of water of the said area should be carried out, and quality of irrigation water should be checked from time to time.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				APR	2017	189	4							156	10.1007/s10661-017-5868-8								WOS:000398714200022	28284001

Once the optimization of grey water pre-treatment system has been determined, the filtration system was operated at different hydraulic loading rate and media filter proportions in order to assess the suitability of treated grey water for irrigational purpose according to salinity hazard, sodium hazard, magnesium hazard, permeability index, water infiltration rate, and widely used graphical methods. Suitability of the treated grey water for industrial purpose was evaluated in terms of foaming, corrosion, and scaling. Under optimal operational conditions, results reveals that treated grey water samples with an upflow-downflow siliceous sand/marble waste filtration system may be considered as a good and an excellent water quality suitable for irrigation purpose. However, treated grey water was found not appropriate for industrial purpose due to high concentrations of calcium and sodium that can generate foaming and scaling harm to boilers. These results suggest that treated grey water with an upflowdownflow siliceous sand/marble waste filtration system would support production when used as irrigation water.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				APR	2017	24	11					9870	9885		10.1007/s11356-016-7471-x								WOS:000399401700005	27566157

The study was performed in water, sediment, and barbel (Barbus peloponnesius), collected in two seasons, from two suspected polluted and one reference zones. The water analyses revealed higher mean values in polluted sites for most of the examined physicochemical parameters. Metal concentrations (Zn, Cu, Cd, Mn, Pb, and Fe) in water were more or less constant, whereas in sediment, they were higher at the two polluted locations. Condition factor (CF), as a general health indicator, revealed better overall condition in barbel from the reference site. In general, blood parameters revealed higher values in the polluted localities. Irrespective of sex and/or season, the frequency of micronuclei (MN) and vacuolated nuclei (VN) were with higher rates in polluted sites. Similarly, the frequencies of the leucocytes (Le), binuclei (BN), and irregularly shaped nuclei (ISN) were also significantly increased in the polluted localities, but they seemed prone to be influenced by sex and/or season. However, strong positive correlations between blood biomarkers and most water physicochemical parameters and metal in sediment were estimated. Our data support that the River Bregalnica's lower course receives significant genotoxic pollution, likely via metal industry effluents, agricultural runoff, and domestic sewage, and reinforced the utility of MN and other nuclear abnormalities as sensitive and suitable biomarkers for genotoxicity when used in monitoring studies.

This study evaluated the water quality of Juara Lagoon (ES, Brazil) based on physical and chemical variables, cytogenetic responses in Allium cepa and phytoplankton dynamics. Three sampling sites were defined and water samples were collected during two sampling periods. Analyses such as determination of photic zone, conductivity, and concentrations of nutrients and metals were conducted as well as cytotoxic, mutagenic, and genotoxic potentials using A. cepa test. The main attributes of phytoplankton community, such as total richness, total density, density by class, dominance, and diversity, were also evaluated. Results have revealed that Juara Lagoon has signs of artificial eutrophication at two sampling sites due to high levels of total phosphorus and ammonia nitrogen. Cytotoxic, genotoxic, and mutagenic potentials were detected as well as high concentrations of Fe and Mn. Furthermore, 165 phytoplankton taxa were recorded, with highest richness in Chlorophyceae and Cyanophyceae classes. In addition, Cyanophyceae presented as the highest density class. A. cepa test and phytoplankton community evaluation indicated that the ecological quality of Juara Lagoon is compromised.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				APR	2017	24	11					10855	10868		10.1007/s11356-017-8721-2								WOS:000399401700089	28293825

A numerical framework for modelling sediment and chemical constituents transport in the Lower Athabasca River	JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS												The transport of fine sediments and associated chemical constituents originating from potential anthropogenic and natural sources is becoming an issue of increasing importance in the Lower Athabasca River (LAR) ecosystem in northern Alberta, Canada. This study aims to (1) establish an integrated numerical modelling framework to investigate the transport of fine cohesive sediments and associated chemical constituents during both ice-covered and open-water periods and (2) apply the modelling framework to investigate the state and temporal/spatial variation in sediment and selected chemical constituents within the LAR. One-dimensional hydrodynamic and transport models, combined with a river ice model, are used to predict the flow characteristics, transport of sediments and a selection of three metals and three polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) within a similar to 200 km reach of the LAR, both in open-water and ice-covered conditions. The models are validated using available field measurements and are applied to investigate the state and variation of sediment and chemicals for a baseline period as well as to assess the effect of various hypothetical pollution scenarios. The model simulations successfully reproduce the hydrodynamics and sediment transport patterns as well as the state and variation of selected metal and PAH constituents. The results generally show that the concentration of chemical constituents in the bed sediment is the major factor in determining the state and variation of their concentration in the water column, and the high-flow season is the critical period for the transport of sediment and chemicals in the system. The scenario simulation results indicate that increases in the concentrations of chemical constituents in tributary streams have to be orders of magnitude higher to have a noticeable effect on their corresponding water column concentration in the LAR. Those effects are also found to be higher only within the immediate vicinity of the tributary confluences and gradually diminish with distance downstream of the confluences. The numerical modelling framework developed in this study provides a tool for investigation and understanding of the state and temporal/spatial variation of sediment and associated chemical constituents within cold region rivers such as the LAR. By conducting additional scenario-based studies (such as future climate and chemicals loading), the models can be used to identify possible future states of sediment and water quality constituents in the LAR ecosystem.

In the Gulf of Aqaba (GoA), coral reefs are considered the dominating ecosystem, while seagrass meadows, recognized worldwide as important ecosystems, have received little attention. Absence of comprehensive seagrass maps limits awareness, evaluations of associated ecosystem services, and implementation of conservation and management tools. 2. Presented here are the first detailed maps of seagrass meadows along the Israeli coast of the northern GoA. Mapping was performed by snorkelling along transects perpendicular to the shore above meadows growing at 15-25 m. Measurements along these transects included position, meadow depth and visual estimations of seagrass cover. Shallow boundaries of meadows, parallel to shore, were recorded by GPS tracking. Supplementary work included drop-camera boat surveys to determine the position of the deeper edge of meadows. In addition, GIS layers were created that indicated shoreline infrastructures, near-shore human activities and potential pollution threats. Ecosystem services of seagrass meadows mapped were valuated using a benefit transfer approach. 3. In total, 9.7 km of the 11 km shoreline were surveyed and 2830 data points collected. Seagrasses were growing along 7.5 km of the shoreline, with shallow (15-25 m) meadows found to cover an area of 707 000 m(2) and valued at more than US$ 2 000 000 yr(-1) in associated ecosystem services. Pilot drop-camera surveys (additional 283 data points) indicated that meadows can extend down to 50 m in some places. Coastal uses and threats varied in character and location. A municipality runoff point and drainage canal located close to the largest meadow were identified as the main threats to local seagrasses. 4. These low-cost methods enhance our understanding of seagrass distribution in the northern GoA. They demonstrate a GIS-based tool for assessing how environmental changes might affect the cover and state of seagrasses, improving efforts to conserve seagrass, and have particular relevance to seagrass mapping in developing countries and/or island nations.

Combining ex situ and in situ methods to improve water quality testing for the conservation of aquatic species	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												1. Determining whether water quality is suitable is an important part of managing aquatic species for conservation, although it is often challenging to achieve. Past approaches have largely consisted of tests exposing individuals to artificial solutions, or field studies that examine the effect of a subset of water quality parameters on the distribution or abundance of a species. 2. Owing to the complex nature of water chemistry in natural systems, which is difficult to replicate using laboratory studies or to capture entirely with correlational field studies, these types of study may not be suitable for determining accurately whether or not water quality at a particular site is suitable for a target species. In situations where conservation outcomes rely heavily on achieving this, an alternative approach is therefore needed. 3. Embryos of the threatened green and golden bell frog Litoria aurea were placed in water collected from ponds that were used by this species for breeding and ponds where breeding was not detected at Sydney Olympic Park, Australia. After 19 days, the tadpoles were placed in enclosures in the same breeding and non- breeding ponds, and monitored until they metamorphosed. 4. There was no difference in tadpole survival, time to metamorphosis or body condition between the two treatments, indicating that poor water quality was not a cause of low pond occupancy by tadpoles at the site and resources should be directed towards investigating other potential causes. 5. We suggest that this method of an ex situ followed by an in situ exposure study is an effective approach to eliminating or confirming poor water quality as a cause of population declines and reduced occupancy, for species that are aquatic for at least part of their life cycle. Other applications include establishing that artificially created habitat provides suitable water chemistry, or identifying a potential location for a reintroduction project.

A.; Legendre, Pierre			Environmental factors structuring benthic primary producers at different spatial scales in the St. Lawrence River (Canada)	AQUATIC SCIENCES												The influence of environmental factors controlling the biomass of submerged aquatic macrophytes, cyanobacterial mats, and epiphyton was examined at three nested spatial scales within the St. Lawrence River: (1) along a 250-km-long upstream-downstream river stretch, (2) among three fluvial lakes located within that river stretch and (3) within each fluvial lake at sites located upstream, at the mouth, and downstream of the St. Lawrence River tributaries. Over its 250-km-long course, large increases of water colour (fivefold), suspended matter (tenfold), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (twofold) and dissolved N and P concentrations (2.5-fold) were observed in the St. Lawrence River, showing the cumulative effects of human activities on water quality. In contrast, biomass of submerged vascular macrophytes dropped tenfold along the sampled reach whereas biomass of epiphytes and cyanobacterial mats rose significantly. Biomass of the three benthic primary producers (PP) was explained (59 %) by the combined effects of conductivity, TP and spatial structure. Macrophyte biomass was related to changes in conductivity (+), biomass of epiphyton responded to DIN:TDP ratio (+) and light extinction coefficient (+) and cyanobacterial mats coincided with differences in DOC (+) and NH4 (+) (-). Within-lake structure was the most important spatial component for all benthic PP, suggesting that local effects, such as enrichment by the inflow of tributaries, rather than upstream-downstream gradients, determined the biomass of benthic PP. Our study shows that the sum of local tributary inflows exerts major overall pressures on benthic PP in the St. Lawrence River and that conversely, small-scale management of individual watersheds, can markedly improve local ecological condition of the river ecosystems.																	1015-1621	1420-9055				APR	2017	79	2					345	356		10.1007/s00027-016-0501-4								WOS:000397570900011

Seasonal shifts in the relative importance of local versus upstream sources of phosphorus to individual lakes in a chain	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Water quality in the Yahara chain of lakes in southern Wisconsin has been degraded significantly since European settlement of the region, primarily as a result of anthropogenic nutrient inputs. While all four main lakes (Mendota, Monona, Waubesa, and Kegonsa) have undergone eutrophication, elevated phosphorus and chlorophyll concentrations are particularly pronounced in the smaller lakes at the bottom of the chain (Waubesa and Kegonsa). Due to their short water residence times (2-3 months), these lakes are more responsive to seasonal variability in magnitude and source of phosphorus loading compared with the larger upstream lakes. In 2014, more than 80 % of the phosphorus load to Lake Waubesa passed through the outlet of Lake Monona (situated immediately upstream). However, between mid-May and late October when phosphorus concentrations in Lake Monona were reduced as a result of thermal stratification the upstream load dropped to similar to 40 % of the total, with the majority of loading during this period coming from Lake Waubesa's local watershed. Correspondingly, seasonal phosphorus trends in Lake Waubesa during summer are correlated with precipitation, rather than phosphorus concentrations leaving upstream lakes. While phosphorus export from the local watersheds of Lakes Waubesa and Kegonsa is relatively small on an annual time scale, targeted loading reductions in these areas during the summertime will most effectively reduce summertime phosphorus concentrations in these fast-flushing lakes. Understanding the interaction of landscape position, water residence time, and mixing regime can help guide watershed management for water quality improvements in lake chains.

Changes in macroinvertebrate trophic structure along a land-use gradient within a lowland stream network	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Running waters are among the most threatened ecosystems globally, having altered hydrological regimes, homogenized habitat, and impaired water quality. These multiple stressors impact aquatic biodiversity and ecosystem function across space and time, although a clear mechanistic understanding is still lacking. Here, we examined the trophic response of macroinvertebrates among streams in a Swiss lowland catchment encompassing a gradient of land uses. Clear compositional changes were observed as anthropogenic impacts increased from least-impacted to agricultural and urbanized sites. Taxonomic diversity was lowest at sites with morphological and water quality impairment (agricultural sites), whereas taxonomic identity (susceptible vs. generalist species) mainly changed due to water quality degradation (agricultural and urban sites) based on the SPEAR (pesticides) index. Using stable isotopes (delta C-13, delta N-15), a simplification in macroinvertebrate trophic structure was evident along the land use gradient. At a site receiving wastewater treatment effluent, stable isotopes also revealed trophic shifts in primary consumers that corresponded to changes in available food resources. Results further showed that some taxa losses, e.g., the mayfly Ecdyonurus, to land- use effects may be due to low trophic plasticity. The combination of analyses, including stable isotopes, provided an improved mechanistic understanding of community and population responses to land-use changes along river networks.																	1015-1621	1420-9055				APR	2017	79	2					407	418		10.1007/s00027-016-0506-z								WOS:000397570900016

The physical and chemical parameters from a total of 192 water samples were tested using standard methods. Additionally, a total of 48 fish samples were analyzed for heavy metal concentrations. Mean values for basic water quality parameters of COD, PO4 (-3), NH3 (-)-N, and NO3 (-)-N exceeded Saudi standards in all seasons. Mean metal concentrations in water were consistently at their highest concentrations in samples collected during the summer, and the lowest in samples collected during the winter. Mean metal concentrations in fish muscle tissue exceeded Saudi standards for As and Cd, and United Nations FAO standards for Cr, Ni, Zn, Fe and Mn. Statistical analysis showed highly significant positive correlations between metal concentrations in water and metal concentrations in fish muscle for As-Fe, Pb-Cr, Pb-Ni, Cr-Cu, and Cu-Fe. This study highlights the urgent need for monitoring and controlling wastewater discharge in Wadi Hanifa to ensure public safety.																	0007-4861	1432-0800				APR	2017	98	4					525	533		10.1007/s00128-017-2048-z								WOS:000397494600014	28214941

In this study, the allelopathic effects of Myriophyllum aquaticum and its exudate on two typical bloom-forming cyanobacteria, Microcystis aeruginosa and Anabaena flos-aquae, were investigated under laboratory conditions. The growth of the cyanobacteria was strongly inhibited by live M. aquaticum while the primary addition of M. Aquaticum exudates had a significant inhibitory effect on the growth of M. aeruginosa but not A. flos-aquae. The results suggested that the persistent release of allelochemicals from live M. aquaticum was needed to effectively constrain the growth of A. flos-aquae. Analysis of cyanobacterial physiological indexes indicated that M. aquaticum produced an inhibitory effect on SOD enzyme activity of A. flos-aquae, while it affected membrane lipid peroxidation in M. aeruginosa. The results show the potential of M. aquaticum to mitigate cyanobacterial blooms in coexistence systems.																	0007-4861	1432-0800				APR	2017	98	4					556	561		10.1007/s00128-017-2034-5								WOS:000397494600018	28184984

Relative changes in simulated mean annual runoff (MAR) and four indicators of high and low extreme flows are compared between the two ensembles. The ensemble median values of changes in runoff with three different scenarios of global-mean warming (1, 2 and 3 degrees C above preindustrial levels) are generally similar between the two ensembles, although the ensemble spread is often larger for the Glob-HM ensemble. In addition the ensemble spread is normally larger than the difference between the two ensemble medians. Whilst we find compelling evidence for projected runoff changes for the Rhine (decrease), Tagus (decrease) and Lena (increase) with global warming, the sign and magnitude of change for the other catchments is unclear. Our model results highlight that for these three catchments in particular, global climate change mitigation, which limits global-mean temperature rise to below 2 degrees C above preindustrial levels, could avoid some of the hydrological hazards that could be seen with higher magnitudes of global warming.

J	Missaghi, S; Hondzo, M; Herb, W				Missaghi, Shahram; Hondzo, Miki; Herb, William			Prediction of lake water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and fish habitat under changing climate	CLIMATIC CHANGE												We applied a three-dimensional lake water quality model to investigate the influence of local meteorological conditions on fish habitat under one historical and two future climate change scenarios. Compared to the historical normal climate scenario, the averaged surface water temperature increases up to 4 degrees C and the dissolved oxygen concentration is 1 mg L-1 less during the ice-free seasons under the future climate scenarios. The stratification periods expand up to 23% (46 days), thermocline depths increase 49%, and the onset of anoxia occurs 4 weeks earlier under the future climate scenarios. The dissolved oxygen concentrations and water temperatures are used as the key water quality parameters to investigate the temporal and spatial variabilities of fish habitat. The good growth, restricted growth, and lethal habitats for the coolwater fish change up to 14% of the total lake volume. Compared to the historical normal climate scenario, on average, the lake total volume for good growth, restricted growth, and lethal habitat of coolwater fish change +16, -18, and +85%, respectively. The most significant (70%) changes in lethal habitat for coolwater fish occurs in the upper 5 m of the water column. During summer, a modest increase of lethal habitat for coolwater fish (8% of total lake volume) has a pronounced impact on the good growth habitat. The prediction of spatial locations and time periods of potential fish habitats during stressed or lethal environmental conditions is becoming increasingly important for managing fish habitats under changing climate.																	0165-0009	1573-1480				APR	2017	141	4					747	757		10.1007/s10584-017-1916-1								WOS:000396826200011

Potamogeton crispus L., a species of pondweed, is widely used in such restoration because it can be easily propagated through its turions. However, little is known so far of the growth characteristics of turions growing under limited light or even in total darkness. The growth and physiological responses of plants raised from small, medium, or large turions (categorized on the basis of their weight) and growing in total darkness in an aquarium showed that plants raised from small turions were significantly shorter (33.4 +/- 4.8 cm) than those grown from medium or large turions (49.9 +/- 4.3 cm and 46.9 +/- 7.4 cm, respectively; the difference between the two categories was not significant) when measured on the average of 48th, 62nd and 69th days after planting. Although the plant biomass was significantly different among the three groups of turions, it remained virtually the same within each group throughout. Plants raised from the three categories of turions, however, did not differ significantly either in terms of root length or with respect to soluble protein contents and peroxidase activity; the last parameter increased significantly after 48 days in all the three categories, whereas the activity of superoxide dismutase increased significantly after 62 days. These observations indicate that P. crispus plants growing in total darkness suffer from stress due to antioxidants, especially after 48 days of culture. Therefore, it is recommended that larger turions be chosen for planting and that suitable measures be taken to ensure that at least some light reaches the plants 48 days after planting. Three formulas are presented, depending on the level of turbidity and the weight of turions, to calculate the maximum water depth at which P. crispus could survive for restoration of P. crispus in eutrophic lakes.

Assessment of physicochemical characteristics of Ganga Canal water quality in Uttarakhand	ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY												Assessment of physicochemical parameters of Ganga Canal water was carried out during 2012-2013 at Haridwar (Uttarakhand) with two different sites, i.e., Bhimgoda Barrage (site 1-control site) and Bahadrabad (site 2-contaminated site), where canal water flows with loads of pollution from highly commercial and industrial areas. During investigation, maximum turbidity (287.72 +/- 56.28 JTU), total solids (1167.60 +/- 303.90 mg l(-1)), free CO2 (1.88 +/- 0.22 mg l(-1)), total hardness (60.14 +/- 1.13 mg l(-1)), pH (7.1 +/- 0.13), nitrate (0.048 +/- 0.010), nitrite (0.019 +/- 0.001), biochemical oxygen demand (2.866 +/- 1.098), chemical oxygen demand (6.8 +/- 2.61) and phosphate (0.087 +/- 0.015), while minimum velocity (1.71 +/- 0.19 ms(-1)), transparency (0.12 +/- 0.08 m) and dissolved oxygen (7.95 +/- 0.44 mg l(-1)) were recorded in monsoon season at site 2 in comparison with site 1. The mean values of these parameters were compared with WHO and ISI standards and found significant differences (p < 0.05) in the mean values of turbidity, total solids, pH, dissolved oxygen, free CO2 and total hardness with sampling sites. The turbidity of both the sites 1 and 2 was recorded above the permissible limit. Turbidity of site 2 is much higher than of site 1, so it is counted as more polluted. The values of the studied parameters were more during monsoon season and summer season at site 2 as compared to site 1. The results indicated that most of the physicochemical parameters from Ganga Canal system were within or at periphery in comparison with permissible limit of ISI and WHO for drinking water and therefore may be suitable for domestic purposes, but it requires perceptible consideration due to intense changes in climate and increase in pollution.

Diverse manganese(II)-oxidizing bacteria are prevalent in drinking water systems	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY REPORTS												Manganese (Mn) oxides are highly reactive minerals that influence the speciation, mobility, bioavailability and toxicity of a wide variety of organic and inorganic compounds. Although Mn(II)-oxidizing bacteria are known to catalyze the formation of Mn oxides, little is known about the organisms responsible for Mn oxidation in situ, especially in engineered environments. Mn(II)-oxidizing bacteria are important in drinking water systems, including in biofiltration and water distribution systems. Here, we used cultivation dependent and independent approaches to investigate Mn(II)-oxidizing bacteria in drinking water sources, a treatment plant and associated distribution system. We isolated 29 strains of Mn(II)-oxidizing bacteria and found that highly similar 16S rRNA gene sequences were present in all culture-independent datasets and dominant in the studied drinking water treatment plant. These results highlight a potentially important role for Mn(II)-oxidizing bacteria in drinking water systems, where biogenic Mn oxides may affect water quality in terms of aesthetic appearance, speciation of metals and oxidation of organic and inorganic compounds. Deciphering the ecology of these organisms and the factors that regulate their Mn(II)-oxidizing activity could yield important insights into how microbial communities influence the quality of drinking water.

EFFECT OF FE (III) ON PSEUDOKIRCHNERIELLA SUBCAPITATA AT CIRCUMNEUTRAL PH IN STANDARD LABORATORY TESTS IS EXPLAINED BY NUTRIENT SEQUESTRATION	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												The complex chemistry of iron (Fe) at circumneutral pH in oxygenated waters and the poor correlation between ecotoxicity results in laboratory and natural waters have led to regulatory approaches for iron based on field studies (US Environmental Protection Agency Water Quality Criteria and European Union Water Framework Directive proposal for Fe). The results of the present study account for the observed differences between laboratory and field observations for Fe toxicity to algae (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata). Results from standard 72-h assays with Fe at pH 6.3 and pH 8 resulted in similar toxicity values measured as algal biomass, with 50% effect concentrations (EC50) of 3.28 mg/L and 4.95 mg/L total Fe(III), respectively. At the end of the 72-h exposure, however, dissolved Fe concentrations were lower than 30 mg/L for all test concentrations, making a direct toxic effect of dissolved iron on algae unlikely. Analysis of nutrient concentrations in the artificial test media detected phosphorus depletion in a dose-dependent manner that correlated well with algal toxicity. Subsequent experiments adding excess phosphorus after Fe precipitation eliminated the toxicity. These results strongly suggest that observed Fe(III) toxicity on algae in laboratory conditions is a secondary effect of phosphorous depletion.

Comparison of fast elimination of Cr(VI) by alumina nanofiber and alumina nanoporous	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The goal of this study is examination of the mixture between adsorption and permeation process for removing chromium (VI) from the water. Two types of supported membranes are developed: The first one which was made by sol-gel method is called nanoporous and the second one which was made by electrospinning is called nanofiber. The sorption capacity of nanoporous and nanofiber is examined in single batch experiments at various pH values, and it is found that maximum chromium removal is observed for both nanoporous and nanofiber at pH 3.5. Adsorption studies illustrated that the Cr(VI) adsorption onto alumina nanoporous and nanofiber is affected by changes in pH, contact time, dosage of adsorbent, concentration of chromium and solution volume. Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms can be used to explain the adsorption equilibria of Cr(VI) onto alumina nanoporous and nanofiber. It was found that balance adsorption data adequate Langmuir isotherm more than Freundlich model. Adsorption kinetics was found to be fitted to pseudo-second order and Weber and Morris model. The output of multiple linear regressions was run for the second-order response surface model implied that the linear agents of pH, sorbent dosage and Cr(VI) concentration are more significant factors. Manufacturing electrospun alumina nanofiber and sol-gel nanoporous with these cheap materials, renewable and fast methods are so important although the removal percentage is significant.				javid, allahbakhsh/D-3379-2016													1735-1472	1735-2630				APR	2017	14	4					803	812		10.1007/s13762-016-1217-7								WOS:000397148700012						
J	Ramirez, Y; Cisternas, LA; Kraslawski, A				Ramirez, Yendery; Cisternas, Luis A.; Kraslawski, Andrzej			Application of House of Quality in assessment of seawater pretreatment technologies	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Increasing pressure on water resources is leading to a growing reliance on seawater desalination for the provision of freshwater. Pretreatment of seawater is a major step in seawater desalination, which can mitigate problems with reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. No clearly superior pretreatment technology exists, due to the variation in input water quality, and furthermore, the pretreatment must be designed to be functional with input water quality characteristics that vary considerably over time. The objective of this work is to conduct technology assessment by applying a lissome version of HOQ matrix developed in a case study of dissolved air flotation (DAF) system, which is used as water pretreatment for RO desalination systems. The DAF system technology is compared with other pretreatment processes such as ultrafiltration, sedimentation, and granular media filtration. General analysis provides insight to decision makers to help them improve technologies so that they could meet specific demands. HOQ offers a comparative analysis and identifies specific characteristics that must be improved to develop the chosen technology. The HOQ provides a comprehensive analysis for decision making in management, showing that no pretreatment technologies present a superior performance vis-a-vis all customer attributes, however, it identifies the features of the system, to which efforts should be funneled. For DAF system, these are: water quality changes and energy consumption. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Seasonal and inter-annual variability of phytoplankton in central Lake Diefenbaker (Saskatchewan, Canada) proximal to a large commercial aquaculture farm	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake Diefenbaker, Saskatchewan, is a large reservoir (392 km(2)) with multiple end users, including a commercial aquaculture farm, which rely on sustainable water quality. Phytoplankton samples were taken monthly at upstream, aquaculture, and downstream locations during August 2008 to November 2011. The phytoplankton community was primarily diatoms and cryptophytes. Diatom biomass was correlated with greater mixing depth, while cryptophyte biomass was correlated with higher dissolved nutrients. Phytoplankton biomass was characterized by date, season and year, and this information was used to test spatial differences between upstream, farm and downstream locations. There was no significant difference in chlorophyte, chrysophyte or dinoflagellate biomass spatially. Upstream sites (US) had higher diatom biomass in the fall (US-DS = 329 mg/m(3)). Downstream sites (DS) had higher cryptophyte biomass in the summer (DS-US = 241 mg/m(3)) and higher cyanobacteria biomass in the fall (DS-US = 15 mg/m(3)). Spatial trends in diatoms, cryptophytes, and cyanobacteria between upstream and downstream locations were found to be significantly related to distance downstream, but failed to provide evidence of a fish farm effect. There was far greater inter-annual variability than spatial variability in phytoplankton biomass of Lake Diefenbaker, a lake prone to flooding and drought. For instance, flooding in 2011 resulted in elevated suspended solids, nutrient concentrations, and algal biomass (particularly cryptophytes and dinoflagellates) due to a La Nina winter. Flood inputs of suspended solids to Lake Diefenbaker favour low-light adapted taxa (e.g., Rhodomonas minuta Skuja) over potentially toxic cyanobacteria.

J	Tompalski, P; Coops, NC; White, JC; Wulder, MA; Yuill, A				Tompalski, Piotr; Coops, Nicholas C.; White, Joanne C.; Wulder, Michael A.; Yuill, Anna			Characterizing streams and riparian areas with airborne laser scanning data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The established position and increasing availability of Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) as an important source of information including forest inventory, allows additional applications to be developed when such data are already available. One key focus area for the application of ALS data is the assessment of riparian ecosystems, due to their critical role for providing, regulating and supporting important ecosystem services. ALS data provide detailed and accurate digital terrain models (DTMs) under forest canopy, which in turn enable the characterization of detailed stream networks, stream properties, and associated vegetation characteristics in adjacent riparian ecotones. In a complex Pacific Northwest coastal forest, we demonstrate how ALS point clouds can be used to map a stream network and characterize stream properties including stream order, width, gradient, sinuosity, and solar shading. Of relevance to regulatory and sustainability related elements of forest management, we demonstrate the use of these data to identify stream classes and related riparian zones, as well as the fish-bearing potential of the stream. The total length of identified streams was 6421.8 km, of which 55% were of the lowest order streams. The median stream gradient was 16.4% with median stream width varying between 0.58 and 19.67 m for the smallest to largest streams respectively. Stream class and fish bearing potential were evaluated using independent data, with overall accuracies of 61.0% for stream class and 82.9% for fish-bearing potential. The median of stand height, canopy cover, and stand vertical variability within riparian management areas was 19.8 m, 88.6%, and 68%, respectively, and in general did not vary across stream orders. The majority of streams (74.4%) were not accessible for anadromous fish. For fish-bearing streams, we found that only 0.2% had a mean stand height <2 m, while 2.4% had canopy cover of <20%, and only 7.3% received <10 h of shade. The ALS data thus enabled a holistic characterization of riparian ecotones, providing useful information on both stream and vegetation properties that can support sustainable forest management, inform on erosion risk, and become a foundation for the quantification of ecosystem goods and services.

J	Julian, P				Julian, Paul, II			Assessment of Upper Taylor Slough water quality and implications for ecosystem management in Everglades National Park	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												This study addresses water quality conditions across several distinct hydrologic regimes in the Upper Taylor Slough (UTS) region of Everglades National Park and briefly considers implications for long-term water quality management. Due to upstream changes in water delivery and construction of a detention area, Taylor Slough has experienced a significant change in hydrology over a 27-year period, progressing from direct discharge at varying amounts to sheet flow via groundwater conditions. Cumulative flow and rainfall relationships at the inflow and outflow of UTS demonstrate distinct break points. These changes in water delivery and subsequent upstream water management have resulted in a change in water quality conditions within the UTS region. Since 1986, total phosphorus (TP) flow-weighted mean concentrations exiting UTS have significantly decreased from 10 mu g/L in the late 1980s to 4 mu g/L or less since 2010. Based on analysis of surface water ion ratios, saltwater intrusion is unlikely and rather hyporheic exchange could be occurring between the inflow and outflow of the UTS region. Based on the analysis of existing water quality data, the UTS region is a resilient oligotrophic wetland system retaining strong assimilation capacity in the face of major management changes. While TP concentrations remain extremely low, restoration is not complete for Taylor Slough and adjacent coastal basins will inevitably bring additional nutrient loading. Management of the Slough should recognize this and consider what water quality condition is best for long-term sustainability of Taylor Slough's ecology.																	0923-4861	1572-9834				APR	2017	25	2					191	209		10.1007/s11273-016-9509-8								WOS:000398185800005

The aim of this research is to identify constituents of concern (COCs) in OSPW sourced from an active settling basin with the goal of providing a sound rational for developing mitigation strategies for using constructed treatment wetlands for COCs contained in OSPW. COCs were identified through several lines of evidence: 1) chemical and physical characterization of OSPW and comparisons with numeric water quality guidelines and toxicity endpoints, 2) measuring toxicity of OSPW using a taxonomic range of sentinel organisms (i.e. fish, aquatic invertebrates, and a macrophyte), 3) conducting process-based manipulations (PBMs) of OSPW to alter toxicity and inform treatment processes, and 4) discerning potential treatment pathways to mitigate ecological risks of OSPW based on identification of COCs, toxicological analyses, and PBM results. COCs identified in OSPW included organics (naphthenic acids [NAs], oil and grease [O/G]), metals/metalloids, and suspended solids. In terms of species sensitivities to undiluted OSPW, fish >= aquatic invertebrates > macrophytes. Bench-scale manipulations of the organic fractions of OSPW via PBMs (i.e. H2O2+UV254 and granular activated charcoal treatments) eliminated toxicity to Ceriodaphnia dubia (7-8 d), in terms of mortality and reproduction. Results from this study provide critical information to inform mitigation strategies using passive or semi-passive treatment processes (e.g., constructed treatment wetlands) to mitigate ecological risks of OSPW to aquatic organisms.

The environmental good is shared by the study countries, but the countries differ substantially in their income levels and other characteristics. We compare the performance of value transfers (with or without income elasticity of willingness to pay adjustments) and function transfers that include only core variables supported by economic theory. Our results point to a new source of uncertainty associated with function transfer choosing a particular functional form. Even if only theoretically relevant explanatory variables are used, the theory offers no insights with respect to a functional relationship of the dependence (e.g., linear, log-linear, exponential, polynomial). We show that while different functional forms may offer improvements in model fit, this does not necessarily translate to improvements in transfer errors or minimum tolerance levels. In our case, the value transfer with constant (unit) income elasticity adjustment, corresponding to the log-log functional relationship between willingness to pay and income, performs the best, Including additional explanatory variables or using other functional forms worsens the quality of transfers. Overall, our study questions the rationale for using more complicated function transfers in international benefit transfers, as the relationships observed within a country or a group of countries does not necessarily translate to dependencies between countries.

In the last decades, this biodiversity hotspot has been severely endangered by poorly treated wastewater discharges from upstream urban communities arriving through its two major contributors, the Cigtiela and Guadiana rivers. In this work, we analysed the potential risk of this constant input of micropollutants (estrogens, dioxin-like compounds and other endocrine disruptors) for the resident wildlife. We sampled 12 locations in TDNP and in the nearby Navaseca Pond during 2013, and performed a series of in-vivo and in-vitro bioassays, including Daphnia magna post-exposure feeding inhibition and recombinant yeast-based assays for dioxin-like and estrogenic activities. These results were then compared with the chemical composition of the samples, analysed by GC-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS, and evaluated according to their toxic potential as toxic equivalents or TEQ, The Navaseca Pond, heavily impacted by wastewater from the town of Daimiel, showed the highest levels of toxic compounds, estrogenic activity, and Daphnia toxicity. Conversely, the less impacted TDNP sites showed low residue levels of contaminants, low estrogenicity and dioxin-like activity and negligible toxicity. The results indicates that the current good chemical status of TDNP is menaced by both the inflow of wastewater treatment plants effluents from Guadiana and Cigiiela rivers into TDNP tributaries and, as it occurs in the Navaseca Pond, by direct sewage discharges.

Multivariate statistical evaluation of dissolved trace elements and a water quality assessment in the middle reaches of Huaihe River, Anhui, China	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												A total of 211 water samples were collected from 53 key sampling points from 5-10th July 2013 at four different depths (0 m, 2 m, 4 m, 8 m) and at different sites in the Huaihe River, Anhui, China. These points monitored for 18 parameters (water temperature, pH, TN, TP, TOC, Cu, Pb, Zn, Ni, Co, Cr, Cd, Mn, B, Fe, Al, Mg, and Ba). The spatial variability, contamination sources and health risk of trace elements as well as the river Water quality were investigated. Our results were compared with national (CSEPA) and international (WHO, USEPA) drinking water guidelines, revealing that Zn, Cd and Pb were the dominant pollutants in the water body. Application of different multivariate statistical approaches, including correlation matrix and factor/principal component analysis (FA/PCA), to assess the origins of the elements in the Huaihe River, identified three source types that accounted for 79.31% of the total variance. Anthropogenic activities were considered to contribute Much of the Zn, Cd, Pb, Ni, Co, and Mn via industrial waste, coal combustion, and vehicle exhaust; Ba, B, Cr and Cu were controlled by mixed anthropogenic and natural sources, and Mg, Fe and Al had natural origins from weathered rocks and crustal materials. Cluster analysis (CA) was used to classify the 53 sample points into three groups of water pollution, high pollution, moderate pollution, and low pollution, reflecting influences from tributaries, power plants and vehicle exhaust, and agricultural activities, respectively. The results of the water quality index (WO) indicate that Water in the Huaihe River is heavily polluted by trace elements, so approximately 96% of the water in the Huaihe River is unsuitable for drinking. A health risk assessment using the hazard quotient and index (HQ/HI) recommended by the USEPA suggests that Co, Cd and Pb in the river could cause non-carcinogenic harm to human health.

Assessing anthropogenic impacts on riverine ecosystems using nested partial least squares regression	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The results of three Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression models were used to gain a holistic view on the consequences of natural processes and anthropogenic pressures for water quality degradation and biodiversity decline in a multi-use watershed. The processes were soil erosion and wildfire risk; the pressures comprised land use conflicts, leachates from domestic and industrial waste, arable farming intensity and livestock density. Water quality was characterized for concentrations of nutrients (nitrate, phosphate), oxygen demands (Biochemical Oxygen Demand - BOD5, Chemical Oxygen Demand - COD) and various metals (e.g., As, Cr). Ecological integrity was assessed by the recently developed MELT (Multiple Ecological Level Index). In total, 18 variables were processed in the regression models. Two models were called "nested models" because they dealt with initial (pressures), intermediate (water quality) and final (MELI) environmental descriptors, used as dependent (MELI, quality) or independent (quality, pressures) variables. The third was called "bypass model" because it dealt solely with initial and final descriptors. Overall, the results of PLS regression linked the ineffective treatment of domestic sewage to water quality and ecological integrity declines in the studied watershed. Put another way, all models recurrently affirmed the major role of local factors, meaning of point source pollution, in determining the quality of stream water and the integrity of freshwater ecosystems. Sources of diffuse pollution were accounted for as contributing factors in the PLS regressions, but their influence was scarcely perceptible in the results. The poor treatment of domestic effluents is a public concern. In their strategic plans for mitigating this problem in the forthcoming years, administrative authorities are concentrated on management initiatives to improve the quality of provided services, instead of considering the construction of new wastewater treatment plants.

Sources and mechanisms of nitrate and orthophosphate transport in urban stormwater runoff from residential catchments	WATER RESEARCH												Nutrients export from residential catchments contributes to water quality impairment in urban water bodies. We investigated the concentrations, transport mechanisms, and sources of nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) and orthophosphate-phosphorus (PO4-P) in urban stormwater runoff generated in residential catchments in Tampa Bay, Florida, United States. Street runoff samples, collected over 21 storm events, were supplemented with rainfall and roof runoff samples from six representative residential catchments. Samples were analyzed for N and P forms, N and oxygen (O) isotopes of nitrate (delta O-18-NO3- and delta N-15 -NO3-), and delta O-18 and hydrogen (delta D) isotopes of water (H2O). We found that the main NO3-N source in street runoff was atmospheric deposition (range: 35-64%), followed by chemical N fertilizers (range: 1 -39%), and soil and organic N (range: 7-33%), whereas PO4-P in the street runoff likely originated from erosion of soil particles and mineralization from organic materials (leaves, grass clippings). The variability in the sources and concentrations of NO3-N and PO4-P across catchments is attributed to different development designs and patterns, use of various fill materials during land development, and landscaping practices. This data can be useful to develop strategies to offset the impacts of urban development (e.g., designs and patterns resulting in variable impervious areas) and management (e.g., fertilizer use, landscaping practices) on NO3-N and PO4-P transport in urban residential catchments.

THM and HAA formation from NOM in raw and treated surface waters	WATER RESEARCH												The disinfection by-product (DBP) formation potential (FP) of natural organic matter (NOM) in surface water sources has been studied with reference to the key water quality determinants (WQPs) of UV absorption (UV254), colour, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration. The data set used encompassed raw and treated water sampled over a 30-month period from 30 water treatment works (WTWs) across Scotland, all employing conventional clarification. Both trihalomethane (THM) and haloacetic acid (HM) FPs were considered. In addition to the standard bulk WQDs, the DOC content was fractionated and analysed for the hydrophobic (HPO) and hydrophilic (HPI) fractions. Results were quantified in terms of the yield (dDBPFP/dWQD) and the linear regression coefficient R-2 of the yield trend. The NOM in the raw waters was found to comprise 30-84% (average 66%) of the more reactive HPO material, with this proportion falling to 18-63% (average 50%) in the treated water. Results suggested UV254 to be as good an indicator of DBPFP as DOC or HPO for the raw waters, with R-2 values ranging from 0.79 to 0.82 for THMs and from 0.71 to 0.73 for HAAs for these three determinants. For treated waters the corresponding values were significantly lower at 0.52-0.67 and 0.46-0.47 respectively, reflecting the lower HPO concentration and thus UV254 absorption and commensurately reduced precision due to the limit of detection of the analytical instrument. It is concluded that fractionation offers little benefit in attempting to discern or predict chlorinated carbonaceous DBP yield for the waters across the geographical region studied. UV254 offered an adequate estimate of DBPFP based on a mean yield of similar to 2600 and similar to 2800 mu g per cm(-1) absorbance for THMFP for the raw and treated waters respectively and similar to 3800 and similar to 2900 g cm(-1) for HAAFP, albeit with reduced precision for the treated waters.

Here, we configured five separate SWAT (US Department of Agriculture's Soil and Water Assessment Tool) models to assess load reduction strategies for the agriculturally dominated Maumee River watershed, the largest P source contributing to toxic algal blooms in Lake Erie. Although several potential pathways may achieve the target loads, our results show that any successful pathway will require large-scale implementation of multiple practices. For example, one successful pathway involved targeting 50% of row cropland that has the highest P loss in the watershed with a combination of three practices: subsurface application of P fertilizers, planting cereal rye as a winter cover crop, and installing buffer strips. Achieving these levels of implementation will require local, state/provincial, and federal agencies to collaborate with the private sector to set shared implementation goals and to demand innovation and honest assessments of water quality-related programs, policies, and partnerships.

Multivariate analysis and GIS-based soil suitability diagnosis for sustainable intensive agriculture in Beni-Moussa irrigated subperimeter (Tadla plain, Morocco)	MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT												The aim of this study was to diagnose the agricultural land quality in Beni-Moussa irrigated subperimeter, Tadla plain (Morocco), and to evaluate that whether they are still suitable for sustainable intensive agriculture using GIS and physicochemical analyses. Eight quality indicators, namely soil depth, soil texture, pH, EC, CEC, OC, OM and slope, and were analyzed in 27 topsoil samples (0-20 cm) collected from the study zone at September 2009-2015. GIS approach was used to provide than indicator specific maps and to generate the land suitability for intensive agriculture. The results showed that about 1.69% (1324.38 ha) of studied area are classified in the class 'excellent suitable', 17.14% (13449.81 ha) in 'good suitable', 75.70% (59393.30 ha) in 'medium suitable' and 5.47% (4293.11 ha) in 'poor suitable' for sustainable intensive agriculture. These two latter land suitability classes needed some restrictions on agricultural practices and appropriate management to be of good sustainable productivity, without soil deterioration and negative effects on environment. The findings of this study are promising and can be used as a basis for the further scientific works, but they required new investigations and experts' opinions to evaluate and increase their accuracy.																	2363-6203	2363-6211				APR	2017	3	1							UNSP 3	10.1007/s40808-017-0272-5								WOS:000432216000003						
J	Bernardo, N; Alcantara, E				Bernardo, Nariane; Alcantara, Enner			Comparing proximal remote sensing and orbital images to estimate the total suspended matter in inland water	MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT												The main purpose of this work was to improve the remote sensing reflectance (R rs ) applications to estimate the total suspended matter (TSM) concentrations, since several studies using R rs retrieved from atmospherically corrected images did not match with in situ radiometric measurements. The goal was achieved by comparing two R rs datasets: one from atmospherically corrected image from Operational Land Imager (OLI)/ Landsat-8 and the R rs surface created by non-deterministic statistical approach. The R rs used to create the surface was computed by using samples gathered out in situ on 13-16 October 2014, and the OLI image used was taken in the first day of fieldwork. A reference surface from in situ TSM concentrations was also created to compare the estimates from both datasets (from statistical approach and image atmospherically corrected). The TSM estimates were made using empirical model, and the results demonstrate that non-statistical methods provide lowest errors to estimate the TSM concentration if compared to atmospheric corrected images.																	2363-6203	2363-6211				APR	2017	3	1							UNSP 19	10.1007/s40808-017-0285-0								WOS:000432216000019

There are broadly two environmental menaces associated with these agricultural stresses, increase of non-point source pollution loads at the surface and instigation of problem of secondary salinity (SS). The present study is applied vertical electrical soundings with Schlumberger electrode configuration having maximum current electrodes separation 300 m to assess the potential of freshwater layer lying over the saline groundwater. Primarily, the collected earth's resistivities were converted to groundwater quality using groundwater electrical conductivity (EC) from exploratory wells drilled at regular interval in the entire Thal Doab. Secondly, based on these EC values, the study area is divided into three different tubewell suitability classes as high, moderate and low with interpreted EC values as less than 1.5 dS/m, between 1.5 and 2.5 dS/m and greater than 2.5 dS/m, respectively. The spatial distribution maps of these suitability classes are done at six depth zones (0-50, 50-100, 100-150, 150-200, 200-250, 250-300 m). Results indicate that there is an inverse relationship between the surface water recharge and SS which should be used for both tubewell depth as well as site optimization and a check on their future growth rates. In this way the eco-friendly agricultural growth rates can be established in Tehsil Kot Adhu, Thal Doab, Pakistan and the other areas having similar hydrogeological conditions.

A hydrological modeling approach was used to identify the sensitive hydrological parameters of the basin through Sequential Uncertainty Fitting (SUFI-2) technique. SUFI-2 was used for the calibration of SOIL WATER ASSESSMENT TOOL (SWAT) model. It was calibrated for period (1979-2000) including 3 years as warm up (1979-1982), subsequently model was validated on 11 years of datasets (2001-2011). The percentage of observation covered by the 95PPU (p-factor) and the average thickness of the 95PPU band divided by the standard deviation of the measured data (r-factor), were taken into an account for performance evaluation of model. In calibration and validation the p-factor and the r-factor was obtained as 0.54, 0.76 and 0.68, 0.56 respectively. The coefficient of determination (R-2), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), percent bias (PBIAS) and RMSE-observations standard deviation ratio (RSR) have been used for goodness of fit between observation and final best simulation. The R-2, NSE, PBIAS and RSR are 0.74, 0.73, -3.55 and 0.54 respectively during the calibration whereas in validation period values are 0.75, 0.69, 18.55 and 0.56 respectively.

J	Kumar, PJS				Kumar, P. J. Sajil			Geostatistical modeling of fluoride enrichment and nitrate contamination in the groundwater of Lower Bhavani Basin in Tamil Nadu, India	MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT												Contamination of groundwater is posing serious threat to the household and drinking water supply schemes all over the world. Increase in concentration of Fluoride (F-) and Nitrate (NO3-) in the groundwater is frequently reported from Indian subcontinent. In this paper, we have studied the F- and NO3- concentration in the Lower Bhavani Basin located in Tamil Nadu state in south India. This is a hard rock dominated semi-arid climatic region, where groundwater is the potential source of drinking and agricultural purposes. Among the total 36 groundwater samples, 22% showed a higher concentration than the permissible of Indian Standard 1.2 mg/L for fluoride. The influence of geochemical factors such as pH, conductivity and Na/Ca ratios were identified. On the other hand, 16% of the samples exceeded the permissible limit of nitrate (45 mg/L). The source of nitrate is identified preliminarily as fertilizer usage in the agricultural fields and secondarily from the sewages. Kriging based Geostatistical model were used the spatial variation mapping of these ions. For fluoride, spatial variation maps showed definite correlation with the Geological formations, i.e., the high fluoride samples were observed in the NE regions of the basin. In case of Nitrate, higher concentration was observed in the Southern part of the basin. Mapping of water quality parameters spatially is proved to be an effective tool for better visualization and management of the groundwater resources in the study area.					P.

J	Ding, SK; Chu, WH				Ding, Shunke; Chu, Wenhai			Recent advances in the analysis of nitrogenous disinfection by-products	TRENDS IN ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												The potential occurrence of nitrogenous disinfection by-products (N-DBPs) in drinking water raises concerns because of their high genotoxicity, cytotoxicity, and carcinogenicity compared to those of carbonaceous DBPs. To meet water quality indexes, drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) adopt a shift from chlorination to chloramination during disinfection to control the formation of regulated DBPs, namely trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids. Meanwhile, DWTPs exploit source waters, which contain natural organic matter with high organic nitrogen content, impacted by algal blooms or municipal wastewater effluents to couple with the increasing water demands. However, these changes can result in the increase in the amounts of certain N-DBPs for the incomplete removal of organic nitrogen content and the addition of inorganic nitrogen content. To study the occurrence, formation, and control of N-DBPs, fundamental analysis techniques are indispensable for identifying and quantifying DBPs and their precursors (formation potential) in lab and real water samples. The analytical determination and quantification of DBPs mainly involve three steps, which are pre-treatment, compound separation by chromatography, and identification by detectors. In this paper, we provide a short review and summary of pre-treatment and analytical methods used in the determination of four types of frequently detected N-DBPs, namely halonitromethanes, haloacetonitriles, haloacetamides, and N-nitrosamines. In addition, the analytical methods for other emerging N-DBPs are also covered in this review.

J	Ma, J				Ma, Jian			Determination of chemical oxygen demand in aqueous samples with non-electrochemical methods	TRENDS IN ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												Water contamination is a globally important environmental concern, with chemical oxygen demand ( COD) being a criteria in water quality assessment, providing information on the availability of chemically degradable fractions of organic pollutants. However, the standard method for COD analysis is time-consuming and results may vary between laboratories. Efforts to resolve these problems have mostly focussed on improvements to both digestion and detection techniques and this review addresses recent trends in the determination of COD in aqueous samples, based on published literature since 2000. The features of principal methods are critically reviewed, focusing on their practical applicability. This review includes an overview of: 1) standard methods; 2) novel digestion techniques; 3) varying detection methods, such as chemiluminescence, spectrophotometry and others; 4) and future trends in COD measurements. Electrochemical techniques are excluded, as despite their importance as an environmental friendly alternative for COD measurement, these methods have only recently been developed and require a full and separate review.																	2214-1588					APR	2017	14						37	43		10.1016/j.teac.2017.05.002								WOS:000429882600004

The events resulted in regime shifts cascading through all trophic levels, disturbing ecosystem functioning and damaging the water environment. Causal pathways by which the external (hydroclimate, overfishing) and internal (food web interactions) drivers provoke regime shifts are investigated. Statistical data analyses supported by an interpretative framework based on hierarchical ecosystem theory revealed mechanisms of hierarchical incorporation of environmental factors into the ecosystem. Evidence links Atlantic teleconnections to Black Sea hydroclimate, which together with fishing shapes variability in fish stocks. The hydroclimatic signal is conveyed through the food web via changes in productivity at all levels, to planktivorous fish. Fluctuating fish abundance is believed to induce a lagged change in competitor jelly plankton that cascades down to phytoplankton and influences water quality. Deprived of the stabilising role of apex predators, the Black Sea's hierarchical ecosystem organisation is susceptible to both environmental and anthropogenic stresses, and increased fishing makes fish stock collapses highly probable. When declining stocks are confronted with burgeoning fishing effort associated with the inability of fishery managers and decision-makers to adapt rapidly to changes in fish abundance, there is overfishing and stock collapse. Management procedures are ineffective at handling complex phenomena such as ecosystem regime shifts because of the shortage of suitable explanatory models. The proposed concepts and models reported here relate the hydroclimate, overfishing and invasive species to shifts in ecosystem functioning and water quality, unravelling issues such as the causality of ecosystem interactions and mechanisms and offering potential for finding ways to reverse regime shifts. We advocate a management approach aiming at restoring ecosystem hierarchy that might mitigate the costly consequences of regime shifts.																	1354-1013	1365-2486				APR	2017	23	4					1486	1498		10.1111/gcb.13508								WOS:000396836800011	27643946

Identification of critical contaminants in wastewater effluent for managed aquifer recharge	CHEMOSPHERE												Managed aquifer recharge (MAR) using highly treated effluent from municipal wastewater treatment plants has been recognized as a promising strategy for indirect potable water reuse. Treated wastewater effluent can contain a number of residual contaminants that could have adverse effects on human health, and some jurisdictions have regulations in place to govern these. For those that do not, but where reuse may be under consideration, it is of crucial importance to develop a strategy for identifying priority contaminants, which can then be used to understand the water treatment technologies that might be required. In this study, a multi-criteria approach to identify critical contaminants in wastewater effluent for MAR was developed and applied using a case study site located in southern Ontario, Canada. An important aspect of this approach was the selection of representative compounds for each group of contaminants, based on potential for occurrence in wastewater and expected health or environmental impacts. Due to a lack of MAR regulations in Canada, the study first proposed potential recharge water quality targets. Predominant contaminants, potential additional contaminants, and potential emerging contaminants, which together comprise critical contaminants for MAR with reclaimed water, were then selected based on the case study wastewater effluent monitoring data and literature data. This paper proposes an approach for critical contaminant selection, which will be helpful to guide future implementation of MAR projects using wastewater treatment plant effluents.

Spatiotemporal change of phosphorous speciation and concentration in stormwater in the St. Lucie Estuary watershed, South Florida	CHEMOSPHERE												Phosphorous (P) concentration in stormwater runoff varies at different spatial and temporal scales. Excessive P loading from agriculture system into the St. Lucie Estuary (SLE) contributed to water quality deterioration in southern Indian River Lagoon. This study examines the spatial and temporal shifts of different P forms in runoff and storm water under different land use, water management, and rainfall conditions. Storm water samplings were conducted monthly between April 2013 and December 2014 in typical farmland and along the waterway (Canal C-24) that connects lands to the SLE. Concentrations of different P forms and related water quality variables were measured. Approximately 89% of the collected water samples contained total P (17) concentrations exceeding the total maximum daily load (TMDL) level (0.081 mg L-1). Concentrations of different P forms declined from agricultural field furrows to the canal and then increased from the upstream to the downstream in the canal where urban activities dominated land use. Total dissolved P (TDP) was the predominant form of TP, followed by PO4-P. Speciation and concentrations of P varied with sites and sampling times, but were significantly higher in the summer months (from June to September) than in the winter. Water pH explained similar to 20% of TP variation. Spatiotemporal variations of P concentrations and compositions provide a data-based guide for development of best management practices (BMPs) to minimize P export from the SLE watershed.

J	Vadas, TM; Smith, M; Luan, HW				Vadas, Timothy M.; Smith, Malcolm; Luan, Hongwei			Leaching and retention of dissolved metals in particulate loaded pervious concrete columns	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												This study examined metal leaching and retention in pervious concrete with or without embedded particulate matter. Particulate matter was collected from an adjacent parking lot and from a nearby parking garage as examples of weathered and un-weathered particulate matter. Particle size distributions were similar, but metal content was 3-35-fold higher and organic matter content was 3-fold higher in the parking garage particulate matter compared to the parking lot particulate matter. Replicate columns were established with either no particulate added as the control, or 20 g of parking lot or parking garage particulate matter. Synthetic rainwater was passed through the columns at variable rainfall intensity or fixed intensity to assess leaching. Metals were leached at higher concentrations from the parking garage particulate amended column, but from all columns less than 1% of the metal mass leached. Rainfall intensity did not have a large effect on leached metal concentrations, only varying effluent by about 2-fold. Synthetic stormwater with elevated dissolved Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb concentrations was passed through the same columns and metal removal efficiencies were on the order of 85-95%, 30 95%, 60-90%, and 95+% for each metal, respectively. After loading the column with a year's worth of stormwater metal exposure, removal efficiencies in the no particulate and parking lot particulate amended columns decreased, while parking garage particulate amended columns performed similarly with a small drop in Cu and Pb removal efficiencies. Generally, columns with no particulate and parking lot particulate amendments performed similarly, suggesting the pervious concrete is responsible for the majority of the initial metal retention. The parking garage particulate amended columns retained more metals from stormwater, perhaps due to an increase in that promoted surface precipitation as hydroxides or carbonate species on the pervious concrete, or due to complexation in the higher concentrations of organic matter and iron oxides in the particulate matter. Overall, metal retention was aided by the presence of organic matter in the particulate matter, but the pervious concrete itself was more important than particulates for metal retention. A strategy to increase metal retention and removal from the environment could involve amending pervious concrete with mixtures of well-defined sorbents to enhance metal retention.

This paper aims at developing an innovative methodology for sustainability assessment of the technologies for groundwater remediation. A total of eight criteria have been used for sustainability assessment of the technologies for groundwater remediation in this study, and they are capital cost, detection and analysis costs, and operation and maintenance costs in economic aspects, effect of secondary pollution environmental aspect, effectiveness for water quality improvement and time for remediation in technological aspect, the effect on public health in social aspect, and policy support belonging to political aspect. The relative priorities of the alternative technologies with respect to each criterion were scored by Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), and it was also employed to calculate the weights of the criteria. After determining the decision-making matrix,ELECTRE was employed to rank the alternatives according to their sustainability performances. An illustrative case has been studied by the proposed method, monitored natural attenuation (MNA) has been recognized as the most sustainable technology for groundwater remediation, followed by pump-treat (1382T) technology, permeable reactive barriers (PRB) and air sparing (AS). Finally, Sensitivity analysis was also carried out to test the robustness of the results. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

An MILP model for optimizing water exchanges in eco-industrial parks considering water quality	RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING												Unlike other resources that may come in multiple energy forms, there is no substitute for freshwater. Therefore, Eco-Industrial Parks (EIPs) have been designed to encourage interplant water exchange networks in order to minimize the consumption of freshwater as well as the generation of wastewater. This study proposes a model that simultaneously minimizes the economic and the environmental objective functions of an EIP through goal programming. The economic costs considered integrates the necessary piping and operating costs together with the freshwater, wastewater, and treatment costs, while the environmental impact considered the volume and the quality of the water used and released by the EIP. Results showed that the considering water volume and quality in minimizing the environmental impact gave better results than considering water volume only. Economic costs and environmental impacts were also found to be dependent on the priorities given to each goal, as well as the treatment quality of the processes.

Waldo			Using integrated, ecosystem-level management to address intensifying ocean acidification and hypoxia in the California Current large marine ecosystem	ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE												Ocean acidification is intensifying and hypoxia is projected to expand in the California Current large marine ecosystem as a result of processes associated with the global emission of CO2. Observed changes in the California Current outpace those in many other areas of the ocean, underscoring the pressing need to adopt management approaches that can accommodate uncertainty and the complicated dynamics forced by accelerating change. We argue that changes occurring in the California Current large marine ecosystem provide opportunities and incentives to adopt an integrated, systems-level approach to resource management to preserve existing ecosystem services and forestall abrupt change. Practical options already exist to maximize the benefits of management actions and ameliorate impending change in the California Current, for instance, adding ocean acidification and hypoxia to design criteria for marine protected areas, including consideration of ocean acidification and hypoxia in fisheries management decisions, and fully enforcing existing laws and regulations that govern water quality and land use and development.																	2325-1026					MAR 31	2017	5									10.1525/elementa.198								WOS:000397956400001

Contribution of Leaf Litter to Nutrient Export during Winter Months in an Urban Residential Watershed	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Identification of nonpoint sources of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in urban systems is imperative to improving water quality and better managing eutrophication. Winter contributions and sources of annual N and P loads from urban watersheds are poorly characterized in northern cities because monitoring is often limited to warm-weather periods. To determine the winter export of N and P, we monitored stormwater outflow in a residential watershed in Saint Paul, Minnesota during 2012-2014. Our data demonstrate that winter melt events contribute a high percentage of annual N and P export (50%). We hypothesized that overwintering leaf litter that is not removed by fall street sweeping could be an important source to winter'oads of N and P. We estimated contributions of this source by studying decomposition in lawns, street gutters, and catch basins, during two winters. Rates of mass and N loss were negligible during both winters. However, P was quickly solubilized from decomposing leaves. Using mass balances and estimates of P leaching losses, we estimated that leaf litter could contribute 80% of winter total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) loading in this watershed (similar to 40% of annual TDP loading). Our work indicates that urban trees adjacent to streets likely represent a major source of P pollution in northern cities. Management that targets important winter sources such as tree leaves could be highly effective for reducing P loading and may mitigate eutrophication in urban lakes and streams in developed cities.

In this study, the structure and composition of EPS (extracellular polymeric substances) were investigated to elucidate the factors for the anammox aggregation property. Anammox sludge taken from 18 lab-scale and pilot scale reactors treating different types of wastewater was analyzed using EEM-PARAFAC (excitation emission matrix and parallel factor analysis), FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) and real-time PCR combined with multivariate statistical analysis. The results showed that slime and TB-EPS (tightly bound EPS) were closely related with water quality and sludge morphology, and could be used as the indicators for anammox microbial survival ability and microbial aggregate morphology. Furthermore, slime secreted from anammox bacterial cells may be exhibited higher viscosity to the sludge surface and easily formed the gel network to aggregate. Large amounts of hydrophobic groups of protein in TB-EPS promoted the microbial aggregation. The mechanisms of anammox aggregation explored in this study enhanced the understanding of anammox stability in wastewater treatment processes.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				MAR 21	2017	51	6					3260	3268		10.1021/acs.est.6b05761								WOS:000397477900017	28240536

Influence of the Mixing Energy Consumption Affecting Coagulation and Floc Aggregation	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The operational significance of energy-intensive rapid mixing processes remains unaddressed in coagulation and flocculation of insollible precipitates (flocs), which play an important role in the removal of impurities from drinking water supplies. In this study, the influence of rapid mixing and associated mixing energy on floc aggregation was examined for a surface water source characterized by a high fraction of aquatic humic matter. Infrared spectral analyses showed that the colloidal complexes resulting from ligand exchange between iron and dissolved natural organic matter (DOM) were not substantially influenced by the mixing energy input. This signified that DOM removal by coagulation can be achieved at lower mixing intensity, thereby reducing energy consumption. In contrast, macroscopic investigations showed the coagulation mixing energy affected floc size distributions during the slow mixing stage in flocculation and, to some extent, their settling characteristics. The results from analysis of floc properties clearly showed that more mixing energy was expended than necessary in coagulation, which is typically designed at a high mixing intensity range of 600-1000 s(-1) in treatment plants. The key findings from this study have practical implications to water utilities to strategically meet water quality goals while reducing energy demands.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				MAR 21	2017	51	6					3480	3489		10.1021/acs.est.6b06281								WOS:000397477900041	28206742					
J	Mabaya, G; Unami, K; Fujihara, M				Mabaya, Goden; Unami, Koichi; Fujihara, Masayuki			Stochastic optimal control of agrochemical pollutant loads in reservoirs for irrigation	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Agriculture intensification through the use of chemical nitrogen fertilizers is contributing substantially to the tremendous increases in global food production. However, eutrophication of downstream waters associated with excess nitrate pollutant runoff has become a major environmental concern in agricultural areas. Reservoirs used for irrigation are well-positioned to intercept substantial fertilizer runoff from upslope agricultural fields. The authors hypothesized that such reservoirs can be used to influence the quality of downstream surface water. A Markov decision process was formulated to find optimal operating policies for controlling stochastic agrochemical pollutant loads in reservoirs for irrigation. The model was applied to an irrigation reservoir in Japan that is prone to nitrate pollution from upslope green tea plantations. The computational results reveal that, in all nitrate-nitrogen states in which the reservoir storage state is below 10%, the optimal policy is to introduce cleaner water supplements from the upstream reservoir. When the reservoir storage volume exceeds 35% of active capacity and when the nitrate-nitrogen concentration is less than 3 mg/L, the optimal policy would be only to release the irrigation water. When the reservoir storage volume exceeds 35% of active capacity and when the nitrate nitrogen concentration exceeds 5 mg/L, the optimal operation decision is to first release irrigation water from the reservoir before introducing cleaner water supplements. Therefore, the operation of irrigation reservoirs can be optimized to control intercepted agro-fertilizer pollutants from intensive agricultural areas. The developed method for reservoir irrigation operation has the potential to support decision making processes to provide greater protection of the water environment from agrochemical pollution while sustaining the productivity in the intensive agricultural areas.

J	Liu, WF; Antonelli, M; Liu, XC; Yang, H				Liu, Wenfeng; Antonelli, Marta; Liu, Xingcai; Yang, Hong			Towards improvement of grey water footprint assessment: With an illustration for global maize cultivation	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												The grey water footprint refers to the volume of water that is required to assimilate polluted water. It reflects the intensity of water pollution caused by water use for human activities. This study aims to address some major shortcomings associated with grey water footprint accounting in the literature and discuss several ways towards its improvement. Global maize production is used for illustration. The study specifically tackles three issues: the appropriate water quality standards for grey water footprint assessment; grey water footprint for multiple pollutants; and the influence of spatial resolution of the assessment on the level of grey water stress. A biophysical crop model is applied to quantify nitrogen and phosphorus losses to water in maize production on a global scale with a 0.5-degree spatial resolution. The study shows that the grey water footprint calculation is highly Sensitive to the water standards applied. The results also suggest that the grey water footprint relating to nitrogen and phosphorus pollution caused by maize production alone has already exceeded their local water availability in many parts of the world. Grey water stress shows a more critical situation at the grid level than at the watershed level for maize cultivation because the former represents the local concentration whereas the latter gives the average situation of the whole watershed. This study highlights the need for standardizing the setting of water quality standards for a consistent grey water footprint assessment taking into consideration the diverse aquatic ecosystems and ambient water quality requirements across regions, as well as the presence of multiple pollutants in water bodies.

However, the detailed knowledge about the contribution of CWs to methane and nitrous oxide emissions in treating sewage treatment plant effluent are still limited in particular for a better understanding of the sustainability of CWs. The fluxes of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from free water surface (FWS) CWs in northern China were measured continuously using the static-stationary chamber technique from 2012 to 2013. The results showed that CWs were the significant source of CH4 and N2O emissions. Average emission rates of CH4 and N2O ranged from -30.2 mu g m(-2) h(-1) to 450.9 mu g m(-2) h(-1), and -58.8 mu g m(-2) h(-1) to 1251.8 mu g m(-2) h(-1), respectively. Obvious annual and seasonal variations of CH4 and N2O emissions were observed over the 2-year period. In addition, temperatures and plant species had an impact on CH4 and N2O emissions. The obtained results showed that FINS CWs, improving water quality but emitting lower CH4 and N2O, could be the alternative method for sewage treatment plant effluent. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Use of fluorescence spectroscopy to control ozone dosage in recirculating aquaculture systems	WATER RESEARCH												The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of fluorescence spectroscopy to be used as an ozone dosage determination tool in recirculating aquaculture systems (RASs), by studying the relationship between fluorescence intensities and dissolved organic matter (DOM) degradation by ozone, in order to optimise ozonation treatment. Water samples from six different Danish facilities (two rearing units from a commercial trout RAS, a commercial eel RAS, a pilot RAS and two marine water aquariums) were treated with different O-3 dosages (1.0-20.0 mg/L ozone) in bench-scale experiments, following which fluorescence intensity degradation was eventually determined. Ozonation kinetic experiments showed that RAS water contains fluorescent organic matter, which is easily oxidised upon ozonation in relatively low concentrations (0-5 mg O-3/L). Fluorescence spectroscopy has a high level of sensitivity and selectivity in relation to associated fluorophores, and it is able to determine accurately the ozone demand of each system. The findings can potentially be used to design offline or online sensors based on the reduction by ozone of natural fluorescent-dissolved organic matter in RAS. The suggested indirect determination of ozone delivered into water can potentially contribute to a safer and more adequate ozone-based treatment to improve water quality. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Samples were biweekly collected at five stations with different hydrographic conditions during a 1-year cycle. The second-stage-matrix-based multivariate approach was used to summarize the internal interactions of the ciliate functional groups among five stations during a 1-year period. The functional groups of the ciliates represented a clear spatial variation in annual cycle among five stations. Mantel analysis demonstrated that the spatial variation in annual cycles of the ciliate functional groups were significantly correlated with the changes nutrients (mainly soluble reactive phosphates and nitrates), alone or in combination with salinity among five stations. Based the results, it is suggested that the spatial variation in annual cycles of functional groups of planktonic ciliates may indicated the changes of hydrographic conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Increased phytoplankton food resulting from eutrophication is suggested to enhance larval survival. We addressed the hypothesis that larval success is associated with particular chl-a levels in tightly controlled larval:algal conditions. We used chl-a conditions found on coral reefs (0.1-5.0 mu g chl-a L-1), including nominal threshold levels for disproportionate larval success (>= 1.0 mu g chl-a L-1). High success to the juvenile occurred across an order of magnitude of chl-a concentrations (0.5-5.0 mu g chl-a L-1), suggesting there may not be a narrow value for optimal success. Oligotrophic conditions (0.1 mu g chl-a L-1) appeared to be a critical limit. With a review of the evidence, we suggest that opportunistic COTS larvae may be more resilient to low food levels than previously appreciated. Initiation of outbreak populations need not require eutrophic conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Chen, WB; Liu, WC				Chen, Wei-Bo; Liu, Wen-Cheng			Investigating the fate and transport of fecal coliform contamination in a tidal estuarine system using a three-dimensional model	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												A three-dimensional fecal coliform transport model was developed and incorporated into a hydrodynamic and suspended sediment transport model to better understand the microbiological water quality in the tidal Tamsui River estuarine system of northern Taiwan, which includes three main tributaries: Dahan River, Xindian River, and Keelung River. The model was calibrated using the water level, salinity, suspended sediment concentration, and fecal coliform data measured in 2010. The predictive skill, a statistical approach, is used to evaluate the model performance. There was quantitatively good agreement between the simulation and measurement results. Further, the calibrated model underwent model sensitivity analysis by varying the model parameters which include the settling velocity, darkness decay rate, partition coefficient, and fecal coliform concentration in the sediment bed. The results indicated that the settling velocity played the most important role in affecting fecal coliform concentrations followed by partition coefficient, darkness decay rate, and fecal coliform concentration in the sediment bed. The model was also used to investigate the effects of salinity and suspended sediment on fecal coliform contamination. The salinity module was excluded in the simulations, resulting in an increase of fecal coliform concentration. However the effect of salinity on fecal coliform concentration is minor. If the suspended sediment transport was excluded in the simulations, the predicted results of fecal coliform concentration decrease to be underestimated the measured data. The modeling results revealed that the inclusion of the suspended sediment transport model in the simulations was of crucial importance because the fecal coliform concentrations were significantly influenced by the suspended sediment concentration in the estuarine system.

Hypothetical scenario exercises to improve planning and readiness for drinking water quality management during extreme weather events	WATER RESEARCH												Two hypothetical scenario exercises were designed and conducted to reflect the increasingly extreme weather-related challenges faced by water utilities as the global climate changes. The first event was based on an extreme flood scenario. The second scenario involved a combination of weather events, including a wild forest fire ('bushfire') followed by runoff due to significant rainfall. For each scenario, a panel of diverse personnel from water utilities and relevant agencies (e.g. health departments) formed a hypothetical water utility and associated regulatory body to manage water quality following the simulated extreme weather event. A larger audience participated by asking questions and contributing key insights. Participants were confronted with unanticipated developments as the simulated scenarios unfolded, introduced by a facilitator. Participants were presented with information that may have challenged their conventional experiences regarding operational procedures in order to identify limitations in current procedures, assumptions, and readily available information. The process worked toward the identification of a list of specific key lessons for each event. At the conclusion of each simulation a facilitated discussion was used to establish key lessons of value to water utilities in preparing them for similar future extreme events. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, the possibility of using pre-ozonation instead of post-ozonation for the removal of micropollutants was explored because of the lower risk of forming carcinogenic bromate. A 1.0 m(3)/h pilot system was utilized to compare the efficacy of pre- and post-ozonation in the removal of bulk organic pollutants as well as micropollutants, including typical odor-causing compounds, pharmaceuticals, and typical pesticides, from one source water (Huangpu River) characterized by the occurrence of various micropollutants. Both pre-ozonation and post-ozonation could achieve similar water purification performance under an ozone dose of 1.5 mg/L, in terms of bulk water quality parameters like CODMn, (66% in combination with biological activated carbon (BAC) treatment, compared to 62% with the pre-ozonation-BAC combination) or micropollutants including 27 pharmaceuticals (85% in combination with BAC compared to 87% with the pre-ozonation-BAC combination) and 25 pesticides (72% in combination with BAC compared to 61% with the preozonation-BAC combination). Pre-ozonation exhibited slightly better odorant removal performance (100% in combination with BAC compared to 92% with the post-ozonation-BAC combination); however, post-ozonation generated approximately 6.0 mu g/L bromate at an ozone dose of 2.0 mg/L, while pre-ozonation did not form bromate even at an ozone dose as high as 3.0 mg/L. So pre-ozonation in combination with BAC might be a solution for the removal of micropollutants from source water with high bromate formation risk. The results of this study will be helpful for the optimization of ozonation processes in the water supply industry. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Microbial source tracking in shellfish harvesting waters in the Gulf of Nicoya, Costa Rica	WATER RESEARCH												Current microbial water quality monitoring is generally limited to culture-based measurements of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB). Given the many possible sources of fecal pollution within a watershed and extra intestinal FIB reservoirs, it is important to determine source(s) of fecal pollution as a means to improve water quality and protect public health. The principal objective of this investigation was to characterize the microbial water quality of shellfish harvesting areas in the Gulf of Nicoya, Costa Rica during 2015. In order to achieve this objective, the specificity and sensitivity of 11 existing microbial source tracking (MST) PCR assays, associated with cows (BacCow), dogs (BacCan, DogBac), domestic wastewater (PMMoV), general avian (GFD), gulls (Gull2), horses (HorseBac, HoF), humans (HF183, HPyV), and pigs (PF), were evaluated using domestic wastewater and animal fecal samples collected from the region. The sensitivity of animal-associated assays ranged from 13 to 100%, while assay specificity ranged from 38 to 100%. The specificity of pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) and human polyomavirus (HPyV) was 100% for domestic wastewater, as compared to 94% specificity of the HF183 Bacteroidales marker. PMMoV was identified as a useful domestic wastewater-associated marker, with concentrations as high as 1.1 x 10(5) copies/ml and 100% sensitivity and specificity. Monthly surface water samples collected from four shellfish harvesting areas were analyzed using culture-based methods for Escherichia coli as well as molecular methods for FIB and a suite of MST markers, which were selected for their specificity in the region. While culturable E. coli results suggested possible fecal pollution during the monitoring period, the absence of human/domestic wastewater-associated markers and low FIB concentrations determined using molecular methods indicated sufficient microbial water quality for shellfish harvesting. This is the first study to our knowledge to test the performance of MST markers in Costa Rica as well as in Central America. Given the lack of wastewater treatment and the presence of secondary sources of FIB, this study highlights the importance of an MST toolbox approach to characterize water quality in tropical regions. Furthermore, it confirms and extends the geographic range of PMMoV as an effective tool for monitoring domestic wastewater pollution. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Evaluation of the dry and wet weather recreational health risks in a semi-enclosed marine embayment in Southern California	WATER RESEARCH												For many coastal regions around the world, recreational beach water quality is assessed using fecal indicator bacteria (FIB). However, the utility of FIB as indicators of recreational water illness (RWI) risk has been questioned, particularly in coastal settings with no obvious sources of human sewage. In this study we employed a source-apportionment quantitative microbial risk assessment (SA-QMRA) to assess RWI risk at a popular semi-enclosed recreational beach in Southern California (Baby Beach, City of Dana Point) with no obvious point sources of human sewage. Our SA-QMRA results suggest that, during dry weather, the median RWI risk at this beach is below the U.S. EPA recreational water quality criteria (RWQC) of 36 illness cases per 1000 bathers. During wet weather, the median RWI risk predicted by SA-QMRA depends on the assumed level of human waste associated with stormwater; the RWI risk is below the EPA RWQC illness risk benchmark 100% of the time provided that <2% of the FIB in stormwater are of human origin. However, these QMRA outcomes contrast strongly with the EPA RWQC for 30-day geometric mean of enterococci bacteria. Our results suggest that SA-QMRA is a useful framework for estimating robust RWI risk that takes into account local information about possible human and non-human sources of FIB.

Using Landsat to extend the historical record of lacustrine phytoplankton blooms: A Lake Erie case study	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Long-term records of phytoplankton blooms in freshwater lakes are necessary both for understanding basin scale changes to watersheds and for providing a key constraint for assessing processes driving blooms. However, due to the inherent constraints of in situ sampling and the short time period covered by modem space borne sensors, few long-term records exist. Historical data from sensors such as Landsat offer strong potential for creating new records of past blooms. Here, we use a novel evaluation procedure based on multiple metrics to assess algorithm suitability and robustness for generating long-term bloom records using Landsat 5 imagery. Evaluation metrics are based on bloom presence, spatial distribution, magnitude and timing, using both in situ Microcystis biovolume and remotely-sensed Cyanobacterial Index (CI) data from MERIS for 2002-2011. Applying this procedure for a test case focusing on Lake Erie's western basin, an algorithm based on a near infrared threshold with simple atmospheric correction through subtraction of the shortwave infrared band, combined with an additional "greenness" filter based on a hue threshold, performs best. Implementing this algorithm for 1984-2001 reveals the long-term trends in peak bloom magnitude prior to the start of the MERIS and MODIS record (2002-2015), and more than doubles the period of record that can be used to understand bloom occurrence and growth for this system. More broadly, we demonstrate that Landsat observations can be used to identify macro-scale features of blooms. For Lake Erie, the performance of the final Landsat algorithm is comparable to that of the MERIS CI algorithm, despite Landsat's broad spectral bands and long revisit time. (C) 2017 The Authors.

J	Li, SY; Cooke, RA; Wang, L; Ma, F; Bhattarai, R				Li, Shiyang; Cooke, Richard A.; Wang, Li; Ma, Fang; Bhattarai, Rabin			Characterization of fly ash ceramic pellet for phosphorus removal	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Phosphorus has been recognized as a leading pollutant for surface water quality deterioration. In the Midwestern USA, subsurface drainage not only provides a pathway for excess water to leave the field but it also drains out nutrients like nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). Fly ash has been identified as one of the viable materials for phosphorus removal from contaminated waters. In this study, a ceramic pellet was manufactured using fly ash for P absorption. Three types of pellet with varying lime and clay proportions by weight (type 1: 10% lime + 30% clay, type 2: 20% lime + 20% clay, and type 3: 30% lime + 10% clay) were characterized and evaluated for absorption efficiency. The result showed that type 3 pellet (60% fly ash with 30% lime and 10% clay) had the highest porosity (14%) and absorption efficiency and saturated absorption capacity (1.98 mg P/g pellet) compared to type 1 and 2 pellets. The heavy metal leaching was the least (30 mu g/L of chromium after 5 h) for type 3 pellet compared to other two. The microcosmic structure of pellet from scanning electron microscope showed the type 3 pellet had the better distribution of aluminum and iron oxide on the surface compared other two pellets. This result indicates that addition of lime and clay can improve P absorption capacity of fly ash while reducing the potential to reduce chromium leaching. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Gwak, JH; Lee, BK; Lee, WK; Sohn, SY				Gwak, Jae Ha; Lee, Bo Kyeong; Lee, Won Kyung; Sohn, So Young			Optimal location selection for the installation of urban green roofs considering honeybee habitats along with socio-economic and environmental effects	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												This study proposes a new framework for the selection of optimal locations for green roofs to achieve a sustainable urban ecosystem. The proposed framework selects building sites that can maximize the benefits of green roofs, based not only on the socio-economic and environmental benefits to urban residents, but also on the provision of urban foraging sites for honeybees. The framework comprises three steps. First, building 'candidates for green roofs are selected considering the building type. Second, the selected building candidates are ranked in terms of their expected socio-economic and environmental effects. The benefits of green roofs are improved energy efficiency and air quality, reduction of urban flood risk and infrastructure improvement costs, reuse of storm water, and creation of space for education and leisure. Furthermore, the estimated cost of installing green roofs is also considered. We employ spatial data to determine the expected effects of green roofs on each building unit, because the benefits and costs may vary depending on the location of the building. This is due to the heterogeneous spatial conditions. In the third step, the final building sites are proposed by solving the maximal covering location problem (MCLP) to determine the optimal locations for green roofs as urban honeybee foraging sites. As an illustrative example, we apply,the proposed framework in Seoul, Korea. This new framework is expected to contribute to sustainable urban ecosystems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

A GIS policy approach for assessing the effect of fertilizers on the quality of drinking and irrigation water and wellhead protection zones (Crete, Greece)	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Fertilizers have undoubtedly contributed to the significant increase in yields worldwide and therefore to the considerable improvement of quality of life of man and animals. Today, attention is focussed on the risks imposed by agricultural fertilizers. These effects include the dissolution and transport of excess quantities of fertilizer major- and trace-elements to the groundwater that deteriorate the quality of drinking and irrigation water. In this study, a map for the Fertilizer Water Pollution Index (FWPI) was generated for assessing the impact of agricultural fertilizers on drinking and irrigation water quality. The proposed methodology was applied to one of the most intensively cultivated with tree crops area in Crete (Greece) where potential pollutant loads are derived exclusively from agricultural activities and groundwater is the main water source. In this region of 215 km(2), groundwater sampling data from 235 wells were collected over a 15-year time period and analyzed for the presence of anionic (NO (-3), P0(-3)4) and cationic (K+1, Fe+2, mn(+2,) zn(+2), Cu+3, B+3) fertilizer trace elements. These chemicals are the components of the primary fertilizers used in local tree crop production. Eight factors/maps were considered in order to estimate the spatial distribution of groundwater contamination for each fertilizer element. The eight factors combined were used to generate the Fertilizer Water Pollution Index (FWPI) map indicating the areas with drinking/irrigation water pollution due to the high groundwater contamination caused by excessive fertilizer use. Moreover; by taking into consideration the groundwater flow direction and seepage velocity, the pathway through which groundwater supply become polluted can be predicted. The groundwater quality results show that a small part of the study area, about 8 km(2) (3.72%), is polluted or moderately polluted by the excessive use of fertilizers. Considering that in this area drinking water sources (wells) are located, this study highlights an analytic method for delineation wellhead protection zones. All these approaches were incorporated in a useful GIS decision support system that aids decision makers in the difficult task of protection groundwater resources. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: A total number of 48 seawater and sediment samples were taken from 8 stations (each site 6 times with an interval time of 2 weeks) between June and September 2014. Seawater and sediment samples were collected from 30 cm under the surface samples and different sediment depths (0, 4, 7, 10, 15, and 20 cm) respectively, along the Persian Gulf in Bushehr coastal areas. Results: Based on the results, the average numbers of bacterial indicators including total coliform, fecal coliform, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as HPC in seawater samples were 1238.13, 150.87, 8.22 MPN/100 ml and 1742.91 CFU/ ml, respectively, and in sediment samples at different depths (from 0-20 cm) varied between 25 x 10(3) to 51.67 x 10(3), 5.63 x 10(3) to 12.46 x 10(3), 17.33 to 65 MPN/100 ml, 36 x 10(3) to 147.5 x 10(3) CFU/ml, respectively. There were no statistically significant relationships between the indicator organism concentration levels with temperature as well as pH value of seawater. A reverse correlation was found between the level of indicator bacteria and salinity of seawater samples. Also results revealed that the sediment texture influenced abundance of indicators bacteria in sediments. As the concentration levels of indicators bacteria were higher in muddy sediments compare with sandy ones. Conclusion: Result conducted Bushehr coastal sediments constitute a reservoir of indicator bacteria, therefore, whole of the indicators determined were distinguished to be present in higher levels in sediments than in the overlying seawater. It was concluded that the concentration levels of microbial indicators decreased with depth in sediments. Except total coliform, the numbers of other bacteria including fecal coliform, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and HPC bacteria significantly declined in the depth between 10 and 15 cm.

Yet understanding the influence of water quality on zooplankton under field-conditions is hindered by traditional labor-intensive approaches that are prone to incomplete or uncertain taxonomic determinations. Here, for the first time, an eco-genomic approach, based on genetic diversity in the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) region of DNA of zooplankton was used to develop a site-specific, water quality criterion (WQC) for ammonia (NH3). Ammonia has been recognized as a primary stressor in the catchment of the large, eutrophic Tai Lake, China. Nutrients, especially NH3 and nitrite (NO3-) had more significant effects on structure of the zooplankton community than did other environmental factors. Abundances of rotifers increased along a gradient of increasing concentrations of total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), while abundances of copepods and cladocera decreased. A novel, rapid, species sensitivity distribution (SSD) approach based on operational taxonomic units (OTUs) was established to develop a WQC for NH3. The WQC based on OTUs was consistent with the WQC based on the traditional morphology taxonomy approach. This genetics-based SSD approach could be a useful tool for monitoring for status and trends in species composition and deriving ecological criteria and an efficient biomonitoring tool to protect local aquatic ecosystems in virtually any aquatic ecosystem.

The study lasted for almost two years and was aimed at assessing the impact of the SSB on the fauna of the Argen River, which is a tributary of Lake Constance. Two sampling sites were examined up- and downstream of the SSB effluent. A combination of different diagnostic methods (fish embryo test with the zebrafish, histopathology, micronucleus test) was applied to investigate health impairment and genotoxic effects in indigenous fish as well as embryotoxic potentials in surface water and sediment samples of the Argen River, respectively, in samples of the SSB effluent. In addition, sediment samples from the Argen River and tissues of indigenous fish were used for chemical analyses of 33 frequently occurring pollutants by means of gas chromatography. Furthermore, the integrity of the macrozoobenthos community and the fish population were examined at both investigated sampling sites. Results: The chemical analyses revealed a toxic burden with trace substances (originating from traffic and waste water) in fish and sediments from both sampling sites. Fish embryo tests with native sediment and surface water samples resulted in various embryotoxic effects in exposed zebrafish embryos (Fig. 1). In addition, the health condition of the investigated fish species (e.g., severe alterations in the liver and kidney) provided clear evidence of water contamination at both Argen River sites (Fig. 2). At distinct points in time, some parameters (fish development, kidney and liver histopathology) indicated stronger effects at the sampling site downstream of the SSB effluent than at the upstream site. Conclusions: Our results clearly showed that the SSB cannot be assigned as the main source of pollutants that are released into the investigated Argen River section. Moreover, we showed that there is moderate background pollution with substances originating from waste waters and traffic which still should be taken seriously, particularly with regard to the impairment of fish health at both investigated field sites. Since the Argen is a tributary of Lake Constance, our results call for a management plan to ensure and improve the river's ecological stability.																	2190-4715					MAR 6	2017	29								10	10.1186/s12302-017-0108-y								WOS:000397614400002	28316899

Zach			Recent advances on iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles as sorbents of organic pollutants in water and wastewater treatment	REVIEWS ON ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH												The constant growth in population worldwide over the past decades continues to put forward the need to provide access to safe, clean water to meet human needs. There is a need for cost-effective technologies for water and wastewater treatment that can meet the global demands and the rigorous water quality standards and at the same maximizing pollutant efficiency removal. Current remediation technologies have failed in keeping up with these factors without becoming cost-prohibitive. Most recently, nanotechnology has been sought as the best alternative to increase access to water supplies by remediating those already contaminated and offering ways to access unconventional sources. The use of iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles as nanoadsorbents has led way to a new class of magnetic separation strategies for water treatment. This review focuses on highlighting some of the most recent advances in core-shell iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles and nanocomposites containing iron oxide nanoparticles currently being developed for water and wastewater treatment of organic pollutants. We discuss the novelty of these novel materials and the insight gained from their advances that can help develop cost-effective reusable technologies for scale-up and commercial use.																	0048-7554	2191-0308				MAR	2017	32	1-2			SI		111	117		10.1515/reveh-2016-0063								WOS:000396033300015	28231068

However, improving the quality of water should include spreading awareness to the public regarding the importance of cleaning their household water tanks. The aim of this study was to investigate the microbial quality of water of household water tanks in Dubai. The water samples from household water tanks were collected from forty houses, and a questionnaire was given to the residents to determine the history of the water tanks. The membrane filtration technique was used to quantify heterotrophic and total coliform bacteria on plate count agar and the violet red bile agar respectively. The overall results of this study have shown that 18 out of total 40 household water tanks contained different types of bacteria concentration level beyond local and widely accepted international standards. The overall results of this study indicated that there is a lack of awareness among residents regarding the importance of maintaining proper sanitation and hygiene of the household water tanks.

Simulation of groundwater quality parameters using ANN and ANN+ PSO models (Case study: Ramhormoz Plain)	POLLUTION												One of the main aims of water resource planners and managers is to estimate and predict the parameters of groundwater quality so that they can make managerial decisions. In this regard, there have many models developed, proposing better management in order to maintain water quality. Most of these models require input parameters that are either hardly available or time-consuming and expensive to measure. Among them, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Models, inspired from human brain, are a better choice. The present study has simulated the groundwater quality parameters of Ramhormoz Plain, including Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR), Electrical Conductivity (EC), and Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), via ANN and ANN+ Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Models and at the end has compared their results with the measured data. The input data for TDS quality parameter is consisted of EC, SAR, pH, SO4, Ca, Mg, and Na, while for SAR, it includes TDS, pH, Na, and Hco(3), and as for EC, it involves So(4), Ca, Mg, SAR, and pH; all of them, gathered from 2009 to 2015. Results indicate that the highest prediction accuracy for SAR, EC, and TDS is related to the ANN + PSO model with the tangent sigmoid activation function so that both MAE and RMSE statistics have the minimum and R-2 the maximum value for the model. Also the highest prediction accuracy is respectively related to EC, TDS, and SAR parameters. Considering the high efficiency of artificial neural network model, by training the PSO algorithm, it can be used in order to make managerial decisions and ensure monitoring and cost reduction results.																	2383-451X	2383-4501				SPR	2017	3	2					191	200		10.7508/pj.2017.02.003								WOS:000414861900003

Assessment of surface water pollution in urban and industrial areas of Savar Upazila, Bangladesh	POLLUTION												The present study has been conducted to determine the surface water quality of urban area in Savar, Dhaka, Bangladesh by determining some water quality parameters (Transparency, Temperature, pH, EC, Eh, DO, TSS, TDS, TS, BOD5(,) COD, TOC, Cl-, Br-, SO4-2, NO3-, NO2-, PO4-3, TP, HCO3- and Total alkalinity) as well as the status of phytoplankton's community in the water from two lakes (Tiger Lake and AERE Lake) and one canal (Karnapara Canal). The water quality of the AERE Lake is better than the Tiger Lake and the Karnapara Canal. Organic Pollution Index (OPI) demonstrates that water bodies are severely polluted by organic matters in the study area. R mode Cluster Analysis (CA) reveals that the water bodies are polluted and the common sources of pollutants are anthropogenic (industrial, agricultural, municipal sewerage). The Principle Component Analysis/ Factor Analysis (PCA/FA) identifies two dominant factors, responsible for data structure, explaining 100% of total variance in the data set. The PCA agrees with CA, suggesting that multiple anthropogenic sources are responsible for the surface water quality deterioration in this area. The present study reflects the actual scenario of surface water quality of Savar urban area, thus will be helpful for the policy planers and makers to take proper management and abatement strategies for the sustainable management of water resources in urban areas of Bangladesh.																	2383-451X	2383-4501				SPR	2017	3	2					243	259		10.7508/pj.2017.02.007								WOS:000414861900007

Physico-chemical and bacteriological characterization of surface water in Djendjen River (North Eastern Algeria)	POLLUTION												Djendjen River is one of the largest rivers in the region of Jijel (Algeria). Human activities such as urban discharges, industrial, agricultural, and livestock have significant effects on the quality of water. The present study attempts to evaluate the quality of water along the banks of the Djendjen River at different sampling sites, using physico-chemical and bacteriological methods. The collected samples are analyzed per standard method parameters and measured in situ. The mean values of the physicochemical parameters of the river water samples are consistently lower than the levels, certified by the Algerian standard (exept for pH and PO43-). The total and fecal coliform surpasses the Algerian standard limits (0 cfu/100 ml) at all sites, signifying that without treatment the water is unsuitable for human consumption. Results reveal that water quality of the Djendjen River is generally affected by the anthropogenic activities, taking place along its banks. The moderate organic pollution (OPI=2-2.6) and high faecal contamination (MQI=3-3.25) of water in the study area has adverse impacts on the environment and public health, which requires a combined treatment (biological and physicochemical).																	2383-451X	2383-4501				SPR	2017	3	2					261	272		10.7508/pj.2017.02.008								WOS:000414861900008						
J	Pham, TL				Pham, T. L.			Comparison between Water Quality Index (WQI) and biological indices, based on planktonic diatom for water quality assessment in the Dong Nai River, Vietnam	POLLUTION												The present study aims to have a comparative study of the results, from biological monitoring as well as conventional method, based on physico-chemical variables. Water quality index (WQI) and planktonic diatom metrics have been used to determine water quality and ecological conditions of the Dong Nai River (DNR) and Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) to find out the main environmental variables that regulate the phytoplankton community. A total of 51 planktonic diatom species, belonging to 23 genera, have been identified during the study period. Fragillaria was the most dominant diatom in the upper course site, while the Aulacoseira was the most dominant species in the middle and lower ones. One-way ANOVA showed that the mean of turbidity, ammonium, nitrate, and phosphate were significantly different (P<0.05) among upper, middle, and lower course sites in both dry and wet seasons. The WQI showed that water quality in the Dong Nai River was classified in medium level at all sites, while water quality varied from good, moderate, to low level, based on the Biological Diatom Index (BDI) values. CCA indicated that nutrients (PO43-, NO3-, NH4+) and turbidity were the most important factors, regulating the variation in structure of the planktonic community. In this study, the BDI has been applied for the first time to biomonitor water quality in Vietnam. The sensitivity of the BDI to environmental stressors, supported the use of this index to bio-monitor surface water in tropical regions.																	2383-451X	2383-4501				SPR	2017	3	2					311	323		10.7508/pj.2017.02.012								WOS:000414861900012						
J	Ha, M; Wu, M				Ha, Miae; Wu, May			Land management strategies for improving water quality in biomass production under changing climate	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The Corn Belt states are the largest corn-production areas in the United States because of their fertile land and ideal climate. This attribute is particularly important as the region also plays a key role in the production of bioenergy feedstock. This study focuses on potential change in streamflow, sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus due to climate change and land management practices in the South Fork Iowa River (SFIR) watershed, Iowa. The watershed is covered primarily with annual crops (corn and soybeans). With cropland conversion to switchgrass, stover harvest, and implementation of best management practices (BMPs) (such as establishing riparian buffers and applying cover crops), significant reductions in nutrients were observed in the SFIR watershed under historical climate and future climate scenarios. Under a historical climate scenario, suspended sediment (SS), total nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) at the outlet point of the SFIR watershed could decrease by up to 56.7%, 32.0%, and 16.5%, respectively, compared with current land use when a portion of the cropland is converted to switchgrass and a cover crop is in place. Climate change could cause increases of 9.7% in SS, 4.1% in N, and 7.2% in P compared to current land use. Under future climate scenarios, nutrients including SS, N, and P were reduced through land management and practices and BMPs by up to 54.0% (SS), 30.4% (N), and 7.1% (P). Water footprint analysis further revealed changes in green water that are highly dependent on land management scenarios. The study highlights the versatile approaches in landscape management that are available to address climate change adaptation and acknowledged the complex nature of different perspectives in water sustainability. Further study involving implementing landscape design and management by using long-term monitoring data from field to watershed is necessary to verify the findings and move toward watershed-specific regional programs for climate adaptation.																	1748-9326					MAR	2017	12	3							034015	10.1088/1748-9326/aa5f32								WOS:000413801700001

The new Caribbean Nitrogen Index to assess nitrogen dynamics in vegetable production systems in southwestern Puerto Rico	INTERNATIONAL SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION RESEARCH												Nutrient loss from agricultural fields is one of the main factors influencing surface-and ground-water quality. Typical fertilizer nitrogen (N) consumption rates in vegetable production systems and horticultural crops in Puerto Rico fluctuate between 112 and 253 kg N/ha. The nitrogen use efficiency of vegetable crops is low, increasing the potential for nitrogen losses and high residual soil nitrate content. Quantification of residual soil N and N losses to the environment can be a difficult task. Simulation models such as the USDA-ARS N Index can be used to identify the relative magnitude of varying N-loss pathways and to identify best management practices. Field studies were conducted to quantify residual soil N and crop N removal, and to validate the Nitrogen Index in onion, tropical pumpkin and tomato production systems in the Lajas Valley in southwestern Puerto Rico. Relationships between observed and simulated values were determined to examine the capability of the model for evaluating N losses. There was good correlation between observed and predicted values for residual soil N (r = 0.88) and crop N removal (r = 0.99) (p < 0.05). In the production systems evaluated, the N volatilization losses ranged from 1 to 4 kg N/ha, the denitrification losses ranged from 18 to 46 kg N/ha, the leaching losses ranged from 155 to 779 kg N/ha, and the residual soil nitrate ranged from 64 to 401 kg N/ha. The N use efficiency ranged from 15% to 39%. The results obtained showed that the Nitrogen Index tool can be a useful tool for evaluating N transformations in vegetable production systems of Puerto Rico's semi-arid zone.																	2095-6339					MAR	2017	5	1					69	75		10.1016/j.iswcr.2017.01.001								WOS:000413330100009

Olive Mill Waste Water Risk Assessment Based on GIS Techniques in Crete, Greece	GLOBAL NEST JOURNAL												Water resources are subjected to different pollution sources. Point source water pollution of surface water is an important issue when considering the limited surface water availability as well as the potential knock-on effects of this pollution on human health as well as habitat and land degradation. One of the main point sources of water pollution is Olive Mill Waste Water (OMWW). OMWW is the liquid by-product generated during olive oil production. However, there is no standardized method to assess the risk of water pollution by OMWW for any given river basin. This research addressed the above issue by designing a detailed quantitative risk assessment methodology, which utilizes Geographic Information System (GIS) modeling to classify within a watershed individual sub-catchment risk of water pollution occurring from olive mill waste discharges. The research presents the proposed criteria and calculations required to estimate sub-catchment risk significance and comments on the potential of the method for wider application. This research combines elements from risk assessment frameworks, Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA), and GIS. MCA helped in aggregating different aspects and elements associated with this environmental problem, while GIS modeling tools helped in obtaining many criterion values and providing insight into how different objects interact in nature and how these interactions influence risk at the watershed level. The proposed method was tested in the Keritis watershed in Crete, Greece, where OMWW is one of the main stressors influencing water quality, and the results indicated that this method has the potential to be a useful guide to prioritize risk management actions and mitigation measures to be incorporated in River Basin Management Plans.

Seasonal variation in ground water quality and its suitability for drinking and agriculture -a case study in Kancheepuram region, Tamil Nadu, India	GLOBAL NEST JOURNAL												In the present study an attempt has been made to assess the seasonal ground water quality variations at Kancheepuram region, Tamil Nadu, India. In order to evaluate the seasonal ground water quality for drinking and irrigation purposes, 68 groundwater well data were collected and analyzed for various physico-chemical parameters such as electrical conductivity (EC), pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), total hardness (TH), Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, SO42-, HCO3- and F-. Nine parameters viz., pH, TDS, TH, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, SO42-, HCO3- and F- were used to calculate the Water Quality Index (WQI) using weighted arithmetic index for drinking purpose. EC and Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR) were the two important indicators used to assess the irrigation water quality. Mapping was done to examine the spatial distribution of water quality parameters using Geographical Information System (GIS). From the analysis, more than half of the samples record good water quality whereas only 1% falls under unsuitable category for drinking purpose. Approximately 33% of samples falls under poor quality for drinking. In terms of irrigation, the salinity hazard occurs in 23 to 42% of sampling locations depicting the uncertainty towards agricultural production in the study region. From the study, it is observed that the water quality is highly degraded where Industrialization and urbanization took place when compared to areas where agriculture is being practiced. Hence, suitable measures to ameliorate the pollution effect of urbanization and industrializations are suggested.																	1790-7632					MAR	2017	19	1					131	139										WOS:000409253800010

Membrane bioreactor (MBR), integration of membrane and biological processes, is regarded as alternative method due to its high quality of effluent. Coagulants are often added into a bioreactor to comply with the rigid standard of phosphorus. Addition of a lot of coagulants have potential adverse effects on MBR performance such as membrane fouling and low removal efficiency. Therefore, this study attempted to investigate the impact on microorganism or membrane permeability when polyaluminium chloride (PAC) was added for phosphorus removal. In batch test, addition of PAC with lower basicity interfered with biological decomposition of organic matters. When the selected PAC with the highest basicity (71%) was employed in continuous MBR, the process showed stable TMP and high-quality treated water due to no negative effect on microorganism.

These conditions of Namgang Dam led to the growth of Salix subfragilis communities. Initially, they were distributed over small areas but over time, they rapidly proliferated to cover large areas. They generate large amounts of leaf debris particularly in the dry season, so that water quality could be deteriorated. And, in the flood season, they raise water levels by obstructing the water flow in tributary streams, this consequently leads to flooding damages. In addition, Salix subfragilis periodically undergoes self-thinning and the withered trunks and branches turn into driftwood. These problems pose difficulties to dam management. By the way, these communities began to wither in areas lower than the highest water level, after a long-term period of inundation in 2012. To determine the reason for the withering phenomena in this study, the relationship between water level(turbidity) and the withering of Salix subfragilis in dam reservoir was investigated, and the withering characteristics of Salix subfragilis communities were analyzed through aerial photographys and field surveys. Results of this study show that disruption of photosynthesis due to high turbidity during the long-term inundation is what was caused their withering.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				SPR	2017					79		70	74		10.2112/SI79-015.1								WOS:000403856800015

The thermal effluent is mixed with sea water and diffused to Youngil Bay. At the beginning of the 1990s, the thermal effluent affects brackish water zone of Hyeongsan River and Youngil Bay and becomes a main cause of red tide in this sea area, which starts to occur from January. Besides, the thermal effluent also affects coastal sea water quality and ecosystem raising the surrounding sea water temperature. In this study, we figured out the present circumstances and problems in the brackish water zone of Hyeongsan River estuary and Youngil Bay, which resulted from the thermal effluent in winter season. We also found out the cause of red tide on the basis of 8 measured categories on site, such as temperature, salinity, DO, COD, TN, TP, chlorophyll-a, and flow velocity, and performed a numerical analysis using the measured data to precisely investigate the occurrence mechanism of red tide. The results show that intrusion range of saline wedge in the lower layer of water depth is reduced in summer season because of increased river discharge, however, the river water and thermal effluent is diffused to Youngil Bay forming a typical estuary front with stratified condition. On the contrary, in winter season, a constant vertical density distribution, resulting from a strong mixing of the upper and lower water layers, is formed at downstream of the thermal effluent outlet. However, a thermohaline front, developing a less denser distribution than that developed in the strong mixing area, is formed at downstream of the strong mixing area. The formation of thermohaline front induces flow stagnation in Youngil Bay and subsequently obstructs river discharge to Youngil Bay. Thus, a mass of chlorophyll-a is bred by the thermal effluent and consequently a red tide.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				SPR	2017					79		174	178		10.2112/SI79-036.1								WOS:000403856800036

However, numerous accidents occur on the eastern coast because of the topographical characteristics of the beach, and most accidents are caused by rip currents. Additionally, in the summer, as many tourists prefer beaches near swash zones, exposure to non-point pollutant sources can occur, significantly harming the health of visitors. Enterococci have shown the strongest correlation to gastrointestinal symptoms in a study examining the relationship between swimming-associated gastrointestinal illness and microorganisms. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency found a direct relationship between the density of E. coli and enterococci in surface waters and increased swimmer-associated gastroenteritis. These reports suggest that E. coli and enterococci can be used as bacterial indicators compared to total coliform. Therefore, in this study, the safety of beach seawater was evaluated using E. coli and enterococci as bacterial indicators. Enterococcus and E. coli were isolated during the summer holiday season from the Gyeongpo Beach located on the eastern coast of Korea. The results indicated that the source of pollution near a swash zone, where people are crowded, was larger than that at the dry beach and near swimming zone.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				SPR	2017					79		249	253		10.2112/SI79-051.1								WOS:000403856800051
