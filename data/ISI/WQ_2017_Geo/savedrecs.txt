Prediction of storm transfers and annual loads with data-based mechanistic models using high-frequency data	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Excess nutrients in surface waters, such as phosphorus (P) from agriculture, result in poor water quality, with adverse effects on ecological health and costs for remediation. However, understanding and prediction of P transfers in catchments have been limited by inadequate data and over-parameterised models with high uncertainty. We show that, with high temporal resolution data, we are able to identify simple dynamic models that capture the P load dynamics in three contrasting agricultural catchments in the UK. For a flashy catchment, a linear, second-order (two pathways) model for discharge gave high simulation efficiencies for short-term storm sequences and was useful in highlighting uncertainties in out-of-bank flows. A model with non-linear rainfall input was appropriate for predicting seasonal or annual cumulative P loads where antecedent conditions affected the catchment response. For second-order models, the time constant for the fast pathway varied between 2 and 15 h for all three catchments and for both discharge and P, confirming that high temporal resolution data are necessary to capture the dynamic responses in small catchments (10-50 km(2)). The models led to a better understanding of the dominant nutrient transfer modes, which will be helpful in determining phosphorus transfers following changes in precipitation patterns in the future.

Legacy sediment, lead, and zinc storage in channel and floodplain deposits of the Big River, Old Lead Belt Mining District, Missouri, USA	GEOMORPHOLOGY												The Old Lead Belt of southeastern Missouri was one of the leading producers of Pb ore for more than a century (1869-1972). Large quantities of contaminated mine waste have been, and continue to be, supplied to local streams. This study assessed the magnitude and spatial distribution of mining-contaminated legacy sediment stored in channel and floodplain deposits of the Big River in the Ozark Highlands of southeastern Missouri. Although metal concentrations decline downstream from the mine sources, the channel and floodplain sediments are contaminated above background levels with Pb and Zn along its entire 171-km length below the mine sources. Mean concentrations in floodplain cores >2000 mg kg(-1) for Pb and >1000 mg kg(-1) for Zn extend 40-50 km downstream from the mining area in association with the supply of fine tailings particles that were easily dispersed downstream in the suspended load. Mean concentrations in channel bed and bar sediments ranging from 1400 to 1700 mg kg(-1) for Pb extend 30 km below the mines, while Zn concentrations of 1000-3000 mg kg(-1) extend 20 km downstream. Coarse dolomite fragments in the 2-16 mm channel sediment fraction provide significant storage of Pb and Zn, representing 13-20% of the bulk sediment storage mass in the channel and can contain concentrations of >4000 mg kg(-1) for Pb and >1000 mg kg(-1) for Zn. These coarse tailings have been transported a maximum distance of only about 30 km from the source over a period of 120 years for an average of about 250 m/y. About 37% of the Pb and 9% of the Zn that was originally released to the watershed in tailings wastes is still stored in the Big River. A total of similar to 157 million Mg of contaminated sediment is stored along the Big River, with 92% of it located in floodplain deposits that are typically contaminated to depths of 1.5-3.5 m. These contaminated sediments store a total of 188,549 Mg of Pb and 34,299 Mg of Zn, of which 98% of the Pb and 95% of the Zn are stored in floodplain deposits. Most of the metal mass in channel deposits is stored near the mines, with 72% of the Pb and 78% of the Zn occurring in the 25 km of channel proximal to the mine source. Although environmental assessments of streams contaminated by mines often focus on evaluating metal concentrations in the geochemically active fine sediment fractions, about 60% of the Pb stored in channels is associated with coarse dolomite tailings fragments deposited in channels within 25 km of the mines. The magnitude and basinwide distribution of Pb and Zn storage in legacy floodplain sediments ensures that remobilization by bank erosion will be a continuing problem for water quality far into the future.

Additionally, these fluxes are seldom measured, hindering critical evaluation of model output. Analysis of the Canadian Small Lake Model (CSLM), a one-dimensional integral lake model, was performed to assess its ability to reproduce diurnal and seasonal variations in heat fluxes and the sensitivity of simulated fluxes to changes in model parameters, i.e., turbulent transport parameters and the light extinction coefficient (K-d). A C++ open-source software package, Problem Solving environment for Uncertainty Analysis and Design Exploration (PSUADE), was used to perform sensitivity analysis (SA) and identify the parameters that dominate model behavior. The generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) was applied to quantify the fluxes' uncertainty, comparing daily-averaged eddy-covariance observations to the output of CSLM. Seven qualitative and two quantitative SA methods were tested, and the posterior likelihoods of the modeled parameters, obtained from the GLUE analysis, were used to determine the dominant parameters and the uncertainty in the modeled fluxes. Despite the ubiquity of the equifinality issue - different parameter-value combinations yielding equivalent results-the answer to the question was unequivocal: K-d, a measure of how much light penetrates the lake, dominates sensible and latent heat fluxes, and the uncertainty in their estimates is strongly related to the accuracy with which K-d is determined. This is important since accurate and continuous measurements of K-d could reduce modeling uncertainty.																	1027-5606	1607-7938				DEC 14	2017	21	12					6345	6362		10.5194/hess-21-6345-2017								WOS:000417943600002

However, these wetland ecosystems are dependent on local climate and hydrology, and are therefore at risk due to climate and land use change. This study develops site-specific empirical hydrologic models for five forested wetlands with different characteristics by analyzing long-term observed meteorological and hydrological data. These wetlands represent typical cypress ponds/swamps, Carolina bays, pine flatwoods, drained pocosins, and natural bottomland hardwood ecosystems. The validated empirical models are then applied at each wetland to predict future water table changes using climate projections from 20 general circulation models (GCMs) participating in Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project 5 (CMIP5) under the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. We show that combined future changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration would significantly alter wetland hydrology including groundwater dynamics by the end of the 21st century. Compared to the historical period, all five wetlands are predicted to become drier over time. The mean water table depth is predicted to drop by 4 to 22 cm in response to the decrease in water availability (i.e., precipitation minus potential evapotranspiration) by the year 2100. Among the five examined wetlands, the depressional wetland in hot and humid Florida appears to be most vulnerable to future climate change. This study provides quantitative information on the potential magnitude of wetland hydrological response to future climate change in typical forested wetlands in the southeastern US.

Response of water temperatures and stratification to changing climate in three lakes with different morphometry	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Water temperatures and stratification are important drivers for ecological and water quality processes within lake systems, and changes in these with increases in air temperature and changes to wind speeds may have significant ecological consequences. To properly manage these systems under changing climate, it is important to understand the effects of increasing air temperatures and wind speed changes in lakes of different depths and surface areas. In this study, we simulate three lakes that vary in depth and surface area to elucidate the effects of the observed increasing air temperatures and decreasing wind speeds on lake thermal variables (water temperature, stratification dates, strength of stratification, and surface heat fluxes) over a century (19112014). For all three lakes, simulations showed that epilimnetic temperatures increased, hypolimnetic temperatures decreased, the length of the stratified season increased due to earlier stratification onset and later fall overturn, stability increased, and longwave and sensible heat fluxes at the surface increased. Overall, lake depth influences the presence of stratification, Schmidt stability, and differences in surface heat flux, while lake surface area influences differences in hypolimnion temperature, hypolimnetic heating, variability of Schmidt stability, and stratification onset and fall overturn dates. Larger surface area lakes have greater wind mixing due to increased surface momentum. Climate perturbations indicate that our larger study lakes have more variability in temperature and stratification variables than the smaller lakes, and this variability increases with larger wind speeds. For all study lakes, Pearson correlations and climate perturbation scenarios indicate that wind speed has a large effect on temperature and stratification variables, sometimes greater than changes in air temperature, and wind can act to either amplify or mitigate the effect of warmer air temperatures on lake thermal structure depending on the direction of local wind speed changes.

Here, we present a proof-of-concept study of a "lab in the field" called the "River Lab" (RL), based on the idea of permanently installing a suite of laboratory instruments in the field next to a river. Housed in a small shed, this set of instruments performs analyses at a frequency of one every 40 min for major dissolved species (Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cl-, SO42-, NO3- )through continuous sampling and filtration of the river water using automated ion chromatographs. The RL was deployed in the Orgeval Critical Zone Observatory, France for over a year of continuous analyses. Results show that the RL is able to capture long-term fine chemical variations with no drift and a precision significantly better than conventionally achieved in the laboratory (up to +/- 0.5% for all major species for over a day and up to 1.7% over 2 months). The RL is able to capture the abrupt changes in dissolved species concentrations during a typical 6-day rain event, as well as daily oscillations during a hydrological low-flow period of summer drought. Using the measured signals as a benchmark, we numerically assess the effects of a lower sampling frequency (typical of conventional field sampling campaigns) and of a lower precision (typically reached in the laboratory) on the hydrochemical signal. The highresolution, high-precision measurements made possible by the RL open new perspectives for understanding critical zone hydro-bio-geochemical cycles. Finally, the RL also offers a solution for management agencies to monitor water quality in quasi-real time.

In order to evaluate its effect, the hydrogeological parameters including groundwater quality and major dissolved components were investigated. The water quality was measured four times in the field, and 74 of 163 samples that showed the high conductivity value of more than 500 mu S/cm and the influence of seawater on the groundwater were analyzed by Cl-/HCO3- molar ratio. The results showed that, 40 samples out of 74 were found to have a value of 2.8 or more, indicating severe and very severe effects. According to the type of groundwater quality, the ratio of samples belonging to Na-Cl type, which is considered to be influenced by the direct seawater, is 35.3% for bedrock groundwater and 52.5% for weathered zone and alluvial groundwater. In the evolution stage of groundwater due to seawater infiltration, the type of Ca-Cl prior to the Na-Cl type is 44.1% in bedrock groundwater and 45% in weathered zone and alluvial groundwater. The effect of sea water on the aquifer is likely to be influenced by distance from the shore, pumped water, and tide.																	1225-6692	2287-4518				DEC	2017	38	7					570	580		10.5467/JKESS.2017.38.7.570								WOS:000424527800010

GI-Waterway is the first artificial waterway, 18 km long and 80 m wide, which connects the West Sea with the Han River, and seawater and freshwater are introduced in the waterway to control water quality condition since September 2011. The electric conductivity at the monitoring well, M-19, close to the waterway is affected by the surface water salinity in the waterway. Hydrogeochemical type of groundwater changes from Ca(Mg)HCO3 into Cl_SO4 type through Ca(Mg) Cl(SO4) type. The result of injection test by using an injection well shows that the average decreasing effect of 49.9% in electric conductivity is acquired just after the injection and the effect is maintained fairly well for several days at the monitoring wells and especially it is predominant in sand layer below about 15 m in depth.																	0435-4036	2288-7377				DEC	2017	53	6					805	817		10.14770/jgsk.2017.53.6.805								WOS:000424418800005

Anthropogenic Phosphorus Inputs to a River Basin and Their Impacts on Phosphorus Fluxes Along Its Upstream-Downstream Continuum	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												The increasing trend in riverine phosphorus (P) loads resulting from anthropogenic inputs has gained wide attention because of the well-known role of P in eutrophication. So far, however, there is still limited scientific understanding of anthropogenic P inputs and their impacts on riverine flux in river reaches along the upstream-to-downstream continuum. Here we investigated P budgets in a series of nested watersheds draining into Hongze Lake of China and developed an empirical function to describe the relationship between anthropogenic inputs and riverine P fluxes. Our results indicated that there are obvious gradients regarding P budgets in response to changes in human activities. Fertilizer application and food and feed P import was always the dominant source of P inputs in all sections, followed by nonfood P. Further interpretation using the model revealed the processes of P loading to the lake. About 2%-9% of anthropogenic P inputs are transported from the various sections into the corresponding tributaries of the river systems, depending upon local precipitation rates. Of this amount, around 41%-95% is delivered to the main stem of the Huai River after in-stream attenuation in its tributaries. Ultimately, 55%-86% of the P loads delivered to different locations of the main stem are transported into the receiving lake of the downstream, due to additional losses in the main stem. An integrated P management strategy that considers the gradients of P loss along the upstream-to-downstream continuum is required to assess and optimize P management to protect the region's freshwater resource.					zhang, wangshou/0000-0001-9473-4555												2169-8953	2169-8961				DEC	2017	122	12					3273	3287		10.1002/2017JG004004								WOS:000423221300011

Water Quality Index (WQI), descriptive statistics, Hurst exponent, fractal dimension and predictability index were estimated for each water parameter. WQI results showed that majority of samples fall in moderate category during 2005-2013, but monitoring site four falls under severe category (water unfit for domestic use). Brownian time series behaviour (a true random walk nature) exists between calcium (Ca2+) and electric conductivity (EC); magnesium (Mg2+) with EC; sodium (Na+) with EC; sulphate (SO42-) with EC; total dissolved solids (TDS) with chloride (Cl-) during pre-(2005-2013) and post-(2006-2013) monsoon season. These parameters have a closer value of Hurst exponent (H) with Brownian time series behaviour condition (H = 0.5). The result of times series analysis of water quality data shows a persistent behaviour (a positive autocorrelation) that has played a role between Cl-and Mg2+, Cl-and Ca2+, TDS and Na+, TDS and SO42-, TDS and Ca2+ in pre- and post-monsoon time series because of the higher value of H (> 1). Whereas an anti-persistent behaviour (or negative autocorrelation) was found between Cl-and EC, TDS and EC during pre-and post-monsoon due to low value of H. The work outline shows that the groundwater of few areas needs treatment before direct consumption, and it also needs to be protected from contamination.

The importance and widespread use of petroleum products and the threats posed by these products on surface water resources in Iran necessitates the access to numerical hydrodynamic and water quality simulation models with appropriate capabilities. Simulation the fate and transport of VOC in both flowing and standing water bodies is a fairly complex problem. In this research, CE-QUAL-W2 model is modified to simulate the fate and transport of VOC [i.e., Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), benzene] in standing and flowing water bodies. The performance of the modified CE-QUAL-W2 model is evaluated in a MTBE pollution spill at Khalife-Tarkhan river along the headwaters of Gheshlagh reservoir, Kordestan, Iran. The results show the modified CE-QUAL-W2 model's capability to depict the spatial and temporal variation of MTBE in comparison with recorded data from MTBE spill event of Gheshlagh reservoir. Based on the simulation results of modified CE-QUAL-W2 model, reservoir cleanup time in different meteorological and hydrological scenarios is evaluated. The results show Gheshlagh reservoir cleanup time reduced in scenarios that included air temperature reduction, wind speed increasing, and high inflow condition.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				DEC	2017	76	23							803	10.1007/s12665-017-7108-5								WOS:000418850500003

Groundwater vulnerability mapping for a sub-catchment of the Rio La Venta watershed, Chiapas, Mexico	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Karst systems are particularly vulnerable to overexploitation and pollution due to their high hydraulic conductivity and points of rapid infiltration that allow quick influx of runoff and pollutants into the aquifer. The sustainability of non-contaminated groundwater in these systems is imperative for both humans and groundwater-dependent ecosystems. An important practice in managing groundwater sustainability involves assessing aquifer vulnerability. This study created the first groundwater vulnerability map (GVM) for a sub-catchment of the Rio La Venta watershed in Chiapas, Mexico, using an adaptation of the hazard-pathway-target method. This project also conducted the first tracer study in the Rio la Venta watershed to establish connectivity between the catchment and the Rio La Venta Canyon. Finally, this study evaluated the results of the GVM through a sensitivity analysis. Results of the GVM clearly demarcate areas of very high, high, moderate, and low vulnerability within the study area most of which being classified as low vulnerability. The zones of high vulnerability were successfully validated through two dye tracer tests that measured rapid groundwater flow velocities. With the limited resources available to land managers in this area, a problem common in many developing countries, tools that quickly and inexpensively highlight areas that require special protection to help maintain or improve water quality in their watersheds have great utility. Conveying this information to land managers and policymakers can lead to potential changes in current land use practices and allow for the reallocation of resources in support of reducing future negative human-landscape interactions.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				DEC	2017	76	23							797	10.1007/s12665-017-7113-8								WOS:000418850500004

The majority of the population uses groundwater from shallow, rudimentary dug wells and also surface water from the Mapunda River, which crosses the city. The city has very poor systems for collecting domestic sewage and household wastes. The majority of domestic sewage is dumped directly into the Mapunda River or in pit latrines. In this study, the surface water quality and groundwater quality were assessed. In surface water, the low oxygen contents are related to the high temperature (T) in the warm rainy season and with high contents of oxygen-consuming organic pollution and nutrients, as shown by PCA, in both seasons. Anoxic conditions, with negative ORP values (-55.7 mV), are caused by oxygen-consuming organic pollution, added with low flow regime during the dry, cold season. The very low ecological quality of the surface water is also indicated by the high contents of -PO4 and -Cl-t (up to 2.00 and 0.44 mg L-1, respectively). The phosphate contamination is higher in the warm rainy season, due to higher run-off and higher T, as expressed by PCA, both in river water and groundwater. Most groundwater sampling points are contaminated with nitrate (contents up to 132 mg L-1). The pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), alkalinity, -Clt and K, determined in the surface water reflect the anthropic contribution to the river water. The variations in water bulk parameters (T, TDS, alkalinity, ORP, DO) and chemical species are indicative of pollution by diffuse sources (N-species, phosphates). The PCA shows that non-point sources such as the free discharge of household wastewater, intense laundering in the river, agriculture and animal grazing are the main contributors to low water quality, associated with seasonality and low contents of dissolved oxygen due to its consumption by organic matter. The multivariate analysis allows the evaluation of the changes in water quality, in fast-growing cities where the climate has a clear seasonality.

J	Jung, HB				Jung, Hun Bok			Nutrients and Heavy Metals Contamination in an Urban Estuary of Northern New Jersey	GEOSCIENCES												The Newark Bay Estuary in northern New Jersey contains one of the largest urban wetland complexes in the United States, but the majority of the wetlands and habitats have been lost due to urbanization and industrialization. Field and laboratory research was conducted to understand the impacts of human activities on the biogeochemistry of nutrients and heavy metals in the urban estuary. Concentrations of dissolved nutrients such as nitrate, ammonia, and phosphate were higher in the Hackensack River than in the Passaic River or the Newark Bay, while the Hackensack River was more deficient in dissolved oxygen. Sediment oxygen demand and mobilization of nutrients were higher in sediments with higher organic matter content as a result of microbial decomposition of organic matter. Heavy metals (Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn) and organic matter were more enriched in finer sediment grains such as silt and clay. There were positive correlations among heavy metals as well as organic matter in sediments. The results suggest that fine grained sediments, which can be readily suspended and transported during tidal cycles, may play a significant role in biogeochemical cycling of nutrients and heavy metals in the urban estuary. It appears that the current sources of nutrients and heavy metals in the water and sediment of the Newark Bay Estuary are mainly domestic effluents from sewage treatment plants during non-storm periods as well as combined sewer overflows during storm events, but further research including more frequent and pervasive water and sediment quality monitoring during dry and wet periods is needed.

Gogi region, Karnataka, India was chosen as the study area due to the effect of the presence of medium-grade uranium deposits. An integrated approach including the concentration of major ions, trace elements and uranium was employed to investigate the quality of groundwater. Totally, 367 groundwater samples were collected periodically from 52 wells distributes over the Gogi region and the parameters such as pH, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids (TDS), Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, Cl-, SO42-, NO3(-), Zn, Pb, Cu, and uranium of groundwater were analysed. Spatial distribution maps of various chemical constituents were prepared using geographic information system and its temporal variation was plotted in box and whisker plot. The analytical data were compared with Bureau of Indian Standards and World Health Organisation standards to determine drinking water quality and parameters such as salinity hazard, alkalinity hazard and percent sodium were estimated to assess the irrigation quality. Multivariate statistical analysis by cluster analysis was also performed which results in two groups consisting of wells with unsuitable water for drinking purposes. Groundwater in about 15% of the sampling wells were found to be unsuitable for domestic purpose based on TDS and about 17% were unsuitable based on uranium concentration. Finally, integration of spatial variation in TDS and uranium reveals that about 25% of the wells were unsuitable for domestic purposes. It is suggested that such an integrated approach needs to be formulated considering major ions, trace elements and radioactive elements for proper assessment of water quality. Implementation of managed aquifer recharge structures in the study area is suggested since it would potentially reduce the concentration of ions.

River temperature modelling: A review of process-based approaches and future directions	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												River temperature has a major influence on biophysical processes in lotic environments. River temperature is expected to increase due to climate change, with potentially adverse consequences for water quality and ecosystems. Consequently, a better understanding of the drivers of river temperature space-time variability is important for developing adaptation strategies. However, existing river temperature archives are often of low resolution or short timespans, and the analysis of patterns or trends can therefore be difficult. In light of these limitations, researchers have increasingly used models to generate river temperature estimates suitable for addressing fundamental and applied questions in river science. Of these models, process-based approaches are well suited to helping improve knowledge of the mechanisms controlling river temperature, because of their ability to explore the energy (and water) fluxes responsible for temperature patterns. While process-based modelling approaches can often be more data intensive than their statistical counterparts, they offer significant advantages with regard to simulating the impacts of projected land-use or climate change, and can provide valuable insights for informing the development of statistical models at larger scales. However, a wide range of process-based river temperature models exist, and choosing the most appropriate model for a given investigation requires careful consideration. In this paper, we review the foundations of process-based river temperature modelling and critically evaluate the features and functionality of existing models with a view to helping river scientists better understand their utility. In conclusion, we discuss key considerations and limitations of currently available process-based models and advocate directions for future research. We hope that this review will enable river researchers and managers to make informed decisions regarding model selection and spur the continued refinement of process-based temperature models for addressing fundamental and applied questions in the river sciences.

Accordingly, the monitoring of the groundwater quality based on different tools and methods becomes a necessity. The aim of this study was to apply several approaches to assess the water quality and to define the main hydrochemical process which affect groundwater of the Maritime Djeffara shallow aquifer. In addition to the hydrochemical approach, two multivariate statistical analyses, hierarchical clusters analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA), were carried out to identify the natural and the anthropogenic processes affecting groundwater chemistry. Hydrochemical approach, based on 47 analyzed groundwater samples, shows that most of samples present a sulfate to mixed chloride, with sodi-potassic tendency facies. According to their chemically composition, the HCA revealed three different groups (C1, C2 and C3) according to their electrical conductivity (EC) values: C1 (average EC = 4500 mu S/cm), C2 (average EC = 7040 mu S/cm) and C3 (average EC = 9767 mu S/cm). Furthermore, PCA results show two principal factors account 84.05% of the total variance: (1) F1 represents the natural component, and (2) F2 symbolizes the anthropic component. Moreover, the groundwater quality map of the Maritime Djeffara shows three categories: suitable, doubtful and unsuitable water for irrigation. These different results should be taken to protect water resources in arid and semiarid regions, especially at the alluvial coastal regions. Also, they help to make a suitable planning to manage and protect the groundwater resources.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				DEC	2017	76	24							821	10.1007/s12665-017-7168-6								WOS:000418851700018

Combined hydrochemical, isotopic, and multivariate statistics techniques to assess the effects of discharges from a uranium mine on water quality in neighboring streams	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The Caldas Uranium Mine (CUM), located on the Pocos de Caldas Plateau in the southeastern region of Brazil, is presently undergoing a decommissioning process. The aim of the present investigation is to identify and characterize the effects of acid mine drainage (AMD) originating from the CUM on surface water quality. To achieve these aims, sampling stations were located at two AMD sources: the retention pond at the foot of waste rock pile#4 (WRP#4) and the settling pond that receives effluents from the tailings dam (TD). Ten additional sampling stations were located along watercourses in the vicinity, both downstream and upstream of the mine. Sampling was performed during the rainy and dry seasons in 2010 and 2011. The water analysis detected significant changes in pH, electrical conductivity, F-, Cd, U, Zn, Al, Mn, As, Ca, -SO4 2-, Pb, U-238, Ra-226, Pb-210, Th-232, Ra-228, and Mo in waters downstream of both pond discharge sites. It was demonstrated that the disequilibrium between Ra-226 and U-238 can be used to trace the extent of AMD impacts in nearby streams. Variations in O-18 and H-2 enabled the flow of mining-impacted water to be traced from the ponds to nearby streams. Multivariate analysis yielded a three-factor model: Factor 1 was interpreted as being associated with AMD (from WRP# 4) and Factor 2 with a Ca-Mo relationship associated with the chemical constitution of the ore and with the treatment of tailings wastes in the area (from TD); Factor 3 was interpreted as being associated with the natural influence of geogenic processes on water quality in the area. The results of this study provide a scientific basis for recommending appropriate remedial actions during mine decommissioning.

This study aimed to assess NPS pollution loads of organic matter, nutrients, bacteria and heavy metals in four river catchments associated with different types of land use in Southern Brazil. Cluster analysis was used to identify similarities between basins and main component analysis (PCA) to identify the main variables that characterize diffuse pollution in each basin. The use and occupation of the soil were determinant in the formation of the clusters. The basins with rural characteristics formed one group, whereas the basin with urban characteristic generated another group. PCA suggests that changes in the water quality of the catchments in this study can be explained by organic pollutants and farming activities. The Rancho do Amaral catchment, with 55.8% of native forest, displayed the lowest NPS pollution load for all tested parameters. The Alto da Colina catchment, with the largest urban area and largest agricultural land use (50%), showed the highest NPS for all variables in the study, even though it has the smallest area. The differences in pollutant loads can be attributed to the intense degradation processes associated with anthropic activities, such as urbanization, agricultural activity and the discharge of effluents, which are different for each catchment.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				DEC	2017	76	24							833	10.1007/s12665-017-7111-x								WOS:000418851700005						
J	Reisch, CE				Reisch, Chad E.			Potential use of low-cost data loggers for groundwater temperature in a regulatory program for public water supply: impact of measurement frequency at a karst spring	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												A simple low-cost procedure for data collection and evaluation was developed to investigate the utility of continuous data loggers and the impact of measurement frequency on a water-quality monitoring method for use in a regulatory program for public water supply and groundwater under the direct influence of surface water (GWUDI). Data loggers were utilized to continuously measure groundwater temperature, descriptive statistics and the coefficient of variation to demonstrate rapid and significant variations. Temperature data were collected from a karst spring located in the Great Valley section of Pennsylvania and reported on daily and 15-min measurement frequencies. In response to five summer rain events, thermographs constructed with the 15-min measurements indicated rapid large-magnitude temperature variations. The average magnitude of change across the five events was 5.3 degrees C, but the shifts operated on quick timescales; thus, variations were not captured when data were reported on the daily frequency. This resulted in a distorted evaluation on how significant the groundwater temperature variations were, because results were dependent on measurement frequency. The average coefficient of variation percentage for the 15-min datasets was 12%, compared to 3% for the dataset of daily measurements. These findings could have important implications to a public water-supply regulatory program, because the regulatory definition for GWUDI includes those groundwater sources that display rapid and significant variations in water quality. Without high-frequency measurements, one alarming result could be that GWUDI sources, particularly those located in fast-acting hydrogeologic settings, are misevaluated when maximum or minimum water-quality variations are not included in the evaluation. Advancement in science and technology has resulted in data loggers for groundwater temperature that are economical, robust, and easy to install. Thus, their application in regulatory programs should no longer be underutilized, especially in karst spring settings where source construction deficiencies and focused recharge features can result in rain-induced rapid infiltration and waterquality variations on the minute-to-hour timescale.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				DEC	2017	76	24							813	10.1007/s12665-017-7164-x								WOS:000418851700014						
J	Awais, M; Arshad, M; Shah, SHH; Anwar-ul-Haq, M				Awais, Muhammad; Arshad, Muhammad; Shah, Syed Hamid Hussain; Anwar-ul-Haq, Muhammad			Evaluating groundwater quality for irrigated agriculture: spatio-temporal investigations using GIS and geostatistics in Punjab, Pakistan	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Groundwater is cornerstone of global food production, and its quality plays a vital role in crop development. Success of agriculture in Pakistan relies heavily on groundwater because of reduced surface water supplies and rainfalls. The current study was conducted to assess the spatio-temporal quality of groundwater in the Lower Chenab Canal (LCC) east area with emphasis on characterizing groundwater quality zones for irrigation applications. Groundwater samples from 289 observation wells were collected and chemically analyzed. A geostatistical approach using kriging interpolation was applied to express spatial variation and minimize estimation error in data. Three water quality parameters, electrical conductivity (EC), sodium absorption ratio (SAR), and residual sodium carbonate (RSC), were utilized to develop groundwater quality maps for two seasons including pre-monsoon and post-monsoon. To describe the spatial autocorrelation, suitable semivariogram models were identified and cross validated. The exponential model gave the best results for EC and RSC, whereas the spherical model was found to be the best fit for SAR. The overlay analysis was performed to create composite water quality maps according to which 40% LCC area is showing good groundwater quality for irrigation, 49% is exhibiting marginal quality, and 10% unsuitable during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. Groundwater quality is 100% good for Sultanpur irrigation subdivision, and only 3.75% is good for Paccadala subdivision. The results of the study may provide guidelines for the planners/policy makers to devise area-specific strategies for sustainable groundwater use.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				DEC	2017	10	23							510	10.1007/s12517-017-3280-x								WOS:000417834100006

Exploration of potential groundwater resources at Thuwal area, north of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, using remote sensing data analysis and geophysical survey	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												The study uses the applications of remote sensing in analyzing the main topographic features of the study area. The digital elevation model derived from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) satellite is used to devise spillway torrents and their tributaries of the different drainage basins in the study area. The digital rainfall data recorded by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) climate research satellite is used to determine places with the highest rainfall within the different drainage basins in the area. Other satellite data (e.g. Landsat-8) are used in identifying and studying the various geological structures in the study area, which intersect the spillway torrents. Such areas may allow seizure of large quantities of water as potential, close to the surface, groundwater (Quaternary) aquifer. Areas of potential hydrological traps have been identified and marked for further geophysical (geoelectrical) surveys. The geophysical studies helped in identifying the shallow geological structures and the thickness of the subsurface sediments. It also assists in determining the size of the groundwater aquifer and the water quality within these aquifers. The study showed a decline of freshwater aquifer in Quaternary sediments. The Tertiary groundwater aquifer is the most prevalent, where this appears normal saline aquifer. All the aquifers within the study area are being recharged from Quaternary sediments by rainwater. The cumulative annual precipitation rate increases in the South-East of the study area, specifically over Wadi Khulais and significantly drops to lower rainfall rates in the rest of the region. Running water permeates the Quaternary sediments, which in turn infiltrates and recharges the Tertiary aquifer. The salinity of the latter depends mostly on the nature of its constituent rocky material.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				DEC	2017	10	23							509	10.1007/s12517-017-3295-3								WOS:000417834100009

Conceptual modelling of E. coli in urban stormwater drains, creeks and rivers	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Accurate estimation of faecal microorganism levels in water systems, such as stormwater drains, creeks and rivers, is needed for appropriate assessment of impacts on receiving water bodies and the risks to human health. The underlying hypothesis for this work is that a single conceptual model (the MicroOrganism Prediction in Urban Stormwater model-i.e. MOPUS) can adequately simulate microbial dynamics over a variety of water systems and wide range of scales; something which has not been previously tested. Additionally, the application of radar precipitation data for improvement of the model performance at these scales via more accurate areal averaged rainfall intensities was tested. Six comprehensive Escherichia coli (E. coli) datasets collected from five catchments in south-eastern Australia and one catchment in Raleigh, USA, were used to calibrate the model. The MOPUS rainfall runoff model performed well at all scales (Nash-Sutcliffe E for instantaneous flow rates between 0.70 and 0.93). Sensitivity analysis showed that wet weather urban stormwater flows can be modelled with only three of the five rainfall runoff model parameters: routing coefficient (K), effective imperviousness (IMP) and time of concentration (TOC). The model's performance for representing instantaneous E. coli fluctuations ranged from 0.17 to 0.45 in catchments drained via pipe or open creek, and was the highest for a large riverine catchment (0.64); performing similarly, if not better, than other microbial models in literature. The model could also capture the variability in event mean concentrations (E = 0.17-0.57) and event loads (E = 0.32-0.97) at all scales. Application of weather radar-derived rainfall inputs caused lower overall performance compared to using gauged rainfall inputs in representing both flow and E. coli levels in urban drain catchments, with the performance improving with increasing catchment size and being comparable to the models that use gauged rainfall inputs at the large riverine catchment. These results demonstrate the potential of the MOPUS model and its ability to be applied to a wide range of catchment scales, including large riverine systems.

J	Nukazawa, K; Kihara, K; Suzuki, Y				Nukazawa, Kei; Kihara, Kousuke; Suzuki, Yoshihiro			Negligible contribution of reservoir dams to organic and inorganic transport in the lower Mimi River, Japan	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Rivers fulfill an essential ecological role by forming networks for material transport from upland forests to coastal areas. The way in which dams affect the organic and inorganic cycles in such systems is not well understood. Herein, we investigated the longitudinal profiles of the various components of the water chemistry across three cascade dams in Japan: the Yamasubaru Dam, Saigou Dam, and Ohuchibaru Dam, which are situated along the sediment-productive Mimi River in different flow conditions. We analyzed the following water quality components: suspended solids (SS), turbidity, total iron (TFe), dissolved iron (DFe), total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), humic substance (HS), and major ionic components (Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cl-, NO3-, and SO42-) in the downstream channels of the three dams during the low-intermediate-flow and high-flow events from 2012 to 2014. We estimated hourly loads of each component using hourly turbidity data and discharge data (i.e., L-Q model) separately, and the results are integrated to estimate the annual fluxes. The annual fluxes between the methods were compared to verify predictability of the conventional L-Q models. Annual flux of TOC, TN, DFe, and HS estimated by the turbidity displayed similar values, whereas the flux of SS, TFe, and TP tended to increase downstream of the dams. Among the dams, estimated flux proportions for TP and TFe were higher during high-flow events (74%-94%). Considering geographic conditions (e.g., absence of major tributary between the dams), the result implies that accumulated TP and TFe in the reservoirs may be flushed and transported downstream with SS over the short height dams during flood events. Assuming this process, the reservoir dams probably make only a fractional contribution to the organic and inorganic transport in the catchment studied. The percent flux errors for SS, TFe, and TP fluxes ranged from -7.2% to -97% (except for the TP flux in 2013), which highlights the risk of underestimating these components when using an L-Q model.

Vadose zone processes delay groundwater nitrate reduction response to BMP implementation as observed in paired cultivated vs. uncultivated potato rotation fields	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Nitrate leaching from crop production contributes to groundwater contamination and subsequent eutrophication of the receiving surface water. A study was conducted in a 7-ha potato-grain-forages rotation field in Prince Edward Island (PEI), Canada during 2011-2016 to link potato rotation practices and groundwater quality. The field consists of fine sandy loam soil and is underlain by 7-9 m of glacial till, which overlies the regional fractured "red-bed" sandstone aquifer. The water table is generally located in overburden close to the bedrock interface. Field treatments included one field zone taken out of production in 2011 with the remaining zones kept under a conventional potato rotation. Agronomy data including crop tissue, soil, and tile-drain water quality were collected. Hydrogeology data including multilevel monitoring of groundwater nitrate and hydraulic head and data from rock coring for nitrate distribution in overburden and bedrock matrix were also collected. A significant amount of nitrate leached below the soil profile after potato plant kill (referred to as topkill) in 2011, most of it from fertilizer N. A high level of nitrate was also detected in the till vadose zone through coring in December 2012 and through multilevel groundwater sampling from January to May 2014 in both cultivated and uncultivated field zones. Groundwater nitrate concentrations increased for about 2.5 years after the overlying potato field was removed from production. Pressure-driven uniform flow processes dominate water and nitrate transport in the vadose zone, producing an apparently instant water table response but a delayed groundwater quality response to nitrate leaching events. These data suggest that the uniform flow dominated vadose zone in agricultural landscapes can cause the accumulation of a significant amount of nitrate originated from previous farming activities, and the long travel time of this legacy nitrate in the vadose zone can result in substantially delayed responses of groundwater quality to field management adjustments. The delayed effects should also apply to the transport of other contaminants. This study also suggests that management practices should be optimized to reduce soil nitrate build-up during the non-growing season (when plant N uptake is diminishing and the soil contains excessive moisture, for example, after the potato harvest period in PEI) in order to protect groundwater quality.

However, the factors behind increased hypolimnetic anoxia in lakes and reservoirs are often diverse and may involve processes at different spatial and temporal scales. Here, we evaluate the combined effects of different anthropogenic pressures on the oxygen dynamics and water chemistry of Lake Enol, an emblematic mountain lake in Picas de Europa National Park (NW Spain). A multidisciplinary study conducted over a period of four years (2013-2016) indicates that the extent and duration of hypolimnetic anoxia has increased dramatically in recent years. The extent and duration of hypolimnetic anoxia is typical of meso-eutrophic systems, in contrast with the internal productivity of the lake, which remains oligo-mesotrophic and phosphorus-limited. This apparent contradiction is ascribed to the combination of different external pressures in the catchment, which have increased the input of allochthonous organic matter in recent times through enhanced erosion and sediment transport. The most important among these pressures appears to be cattle grazing, which affects not only the import of carbon and nutrients, but also the lake microbiology. The contribution of clear-cutting, runoff channelling, and tourism is comparatively less significant. The cumulative effects of these local human impacts are not only affecting the lake metabolism, but also the import of sulfate, nitrate- and ammonium-nitrogen, and metals (Zn). However, these local factors alone cannot explain entirely the observed oxygen deficit. Climatic factors (e.g., warmer and drier spring and autumn seasons) are also reducing oxygen levels in deep waters through a longer and increasingly steep thermal stratification. Global warming may indirectly increase anoxia in many other mountain lakes in the near future. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Spatial and temporal replicability of meteoric and in situ Be-10 concentrations in fluvial sediment	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Cosmogenic isotopes, short-lived radionuclides, elemental concentrations and thermochronometric indicators are measured in river sand to quantify erosion rates and trace sediment sources, and/or infer erosional processes. Interpretations of detrital sediment analyses are often based on the rarely tested assumption of time-invariant tracer concentration. A better understanding of when and where this assumption breaks down and what sampling strategies minimize temporal and small-scale spatial variance will improve science done using detrital river sediment. Here, we present new and previously published spatial and temporal replicates measured for in situ and meteoric Be-10 (Be-10(i) and Be-10(m), respectively). Our new data include 113 replicate pairs, taken from agricultural and/or tectonically active watersheds in China months to millennia apart and spatial replicates taken up to 2 km apart on the same day. The mean percentage difference is 10% (-122% to 150%) for both systems considered together; the mode is close to 0% for both systems; and 36% of pairs of samples replicate within our analytical accuracy at 2 sigma. We find that Be-10(i) replicates better than Be-10(m) (p < 0.01). Be-10(i) replicability is worse in steeper basins, suggesting that stochastic processes (i.e. landslides) affect reproducibility. Be-10(m) replicability is worse in larger basins, suggesting non-conservative behavior of Be-10(m) as sediment moves downstream. Our results are consistent with the few previously published replicate studies. Considering all replicate data in a wide range of landscapes, in areas with deep erosional processes, replicability is poor; in other areas, replicability is good. This suggests that, in steep, tectonically active, and/or agricultural landscapes, individual detrital sediment measurements do not represent upstream rates as well as larger populations of samples. To ensure that measurements are representative of the upstream watershed, our data suggest that samples be amalgamated either over time or from several places close by in the same channel.

Simulation of Daily Flow Pathways, Tile-Drain Nitrate Concentrations, and Soil-Nitrogen Dynamics Using SWAT	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Tile drainage significantly alters flow and nutrient pathways and reliable simulation at this scale is needed for effective planning of nutrient reduction strategies. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) has been widely utilized for prediction of flow and nutrient loads, but few applications have evaluated the model's ability to simulate pathway-specific flow components or nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) concentrations in tile-drained watersheds at the daily time step. The objectives of this study were to develop and calibrate SWAT models for small, tile-drained watersheds, evaluate model performance for simulation of flow components and NO3-N concentration at daily intervals, and evaluate simulated soil-nitrogen dynamics. Model evaluation revealed that it is possible to meet accepted performance criteria for simulation of monthly total flow, subsurface flow (SSF), and NO3-N loads while obtaining daily surface runoff (SURQ), SSF, and NO3-N concentrations that are not satisfactory. This limits model utility for simulating best management practices (BMPs) and compliance with water quality standards. Although SWAT simulates the soil N-cycle and most predicted fluxes were within ranges reported in agronomic studies, improvements to algorithms for soil-N processes are needed. Variability in N fluxes is extreme and better parameterization and constraint, through use of more detailed agronomic data, would also improve NO3-N simulation in SWAT.

Evaluation of Existing and Modified Wetland Equations in the SWAT Model	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												The ability to accurately simulate flow and nutrient removal in treatment wetlands within an agricultural, watershed-scale model is needed to develop effective plans for meeting nutrient reduction goals associated with protection of drinking water supplies and reduction of the Gulf of Mexico hypoxic zone. The objectives of this study were to incorporate new equations for wetland hydrology and nutrient removal in Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), compare model performance using original and improved equations, and evaluate the ramifications of errors in watershed and tile drain simulation on prediction of NO3-N dynamics in wetlands. The modified equations produced Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency values of 0.88 to 0.99 for daily NO3-N load predictions, and percent bias values generally less than 6%. However, statistical improvement over the original equations was marginal and both old and new equations provided accurate simulations. The new equations reduce the model's dependence on detailed monitoring data and hydrologic calibration. Additionally, the modified equations increase SWAT's versatility by incorporating a weir equationand an irreducible nutrient concentration and temperature coefficient. Model improvements enhance the utility of SWAT for simulating flow and nutrients in wetlands and other impoundments, although performance is limited by the accuracy of inflow and NO3-N predictions from the contributing watershed.

To explore this balance, we developed a multi-objective decision support system for allocating BMP type and placement by coupling the Soil and Water Assessment Tool with a nondominated sorted genetic algorithm that minimizes total phosphorus (TP) yields from agricultural hydrologic response units (HRUs) and costs, while using stakeholder BMP familiarity as a constraint; conventional tillage, no tillage, nutrient management, riparian buffers, and contour cropping were explored. Using constraints representing current conditions, the optimization resulted in 59.6 to 81.0% reduction in agricultural TP yield from HRUs at costs ranging between US $0.8 and US $5.3 million. The constrained optimization tended to select mostly single BMPs or at most two BMPs for a given HRU due to these BMPs having higher acceptability to stakeholders. In contrast, the unconstrained case, representing full familiarity, selected 2- and 3-BMP applications. There was little difference in costs between the constrained and unconstrained cases below an 80% TP yield reduction; however, significant differences were found at larger reductions, supporting the value of stakeholder education and extension efforts.

We used the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to investigate how natural gas development could impact streamflow and sediment, total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorous (TP) loadings in the upper Delaware River Basin (DRB), a relatively undeveloped watershed of 7,950km(2) that lies above the Marcellus Shale formation. If gas development was permitted, our projections show the DRB could experience development of over 600 well pads to extract natural gas at build out, which, with supporting infrastructure (roads, gathering pipelines), could convert over 5,000ha from existing land uses in the study area. In subbasins with development activity we found sediment, TN, and TP yields could increase by an average of 15, 0.08, and 0.03kg/ha/yr, respectively (an increase of 2, 3, and 15%, respectively) for each one percent of subbasin land area converted into natural gas infrastructure. At the study area outlet on the Delaware River at Port Jervis, New York, we found increases in the annual average streamflow and sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus loads of up to 0.01, 0.2, 0.2, and 1%, respectively, for a rapid development year, and 0.08, 1.3, 2.0, and 11%, respectively, for the full development scenario.

Specifically, the three accompanying studies describe the water quality implications of adopting the three biofuel-cropping systems via large-scale conversion of cropland or targeting to marginal lands for three smaller watersheds located in the western or eastern Corn Belt, or across the Upper Mississippi and Ohio-Tennessee River Basins. Other results such as climate change related impacts for two eastern Corn Belt watersheds are also discussed. These studies are supported by the CenUSA Bioenergy coordinated agricultural project funded by the USDA to develop a regional system for producing cellulosic biofuels. A description of the evolving federal policy related to cellulosic biofuel production and consumption is provided as are other potential drivers for encouraging the adoption of stover removal, switchgrass, and Miscanthus as perennial feedstocks. Findings from the SWAT studies and their implications for environmental and economic performance in their respective agroecosystems are discussed, and commonalities and divergences in results are identified. The potential for policy design to improve the performance of these systems based on the findings of these modeling studies, and continuing research needs and directions for improved policy design are discussed.

We quantify ecosystem services of bioenergy-based land use change and estimate the potential changes of ecosystem services due to climate change projections. We considered 17 bioenergy-based scenarios with Miscanthus, switchgrass, and corn stover as candidate bioenergy feedstock. Soil and Water Assessment Tool simulations of biomass/grain yield, hydrology, and water quality were used to quantify ecosystem services freshwater provision (FWPI), food (FPI) and fuel provision, erosion regulation (ERI), and flood regulation (FRI). Nine climate projections from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase-3 were used to quantify the potential climate change variability. Overall, ecosystem services of heavily row cropped Wildcat Creek watershed were lower than St. Joseph River watershed which had more forested and perennial pasture lands. The provision of ecosystem services for both study watersheds were improved with bioenergy production scenarios. Miscanthus in marginal lands of Wildcat Creek (9% of total area) increased FWPI by 27% and ERI by 14% and decreased FPI by 12% from the baseline. For St. Joseph watershed, Miscanthus in marginal lands (18% of total area) improved FWPI by 87% and ERI by 23% while decreasing FPI by 46%. The relative impacts of land use change were considerably larger than climate change impacts in this paper.

Assessment of Bioenergy Cropping Scenarios for the Boone River Watershed in North Central Iowa, United States	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Several biofuel cropping scenarios were evaluated with an improved version of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) as part of the CenUSA Bioenergy consortium for the Boone River Watershed (BRW), which drains about 2,370km(2) in north central Iowa. The adoption of corn stover removal, switchgrass, and/or Miscanthus biofuel cropping systems was simulated to assess the impact of cellulosic biofuel production on pollutant losses. The stover removal results indicate removal of 20 or 50% of corn stover in the BRW would have negligible effects on streamflow and relatively minor or negligible effects on sediment and nutrient losses, even on higher sloped cropland. Complete cropland conversion into switchgrass or Miscanthus, resulted in reductions of streamflow, sediment, nitrate, and other pollutants ranging between 23-99%. The predicted nitrate reductions due to Miscanthus adoption were over two times greater compared to switchgrass, with the largest impacts occurring for tile-drained cropland. Targeting of switchgrass or Miscanthus on cropland 2% slope or 7% slope revealed a disproportionate amount of sediment and sediment-bound nutrient reductions could be obtained by protecting these relatively small areas of higher sloped cropland. Overall, the results indicate that all biofuel cropping systems could be effectively implemented in the BRW, with the most robust approach being corn stover removal adopted on tile-drained cropland in combination with a perennial biofuel crop on higher sloped landscapes.

To address the water quality implications of increased biofuel production, biofuel scenarios were tested with a Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model revision featuring improved biofuel crop representation. Scenarios included corn stover removal and the inclusion of two perennial bioenergy crops, switchgrass and Miscanthus, grown on marginal lands (slopes >2% and erosion rates >2 t/ha) and nonmarginal lands. The SWAT model estimates show water quality is not very sensitive to stover removal. The perennial bioenergy crops reduce simulated sediment, nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) yields by up to 60%. Simulated sediment and P reductions in marginal lands were generally twice that occurring in the nonmarginal lands. The highest unit area reductions of N occurred in the less sloping tile-drained lands. Productivity showed corn grain yield was independent from stover removal, while yields of the two perennial bioenergy crops were similar in the marginal and nonmarginal lands. The results suggest planning for biofuel production in the Corn Belt could include the removal of stover in productive corn areas, and the planting of perennial bioenergy crops in marginal land and in low-sloped tile-drained areas characterized by high N pollution.

Assessing Parameter Uncertainty of a Semi-Distributed Hydrology Model for a Shallow Aquifer Dominated Environmental System	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												This paper examines the performance of a semi-distributed hydrology model (i.e., Soil and Water Assessment Tool [SWAT]) using Sequential Uncertainty FItting (SUFI-2), generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE), parameter solution (ParaSol), and particle swarm optimization (PSO). We applied SWAT to the Waccamaw watershed, a shallow aquifer dominated Coastal Plain watershed in the Southeastern United States (U.S.). The model was calibrated (2003-2005) and validated (2006-2007) at two U.S. Geological Survey gaging stations, using significant parameters related to surface hydrology, hydrogeology, hydraulics, and physical properties. SWAT performed best during intervals with wet and normal antecedent conditions with varying sensitivity to effluent channel shape and characteristics. In addition, the calibration of all algorithms depended mostly on Manning's n-value for the tributary channels as the surface friction resistance factor to generate runoff. SUFI-2 and PSO simulated the same relative probability distribution tails to those observed at an upstream outlet, while all methods (except ParaSol) exhibited longer tails at a downstream outlet. The ParaSol model exhibited large skewness suggesting a global search algorithm was less capable of characterizing parameter uncertainty. Our findings provide insights regarding parameter sensitivity and uncertainty as well as modeling diagnostic analysis that can improve hydrologic theory and prediction in complex watersheds.

Although riverbeds are known to attenuate nitrate, it is not known if large woody debris (LWD) can increase this ecosystem service through enhanced hyporheic exchange and streambed residence time. Over a year, we monitored the surface water and pore water chemistry at 200 points along a similar to 50 m reach of a lowland sandy stream with three natural LWD structures. We directly injected N-15-nitrate at 108 locations within the top 1.5 m of the streambed to quantify in situ denitrification, anammox and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia, which, on average, contributed 85, 10 and 5% of total nitrate reduction, respectively. Total nitrate reducing activity ranged from 0 to 16 A mu M h(-1) and was highest in the top 30 cm of the stream bed. Depth, ambient nitrate and water residence time explained 44% of the observed variation in nitrate reduction; fastest rates were associated with slow flow and shallow depths. In autumn, when the river was in spate, nitrate reduction (in situ and laboratory measures) was enhanced around the LWD compared with non-woody areas, but this was not seen in the spring and summer. Overall, there was no significant effect of LWD on nitrate reduction rates in surrounding streambed sediments, but higher pore water nitrate concentrations and shorter residence times, close to LWD, indicated enhanced delivery of surface water into the streambed under high flow. When hyporheic exchange is too strong, overall nitrate reduction is inhibited due to short flow-paths and associated high oxygen concentrations.

Danjiangkou Reservoir, the source reservoir for China's South-to-North Water Diversion Middle Route Project, suffers from total nitrogen pollution and threatens the water transfer to a number of metropolises including the capital, Beijing. To locate the main source of nitrogen pollution into the reservoir, especially near the Taocha canal head, where the intake of water transfer begins, we constructed a 3-D water quality model. We then used an inflow sensitivity analysis method to analyze the significance of inflows from each tributary that may contribute to the total nitrogen pollution and affect water quality. The results indicated that the Han River was the most significant river with a sensitivity index of 0.340, followed by the Dan River with a sensitivity index of 0.089, while the Guanshan River and the Lang River were not significant, with the sensitivity indices of 0.002 and 0.001, respectively. This result implies that the concentration and amount of nitrogen inflow outweighs the geographical position of the tributary for sources of total nitrogen pollution to the Taocha canal head of the Danjiangkou Reservoir.																	2095-0195	2095-0209				DEC	2017	11	4					609	619		10.1007/s11707-017-0650-3								WOS:000416164400002

This comprises a significant threat to potable water supplies and overall estuary ecosystem health. In this study, the environmental flows of the Modaomen Estuary, one of the estuaries of the Pearl River Delta in China, were determined based on the salinity demand of keystone species and the linear relationship between river discharge and estuarine salinity. The estimated minimum and optimal annual environmental flows in the Modaomen Estuary were 116.8 x 10(9) m(3) and 273.8 x 10(9) m(3), respectively, representing 59.3% and 139.0% of the natural runoff. Water quality assessments in recent years indicate that the environmental flows have not been satisfied most of the time, particularly the optimal environmental flow, despite implementation of various water regulations since 2005. Therefore, water regulations and wetland network recoveries based on rational environmental flows should be implemented to alleviate saltwater intrusion and for the creation of an ideal estuarine habitat.																	2095-0195	2095-0209				DEC	2017	11	4					670	681		10.1007/s11707-016-0609-9								WOS:000416164400007

However, their provisioning has been under the increasing pressure from both natural and socio-economic changes. This paper aims to assess the most significant hazards, such as water quality, nitrogen deposition, erosion, floods, invasive species, urbanisation and contaminated sites affecting delivery of ecosystem services in the Czech Republic. Using the multi-hazard assessment, the integrated risk index for ecosystem service provisioning was proposed. The spatial analysis based on this approach was then applied to the Czech Republic as a case study. The results showed that about 48% of the area falls into the very low risk category followed by 30%, 21%, and 1% for low, medium and high categories, respectively. Forest and wetland ecosystems were estimated to have the highest proportion of their total area among the highest risk values. Moreover, we found that the national parks appeared to have the highest proportion of medium- and high-risk classes among the natural areas. The approach presented in this study should aggregate the existing knowledge on ecosystem services and hazards and thus monitor the integrated risk. The results are intended to help with various planning and management decisions at both the national and regional levels and to bring more attention on the most problematic hot-spots.

On Tutuila, the main island of American Samoa, production wells in the most populated region (the Tafuna-Leone Plain) produce most of the island's drinking water. However, much of this water has been deemed unsafe to drink since 2009. Tutuila has three predominant anthropogenic non-point-groundwater-pollution sources of concern: on-site disposal systems (OSDS), agricultural chemicals, and pig manure. These sources are broadly distributed throughout the landscape and are located near many drinking-water wells. Water quality analyses show a link between elevated levels of total dissolved groundwater nitrogen (TN) and areas with high non-point-source pollution density, suggesting that TN can be used as a tracer of groundwater contamination from these sources. The modeling framework used in this study integrates land-use information, hydrological data, and water quality analyses with nitrogen loading and transport models. The approach utilizes a numerical groundwater flow model, a nitrogen-loading model, and a multi-species contaminant transport model. Nitrogen from each source is modeled as an independent component in order to trace the impact from individual land-use activities. Model results are calibrated and validated with dissolved groundwater TN concentrations and inorganic delta N-15 values, respectively. Results indicate that OSDS contribute significantly more TN to Tutuila's aquifers than other sources, and thus should be prioritized in future water-quality management efforts.																	1431-2174	1435-0157				DEC	2017	25	8					2419	2434		10.1007/s10040-017-1617-x								WOS:000415195900015

Rapid fluctuations in the northern Baltic Sea H2S layer	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is linked to water quality deterioration in the Baltic Sea, with widespread seafloor hypoxia. We examined the vertical and temporal variability of in situ [H2S], oxygen concentration ([O-2]), temperature (T) and pH at weekly, hourly and minute intervals at 13 locations in the western Gulf of Finland in 2013-2014. The main target was the 60-100 m water depth range, containing 3.2-290 mu M O-2 and 6.3-22.6 mu M H2S. Where gas was detected by acoustic surveys, the structure of the H2S layer was more complex compared to stations devoid of gas. Local minima and maxima in pH frequently occurred near the H2S upper boundary (redox transition zone). Except for the homogeneous, tranquil zone above the seafloor at some stations, substantial rapid changes in hydrographic conditions were common. Typically, a layer of marked temporal T variability was present atop or within the topmost H2S layers. The largest temporal changes over a weekly period were - 0.44 degrees C/-10.8 mu M H2S/-0.12 pH units (at seafloor level), + 0.18 degrees C/+7.9 mu M H2S between casts (1 h) and + 0.03 degrees C/-2.5 mu M H2S per minute (high resolution logging). Abrupt [H2S] changes were recorded at two stations with sediments containing free gas. The T and [H2S] changes were synchronous at several layers, reflecting water movement. We conclude that rapid changes occur in hydrographic conditions in the near-bottom H2S layer in the northern Baltic Sea, especially at locations where free gas is present in the underlying sediments.

J	Wang, CY; Chen, SS; Li, D; Wang, DN; Liu, W; Yang, J				Wang, Chongyang; Chen, Shuisen; Li, Dan; Wang, Danni; Liu, Wei; Yang, Ji			A Landsat-based model for retrieving total suspended solids concentration of estuaries and coasts in China	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT												Retrieving total suspended solids (TSS) concentration accurately is essential for sustainable management of estuaries and coasts, which plays a key role in the interaction between hydrosphere, pedosphere and atmosphere. Although many TSS retrieval models have been published, the general inversion method that is applicable to different field conditions is still under research. In order to obtain a TSS remote sensing model that is suitable for estimating TSS concentrations with wide range in estuaries and coasts by Landsat imagery, after reviewing a number of Landsatbased TSS retrieval models and improving a comparatively better one among them, this study developed a quadratic model using the ratio of logarithmic transformation of red band and near-infrared band and logarithmic transformation of TSS concentration (QRLTSS) based on 119 in situ samples collected in 2006-2013 from five regions of China. It was found that the QRLTSS model works well and shows a satisfactory performance. The QRLTSS model based on Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper), ETM+ (Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus) and OLI (Operational Land Imager) sensors explained about 72 % of the TSS concentration variation (TSS: 4.3-577.2 mg L-1, N = 84, P value < 0.001) and had an acceptable validation accuracy (TSS: 4.5-474 mg L-1, root mean squared error (RMSE) < 25 mg L-1, N = 35). In addition, a threshold method of red-band reflectance (OLI: 0.032, ETM+ and TM: 0.031) was proposed to solve the two-valued issue of the QRLTSS model and to retrieve TSS concentration from Landsat imagery. After a 6S model based atmospheric correction of Landsat OLI and ETM + imagery, the TSS concentrations of three regions (Moyangjiang River estuary, Pearl River estuary and Hanjiang River estuary) in Guangdong Province in China were mapped by the QRLTSS model. The results indicated that TSS concentrations in the three estuaries showed large variation ranging from 0.295 to 370.4 mg L-1. Meanwhile we found that TSS concentrations retrieved from Landsat imagery showed good validation accuracies with the synchronous water samples (TS S : 7-160 mg L-1, RMSE: 11.06 mg L-1, N = 22). The further validation from EO-1 Hyperion imagery also showed good performance (in situ synchronous measurement of TSS: 106-220.7 mgL(-1), RMSE: 26.66 mgL(-1), N = 13) of the QRLTSS model for the area of high TSS concentrations in the Lingding Bay of the Pearl River estuary. Evidently, the QRLTSS model is potentially applied to simulate high-dynamic TSS concentrations of other estuaries and coasts by Landsat imagery, improving the understanding of the spatial and temporal variation of TSS concentrations on regional and global scales. Furthermore, the QRLTSS model can be optimized to establish a regional or unified TS S retrieval model of estuaries and coasts in the world for different satellite sensors with medium- and high-resolution similar to Landsat TM, ETM + and OLI sensors or with similar red bands and near-infrared bands, such as ALI, HJ-1 A and B, LISS, CBERS, ASTER, ALOS, RapidEye, Kanopus-V, and GE.

J	Hartmann, A; Barbera, JA; Andreo, B				Hartmann, Andreas; Barbera, Juan Antonio; Andreo, Bartolome			On the value of water quality data and informative flow states in karst modelling	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												If properly applied, karst hydrological models are a valuable tool for karst water resource management. If they are able to reproduce the relevant flow and storage processes of a karst system, they can be used for prediction of water resource availability when climate or land use are expected to change. A common challenge to apply karst simulation models is the limited availability of observations to identify their model parameters. In this study, we quantify the value of information when water quality data (NO3- and SO42-) is used in addition to discharge observations to estimate the parameters of a process-based karst simulation model at a test site in southern Spain. We use a three-step procedure to (1) confine an initial sample of 500 000 model parameter sets by discharge and water quality observations, (2) identify alterations of model parameter distributions through the confinement, and (3) quantify the strength of the confinement for the model parameters. We repeat this procedure for flow states, for which the system discharge is controlled by the unsaturated zone, the saturated zone, and the entire time period including times when the spring is influenced by a nearby river. Our results indicate that NO3- provides the most information to identify the model parameters controlling soil and epikarst dynamics during the unsaturated flow state. During the saturated flow state, SO42- and discharge observations provide the best information to identify the model parameters related to groundwater processes. We found reduced parameter identifiability when the entire time period is used as the river influence disturbs parameter estimation. We finally show that most reliable simulations are obtained when a combination of discharge and water quality date is used for the combined unsaturated and saturated flow states.

Accordingly, many lakes are currently undergoing a systematic decline in water quality. Recent studies have highlighted that global warming and the subsequent changes in water use may further exacerbate eutrophication in lakes. Lake evolution depends strongly on hydrologic balance, and therefore on groundwater connectivity. Groundwater also influences the sensitivity of lacustrine ecosystems to climate and environmental changes, and governs their resilience. Improved characterization of groundwater exchange with lakes is needed today for lake preservation, lake restoration, and sustainable management of lake water quality into the future. In this context, the aim of the present paper is to determine if the future evolution of the climate, the population, and the recharge could modify the geochemistry of lakes (mainly isotopic signature and quality via phosphorous load) and if the isotopic monitoring of lakes could be an efficient tool to highlight the variability of the water budget and quality. ' Small groundwater-connected lakes were chosen to simulate changes in water balance and water quality expected under future climate change scenarios, namely representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. Contemporary baseline conditions, including isotope mass balance and geochemical characteristics, were determined through an intensive field-based research program prior to the simulations. Results highlight that future lake geochemistry and isotopic composition trends will depend on four main parameters: lo-cation (and therefore climate conditions), lake catchment size (which impacts the intensity of the flux change), lake volume (which impacts the range of variation), and lake G index (i.e., the percentage of groundwater that makes up total lake inflows), the latter being the dominant control on water balance conditions, as revealed by the sensitivity of lake isotopic composition. Based on these model simulations, stable isotopes appear to be especially useful for detecting changes in recharge to lakes with a G index of between 50 and 80 %, but response is non-linear. Simulated monthly trends reveal that evolution of annual lake isotopic composition can be dampened by opposing monthly recharge fluctuations. It is also shown that changes in water quality in groundwater-connected lakes depend significantly on lake location and on the intensity of recharge change.

Consequently, these flows ignore the inter-annual flow variability that rules species with longer lifecycles and therefore disregard the long-term perspective of the riverine ecosystem. We analyzed the importance of considering riparian requirements for the long-term efficiency of environmental flows. For that analysis, we modeled the riparian vegetation development for a decade facing different environmental flows in two case studies. Next, we assessed the corresponding fish habitat availability of three common fish species in each of the resulting riparian landscape scenarios. Modeling results demonstrated that the environmental flows disregarding riparian vegetation requirements promoted riparian degradation, particularly vegetation encroachment. Such circumstance altered the hydraulic characteristics of the river channel where flow depths and velocities underwent local changes of up to 10 cm and 40 cm s(-1), respectively. Accordingly, after a decade of this flow regime, the available habitat area for the considered fish species experienced modifications of up to 110 % when compared to the natural habitat. In turn, environmental flows regarding riparian vegetation requirements were able to maintain riparian vegetation near natural standards, thereby preserving the hydraulic characteristics of the river channel and sustaining the fish habitat close to the natural condition. As a result, fish habitat availability never changed more than 17 % from the natural habitat.

Chemical elements from 17 groundwater samples, 9 surface water samples (treated wastewater), and 14 soil samples were analyzed. Water facies analyses showed that both groundwater and surface water belong to the SO4-Cl class. However, the groundwater is characterized by high salinity (average value of 3547 mg/l), which may be result of the greater rock-water interaction and limited rainfall recharge. The NO3 values are also high in the groundwater samples (average value of 40 mg/l) and are mainly attributed to the agricultural practices in the study area. The surface water samples (treated wastewater from the plant) shows an average salinity value of 1232 mg/l and is better suited for irrigation purposes. Heavy elements analyzed in the soil samples show high concentrations of all the elements except Mn and Ni as compared to their background concentration. Enrichment factor and index of geoaccumulation calculated from the soil samples indicate that they are severely enriched with respect to Cd and Se. The spatial distribution maps were prepared based on kriging interpolation technique to estimate the concentrations of the analyzed elements at unknown locations. The treated wastewater in the study area is better suited for agricultural and domestic activities as compared to groundwater.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				NOV 17	2017	10	22							490	10.1007/s12517-017-3256-x								WOS:000415964600001						
J	Ahn, SR; Kim, SJ				Ahn, So Ra; Kim, Seong Joon			Assessment of integrated watershed health based on the natural environment, hydrology, water quality, and aquatic ecology	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Watershed health, including the natural environment, hydrology, water quality, and aquatic ecology, is assessed for the Han River basin (34 148 km(2)) in South Korea by using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The evaluation procedures follow those of the Healthy Watersheds Assessment by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Six components of the watershed landscape are examined to evaluate the watershed health (basin natural capacity): stream geomorphology, hydrology, water quality, aquatic habitat condition, and biological condition. In particular, the SWAT is applied to the study basin for the hydrology and water-quality components, including 237 sub-watersheds (within a standard watershed on the Korea Hydrologic Unit Map) along with three multipurpose dams, one hydroelectric dam, and three multifunction weirs. The SWAT is calibrated (2005-2009) and validated (2010-2014) by using each dam and weir operation, the flux-tower evapotranspiration, the time-domain reflectometry (TDR) soil moisture, and groundwater-level data for the hydrology assessment, and by using sediment, total phosphorus, and total nitrogen data for the water-quality assessment. The water balance, which considers the surface-groundwater interactions and variations in the stream-water quality, is quantified according to the sub-watershed-scale relationship between the watershed hydrologic cycle and stream-water quality. We assess the integrated watershed health according to the U.S. EPA evaluation process based on the vulnerability levels of the natural environment, water resources, water quality, and ecosystem components. The results indicate that the watershed's health declined during the most recent 10-year period of 2005-2014, as indicated by the worse results for the surface process metric and soil water dynamics compared to those of the 1995-2004 period. The integrated watershed health tended to decrease farther downstream within the watershed.

J	Magin, K; Somlai-Haase, C; Schafer, RB; Lorke, A				Magin, Katrin; Somlai-Haase, Celia; Schaefer, Ralf B.; Lorke, Andreas			Regional-scale lateral carbon transport and CO2 evasion in temperate stream catchments	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Inland waters play an important role in regional to global-scale carbon cycling by transporting, processing and emitting substantial amounts of carbon, which originate mainly from their catchments. In this study, we analyzed the relationship between terrestrial net primary production (NPP) and the rate at which carbon is exported from the catchments in a temperate stream network. The analysis included more than 200 catchment areas in southwest Germany, ranging in size from 0.8 to 889 km(2) for which CO2 evasion from stream surfaces and downstream transport with stream discharge were estimated from water quality monitoring data, while NPP in the catchments was obtained from a global data set based on remote sensing. We found that on average 13.9 g Cm(-2)yr(-1) (corresponding to 2.7% of terrestrial NPP) are exported from the catchments by streams and rivers, in which both CO2 evasion and downstream transport contributed about equally to this flux. The average carbon fluxes in the catchments of the study area resembled global and large-scale zonal mean values in many respects, including NPP, stream evasion and the carbon export per catchment area in the fluvial network. A review of existing studies on aquatic-terrestrial coupling in the carbon cycle suggests that the carbon export per catchment area varies in a relatively narrow range, despite a broad range of different spatial scales and hydrological characteristics of the study regions.

J	Yang, Y; Wu, JF; Wang, JG; Zhou, ZF				Yang, Yun; Wu, Jianfeng; Wang, Jinguo; Zhou, Zhifang			An Elitist Multiobjective Tabu Search for Optimal Design of Groundwater Remediation Systems	GROUNDWATER												This study presents a new multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA), the elitist multiobjective tabu search (EMOTS), and incorporates it with MODFLOW/MT3DMS to develop a groundwater simulation-optimization (SO) framework based on modular design for optimal design of groundwater remediation systems using pump-and-treat (PAT) technique. The most notable improvement of EMOTS over the original multiple objective tabu search (MOTS) lies in the elitist strategy, selection strategy, and neighborhood move rule. The elitist strategy is to maintain all nondominated solutions within later search process for better converging to the true Pareto front. The elitism-based selection operator is modified to choose two most remote solutions from current candidate list as seed solutions to increase the diversity of searching space. Moreover, neighborhood solutions are uniformly generated using the Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) in the bounded neighborhood space around each seed solution. To demonstrate the performance of the EMOTS, we consider a synthetic groundwater remediation example. Problem formulations consist of two objective functions with continuous decision variables of pumping rates while meeting water quality requirements. Especially, sensitivity analysis is evaluated through the synthetic case for determination of optimal combination of the heuristic parameters. Furthermore, the EMOTS is successfully applied to evaluate remediation options at the field site of the Massachusetts Military Reservation (MMR) in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. With both the hypothetical and the large-scale field remediation sites, the EMOTS-based SO framework is demonstrated to outperform the original MOTS in achieving the performance metrics of optimality and diversity of nondominated frontiers with desirable stability and robustness.																	0017-467X	1745-6584				NOV-DEC	2017	55	6					811	826		10.1111/gwat.12525								WOS:000419219600005	28493319

Borehole techniques have been widely used, but they are quite expensive, intrusive, and time consuming. The electrical resistivity method has proved very successful in groundwater assessment. This advanced technique uses the calculation of Dar-Zarrouk (D-Z) parameters, namely longitudinal unit conductance, transverse unit resistance, and longitudinal resistivity has been employed by using 50 vertical electrical sounding points to assess the groundwater and delineate the fresh-saline water interface over 1045 km(2) area of Khanewal in Southern Punjab of Pakistan. The x-y plots and maps of D-Z parameters were produced to establish a decipherable vision for the occurrence and distribution of different water-bearing formations of fresh-saline water aquifers through a complicated situation of intermixing of different resistivity ranges for fresh-saline water bodies. This technique is useful to reduce the ambiguity produced by the process of equivalence and suppression which cause intermixing in differentiating fresh, brackish, and saline aquifers during interpretation. The fresh-saline water interface is correlated very well with the previous studies of water quality analysis carried out in Khanewal area. The results suggest that the D-Z parameters are useful for demarcating different aquifer zones. The behavior and pattern of D-Z parameters with respect to occurrence and distribution of different water-bearing formations were effectively identified and delineated in the study area.																	0017-467X	1745-6584				NOV-DEC	2017	55	6					841	856		10.1111/gwat.12527								WOS:000419219600007	28498518

The following results were obtained. (1) The total non-carcinogenic risk values of 14 surface water samples were all lower than 1, which indicates that these surface water samples will not pose non-carcinogenic risk. Drinking water intake is the main exposure pathway of non-carcinogenic risk. (2) Among the 15 phreatic groundwater wells monitored, the total non-carcinogen levels at 6 points exceeded safe levels for children, which indicates that the local groundwater is harmful to children's health. The order of contaminants contributing to this risk is NO3-N > Mn > Fe > NH4-N > NO2-N. (3) Among the 29 points of confined groundwater monitoring wells, 2 points showed total non-carcinogenic risk values exceeding safe levels for children, which indicates that the local groundwater is unsafe to children health. The order of contaminants contributing to non-carcinogenic risk is NO3-N > Mn > Fe > NH4-N > NO2-N.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				NOV	2017	76	22							UNSP 761	10.1007/s12665-017-7097-4								WOS:000416820300019						
J	Sharifinia, M; Adeli, B; Nafarzadegan, AR				Sharifinia, Moslem; Adeli, Behzad; Nafarzadegan, Ali Reza			Evaluation of water quality trends in the Maroon River Basin, Iran, from 1990 to 2010 by WQI and multivariate analyses	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												This research aimed to investigate the long-term spatiotemporal changes of surface water quality of the Maroon River by implementing Water Quality Index (WQI) and multivariate statistical analyses such as non-metric multidimensional scaling and cluster analyses, as complementary tools to investigate spatial variations in water quality parameters and also delineate areas in terms of water quality conditions in the period under study. The other purposes of this study were to evaluate the physicochemical properties of the Maroon River water and assess the effects of each water quality parameter on the WQI values. Relationship between quality scale of hydrochemical parameters and the resulting WQI scores was determined employing linear regression analysis. Moreover, the suitability of water quality was evaluated for irrigation purposes using conventional indices, electrical conductivity (EC), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), and percent sodium (Na%). The monitoring stations were placed in high and very high categories according to the assessment of irrigation water quality with EC. Considering WQI, the upper (S1, S2, and S4) and lower (S3, S5, and S6) monitoring stations of the Maroon River distributed in category C3 (high salinity) and C4-C5 (very high salinity), respectively. The findings of WQI presented an increasing trend from upstream toward downstream in the Maroon River. The findings of the linear regression analysis showed no significant correlation between WQI scores with pH and SO42- concentrations even though the relationship is weak. These results suggest that pH and SO42- concentrations could be the secondary driving parameters behind the variations in WQI scores. It can be inferred that the Maroon River water is appropriate for irrigation based on Na% and SAR. However, it also exhibits high EC. Therefore, for mitigating the adverse impacts of polluted water authors recommend multidimensional management practices such as transferable discharge permit programs in the study area.

Direct groundwater discharge and vulnerability to hidden nutrient loads along the Great Lakes coast of the United States	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Direct groundwater discharge delivers nutrients from land and lakebed sediments to the Great Lakes, which impacts lake water quality. Broad spatial distributions of discharging groundwater are often difficult to measure directly. We present high resolution estimates of direct groundwater discharge across 43% of the Great Lakes coastline based on a water budget approach that uses hydroclimatic models and high-resolution hydrographic data available within the United States. We also integrate land use data to identify coastal areas vulnerable to high groundwater-borne nutrient loads. Estimated rates of direct groundwater discharge along the Great Lakes coast are highly variable, but generally are greatest for Lake Erie and Lake Michigan. Almost one-third of Lake Erie's United States coastline is vulnerable to groundwater sources of nutrients. To assess uncertainties and limitations in our vulnerability analysis, a vulnerable site along Lake Erie was selected for detailed field measurements of direct groundwater discharge rates and nutrient fluxes. Measured discharge rates were significantly lower than water budget-based estimates (354 +/- 25 m(3) y(-1) m(-1) compared to 588 +/- 181 m(3) y(-1) m(-1)). Dissolved phosphorous concentrations in the lakebed were elevated compared to onshore groundwater, while nitrate concentrations were lower, indicative of a highly reactive sediment-water interface. Some of the measured phosphorus may be locally sourced from desorption of legacy P or mineralization of organic matter in the lakebed, which our vulnerability framework does not include. Much of the land-derived nitrogen may be transformed along groundwater flow paths prior to discharge. While model-based estimates of direct groundwater discharge and vulnerability to nutrient loading are important for managing Great Lakes water quality, direct field observations remain essential for quantifying fluxes.

Specifically, a bespoke integrated model developed in previous studies has been modified in order to include the micropollutant assessment (namely, sulfamethoxazole - SMX). The model takes into account also the interactions between the three components of the system: sewer system (SS), wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and receiving water body (RWB). The analysis has been applied to an experimental catchment nearby Palermo (Italy): the Nocella catchment. Overall, five scenarios, each characterized by different uncertainty combinations of sub-systems (i.e., SS, WWTP and RWB), have been considered applying, for the sensitivity analysis, the Extended FAST method in order to select the key factors affecting the RWB quality and to design a reliable/useful experimental campaign. Results have demonstrated that sensitivity analysis is a powerful tool for increasing operator confidence in the modelling results. The approach adopted here can be used for blocking some non identifiable factors, thus wisely modifying the structure of the model and reducing the related uncertainty. The model factors related to the SS have been found to be the most relevant factors affecting the SMX modeling in the RWB when all model factors (scenario 1) or model factors of SS (scenarios 2 and 3) are varied. If the only factors related to the WWTP are changed (scenarios 4 and 5), the SMX concentration in the RWB is mainly influenced (till to 95% influence of the total variance for S-SMX,S-max) by the aerobic sorption coefficient. A progressive uncertainty reduction from the upstream to downstream was found for the soluble fraction of SMX in the RWB. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Swain, JB; Patra, KC				Swain, Janaki Ballav; Patra, Kanhu Charan			Streamflow estimation in ungauged catchments using regionalization techniques	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Continuous streamflow regionalization in ungauged catchments is contemplated as a challenging task. In a developing country like India where the subject of prediction in ungauged basins (PUB) is not prevalent, thirty-two catchments were specified in order to analyze continuous streamflow estimation. Spatial proximity (Inverse Distance Weighted, Kriging, and global mean), regression and physical similarity were the regionalization approaches implemented in conjunction with SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) for streamflow estimation in each catchment treated as ungauged in turn. Kriging and IDW were the two methods that produced superior results than other applied techniques in terms of Nash-Sutcliff Efficiency (NSE), RMSE-observations standard deviation ratio (RSR) Percentage bias (PBIAS) and Peak percent threshold statistics (PPTS). Physical similarity and regression approaches, which were based on catchment attributes exhibited better results than global mean approach. Sequential Uncertainty Fitting (SUFI-2) tool analyzed the uncertainty associated with regionalization techniques in terms of 95% prediction uncertainty (95PPU). The comparative assessment proposes that presence of well gauged catchments in proximity with the ungauged catchment is more beneficial than catchments having resemblance between them in terms of physiographic attributes for continuous streamflow prediction.

J	Han, DM; Currell, MJ; Cao, GL; Hall, B				Han, Dongmei; Currell, Matthew J.; Cao, Guoliang; Hall, Benjamin			Alterations to groundwater recharge due to anthropogenic landscape change	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The impacts of anthropogenic modifications to the landscape on groundwater recharge rates, locations, and mechanisms are reviewed. The two major categories of change examined are conversion of land for agriculture and urbanization, both of which have significant effects on groundwater recharge. Techniques for identifying and quantifying the changes in recharge due to these impacts are discussed. Land-clearing for agriculture and surface water transfer for irrigation have resulted in order of magnitude increases in recharge rates in many semi-arid regions worldwide, causing ongoing land and water salinization and water-logging problems. While increased recharge by irrigation return flow may alleviate shallow groundwater depletion in some settings, this is complicated by the effect of unsaturated zone thickening, which reduces the fraction of potential recharge becoming actual recharge, and may result in new water quality risks such as nitrate contamination. Expansion of urban and peri-urban land and their associated surface and sub-surface infrastructure results in complex water balance changes that re-distribute groundwater recharge locations, modify recharge mechanism(s) and result in variable impacts on recharge rates (e.g., overall net decrease, increase or minimal change) and quality. While changes to groundwater recharge resulting from conversion of land for agriculture are relatively well understood, less is documented about the changes resulting from urbanization, due to a paucity of data from field-based studies. Two case studies from Beijing, China and Melbourne Australia are examined, which highlight these impacts and demonstrate some potential methodological techniques for this topic.

To overcome the uncertainty and coupling in reginal planning management, an interval fuzzy program combined with water quality model for regional planning and management has been developed to obtain the absolutely "optimal" solution in this study. The model is a hybrid methodology of interval parameter programming (IPP), fuzzy programing (FP), and a general one-dimensional water quality model. The method extends on the traditional interval parameter fuzzy programming method by integrating water quality model into the optimization framework. Meanwhile, as an abstract concept, water resources carrying capacity has been transformed into specific and calculable index. Besides, unlike many of the past studies about water resource management, population as a significant factor has been considered. The results suggested that the methodology was applicable for reflecting the complexities of the regional planning and management systems within the planning period. The government policy makers could establish effective industrial structure, water resources utilization patterns and population planning, and to better understand the tradeoffs among economic, water resources, population and environmental objectives.

Assessing Target Strength, Abundance, and Biomass for Three Commercial Pelagic Fish Species along the East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia Using a Split-Beam Echo Sounder	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Decapterus maruadsi (round scad), Megalaspis cordyla (torpedo scad), and Selar boops (oxeye scad) are commercially important small pelagic fish species of Malaysia. Despite their commercial and ecological value, little is known about their target strength (TS), spatial and vertical distributions, and biomass estimates. A split-beam acoustic survey was performed in the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia (ECPM) in March-June 2009. The calibrated echo sounder allowed determination of TS, estimation of fish density (spatial distribution) and biomass, and produced density maps along depth gradients (vertical distribution). The TS-length relationships indicated that the logarithmic TS was proportional to the squared length. Additional water parameters that included salinity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen (DO) were collected to examine fish density changes in relation to water quality and depth. Results revealed that the small pelagic fish formed small schools that were scattered over a wide area of the ECMP; mean density varied between 1.1 and 1.9 t/km(2). The maximum fish density was in the spatial coverage between 102.875 degrees E, 6.000 degrees N and 103.125 degrees E, 6.500 degrees N. The mean total biomass was about 18,610 t. Optimum fish density was estimated around water depths between 40 and 60 m. Fish density mainly decreased with decreasing DO and with increasing depth. The demonstrated acoustic method can be used as a monitoring tool for national fish stock surveys.

It could affect water quality and marine ecosystems due to pollutants and trace elements transported through groundwater. Relations between different characteristics of aquifers and SGD have been investigated extensively before, but the role of fractures in SGD still remains unknown. In order to better understand the mechanism of groundwater flow and solute transport through fractures in SGD, one-dimensional analytical solutions of groundwater hydraulic head and velocity through a synthetic horizontal fracture with periodic boundary conditions were derived using a Laplace transform technique. Then, numerical solutions of solute transport associated with the given groundwater velocity were developed using a finite-difference method. The results indicated that SGD associated with groundwater flow and solute transport was mainly controlled by sea level periodic fluctuations, which altered the hydraulic head and the hydraulic head gradient in the fracture. As a result, the velocity of groundwater flow associated with SGD also fluctuated periodically. We found that the pollutant concentration associated with SGD oscillated around a constant value, and could not reach a steady state. This was particularly true at locations close to the seashore. This finding of the role of fracture in SGD will assist pollution remediation and marine conservation in coastal regions.

Transport and potential attenuation of nitrogen in shallow groundwaters in the lower Rangitikei catchment, New Zealand	JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY												Intensive agricultural activities are generally associated with nitrogen leaching from agricultural soils, and this nitrogen has the potential to percolate and contaminate groundwater and surface waters. We assessed surface water and groundwater interactions, and nitrogen leaching and its potential attenuation in shallow groundwater in the lower Rangitikei River catchment (832 km(2)), New Zealand. We combined regional- and local-scale field surveys and experiments, nutrient budget modelling, and hydraulic and geochemical methods, to gain an insight into leaching, transformation and transport of nitrogen via groundwaters to the river in the study area. Concurrent river flow gaugings (in January 2015) and a piezometric map, developed from measured depths to groundwater in 110 bores (in October 2014), suggest groundwater discharges to the Rangitikei River in the upper parts of the study area, while there is groundwater recharge near the coast. The groundwater redox characterisation, based on sampling and analysis of 15 mostly shallow bores (< 30 m below ground level (bgl)), suggests groundwater across the lower Rangitikei catchment in general is under anoxic/reduced conditions. The groundwater typically has low dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations (< 1 mg/L), suggesting the subsurface environment is conducive to potential attenuation by 'denitrification' of NO3-N in groundwater. We further measured NO3-N attenuation in shallow groundwater piezometers (3-6 m bgl) using single-well push-pull tests. We found generally low levels (< 0.5 mg/L) of NO3-N in shallow groundwater piezometers (> 5 m bgl), despite being installed under intensive land uses, such as dairying and cropping. Our in-field push-pull tests showed NO3-N reduction at four shallow groundwater piezometers, with the rates of reduction varying from 0.04 mg N L-1 h(-1) to 1.57 mg N h(-1). This highlights the importance of a sound understanding of not only the sources, but also transport and transformation, or fate, of nutrients leached from farms, to mitigate the likely impacts of land use on water quality and ecosystem health in agricultural catchments.																	0169-7722	1873-6009				NOV	2017	206						55	66		10.1016/j.jconhyd.2017.10.002								WOS:000414891200006	29033220					
J	Kumari, J; Paul, B				Kumari, Juli; Paul, Biswajit			Geochemical and environmental risk assessment of hazardous elements in river sediment	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The peninsular river Damodar is the life line of eastern India, facing critical pollution problems due to sewage, industrial waste disposal as well as coal mining along the river valley. Sediment samples were collected and analyzed for various geochemical phases of hazardous elements, and associated environmental risks were evaluated. This paper provides chemical fractionation of nine (Cd, Mn, Zn, Ni, Cu, Pb, Co, Cr, Fe) elements from river sediment by using Tessier five step sequential extraction method. The study was aimed (1) to understand dynamics and mobility of elements in different geochemical fractions; (2) to evaluate bioavailability and ecological risk of these elements by RAC; and (3) to identify contaminated and uncontaminated sites by using cluster analysis. The result of the study revealed maximum bioavailable fraction was that of Cd. Bioavailable elements in studied sediment followed the order Cd (23.76%) > Mn (14.19%) > Zn (13.54%) > Ni (12.82%) > Cu (7.12%) > Pb (7.05%) > Co (6.09%) > Fe (4.98%) > Cr (2.03%). Maximum % of the reducible fraction was found for Fe (14.38%) while in organic fraction Cu (11.25%) was maximum. Residual fraction dominates in all elements with a maximum percentage of 83.85% for Co. Risk assessment by RAC reveals that the river was under medium risk due to Cd, Mn, Zn and Ni while at low risk for rest of the elements. Cluster analysis shows that three sampling sites were highly contaminated, three were moderately contaminated and six were contaminated while only one site was uncontaminated.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				NOV	2017	76	21							731	10.1007/s12665-017-7073-z								WOS:000414335900010						
J	Sener, S; Karakus, M				Sener, Sehnaz; Karakus, Murat			Investigating water quality and arsenic contamination in drinking water resources in the Tavsanli District (Kutahya, Western Turkey)	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Arsenic is a natural component of the earth's crust, and it is transported into surface water and groundwater through the dissolution of rocks, minerals and ores. In addition, arsenic leaching processes contaminate water sources and this geogenic arsenic contamination causes significant water quality problems in many parts of the world. In this study, water quality, arsenic contamination and human health risks of drinking water resources in the Tavsanli District were determined and the origins were discussed. For this purpose, geological and hydrogeological properties were investigated. In situ measurements and chemical analyses were carried out on water samples taken from drinking water sources such as wells, springs and surface waters for hydrogeochemical studies. According to the obtained results, water resources are Ca-Mg-HCO3, Mg-HCO3 and Na-HCO3 type. Total As (AsT) concentration of the water samples sometimes exceeds the permissible limit given by the TSI-266 (Standards for drinking waters, Turkish Standards Institution, Ankara, 2005) and WHO (Guidelines for drinking-water quality, World Health Organization, Geneva, 2008) for drinking water. H3AsO30 and HAsO42- are dominant arsenic species in groundwater and surface water, respectively. Typically high total arsenic concentrations can be found in regions characterized by magmatic rocks. In addition, As concentrations in surface waters were found to be higher than in groundwater in the region, due to the anthropogenic influence of mining activities in the region.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				NOV	2017	76	21							750	10.1007/s12665-017-7101-z								WOS:000414335900028						
J	Gailey, RM				Gailey, Robert M.			Inactive supply wells as conduits for flow and contaminant migration: conditions of occurrence and suggestions for management	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Water supply wells can act as conduits for vertical flow and contaminant migration between water-bearing strata under common hydrogeologic and well construction conditions. While recognized by some for decades, there is little published data on the magnitude of flows and extent of resulting water quality impacts. Consequently, the issue may not be acknowledged widely enough and the need for better management persists. This is especially true for unconsolidated alluvial groundwater basins that are hydrologically stressed by agricultural activities. Theoretical and practical considerations indicate that significant water volumes can migrate vertically through wells. The flow is often downward, with shallow groundwater, usually poorer in quality, migrating through conduit wells to degrade deeper water quality. Field data from locations in California, USA, are presented in combination with modeling results to illustrate both the prevalence of conditions conducive to intraborehole flow and the resulting impacts to water quality. Suggestions for management of planned wells include better enforcement of current regulations and more detailed consideration of hydrogeologic conditions during design and installation. A potentially greater management challenge is presented by the large number of existing wells. Monitoring for evidence of conduit flow and solute transport in areas of high well density is recommended to identify wells that pose greater risks to water quality. Conduit wells that are discovered may be addressed through approaches that include structural modification and changes in operations.																	1431-2174	1435-0157				NOV	2017	25	7					2163	2183		10.1007/s10040-017-1588-y								WOS:000413970900017

Measuring water quality from individual fractures in open wellbores using hydraulic isolation and the dissolved oxygen alteration method	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												This study describes a low-cost method for sampling individual fractures in open wellbores in crystalline bedrock utilizing naturally occurring flow conditions in the well. The method entails using the dissolved oxygen alteration method (DOAM) to identify transmissive fractures and vertical flow direction. After obtaining information about relative hydraulic gradients, flow direction in the well is modified using a single control pump to isolate fractures of interest for sampling. Additional dissolved oxygen, injected during the DOAM procedure, serves as a tracer to ensure the water quality in the sampling zone is characteristic of the fracture of interest by requiring a tracer-free zone prior to sampling. Sampling procedures are described conceptually for nine bedrock wells with varying flow conditions containing one, two, or three transmissive inflowing fractures. The method was demonstrated in two crystalline bedrock wells containing one and two transmissive inflowing fractures.																	1431-2174	1435-0157				NOV	2017	25	7					2199	2206		10.1007/s10040-017-1657-2								WOS:000413970900019

Evaluation of fog and rain water collected at Delta Barrage, Egypt as a new resource for irrigated agriculture	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES												Alternative clean water resources are needed in Egypt to face the current water shortage and water quality deterioration. Therefore, this research investigates the suitability of harvesting fog and rain water for irrigation using a pilot fog collector for water quantity, water quality, and economic aspects. A pilot fog collector was installed at one location at Delta Barrage, Egypt. Freeze liquid nitrogen was fixed at the back of the fiberglass sheet to increase the condensation rate. The experiment was conducted during the period from November 2015 to February 2016. In general, all physicochemical variables are observed with higher values in the majority of fog than rain water. The fog is assumed to contain higher concentrations of anthropogenic emissions. TDS in both waters collected are less than 700 mg/l at sodium content less than 60%, classifying these waters as good for various plants under most conditions. In addition, SAR calculated values are less than 3.0 in each of fog and rain water, which proves the water suitability for all irrigated agriculture. Al and Fe concentrations were found common in all samples with values less than the permissible limits of the guidelines. These metals originate from soil material, ash and metal surfaces. The sensitive heavy metals (Cd and Pb) were within the permissible limits of the guideline in fog water, indicating this water is suitable for irrigation. On the contrary, rain water that has heavy metals is not permitted in irrigation water as per the Egyptian law. As per WQI, the rain water is classified as good quality while fog is classified as medium quality. Regarding the water quantity, a significant increase in the harvested fog quantity was observed after cooling the collector surface with freeze liquid nitrogen. The current fog collector produced the lowest water quantity among different fog collectors worldwide. However, these comparative results confirmed that quantity is different from one location to another worldwide even in the same country. The cost of the unit water volume of harvested water by the current pilot collector is relatively low among different collectors worldwide. This study proves that fog harvesting in Egypt is feasible using the current pilot collector in terms of water quantity, water quality, and economy. But it recommends collection of fog at various locations and times, since both water quantity and water quality are variable in time and space. It is more or less viable solution to meet the shortage of water in Egypt. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Zhang, Y; Wang, JL; Yang, PH; Xie, SY				Zhang Yu; Wang JianLi; Yang PingHeng; Xie ShiYou			Movement of lateral hyporheic flow between stream and groundwater	SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES												The hyporheic zone plays an important role in groundwater and stream water quality protection. To investigate the stream-groundwater interaction mechanisms in the lateral hyporheic zone, this study examined Ma'an Creek in Chongqing during the dry season from December 2015 to April 2016. The water level, water temperature, pH and Cl- concentration in the hyporheic zone and groundwater were monitored in situ. The sediment permeability coefficient, stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen and concentration of DOC were analyzed. The results show that the water level changes of hyporheic zone and the movement of hyporheic flow were influenced significantly by the permeability coefficient of sediment. The hyporheic flow approximately 10 cm from the stream bank was clearly affected by precipitation infiltration and evapotranspiration. During the study period, the groundwater recharged the stream, and the impact of groundwater on the hyporheic flow gradually decreased with the flow path. The hyporheic flow approximately 30 cm from the stream bank was still mainly affected by groundwater. Approximately 10-30 cm from the stream bank, the mixing of groundwater with precipitation and stream water intensified. Due to the sediment properties, moisture accumulated approximately 10 cm from the stream bank and drained into the stream via hyporheic flow, with potential impacts on stream water quality.																	1674-7313	1869-1897				NOV	2017	60	11					2033	2040		10.1007/s11430-016-9103-9								WOS:000413691300009

Pesticide fate on catchment scale: conceptual modelling of stream CSIA data	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Compound-specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) has proven beneficial in the characterization of contaminant degradation in groundwater, but it has never been used to assess pesticide transformation on catchment scale. This study presents concentration and carbon CSIA data of the herbicides S-metolachlor and acetochlor from three locations (plot, drain, and catchment outlets) in a 47 ha agricultural catchment (Bas-Rhin, France). Herbicide concentrations at the catchment outlet were highest (62 mu gL(-1)) in response to an intense rainfall event following herbicide application. Increasing delta C-13 values of S-metolachlor and acetochlor by more than 2% during the study period indicated herbicide degradation. To assist the interpretation of these data, discharge, concentrations, and delta C-13 values of S-metolachlor were modelled with a conceptual mathematical model using the transport formulation by travel-time distributions. Testing of different model setups supported the assumption that degradation half-lives (DT50) increase with increasing soil depth, which can be straightforwardly implemented in conceptual models using travel-time distributions. Moreover, model calibration yielded an estimate of a field-integrated isotopic enrichment factor as opposed to laboratory-based assessments of enrichment factors in closed systems. Thirdly, the Rayleigh equation commonly applied in groundwater studies was tested by our model for its potential to quantify degradation on catchment scale. It provided conservative estimates on the extent of degradation as occurred in stream samples. However, largely exceeding the simulated degradation within the entire catchment, these estimates were not representative of overall degradation on catchment scale. The conceptual modelling approach thus enabled us to upscale sample-based CSIA information on degradation to the catchment scale. Overall, this study demonstrates the benefit of combining monitoring and conceptual modelling of concentration and CSIA data and advocates the use of traveltime distributions for assessing pesticide fate and transport on catchment scale.					van der Velde, Ype/0000-0002-2183-2573; Lutz, Stefanie/0000-0001-9583-7337												1027-5606	1607-7938				OCT 18	2017	21	10					5243	5261		10.5194/hess-21-5243-2017								WOS:000413201600001

Post-fire hillslope debris flows: Evidence of a distinct erosion process	GEOMORPHOLOGY												After wildfire a hitherto unexplained erosion process that some authors have called 'miniature debris flows on hillslopes' and that leave behind levee-lined rills has been observed in some regions of the world. Despite the unusual proposition of debris flow on planar hillslopes, the process has not received much attention. The objectives of this study were to (1) accumulate observational evidence of Hillslope Debris Flows (HDF) as we have defined the process, to (2) understand their initiation process by conducting runoff experiments on hillslopes, to (3) propose a conceptual model of HDF, and to (4) contrast and classify HDF relative to other erosion and transport processes in the post-wildfire hillslope domain. HDF have been observed at relatively steep slope gradients (0.4-0.8), on a variety of geologies, and after fire of at least moderate severity and consist of a lobe of gravel-to cobble-sized material 0.2-1 m wide that is pushed by runoff damming up behind it. During initiation, runoff moved individual particles that accumulated a small distance downslope until the accumulation of grains failed and formed the granular lobe of the HDF. HDF are a threshold process, and runoff rates of 0.5 L s(-1) 2 L s(-1) were required for their initiation during the experiments. The conceptual model highlights HDF as a geomorphic process distinct from channel debris flows, because they occur on planar, unconfined hillslopes rather than confined channels. HDF can erode very coarse non-cohesive surface soil, which distinguishes them from rill erosion that have suspended and bedload transport. On a matrix of slope and grain size, HDF are enveloped between purely gravity-driven dry ravel, and mostly runoff driven bedload transport in rills.

Unionid shells (Hyriopsis cumingii) record manganese cycling at the sediment-water interface in a shallow eutrophic lake in China (Lake Taihu)	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Aquatic eutrophication is becoming a serious environmental problem throughout the world. The utility of bi-valves as bio-filters to improve water quality and reduce algal blooms has been widely acknowledged, but the potential usefulness of bivalve shells as retrospective monitors of eutrophication-induced environmental change has received little attention. Here, we present the first multi-year, high-resolution Mn/Ca-shell records of the freshwater mussel, Hyriopsis cumingii (Lea, 1852) from a shallow eutrophic lake (Lake Taihu, China). Mn/Ca-shell time series of the two studied shells exhibit a high degree of synchrony after being placed in a precise temporal context by means of growth pattern analysis. There is a large inter-annual variability of Mn/Casheii records during 20112015, with the highest value occurring in 2013. Mn/Ca-shell also displays a pronounced intra-annual variability with maxima consistently occurring during late spring/early summer. The high reproducibility of Mn/Ca-shell time-series among contemporaneous specimens highlights the existence of strong environmental rather than biological control on the incorporation of Mn into the shells. In particular, the striking feature of late spring/early summertime Mn/Cashell maxima is synchronous with the occurrence of reducing conditions beneath the sediment-water interface (SWI). The latter results in substantial increases of biologically available Mn2+ in the sediment pore water and organic particles, the element being rapidly taken up from these sources by the mussels with subsequent incorporation of Mn into their shells. Therefore, Mn/Ca-shell can potentially serve as a high-resolution proxy of the mobility of Mn at the SWI. As demonstrated by the present study, documenting and understanding geochemical properties of bivalve shells can help to retrospectively monitor eutrophication-induced environmental change in aquatic ecosystems.

Effects of changes in nutrient loading and composition on hypoxia dynamics and internal nutrient cycling of a stratified coastal lagoon	BIOGEOSCIENCES												The effects of changes in catchment nutrient loading and composition on the phytoplankton dynamics, development of hypoxia and internal nutrient dynamics in a stratified coastal lagoon system (the Gippsland Lakes) were investigated using a 3-D coupled hydrodynamic biogeochemical water quality model. The study showed that primary production was equally sensitive to changed dissolved inorganic and particulate organic nitrogen loads, highlighting the need for a better understanding of particulate organic matter bioavailability. Stratification and sediment carbon enrichment were the main drivers for the hypoxia and subsequent sediment phosphorus release in Lake King. High primary production stimulated by large nitrogen loading brought on by a winter flood contributed almost all the sediment carbon deposition (as opposed to catchment loads), which was ultimately responsible for summer bottom-water hypoxia. Interestingly, internal recycling of phosphorus was more sensitive to changed nitrogen loads than total phosphorus loads, highlighting the potential importance of nitrogen loads exerting a control over systems that become phosphorus limited (such as during summer nitrogen-fixing blooms of cyanobacteria). Therefore, the current study highlighted the need to reduce both total nitrogen and total phosphorus for water quality improvement in estuarine systems.																	1726-4170	1726-4189				OCT 6	2017	14	19					4423	4433		10.5194/bg-14-4423-2017								WOS:000412383600001						
J	Tecklenburg, C; Blume, T				Tecklenburg, Christina; Blume, Theresa			Identifying, characterizing and predicting spatial patterns of lacustrine groundwater discharge	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Lacustrine groundwater discharge (LGD) can significantly affect lake water balances and lake water quality. However, quantifying LGD and its spatial patterns is challenging because of the large spatial extent of the aquiferlake interface and pronounced spatial variability. This is the first experimental study to specifically study these larger-scale patterns with sufficient spatial resolution to systematically investigate how landscape and local characteristics affect the spatial variability in LGD. We measured vertical temperature profiles around a 0.49 km(2) lake in northeastern Germany with a needle thermistor, which has the advantage of allowing for rapid (manual) measurements and thus, when used in a survey, high spatial coverage and resolution. Groundwater inflow rates were then estimated using the heat transport equation. These near-shore temperature profiles were complemented with sediment temperature measurements with a fibre-optic cable along six transects from shoreline to shoreline and radon measurements of lake water samples to qualitatively identify LGD patterns in the offshore part of the lake. As the hydrogeology of the catchment is sufficiently homogeneous (sandy sediments of a glacial outwash plain; no bedrock control) to avoid patterns being dominated by geological discontinuities, we were able to test the common assumptions that spatial patterns of LGD are mainly controlled by sediment characteristics and the groundwater flow field. We also tested the assumption that topographic gradients can be used as a proxy for gradients of the groundwater flow field. Thanks to the extensive data set, these tests could be carried out in a nested design, considering both small-and large-scale variability in LGD. We found that LGD was concentrated in the near-shore area, but along-shore variability was high, with specific regions of higher rates and higher spatial variability. Median inflow rates were 44 Lm(-2) d(-1) with maximum rates in certain locations going up to 169 Lm(-2) d(-1). Offshore LGD was negligible except for two local hotspots on steep steps in the lake bed topography. Large-scale groundwater inflow patterns were correlated with topography and the groundwater flow field, whereas small-scale patterns correlated with grain size distributions of the lake sediment. These findings confirm results and assumptions of theoretical and modelling studies more systematically than was previously possible with coarser sampling designs. However, we also found that a significant fraction of the variance in LGD could not be explained by these controls alone and that additional processes need to be considered. While regression models using these controls as explanatory variables had limited power to predict LGD rates, the results nevertheless encourage the use of topographic indices and sediment heterogeneity as an aid for targeted campaigns in future studies of groundwater discharge to lakes.

Firstly, explanatory relationships were derived between an Antecedent Precipitation Index and the loads of thermo-tolerant coliforms and intestinal enterococci measured at three catchment outlets in the Gulf of Aigues-Mortes (southern France). Secondly, fecal bacterial loadings were simulated during summer season from 2006-2016, with a confidence interval arising from measurements uncertainties. On average, more than two rainstorms per summer season elevate bacterial loads at least by one order of magnitude, potentially leading to the degradation of bathing and fishing water quality observed in regulatory monitoring data. The results highlight the crucial importance of considering hydrological conditions in coastal water quality management. (C) 2017 Academie des sciences. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

Driven by this, this study developed a spatially weighted optimization model (SWOM) to predict the dry and wet season's surface water salinity in Florida Bay. The modeling was carried out using in situ salinity observations from United States Geological Survey (USGS) for 1998-2001 coupled with processed Landsat TM 5 images for corresponding dates. A mathematical optimization formulation was developed for the model, which was solved using a gradient-based optimization solver, following the clustering of the study area into a set of 3 km * 3 km grids. To train the model so as to infer optimum values of decision variables, the optimization process was simulated for each 3 km pixel using two-third randomly selected samples, which yielded acceptable R-squared values of 0.92 and 0.90 for dry and wet seasons and root mean squared error (RMSE) values of 1.8 and 1.73 parts per thousand (ppt) for dry and wet seasons, respectively. The validation of the model with the remaining one-third samples also provided good statistical correlation, as the R-squared values found were 0.91 (dry) and 0.89 (wet); and the validated RMSE values obtained were 1.92 ppt (dry) and 1.84 ppt (wet), providing strong inference of the model's consistency in estimating surface water salinity. Lastly, the model was applied to six different temporal cases (i.e., dry and wet seasons of 1996-97, 2004-05, and 2016). Upon application, the model provided reasonable accuracy except for showing errors in some regions for 2004-05. The surface water salinity mapping carried out using SWOM not only provided meaningful spatial and temporal variations of surface water salinity but also highlighted the wet season hypersaline peaks within the central Florida Bay region.

Field assessment of surface runoff, sediment yield and soil erosion in the opencast mines in Chirimiri area, Chhattisgarh, India	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH												Chirimiri Coal field is located in the Koriya district of Chhattisgarh state of India. It lies in the valley of the Hasdeo River and is spread over 125 km(2) area. Ever increasing problem of declining forest resources and water quality is a cause of concern particularly due to excessive soil erosion resulting in soil sediment deposition from the overburdened dump. Dwindling resources has compelled the policy makers to search for alternatives such as waste lands and mined areas to improve soil and water resources for use in agriculture and allied sectors while maintaining the local ecology and hydrology. Most Opencast mines release huge amount of mining wastes in the form of overburden dump (OBD) materials that are prone to soil erosion and also create problems of sedimentation and deteriorating water quality, affecting agriculture. Historical daily rainfall data for 21 years and daily surface runoff as estimated by SCS-Curve Number method were analysed. Sediment yield was estimated at lower end of erosion face of OBD and near drainage outlet of opencast mine. Assessment of soil erosion from OBD materials was made byRevised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) method and was compared with direct field measurements by placing plastic sheets in downstream portion of OBD. As a result monsoon rainfall constitutes 91.6 percent of the annual rainfall and surface runoff constitutes 31.7 percent of monsoon rainfall. The surface runoff was found to be 4133 m(3)/ha while the sediment yield of drainage effluent was negligible. The soil loss from OBD as estimated by the RUSLE method (62.7 t ha(-1) yr(-1)) was quite close (+13.2 percent) to the direct field measurement 54.44 t ha(-1). The sediment samples from OBD were found acidic in nature and exhibited low values of Electrical Conductivity (EC), Organic Content (OC), Water Holding Capacities (WHC), and Available Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P) and Potassium (K). For controlling soil erosion of OBD, mechanical and vegetative measures have been suggested along with installation of sediment traps inside and outside the mines. There is good scope to backfill the mines with the OBD in the form of well laid out terraces to support plantation. This can be eventually used for leguminous fodder/grass production.

J	Vaughan, AA; Belmont, P; Hawkins, CP; Wilcock, P				Vaughan, Angus A.; Belmont, Patrick; Hawkins, Charles P.; Wilcock, Peter			Near-Channel Versus Watershed Controls on Sediment Rating Curves	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												Predicting riverine suspended sediment flux is a fundamental problem in geomorphology, with important implications for water quality, land and water resource management, and aquatic ecosystem health. To advance understanding, we evaluated environmental and landscape factors that influence sediment rating curves (SRCs). We generated SRCs with recent total suspended solids (TSSs) and discharge data from 45 gages on 36 rivers throughout the state of Minnesota, USA. Watersheds range from 32 to 14,600 km(2) and represent distinct settings regarding topography, land cover, and geologic history. Rivers exhibited three distinct SRC shapes: simple power functions, threshold power functions, and peaked or negative-slope functions. We computed SRC exponents and coefficients (describing the steepness of the relation and the TSS concentration at median flows, respectively). In addition to quantifying watershed topography, climate/hydrology, geology, soil type, and land cover, we used lidar topography to characterize the near-channel environment upstream of gages. We used random forest models to analyze relations between SRC parameters and attributes of the watershed and the near-channel environment. The models correctly classify 78% of SRC shapes and explain 37%-60% of variance in SRC parameters. We find that SRC steepness (exponent) is strongly related to near-channel morphological characteristics including near-channel relief, channel gradient, and presence of lakes along the local channel network, but not to land use. In contrast, land use influences TSS concentrations at moderate and low flow. These findings suggest that the near-channel environment controls changes in TSS as flows increase, whereas land use drives median and low flow TSS conditions.																	2169-9003	2169-9011				OCT	2017	122	10					1901	1923		10.1002/2016JF004180								WOS:000415149000009

Dissolved Organic Matter Compositional Change and Biolability During Two Storm Runoff Events in a Small Agricultural Watershed	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Agricultural watersheds are globally pervasive, supporting fundamentally different organic matter source, composition, and concentration profiles in comparison to natural systems. Similar to natural systems, agricultural storm runoff exports large amounts of organic carbon from agricultural land into waterways. But intense management of upper soil layers, waterway channelization, wetland and riparian habitat removal, and postharvest vegetation removal promise to uniquely drive organic matter release to waterways. During a winter first flush and a subsequent storm event, this study investigated the influence of a small agricultural watershed on dissolved organic matter (DOM) source, composition, and biolability. Storm water discharge released strongly terrestrial yet biolabile (23 to 32%) dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Following a 21day bioassay, a parallel factor analysis identified an 80% reduction in a protein-like (phenylpropyl) component (C2) that was previously correlated to lignin phenol concentration, and a 10% reduction in a humic-like, terrestrially sourced component (C4). Storm-driven releases tripled DOC concentration (from 2.8 to 8.7mgL(-1)) during the first flush event in comparison to base flow and were terrestrially sourced, with an eightfold increase in vascular plant derived lignin phenols (23.0 to 185gL(-1)). As inferred from system hydrology, lignin composition, and nitrate as a groundwater tracer, an initial pulse of dilute water from the upstream watershed caused a counterclockwise DOC hysteresis loop. DOC concentrations peaked after 3.5days, with the delay between peak discharge and peak DOC attributed to storm water hydrology and a period of initial water repellency of agricultural soils, which delayed DOM leaching. Plain Language Summary Human activities have transformed vast areas of Earth's surface to agricultural use. Contemporary agricultural practices have vastly increased crop yield but have also greatly intensified agricultural land management practices, which deviate strongly from many of the basic processes that affect natural habitats. It follows, then, that agricultural land use could affect carbon cycling and water quality in agricultural watersheds very differently from how natural systems affect those same parameters. This study seeks to deepen scientific knowledge surrounding how storms drive carbon release from land to waterways, specific to an agricultural watershed. Results indicate that over a quarter of the carbon released from the subject agricultural watershed during storms has the potential to be used as energy by downstream ecosystems. This could support future management actions seeking to benefit downstream ecosystems or may pose a threat to ecosystem health. The study also suggests that the timing, amount, and quality of carbon released from the watershed depend on rainfall patterns and watershed plumbing, and on whether or not soil wetting has occurred recently, prior to the event in question.

Safiur			Assessing irrigation water quality in Faridpur district of Bangladesh using several indices and statistical approaches	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Several water quality indices, i.e., salinity hazard (SH), sodium percentage (Na%), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), permeability index (PI), magnesium hazard (MH), Kelly's ratio (KR) and irrigation water quality (IWQ) indices are applied to assess the irrigation water quality using 60 groundwater samples collected from the study sites. This study reveals that groundwater samples are mainly Ca-MgHCO3 types. The IWQ of groundwater with various classifications are also followed to assess the water suitability for irrigation purposes. Based on IWQ index, it is observed that 68.33% of the water samples (41 locations) belong to high suitability water type, whereas 30% (18 locations) samples exhibit low suitability type for irrigation purposes in the study area. Results of the classification (EC, SH, Na%, SAR, PI, MH, and KR) indicate that groundwater in the study areas are mainly fit for irrigation uses. Besides the above findings, Na+ and Cl- concentrations reveal the positively skewed and are regarded to be extreme. Furthermore, results shows that groundwater mineralization process and rock-water interaction are mainly controlled with bivariate plots of major ions in the study areas. Subsequently, these results are validated using multiple regression models and correlation analysis. The spatial distribution of irrigation indices is carried out by geostatistical modeling. The results of semivariagram model show that most of the irrigation indices have weakly spatial dependence, suggesting agricultural and residential influences. However, it has been expected that this paper helps to give insights for a better management of the groundwater resources for the agricultural purposes in the study area.

J	Naik, PK; Mojica, M; Ahmed, F; Al-Mannai, S				Naik, Pradeep K.; Mojica, Marcial; Ahmed, Faizul; Al-Mannai, Shawqi			Storm water injection in Bahrain: pilot studies	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Kingdom of Bahrain often suffers from urban flooding problems despite being a desertic country. An attempt has been made in this contribution to study the efficacy of the storm water injection systems not only in tackling urban flooding problems but also in augmenting the depleting ground water resources of the country. Two pilot studies were carried out in a centrally located area, one in a relatively open area and another in a densely populated location. A set of one recharge well and one observation well of about 40 m depth and 30 m apart was drilled in each site. Storm water was injected into the recharge wells after allowing it to pass through a specially designed natural filter system. Ground water levels were monitored at the observation wells on monthly basis and water samples were collected periodically during and after the rainfall events for chemical analysis. Initial results showed that the volume of storm water injected is proportional to the volume of storm water generated in an area. However, in the long run, the injection well having favourable hydrogeological situation and lesser silts in the storm water performed better in terms of total recharge despite having lesser volume of storm water available. Ground water quality for some parameters such as lead and cadmium remained an issue of concern, but could be controlled through construction of stricter filter system. Dilution of the injected storm water with the host ground water too significantly reduced the risks of contamination. The injection well located in the open area performed better than that of the densely populated area despite having lesser volume of storm water available. Site selection of the recharge wells, therefore, plays a vital role in the efficacy of a storm water injection system.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				OCT	2017	10	20							452	10.1007/s12517-017-3232-5								WOS:000414053300012						
J	Qi, YM; Li, MZ; Li, KJ; Yeh, TCJ				Qi, Yueming; Li, Minzu; Li, Kuangjia; Yeh, Tian-Chyi Jim			Spatiotemporal development of mine water inrush and its mechanism-a case study in Ganhe coal mine, Shanxi, China	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Mine water inrush is one of the main hazards in coal mining industry. The mechanism and the processes are complex. Investigation of the spatiotemporal development of the hydrological process could lead to a better understanding of mine water inrush and effective countermeasures. For this reason, we investigated spatial and temporal characteristics (i.e., the changes of flow rate, groundwater level, and water quality) during a water inrush event in China, which had a flow rate of 730 m(3)/h at maximum and 300m(3)/h under a steady condition. The result shows that the water inrush developed in several stages. A mathematical model of the dynamic change between the water table and the inrush flow rate was constructed. Based on this model, we found the relationship of highly conductive flow channels between some observation boreholes and the water inrush point. In addition, the recharge velocity of the highly conductive flow channels and the equivalent mean flow velocity of the whole mine were determined. A comprehensive analysis of geological, hydrodynamic, and crustal stress conditions was conducted to study the development of the water channel near the F-13 fault and the nonlinear process from seepage stage to inrush stage. The result reveals the water inrush is likely caused by activation of faults under combined influences of high crustal stress and high hydraulic pressure.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				OCT	2017	10	19							433	10.1007/s12517-017-3216-5								WOS:000413203600017						
J	Bayram, A				Bayram, Adem			Rebuttal to "Evaluation of surface water quality and heavy metal pollution of Coruh River Basin (Turkey) by multivariate statistical methods'' by Bilgin and Konanc (Environ Earth Sci 2016; 75:1029)	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The paper entitled "Evaluation of surface water quality and heavy metal pollution of Coruh River Basin (Turkey) by multivariate statistical methods'' by Bilgin and Konanc (Environ Earth Sci 75: 1029, 2016) was discussed. The authors made a great effort measuring 21 water quality indicators for the surface waters from 14 monitoring and sampling stations selected in the Coruh River Basin (northeastern Turkey) during a period from June 2014 to May 2015. Unfortunately, various mistakes, e.g., several misevaluated water quality indicators and a number of mistyped parts, as well as incomplete evaluation were identified with respect to the surface water quality in the Coruh River Basin, northeastern Turkey. Moreover, Bilgin and Konanc (Environ Earth Sci 75: 1029, 2016) considered the Turkish Water Pollution Control Regulation (TWPCR 2004), which was repealed as of 30.11.2012, and the Council Directive 75/440/EEC (1975), which was repealed as of 22.12.2007, to evaluate the surface water quality in the Coruh River Basin, northeastern Turkey. The mistakes were corrected, and the surface water quality was reevaluated with reference to the Turkish Regulation being in force.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				OCT	2017	76	20							700	10.1007/s12665-017-6984-z								WOS:000413674900003

Hydrogeological modelling of these data can be implemented with physically based models (i.e. MODFLOW, MT3D.). Other approaches that are simpler to implement may be a good substitute for these numerical approaches. This is the case of probabilistic approaches and especially the statistical approach neural networks. The proposed method (coupling GIS/ANN) is especially suitable for the problem of large-scale and long-term simulation. It has been applied in the spatial prediction of nitrates in the chalk aquifer in Bethune (North of France). This confined chalk aquifer in its northern part provides natural denitrification and ensures a good drinking water quality, while in its southern part this aquifer is facing a high level of nitrate concentrations far above the European Nitrates Directive standard. A good groundwater management of this ecosystems service is therefore of great importance for regional water management. Thus, the spatial distribution of nitrate concentration obtained by GIS/ANN coupling model was compared with the results obtained from the numerical modelling (MT3D) and validated by the real measurements. ANN modelling seems to be more realistic than MT3D modelling both for 2003 and 2004. This is true for both of the nitrate concentrations and their difference. So, ANN modelling's spatially distributed difference with observed data ranges from - 3.67 to + 1.24 mg/l in 2003 and - 10.8 to + 6.51 mg/l in 2004, whereas for the MT3D model, this difference ranges from - 11.5 to + 17.9 mg/l in 2003 and - 9.91 to + 16.9 mg/l in 2004. The satisfactory results of the ANN model allowed to launch prospective simulations for 2025 under two groundwater recharge scenarios: a deficit year (150 mm/year) and a rainy year (500 mm/year) show an expansion of the exploitable zone ([NO3-] < 50 mg/L) in the case of a rainy year. The results demonstrate the potential of ANN modelling of spatially distributed hydrogeological data for groundwater management of nitrate pollution. From a groundwater management point of view, the GIS/ANN modelling represents an alternative data analysis to obtain fast results using a less tedious method whose results are satisfactory.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				OCT	2017	76	19							649	10.1007/s12665-017-6990-1								WOS:000412736700005

Findings on water quality in Upper Mustang (Nepal) from a preliminary geochemical and geological survey	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The major ion and trace element chemistry of water samples, including springs, rivers and irrigation ditches, collected during a survey on August 2016 in the Upper Mustang region of the Mustang District of Dhawalagiri Zone (Nepal) has been investigated. The Upper Mustang region, a cold desert, represents a hot-spot for climate change: indeed, violent hailstorms and rainstorms have been recently observed, consequently exposing land to erosion. Results of this study indicate that waters in the region belong to the Ca-HCO3, Ca-Mg-Cl-SO4 and Na-K-Cl-types, reflecting different hydrochemical regimes. Uranium is widespread in waters, with concentrations up to 19 mu g/L recorded in a potable water supply. Locally, anoxic conditions affect uranium mobility due to the low solubility of U(IV) minerals. Highly toxic thallium was detected in a thermal spring at an elevated concentration (45 mu g/L Tl). The association of thallium with high concentrations of iron suggests that these elements are derived from pyrite oxidation. Detectable levels of thallium were also measured in the water of an irrigation ditch. Lithium concentrations ranged from 7 mu g/L to 12 mg/L in the thermal water and showed a strong association with chloride ions. Arsenic concentrations up to 4.7 mu g/L were measured in tributaries of the Kali Gandaki river. The data provide evidence that solutes in water have originated from an array of input sources, including carbonate dissolution, the dissolution of soluble salts, silicate weathering and localized sulfide oxidation. In particular, chemical weathering of granitic rocks is likely the primary source for metals and metalloids in waters. Since the erosion rate is a factor affecting lithological weathering, highintensity rainfalls due to climate change are expected to influence the release and fate of potentially harmful elements in the in the Upper Mustang Valley.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				OCT	2017	76	19							651	10.1007/s12665-017-6991-0								WOS:000412736700007

Water in Central Asia: an integrated assessment for science-based management	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Central Asia contains one of the largest internal drainage basins in the world, and its continental location results in limited availability of both surface and groundwater. Since the twentieth century, water resources of the region have been exploited beyond sustainable levels. From small Mongolian headwater streams to the mighty Aral Sea, surface waters have been partially desiccated. Demands from the agricultural, energy and raw material sectors as well as population growth have not only increased water abstractions, but also left a diverse and strong pollution footprint on rivers, lakes and groundwater bodies. Such changes in water quantity and quality have not only led to a degradation of aquatic and riparian ecosystems, but also they have placed the region's socioeconomic development at risk. Because of the complexity of Central Asia's water problems, integrated assessment and management approaches are required. Despite some shortcomings in practical implementation, the widespread adoption of the Integrated Water Resources Management and water-food-energy nexus approaches may be keys to a more sustainable future. This thematic issue aims to provide documentation of the current state of scientific knowledge, ranging from hydrological research to water quality investigations, and offers an assessment of ecosystems and the services provided by them. Reviews and case studies on different management options conclude the thematic issue by providing insights into field-tested solutions for the region's water challenges.

Experimental investigation of fine sediment deposition using particle image velocimetry	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												In order to create natural and healthy water ecosystems, the impact of hydrological processes in ponds must be identified. Pond structure may affect water quality in many ways. The present study provides a novel insight into some of the hydrological processes as well as how to employ retentions to enhance storm water detention and manage discharge. In this research, particle image velocimetry is utilized to study the two-dimensional collecting efficiency of fine sediments by retention structures with a range of hydraulic features. To examine the hydrodynamic behavior of water mixed with fine particles, a sediment basin was designed. Fluorescent polymer particles (1-50 mu m) were subsequently added to this fluid mix. This study demonstrates that gravitational force increases fine particle settlement by over 50% at greater depths. The optimum collecting efficiency of sediments at the water surface was found to be around 80%. It was also determined that flow rate and particle size are directly correlated and that inlets and outlets at higher levels impede fine particle dispersion in the water column. For these reasons, it seems that adjusting the hydraulic parameters may diminish siltation.

Spatial distribution maps of nitrate pollution for groundwater in the study area were created using a geographical information system (GIS), and the potential for contamination in the entire plain was determined. Seasonal variations of nitrate concentrations in groundwater were assessed by sampling during spring, summer, autumn, and winter in the period April 2012 to January 2013. The groundwater samples were analyzed for nitrate (NO3). The results obtained were evaluated using a number of national and international standards and classifications. Seasonal average concentration distribution maps were established for nitrate to determine the extent and severity of contamination by this parameter in groundwater in the region. The monitoring indicated that nitrate concentrations in only two wells exceeded the recommended drinking water limit and that groundwater beneath the basin is currently suitable for irrigation.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				OCT	2017	76	20							698	10.1007/s12665-017-7044-4								WOS:000413674900001

Surface and groundwater samples of Kutahya plain were analyzed for their physio-chemical and environmental isotope properties. The relative concentrations of the water ions were found to occur in the order of Ca2+>Mg2+>(K+ + Na+) and HCO3->SO42->CI-. Piper diagram shows that Ca-Mg/Mg-Ca-HCO3 was the dominant water types. Waters in the area were super -saturated with respect to carbonates. However, they were under -saturated with respect to sulphate minerals. The groundwaters had a mean isotopic composition of -67.32 delta H-2 and- 9.72 delta O-18 and were comparatively lower than surface waters -64.64 delta H-2 and 9.25 delta O-18. Tritium activities in groundwater from the wells ranged from 1.00 to 8.38 TU with a mean value of 4.37 TU. The impact of agricultural practices and poor sanitation conditions is indicated by the positive correlation between K+ - NO3-, K+- NO2- and HCO3- - Cl- ions as well as Na+ and Mg2+ ions with Salon.

In this study, the impact of climate change and land-use change on the presence of faecal indicator bacteria in freshwater was evaluated, through the use of a recently-developed catchment-scale pathogen model. The River Conwy in Wales has been used as a case-study, because of the large presence of livestock in the catchment and the importance of the shellfish harvesting activities in its estuary. The INCA-Pathogens catchment model has been calibrated through the use of a Monte Carlo -based technique, based on faecal indicator bacteria measurements, and then driven by an ensemble of climate projections obtained from the HadRM3-PPE model (Future Flow Climate) plus four land-use scenarios (current land use, managed ecosystem, abandonment and agricultural intensification). The results show that climate change is not expected to have a very large impact on average river flow, although it might alter its seasonality. The abundance of faecal indicator bacteria is expected to decrease in response to climate change, especially during the summer months, due to reduced precipitation, causing reduced runoff, and increased temperature, which enhances the bacterial die-off processes. Land-use change can also have a potentially large impact on pathogens. The "managed ecosystems" scenario proposed in this study can cause a reduction of 15% in average water faecal indicator bacteria and up to 30% in the 90th percentile of water faecal indicator bacteria, mainly due to the conversion of pasture land into grassland and the expansion of forest land. This study provides an example of how to assess the impacts of human interventions on the landscape, and what may be the extent of their effects, for other catchments where the human use of the natural resources in the uplands can jeopardise the use of natural resources downstream.

A Bayesian-based multilevel factorial analysis method for analyzing parameter uncertainty of hydrological model	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												In this study, a Bayesian-based multilevel factorial analysis (BMFA) method is developed to assess parameter uncertainties and their effects on hydrological model responses. In BMFA, Differential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis (DREAM) algorithm is employed to approximate the posterior distributions of model parameters with Bayesian inference; factorial analysis (FA) technique is used for measuring the specific variations of hydrological responses in terms of posterior distributions to investigate the individual and interactive effects of parameters on model outputs. BMFA is then applied to a case study of the Jinghe River watershed in the Loess Plateau of China to display its validity and applicability. The uncertainties of four sensitive parameters, including soil conservation service runoff curve number to moisture condition II (CN2), soil hydraulic conductivity (SOL_K), plant available water capacity (SOL_AWC), and soil depth (SOL_Z), are investigated. Results reveal that (i) CN2 has positive effect on peak flow, implying that the concentrated rainfall during rainy season can cause infiltration-excess surface flow, which is an considerable contributor to peak flow in this watershed; (ii) SOL_K has positive effect on average flow, implying that the widely distributed cambisols can lead to medium percolation capacity; (iii) the interaction between SOLAWC and SOL_Z has noticeable effect on the peak flow and their effects are dependent upon each other, which discloses that soil depth can significant influence the processes of plant uptake of soil water in this watershed. Based on the above findings, the significant parameters and the relationship among uncertain parameters can be specified, such that hydrological model's capability for simulating/predicting water resources of the Jinghe River watershed can be improved.

Retention performance of green roofs in representative climates worldwide	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The ongoing process of global urbanization contributes to an increase in stormwater runoff from impervious surfaces, threatening also water quality. Green roofs have been proved to be innovative stormwater management measures to partially restore natural states, enhancing interception, infiltration and evapotranspiration fluxes. The amount of water that is retained within green roofs depends not only on their depth, but also on the climate, which drives the stochastic soil moisture dynamic. In this context, a simple tool for assessing performance of green roofs worldwide in terms of retained water is still missing and highly desirable for practical assessments. The aim of this work is to explore retention performance of green roofs as a function of their depth and in different climate regimes. Two soil depths are investigated, one representing the intensive configuration and another representing the extensive one. The role of the climate in driving water retention has been represented by rainfall and potential evapotranspiration dynamics. A simple conceptual weather generator has been implemented and used for stochastic simulation of daily rainfall and potential evapotranspiration. Stochastic forcing is used as an input of a simple conceptual hydrological model for estimating long-term water partitioning between rainfall, runoff and actual evapotranspiration. Coupling the stochastic weather generator with the conceptual hydrological model, we assessed the amount of rainfall diverted into evapotranspiration for different combinations of annual rainfall and potential evapotranspiration in five representative climatic regimes. Results quantified the capabilities of green roofs in retaining rainfall and consequently in reducing discharges into sewer systems at an annual time scale. The role of substrate depth has been recognized to be crucial in determining green roofs retention performance, which in general increase from extensive to intensive settings. Looking at the role of climatic conditions, namely annual rainfall, potential evapotranspiration and their seasonality cycles, we found that they drive green roofs retention performance, which are the maxima when rainfall and temperature are in phase. Finally, we provide design charts for a first approximation of possible hydrological benefits deriving from the implementation of intensive or extensive green roofs in different world areas. As an example, 25 big cities have been indicated as benchmark case studies. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												This study aimed to evaluate the influence of sub-daily precipitation time steps on model performance and hydrological components by applying the Green and Ampt infiltration method using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Precipitation was measured at a resolution of 0.1mm and aggregated to 5-, 15-, 30-, and 60-min time steps. Daily discharge data over a 10-year period were used to calibrate and validate the model. Following a global sensitivity analysis, relevant parameters were optimized through an automatic calibration procedure using SWAT-CUP for each time step. Daily performance statistics were almost equal among all four time steps (NSE approximate to 0.47). Discharge mainly consisted of groundwater flow (55%) and tile flow (42%), in reasonable proportions for the investigated catchment. In conclusion, model outputs were almost identical, showing simulations responded nearly independently of the chosen precipitation time step. This held true for (1) the selection of sensitive parameters, (2) performance statistics, (3) the shape of the hydrographs, and (4) flow components. However, a scenario analysis revealed that the precipitation time step becomes important when saturated hydraulic conductivities are low and curve numbers are high. The study suggests that there is no need in using precipitation time steps <1h for lowland catchments dominated by soils with a low surface runoff potential if daily flow values are being considered.

However, these ubiquitous assets, valued at approximately $600,000 per km(2) in a representative suburban watershed, are ideal candidates to aid in reversing such cycles of channel degradation because improving their functionality would not necessarily require property acquisition or heavy construction. The objective of this research was to develop a simple, cost-effective device that could be installed in detention basin outlets to reduce the erosive power of the relatively frequent storm events (similar to < two-year recurrence) and provide a passive bypass to maintain flood control performance during infrequent storms (such as the 100-year recurrence). Results from a pilot installation show that the Detain H2O device reduced the cumulative sediment transport capacity of the preretrofit condition by greater than 40%, and contributed to reduced flashiness and prolonged baseflows in receiving streams. When scaling the strategy across a watershed, these results suggest that potential gains in water quality and stream channel stability could be achieved at costs that are orders of magnitude less than comparable benefits from newly constructed stormwater control measures.																	1093-474X	1752-1688				OCT	2017	53	5					1032	1047		10.1111/1752-1688.12548								WOS:000412132000005

Modeling Watershed-Scale Impacts of Stormwater Management with Traditional versus Low Impact Development Design	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Stormwater runoff and associated pollutants from urban areas in the greater Chesapeake Bay Watershed (CBW) impair local streams and downstream ecosystems, despite urbanized land comprising only 7% of the CBW area. More recently, stormwater best management practices (BMPs) have been implemented in a low impact development (LID) manner to treat stormwater runoff closer to its source. This approach included the development of a novel BMP model to compare traditional and LID design, pioneering the use of comprehensively digitized storm sewer infrastructure and BMP design connectivity with spatial patterns in a geographic information system at the watershed scale. The goal was to compare total watershed pollutant removal efficiency in two study watersheds with differing spatial patterns of BMP design (traditional and LID), by quantifying the improved water quality benefit of LID BMP design. An estimate of uncertainty was included in the modeling framework by using ranges for BMP pollutant removal efficiencies that were based on the literature. Our model, using Monte Carlo analysis, predicted that the LID watershed removed approximately 78kg more nitrogen, 3kg more phosphorus, and 1,592kg more sediment per square kilometer as compared with the traditional watershed on an annual basis. Our research provides planners a valuable model to prioritize watersheds for BMP design based on model results or in optimizing BMP selection.																	1093-474X	1752-1688				OCT	2017	53	5					1081	1094		10.1111/1752-1688.12559								WOS:000412132000008

Designing and Implementing a Network for Sensing Water Quality and Hydrology across Mountain to Urban Transitions	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Water resources are increasingly impacted by growing human populations, land use, and climate changes, and complex interactions among biophysical processes. In an effort to better understand these factors in semiarid northern Utah, United States, we created a real-time observatory consisting of sensors deployed at aquatic and terrestrial stations to monitor water quality, water inputs, and outputs along mountain to urban gradients. The Gradients Along Mountain to Urban Transitions (GAMUT) monitoring network spans three watersheds with similar climates and streams fed by mountain winter-derived precipitation, but that differ in urbanization level, land use, and biophysical characteristics. The aquatic monitoring stations in the GAMUT network include sensors to measure chemical (dissolved oxygen, specific conductance, pH, nitrate, and dissolved organic matter), physical (stage, temperature, and turbidity), and biological components (chlorophyll-a and phycocyanin). We present the logistics of designing, implementing, and maintaining the network; quality assurance and control of numerous, large datasets; and data acquisition, dissemination, and visualization. Data from GAMUT reveal spatial differences in water quality due to urbanization and built infrastructure; capture rapid temporal changes in water quality due to anthropogenic activity; and identify changes in biological structure, each of which are demonstrated via case study datasets.																	1093-474X	1752-1688				OCT	2017	53	5					1095	1120		10.1111/1752-1688.12557								WOS:000412132000009

As a result, most models are calibrated and, if possible, validated using limited measured data. However, little research has been done to determine the impact of length of available calibration data on model parameterization and performance. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of length of calibration data (LCD) on parameterization and performance of the Agricultural Policy Environmental eXtender model for predicting daily, monthly, and annual streamflow. Long-term (1984-2015) measured daily streamflow data from Rock Creek watershed, an agricultural watershed in northern Ohio, were used for this study. Data were divided into five Short (5-year), two Medium (15-year), and one Long (25-year) streamflow calibration data scenarios. All LCD scenarios were calibrated and validated at three time steps: daily, monthly, and annual. Results showed LCD affected the ability of the model to accurately capture temporal variability in simulated streamflow. However, overall average streamflow, water budgets, and crop yields were simulated reasonably well for all LCD scenarios.																	1093-474X	1752-1688				OCT	2017	53	5					1164	1177		10.1111/1752-1688.12564								WOS:000412132000013

Lessons from Virginia Water Quality Trading Programs	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Governmental agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and agricultural organizations promote water quality trading programs as an innovative policy to engage agricultural producers in conservation activities. Cost analyses suggest regulated sources can reduce compliance costs by purchasing agricultural nonpoint source credits. Yet, such point-nonpoint trades are rare. This article assesses the demand for agricultural nonpoint sources in well-developed nutrient trading programs in Virginia for industrial and municipal wastewater treatment plants, municipal stormwater programs, and land developers. Evidence suggests nutrient trading programs in Virginia will not stimulate investments in pollutant reduction practices on working agricultural lands. The lack of demand for agricultural nonpoint source credits can be attributed to a substantial degree to the design features and incentives present in multiple overlapping regulatory programs. The legal setting that dampens regulated source demand for nonpoint source credits in Virginia is broadly representative of conditions found elsewhere in the United States.																	1093-474X	1752-1688				OCT	2017	53	5					1178	1194		10.1111/1752-1688.12565								WOS:000412132000014

Water Quality Signals from Rural Land Use and Exurbanization in a Mountain Landscape: What's Clear and What's Confounded?	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												In mountainous landscapes with high climatic and geomorphic variability, how do rural land uses and exurbanization alter hydrology and water quality? We evaluated effects of rural land use and exurbanization on streamflows, suspended sediment concentrations and loads, specific conductance, and summer water temperatures in 12 streams and rivers within the Upper Little Tennessee River basin in the southern Appalachian Mountains. Eleven streams featured low levels of development (>61% forest cover) but differed in land use patterning, basin size, annual precipitation, and watershed morphology. One urban stream, located within the largest town in the basin, provided the high development comparative endpoint. Even low levels of rural development and exurbanization were associated with substantial increases in suspended sediment concentrations, sediment loads, and summer stream temperature daily maxima and diurnal variation. Observed summer temperature increases were much larger than would be expected due to global climate change over the next century. Specific conductance was idiosyncratic among the smaller streams. These water quality changes were not accompanied by streamflow changes that were discernible amid the high natural variation in precipitation and geomorphology. The water quality findings suggest the need for applying the best management practices, including riparian buffers, to even low levels of rural development.																	1093-474X	1752-1688				OCT	2017	53	5					1212	1228		10.1111/1752-1688.12567								WOS:000412132000016

Unfortunately, there are few publicly available data sources at the local level and even fewer at the national scale. In this research, randomly selected points within agricultural lands were examined for selected conservation practices using Google Earth aerial imagery by a team of interpreters. In total, 13,530 points had field boundaries digitized, and were subsequently examined and classified. The presence of terraces, grassed waterways, contour farming, center pivot irrigation, strip cropping, ponds, riparian vegetation, filter strips, and land cover were noted. Subjectivity among interpreters was evaluated using duplicate samples and was found to be similar to image misclassification rates in other research. Conservation practice adoption rates for selected major river basins compared favorably with data collected by the Conservation Effects Assessment Project. The frequency of occurrence of each conservation practice was summarized and presented by ecoregion. To facilitate future research, point level data and software source code developed in this research are available via the web at . Aerial imagery was found to be a powerful, inexpensive, and easily accessible tool to assess large-scale conservation practice implementation for certain conservation practices.

A methodology for relating wetland configuration to human disturbance in Alberta	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Context Widespread loss of wetland ecosystems resulting from human land use highlights the need for a reclamation strategy that can sustain wetland ecosystem services. Since wetland function partly depends on landscape structure, reclamation and monitoring can be aided by knowing the differences in wetland configuration between undisturbed and disturbed landscapes. Objectives Identify a parsimonious set of landscape metrics for quantifying wetland configuration and land-cover composition, and quantify how these metrics vary with anthropogenic disturbance. Methods A large suite of landscape metrics quantifying area/edge, shape, aggregation, and diversity were calculated for landscapes in the Grassland, Parkland, and Boreal Natural Regions of Alberta. Variable reduction techniques were applied to identify representative metrics. These representative metrics were related to anthropogenic disturbance using non-parametric tests. Results The spatial configuration of wetlands in low-disturbance and high-disturbance landscapes were significantly different from other landscapes. Aggregation metrics were the most commonly identified measures of wetland configuration independent of wetland-proportion in the landscape. Conclusions Our findings provide insight for reclamation and monitoring by showing that some aspects of wetland configuration vary independently of composition, and therefore both need to be considered when parameterizing the design of reclaimed landscapes. We suggest that using landscape metrics in a reference condition approach is appropriate for evaluating landscape degradation and for setting landscape reclamation targets and monitoring programs.																	0921-2973	1572-9761				OCT	2017	32	10					2059	2076		10.1007/s10980-017-0566-z								WOS:000412693200010						
J	Hornsey, W; Service, B				Hornsey, Warren; Service, Bill			A major failure involving an exposed geotextile to contain dredged spoil	GEOTEXTILES AND GEOMEMBRANES												The development of facility for the export of LNG from coal seam gas required a major dredging program which, due to the proximity of the Great Barrier Reef, was subject to strict environmental conditions. Most of the dredged spoil was required to be disposed of into a purpose-built bunded disposal area, constructed over existing seabed shallows. The as constructed rock fill embankment unintentionally allowed significant leakage of dredged spoil through and along much of its perimeter, compromising the disposal area's effectiveness in meeting water quality requirements. The loss of the dredged material through the embankment was primarily attributed to the geotextile component of the wall not performing as anticipated by the design and construct alliance. The design and construction factors that lead to the failure are discussed. Guidance is provided so as to avoid similar designs from being implemented in the future. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

A hydrochemical study was performed in an area of SW Guatemala (Samala River basin), where water supply to population is groundwater-based and no systematic studies on its groundwater resources have been performed so far. Traditional hydrochemical analyses on major ions and some trace elements metals coupled with chemometric approach were performed, including principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis. Results evidence that chemical differentiation is linked to the spatial distribution of sampled waters. The most common hydrochemical fades, bicarbonate calcium and magnesium, is linked to infiltration of meteoric waters in recharge areas represented by highlands surrounding Xela caldera, a wide plateau where most of population is concentrated. This trend undergoes chemical evolution in proximity of active volcanic complexes in the southern area, with enrichment in sulphate, chloride and magnesium. Chemical evolution also occurs towards the centre of Xela caldera due to slow circulation in aquifer and consequent sodium enrichment due to ion exchange with the porous medium. Water quality did not reveal severe concerns, even though some sources of contamination could be identified; in particular, agriculture and urban wastewater could be responsible for observed threshold exceedances in nitrate and lead. This integrated multi-approach to hydrochemical data interpretation yielded to the achievement of important information that poses the basis for future groundwater protection in an area where main water features were almost unknown.

The macro-tidal Gironde Estuary is characterized by a highly concentrated turbidity maximum zone (TMZ). Field observations show that hypoxia occurs in summer in the TMZ at low river flow and a few days after the spring tide peak. In situ data highlight lower dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations around the city of Bordeaux, located in the upper estuary. Interactions between multiple factors limit the understanding of the processes controlling the dynamics of hypoxia. A 3D biogeochemical model was developed, coupled with hydrodynamics and a sediment transport model, to assess the contribution of the TMZ and the impact of urban effluents through wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and sewage overflows (SOS) on hypoxia. Our model describes the transport of solutes and suspended material and the biogeochemical mechanisms impacting oxygen: primary production, degradation of all organic matter (i.e. including phytoplankton respiration, degradation of river and urban watershed matter), nitrification and gas exchange. The composition and the degradation rates of each variable were characterized by in situ measurements and experimental data from the study area. The DO model was validated against observations in Bordeaux City. The simulated DO concentrations show good agreement with field observations and satisfactorily reproduce the seasonal and neap-spring time scale variations around the city of Bordeaux. Simulations show a spatial and temporal correlation between the formation of summer hypoxia and the location of the TMZ, with minimum DO centered in the vicinity of Bordeaux. To understand the contribution of the urban watershed forcing, different simulations with the presence or absence of urban effluents were compared. Our results show that in summer, a reduction of POC from SO would increase the DO minimum in the vicinity of Bordeaux by 3% of saturation. Omitting discharge from SO and WWTPs, DO would improve by 10% of saturation and mitigate hypoxic events. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, the spatial and temporal variability in nitrate (NO3-), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) was analyzed in the Selke (Germany) river continuum from three headwaters draining 1-3 km(2) catchments to two downstream reaches representing spatially integrated signals from 184-456 km(2) catchments. Three headwater catchments were selected as archetypes of the main landscape units (land use x lithology) present in the Selke catchment. Export regimes in headwater catchments were interpreted in terms of NO3-, DOC and SRP land-to-stream transfer processes. Headwater signals were subtracted from downstream signals, with the differences interpreted in terms of in-stream processes and contributions from point sources. The seasonal dynamics for NO3- were opposite those of DOC and SRP in all three headwater catchments, and spatial differences also showed NO3- contrasting with DOC and SRP. These dynamics were interpreted as the result of the interplay of hydrological and biogeochemical processes, for which riparian zones were hypothesized to play a determining role. In the two downstream reaches, NO3- was transported almost conservatively, whereas DOC was consumed and produced in the upper and lower river sections, respectively. The natural export regime of SRP in the three headwater catchments mimicked a point-source signal (high SRP during summer low flow), which may lead to overestimation of domestic contributions in the downstream reaches. Monitoring the river continuum from headwaters to downstream reaches proved effective to jointly investigate land-to-stream and in-stream transport, and transformation processes.

M.			Hydrological controls on DOC: nitrate resource stoichiometry in a lowland, agricultural catchment, southern UK	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The role that hydrology plays in governing the interactions between dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen in rivers draining lowland, agricultural landscapes is currently poorly understood. In light of the potential changes to the production and delivery of DOC and nitrate to rivers arising from climate change and land use management, there is a pressing need to improve our understanding of hydrological controls on DOC and nitrate dynamics in such catchments. We measured DOC and nitrate concentrations in river water of six reaches of the lowland river Hampshire Avon (Wiltshire, southern UK) in order to quantify the relationship between BFI (BFI) and DOC: nitrate molar ratios across contrasting geologies (Chalk, Greensand, and clay). We found a significant positive relationship between nitrate and BFI (p < 0.0001), and a significant negative relationship between DOC and BFI (p < 0.0001), resulting in a non-linear negative correlation between DOC: nitrate molar ratio and BFI. In the Hampshire Avon, headwater reaches which are underlain by clay and characterized by a more flashy hydrological regime are associated with DOC: nitrate ratios > 5 throughout the year, whilst groundwater-dominated reaches underlain by Chalk, with a high BFI have DOC: nitrate ratios in surface waters that are an order of magnitude lower (< 0.5). Our analysis also reveals significant seasonal variations in DOC: nitrate transport and highlights critical periods of nitrate export (e.g. winter in sub-catchments underlain by Chalk and Greensand, and autumn in drained, clay sub-catchments) when DOC: nitrate molar ratios are low, suggesting low potential for in-stream uptake of inorganic forms of nitrogen. Consequently, our study emphasizes the tight relationship between DOC and nitrate availability in agricultural catchments, and further reveals that this relationship is controlled to a great extent by the hydrological setting.

Using physically based arguments, we refine the transfer of wind energy to basin-scale internal waves (BSIWs). We consider the properties of the basin, the characteristics of the wind time series and the stability of the water column to filter and thereby optimize the magnitude of wind energy transferred to BSIWs. We show that this filtering procedure can significantly improve the accuracy of modelled temperatures, especially in the deep water of lakes such as Lake Geneva, for which the root mean square error between observed and simulated temperatures was reduced by up to 40 %. The modification, tested on four different lakes, increases model accuracy and contributes to a significantly better reproduction of seasonal deep convective mixing, a fundamental parameter for biogeochemical processes such as oxygen depletion. It also improves modelling over long time series for the purpose of climate change studies.

Existing measurement techniques, however, are not capable of resolving sediment-water fluxes of most constituents under in situ flow conditions. We investigated whether relaxed eddy accumulation (REA), a micrometeorological technique with conditional sampling of turbulent updrafts and downdrafts, can be adapted to the aquatic environment. We simulated REA fluxes by reanalyzing eddy covariance measurements from a riverine lake. We found that the empirical coefficient that relates mass fluxes to the concentration difference between both REA samples is invariant with scalar and flow and responds as predicted by a joint Gaussian distribution of linearly correlated variables. Simulated REA fluxes differed on average by around 30% from eddy covariance fluxes (mean absolute error). Assessment of the lower quantification limit suggests that REA can potentially be applied for measuring benthic fluxes of a new range of constituents that cannot be assessed by standard eddy covariance methods.

The potential impact of green agendas on historic river landscapes: Numerical modelling of multiple weir removal in the Derwent Valley Mills world heritage site, UK	GEOMORPHOLOGY												The exploitation of river systems for power and navigation has commonly been achieved through the installation of a variety of in-channel obstacles of which weirs in Britain are amongst the most common. In the UK, the historic value of many of these features is recognised by planning designations and protection more commonly associated with historic buildings and other major monuments. Their construction, particularly in the north and west of Britain, has often been associated with industries such as textiles, chemicals, and mining, which have polluted waterways with heavy metals and other contaminants. The construction of weirs altered local channel gradients resulting in sedimentation upstream with the potential as well for elevated levels of contamination in sediments deposited there. For centuries these weirs have remained largely undisturbed, but as a result of the growth in hydropower and the drive to improve water quality under the European Union's Water Framework Directive, these structures are under increasing pressure to be modified or removed altogether. At present, weir modifications appear to be considered largely on an individual basis, with little focus on the wider impacts this might have on valley floor environments. Using a numerical modelling approach, this paper simulates the removal of major weirs along a 24-km stretch of the river Derwent, Derbyshire, UK, designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The results suggest that although removal would not result in significant changes to the valley morphology, localised erosion would occur upstream of structures as the river readjusts its base level to new boundary conditions. Modelling indicates that sediment would also be evacuated away from the study area. In the context of the Derwent valley, this raises the potential for the remobilisation of contaminants (legacy sediments) within the wider floodplain system, which could have detrimental, long-term health and environmental implications for the river system. Worldwide, rivers have a common association with industry being the focus of settlement and development since the earliest civilisations with channel engineering a common practice. Therefore, the conceptual issues raised by this study have global resonance and are particularly important where heritage protection is less robust and structures can be removed with little consideration of the environmental consequences.																	0169-555X	1872-695X				SEP 15	2017	293		A				37	52		10.1016/j.geomorph.2017.05.009								WOS:000412257100004

Identifying the spatial pattern and importance of hydro-geomorphic drainage impairments on unpaved roads in the northeastern USA	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Roads have been widely studied as sources of runoff and sediment and identified as pollutant production sources to receiving waters. Despite the wealth of research on logging roads in forested, upland settings, little work has been conducted to examine the role of extensive networks of rural, low-volume, unpaved roads on water quality degradation at the catchment scale. We studied a network of municipal unpaved roads in the northeastern US to identify the type and spatial extent of hydro-geomorphic impairments' to water quality. We mapped erosional and depositional features on roads to develop an estimate of pollutant production. We also mapped the type and location of design interventions or best management practices (BMPs) used to improve road drainage and mitigate water quality impairment. We used statistical analyses to identify key controls on the frequency and magnitude of erosional features on the road network, and GIS to scale up from the survey results to the catchment scale to identify the likely importance of unpaved roads as a pollutant source in this setting. An average of 21 hydro-geomorphic impairments were mapped per kilometer of road, averaging 0.3m(3) in volume. Road gradient and slope position were key controls on the occurrence of these features. The presence of BMPs effectively reduced erosion frequency. Scaled up to the watershed and using a conservative estimate of road-stream connectivity, our results for the Winooski River watershed in the northeastern US suggest that roughly 16% and 6% of the average annual sediment and phosphorus flux, respectively, of the Winooski River may be derived from unpaved roads. Our study identifies an under-appreciated source of water quality degradation in rural watersheds, provides insights into identifying hot spots' of pollutant production associated with these networks, and points to effectiveness of design interventions in mitigating these adverse impacts on water quality.

S.; Yang, Jia; Pan, Shufen			Global manure nitrogen production and application in cropland during 1860-2014: a 5 arcmin gridded global dataset for Earth system modeling	EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA												Given the important role of nitrogen input from livestock systems in terrestrial nutrient cycles and the atmospheric chemical composition, it is vital to have a robust estimation of the magnitude and spatiotemporal variation in manure nitrogen production and its application to cropland across the globe. In this study, we used the dataset from the Global Livestock Impact Mapping System (GLIMS) in conjunction with country-specific annual livestock populations to reconstruct the manure nitrogen production during 1860-2014. The estimated manure nitrogen production increased from 21.4 TgN yr(-1) in 1860 to 131.0 Tg N yr(-1) in 2014 with a significant annual increasing trend (0.7 Tg N yr(-1), p < 0.01). Changes in manure nitrogen production exhibited high spatial variability and concentrated in several hotspots (e.g., Western Europe, India, northeastern China, and southeastern Australia) across the globe over the study period. In the 1860s, the northern midlatitude region was the largest manure producer, accounting for similar to 52% of the global total, while low-latitude regions became the largest share (similar to 48 %) in the most recent 5 years (2010-2014). Among all the continents, Asia accounted for over one-fourth of the global manure production during 1860-2014. Cattle dominated the manure nitrogen production and contributed similar to 44% of the total manure nitrogen production in 2014, followed by goats, sheep, swine, and chickens. The manure nitrogen application to cropland accounts for less than one-fifth of the total manure nitrogen production over the study period. The 5 arcmin gridded global dataset of manure nitrogen production generated from this study could be used as an input for global or regional land surface and ecosystem models to evaluate the impacts of manure nitrogen on key biogeochemical processes and water quality. To ensure food security and environmental sustainability, it is necessary to implement proper manure management practices on cropland across the globe.

J	Buchanan, GA; Belton, TJ; Paudel, B				Buchanan, Gary A.; Belton, Thomas J.; Paudel, Bhanu			The Comprehensive Barnegat Bay Research Program	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												A comprehensive ecosystem research strategy was developed and initiated for the Barnegat Bay-Little Egg Harbor (BB-LEH) estuary in New Jersey, United States. This multiyear program (2011-15) examined several environmental management issues and questions involving concerns with water quality (e.g., nutrients) and the health of this ecosystem (e.g., eutrophication). Multiple projects ranging from the assessment of phytoplankton to fish to wetlands, as well as hydrodynamic/water quality and ecosystem modeling, were conducted each year to fill in critical data gaps and to define the bay's baseline condition for future comparisons (e.g., a nuclear generating station on the bay with a once-through cooling system will close in 2019). Issues of concern for environmental agencies and the public include nuisance jellyfish; excess nutrients; benefits of conservation zones; and the status of fish, crab, and shellfish populations. Three projects examined the potential for developing biological indicators of nutrient (i.e. nitrogen and phosphorus) effects. Three other projects studied the unique habitat features (i.e. salt marshes, sedge islands, submerged aquatic vegetation beds) in BB-LEH that may need protection and/or restoration. Ecosystem baseline conditions were examined by six projects, and data were used in the Ecopath-Ecosim model to predict potential future changes in the biomass of major biological groups and species using specific scenarios (i.e. closure of the Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station, reducing nutrient inputs and fishery management plans). Noteworthy is the collection of these data pre- and post-Superstorm Sandy, which made landfall a few kilometers south of the estuary in 2012. The subsequent 19 papers in this special issue provide an in-depth examination of these areas of concern, the results of which are exceedingly relevant to the management of this and other estuarine systems.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				FAL	2017					78		1	6		10.2112/SI78-001.1								WOS:000417480200001

Barnegat Bay and its tributaries were evaluated for multiple water quality metrics and from various perspectives. The nutrient concentrations and loadings from the tributaries in the northern watershed are higher than those from the tributaries in the southern portion of the watershed. Within Barnegat Bay, higher nitrogen concentrations were observed in the northern portion, while higher total phosphorus (TP) concentrations occurred in the southern portion. Daily variability of water quality at certain locations was observed from the results of intensive sampling events (six samples per day over 4 consecutive days of sampling). Analysis of multiple years of data suggests that water quality has not varied significantly year to year from 2011 to 2015. Violation of the existing applicable numeric criterion was identified for dissolved oxygen, TP, and turbidity within some assessment units in Barnegat Bay and its watershed. A comparison made between these data and the targets used by other estuaries in the NE United States related to nutrient criteria found that portions of the bay would not achieve the water quality thresholds used by these other estuaries.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				FAL	2017					78		7	21		10.2112/SI78-002.1								WOS:000417480200002

Data evaluated spanned from the 1970s through July of 2013. Trends were evaluated after regionalizing sampling locations into 17 geographic zones. Over 1700 sampling stations within freshwater and Bay zones provided over 280,000 data results for 20 parameters. The parameters evaluated include: temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, nutrients, indicator bacteria, and solids. Temperature data comparing the 1970s with the present show statistically significant increasing trends in 13 of 17 zones during the summer months. Seven of those zones also saw increasing temperatures in at least one other season. Increasing trends were also seen for salinity in 8 of the 10 estuarine zones for two or more seasons. Potentially related to the increasing trends in salinity and temperature, DO concentrations were often decreasing or unchanged. Significant decreases in DO concentration can be seen in 12 of the 17 zones for one or more seasons. The pH was shown to be increasing in 10 of the 17 zones during one to four seasons. Four zones experienced a decreasing trend in pH, but only during one to two seasons. The interpretation of the nutrient data over this long time period proved to be a challenge, with multiple species of nitrogen and phosphorus reported but often with insufficient data to draw significant conclusions. Where data were sufficient, nutrient results were mixed, with many zones showing no changes in trends.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				FAL	2017					78		22	33		10.2112/SI78-003.1								WOS:000417480200003

Toward a Comprehensive Water-Quality Modeling of Barnegat Bay: Development of ROMS to WASP Coupler	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												The Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) has been coupled with the Water Quality Analysis Simulation Program (WASP) to be used in a comprehensive analysis of water quality in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey. The coupler can spatially aggregate hydrodynamic information in ROMS cells into larger WASP segments. It can also be used to resample ROMS output at a finer temporal scale to meet WASP time-stepping requirements. The coupler aggregates flow components, temperature, and salinity in ROMS output for input to WASP via a hydrodynamic linkage file. The coupler was tested initially with idealized cases designed to verify the water mass balance and conservation of constituent mass using one-to-one and one-to-many connectivity options between segments. A realistic example from the Toms River embayment, a subdomain of Barnegat Bay, was used to demonstrate the functionality of the coupling. A WASP eutrophication model accounting for dissolved oxygen (DO), nitrogen, and constant phytoplankton concentrations was applied to explore the distribution and trends in DO and nitrogen in the embayment for the period of July-August 2012. Results of DO modeling indicate satisfactory agreement with measurements collected at in-bay stations and also indicate that this coupled approach, despite substantial differences in spatiotemporal discretization between the models, provides adequate predictive capabilities.

Synchronized phytoplankton and water-quality data collected between August 2011 and August 2013 from the Barnegat Bay Water Quality Monitoring Program were used as calibration data set. The results showed that one-fifth of samples were from the least-impaired habitat condition, with low turbidity and low concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and orthophosphate (PO4). Nearly 60% of samples were from undesirable conditions with poor water clarity and excess nutrients. Phytoplankton reference communities, in comparison with communities in impaired conditions, were characterized with low concentrations of chlorophyll a (Chl a), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP), low Chl a/C ratio, low summer picoplankton biomass, and high spring and summer dissolved oxygen. Thirty-four metrics were evaluated for their ability to discriminate between the least-impaired and impaired habitat conditions. Nine phytoplankton metrics and three physiological and chemical metrics, which showed strong discriminatory ability, were selected, and different combinations of these metrics were used to create phytoplankton indices for spring and summer mesohaline and polyhaline zones in BB-LEH. The current P-IBI was able to correctly classify 64-100% for spring samples and 68-88% for summer samples in the calibration data set. Our work is the first attempt to develop a P-IBI for this region. The calculated reference communities and P-IBI, though constrained because of limited data availability, were region specific and intended to facilitate water-quality assessment and management efforts in BB-LEH. The differences of TN and TP between the least-impaired and impaired conditions in most of season-salinity zones suggested that dual reduction of N and P are necessary to control eutrophication in BB-LEH. Further work on the refinement of the P-IBI is underway as additional phytoplankton and water-quality data are being collected and assessed.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				FAL	2017					78		89	105		10.2112/SI78-009.1								WOS:000417480200009

Zooplankton Community Dynamics in a Western Mid-Atlantic Lagoonal Estuary	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Zooplankton are an integral component of the food web in estuarine ecosystems. The most recent studies of zooplankton in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey, occurred almost 40 years ago. Since then, this coastal lagoon estuary has been affected by anthropogenic impacts that threaten its ecological integrity, including nutrient enrichment, algal blooms, alterations of freshwater inputs, and extensive development around the bay and its watershed. Assessing the zooplankton community in this ecosystem provided updated information on the status of this important component of the bay's living resources. Zooplankton samples were collected from the upper meter of the water column with horizontal surface net tows using bongo plankton nets monthly during the winter and twice a month during spring, summer, and fall. Sites were located along a longitudinal transect in the bay. Data included abundance and distribution of copepods, gelatinous macrozooplankton, bivalves, and decapods. The zooplankton community was characterized by strong spatial, seasonal, and interannual trends in abundance and diversity. Spatial variability is most apparent between the northern and southern sections of the bay. The northern bay was characterized by higher nitrogen and chlorophyll a; high abundances of copepods, ctenophores, and barnacle larvae; and lowest species diversity. Alkalinity, phosphate, and species diversity were higher in the southern bay. This was a typical pattern for the study, remaining stable even between seasons. It is apparent that direct and/or indirect effects of weather and climate affect zooplankton abundance in Barnegat Bay. Such sensitivity to changes in weather patterns has the potential to cause long- term shifts in the zooplankton community as a result of climate change.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				FAL	2017					78		141	168		10.2112/SI78-012.1								WOS:000417480200012

The data depicted that calcium and bicarbonates were dominating among the cations and anions. The results indicate the trend of cation dominance as Ca2+ > Na+>Mg2+ > K+, whereas anion dominance was in the order of HCO3- > Cl- > SO42-. Ratio of calcium to magnesium indicated the dissolution of Ca2+ from CaCO3, which results in an increased levels of Ca2+ in the groundwater. Interpretation of Piper Trilinear plot understands the various geochemical processes affecting the groundwater quality and shows groundwater was dominated by Ca-HCO3 type. The pH was recorded in the slightly alkalinity range 7.2-7.8 and was showing positive correlation with HCO3-. The chloro-alkaline indices revealed 86% of the sources exchange by a type of base-exchange reactions, rest by cation-anion exchange. Gibbs diagram revealed groundwater sources fall in the category of rock dominance. The concentration of the nitrogen compounds was in the progression of NO3-N > NH4- N > NO2-N, and the PO4- fluctuated from 0.12 to 0.22 mg/L. Moreover, corrosivity ratio indicated that water from the majority of sources (71%) is safe to supply using pipes without any corrosive effects, while 29% of sources are corrosive in nature and need non-corrosive pipes for transporting and lifting of groundwater. The results revealed, groundwater samples were within permissible limits as prescribed by International and National standards, for drinking purposes. The State government and NGO's can show their interest in utilizing such water resources to overcome the shortage of drinking water in a sustainable way for the daily consumption of the people living in the vicinity of Jhelum River.

J	Huang, HZ; Sang, SX; Miao, Y; Dong, ZT; Zhang, HJ				Huang, Huazhou; Sang, Shuxun; Miao, Yao; Dong, Zaitian; Zhang, Huajun			Trends of ionic concentration variations in water coproduced with coalbed methane in the Tiefa Basin	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY												The primary objective of this study is to investigate the trends of water quality in coproduced water over time. Forty-six water samples were collected over the drainage time from 2 to 2028 d from 12 coalbed methane wells in the Beier mining area of the Daxing Mine in the Tiefa Basin, which is a continental deposit in China. Nine ions, including chloride, nitrate, sulfate, bicarbonate, carbonate, potassium, sodium, calcium, and magnesium, were tested using an Ion-chromatograph ICS-1500. The results indicate that the water quality of coproduced water has a close relationship with the drainage time. The variations of water quality are distinguished into three stages relative to the drainage time, wherein the major ions contributed to the TDS are different in each stage. The water contains Na-Cl in the first stage, after which the water type transforms to Na-HCO3-Cl and finally turns into Na-HCO3. Higher concentrations of chloride, sulfate, calcium, and magnesium, are the representative characteristics of the first stage, which are consequences of the impact of the fracturing fluid. The second stage is characterized by the decline of chloride, sulfate, calcium, and magnesium concentrations and an increase of bicarbonate and carbonate proportion in TDS. As the drainage time increases, the major components of the TDS in the third stage change to bicarbonate, sodium, and carbonate from the second stage ions of bicarbonate, sodium, chloride, and the variation of ionic concentration tends toward stability in the third stage. After long drainage periods, the water quality of coproduced water tends to be similar to that of the original formation water.																	0166-5162	1872-7840				SEP 1	2017	182						32	41		10.1016/j.coal.2017.08.010								WOS:000413882900003

Quantifying the impact of community-scale flood mitigation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION												Federal, State, and local governments, non-governmental organizations, and independent local community organizations spend billions of dollars on watershed management activities. The goals of watershed management projects may span a wide spectrum including, but limited to flood reduction, soil erosion reduction, water quality improvement or protection, and/or increase source of wood fiber for fuel or construction material. Accomplishing these goals is commonly done through revegetation campaigns, construction of small-scale hydraulic works, contour terracing, and urban development planning, among others. An ongoing challenge for these agencies, along with local stakeholders is to understand the various individual and combined impacts of different mitigation measures. The methodology and models developed and applied herein provide important tools for examining the feasibility of construction and the likely impacts of gabion dams and vegetation coverage applications (e.g., hillside and channel revegetation campaigns) in steep mountainous areas upstream of populated areas. The purpose of this investigation is to quantify the impact of changes in the size and location of the gabion dams and of changes in vegetation coverage in the Ravine Millet watershed near Port-au-Price, Haiti. This environment frequently experiences strong convective precipitation events, often the result of hurricane passage over the region. Intensity-Duration-Frequency curves were developed with available data, which were then used to develop design storms associated with different return period frequencies. Hourly satellite-derived precipitation was used to identify the shape and duration of various return period storm events. This investigation then applies some commonly available hydrologic and hydraulic models and various concomitant tools used to construct those models, along with a Kinematic Routing Model to assess the impact of various mitigation strategies. Storm events with multiple peaks of similar magnitude interact with channel geometry and other hydraulic characteristics and may result in peak delay or reduce the time of arrival and may increase or decrease the magnitude of flood peaks. Results indicate that hillslope revegetation impacts to flood peak and the time or arrival of flood peaks at the watershed outlet are limited to relatively low return period storms. Results also indicate that channel vegetation can reduce the peak discharge and significantly delay the arrival of flood peaks. The combined impacts of gabion dams and channel vegetation are highly non-linear, and depend on the shape and duration of storm peaks.																	2212-4209					SEP	2017	24						189	208		10.1016/j.ijdrr.2017.06.001								WOS:000413936100022

Rob; Krause, Stefan			High-frequency monitoring of catchment nutrient exports reveals highly variable storm event responses and dynamic source zone activation	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Storm events can drive highly variable behavior in catchment nutrient and water fluxes, yet short-term event dynamics are frequently missed by low-resolution sampling regimes. In addition, nutrient source zone contributions can vary significantly within and between storm events. Our inability to identify and characterize time-dynamic source zone contributions severely hampers the adequate design of land use management practices in order to control nutrient exports from agricultural landscapes. Here we utilize an 8month high-frequency (hourly) time series of streamflow, nitrate (NO3-N), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and hydroclimatic variables for a headwater agricultural catchment. We identified 29 distinct storm events across the monitoring period. These events represented 31% of the time series and contributed disproportionately to nutrient loads (42% of NO3-N and 43% of DOC) relative to their duration. Regression analysis identified a small subset of hydroclimatological variables (notably precipitation intensity and antecedent conditions) as key drivers of nutrient dynamics during storm events. Hysteresis analysis of nutrient concentration-discharge relationships highlighted the dynamic activation of discrete NO3-N and DOC source zones, which varied on an event-specific basis. Our results highlight the benefits of high-frequency in situ monitoring for characterizing short-term nutrient fluxes and unraveling connections between hydroclimatological variability and river nutrient export and source zone activation under extreme flow conditions. These new process-based insights, which we summarize in a conceptual model, are fundamental to underpinning targeted management measures to reduce nutrient loading of surface waters.

J	Isazadeh, M; Biazar, SM; Ashrafzadeh, A				Isazadeh, Mohammad; Biazar, Seyed Mostafa; Ashrafzadeh, Afshin			Support vector machines and feed-forward neural networks for spatial modeling of groundwater qualitative parameters	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The present study attempts to model the spatial variability of three groundwater qualitative parameters in Guilan Province, northern Iran, using artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector machines (SVMs). Data collected from 140 observation wells for the years 2002-2014 were used. Five variables, X and Y coordinates of the observation well, distance of the observation well from the shoreline, areal average 6-month rainfall depth, and groundwater level at the day of water quality sampling, were considered as primary input variables. In addition, nine qualitative variables were also considered as auxiliary input variables. Electrical conductivity (EC), sodium concentration (Na+),and sulfate concentration (SO42-) of the groundwater in the region were estimated using ANNs and SVMs with different input combinations. The results showed that both ANNs and SVMs work well when the only primary input variable is the well location. The ANN yielded an RMSE of 1.03 mEq/l for SO42-, 1.05 mEq/l for Na+, and 203.17 mu S/cm for EC, using the X and Y coordinates of the observation wells in the study area. In the case of SVM, these values were, respectively, 0.87, 0.87, and 176.68. Considering the auxiliary input variables (pH, EC, and the concentrations of Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, SO42-, and HCO3-) resulted in a significant decrease in the RMSE of both ANNs (0.22, 0.30, and 33.04) and SVMs (0.26, 0.34, and 36.23). Comparing these RMSE values with those of cokriging interpolation technique (0.59, 0.98, and 177.59) indicated that ANNs and SVMs produced more accurate estimates of the three qualitative parameters. The relative importance of auxiliary input variables was also determined using Gamma test. The output uncertainty of ANNs and SVMs were determined using p-factor and d-factor. The results showed that SVMs have less uncertainty than ANNs.

The role of alluvial aquifer sediments in attenuating a dissolved arsenic plume	JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY												In a crude-oil-contaminated sandy aquifer at the Bemidji site in northern Minnesota, biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons has resulted in release of naturally occurring As to groundwater under Fe-reducing conditions. This study used chemical extractions of aquifer sediments collected in 1993 and 2011-2014 to evaluate the relationship between Fe and As in different redox zones (oxic, methanogenic, Fe-reducing, anoxic-suboxic transition) of the contaminated aquifer over a twenty-year period. Results show that 1) the aquifer has the capacity to naturally attenuate the plume of dissolved As, primarily through sorption; 2) Fe and As are linearly correlated in sediment across all redox zones, and a regression analysis between Fe and As reasonably predicted As concentrations in sediment from 1993 using only Fe concentrations; 3) an As-rich "iron curtain," associated with the anoxic-suboxic transition zone, migrated 30 m downgradient between 1993 and 2013 as a result of the hydrocarbon plume evolution; and 4) silt lenses in the aquifer preferentially sequester dissolved As, though As is remobilized into groundwater from sediment after reducing conditions are established. Using results of this study coupled with historical data, we develop a conceptual model which summarizes the natural attenuation of As and Fe over time and space that can be applied to other sites that experience As mobilization due to an influx of bioavailable organic matter.

J	Chen, L; Sun, C; Wang, GB; Xie, H; Shen, ZY				Chen, Lei; Sun, Cheng; Wang, Guobo; Xie, Hui; Shen, Zhenyao			Event-based nonpoint source pollution prediction in a scarce data catchment	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Quantifying the rainfall-runoff-pollutant (R-R-P) process is key to regulating non-point source (NPS) pollution; however, the impacts of scarce measured data on R-R-P simulations have not yet been reported. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive study of scarce data that addressed both rainfall-runoff and runoff-pollutant processes, whereby the impacts of data scarcity on two commonly used methods, including Unit Hydrograph (UH) and Loads Estimator (LOADEST), were quantified. A case study was performed in a typical small catchment of the Three Gorges Reservoir Region (TGRR) of China. Based on our results, the classification of rainfall patterns should be carried out first when analyzing modeling results. Compared to data based on a missing rate and a missing location, key information generates more impacts on the simulated flow and NPS loads. When the scarcity rate exceeds a certain threshold (20% in this study), measured data scarcity level has clear impacts on the model's accuracy. As the model of total nitrogen (TN) always performs better under different data scarcity conditions, researchers are encouraged to pay more attention to continuous the monitoring of total phosphorus (TP) for better NPS-TP predictions. The results of this study serve as baseline information for hydrologic forecasting and for the further control of NPS pollutants. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Evaluation of wetland implementation strategies on phosphorus reduction at a watershed scale	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Excessive nutrient use in agricultural practices is a major cause of water quality degradation around the world, which results in eutrophication of the freshwater systems. Among the nutrients, phosphorus enrichment has recently drawn considerable attention due to major environmental issues such as Lake Erie and Chesapeake Bay eutrophication. One approach for mitigating the impacts of excessive nutrients on water resources is the implementation of wetlands. However, proper site selection for wetland implementation is the key for effective water quality management at the watershed scale, which is the goal of this study. In this regard, three conventional and two pseudo-random targeting methods were considered. A watershed model called the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was coupled with another model called System for Urban Stormwater Treatment and Analysis IntegratioN (SUSTAIN) to simulate the impacts of wetland implementation scenarios in the Saginaw River watershed, located in Michigan. The inter-group similarities of the targeting strategies were investigated and it was shown that the level of similarity increases as the target area increases (0.54-0.86). In general, the conventional targeting method based on phosphorus load generated per unit area at the subwatershed scale had the highest average reduction among all the scenarios (44.46 t/year). However, when considering the total area of implemented wetlands, the conventional method based on long-term impacts of wetland implementation showed the highest amount of phosphorus reduction (36.44 t/year).

Stormwater infiltration and the 'urban karst' - A review	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The covering of native soils with impervious surfaces (e.g. roofs, roads, and pavement) prevents infiltration of rainfall into the ground, resulting in increased surface runoff and decreased groundwater recharge. When this excess water is managed using stormwater drainage systems, flow and water quality regimes of urban streams are severely altered, leading to the degradation of their ecosystems. Urban streams restoration requires alternative approaches towards stormwater management, which aim to restore the flow regime towards pre-development conditions. The practice of stormwater infiltration achieved using a range of stormwater source-control measures (SCM5) is central to restoring baseflow. Despite this, little is known about what happens to the infiltrated water. Current knowledge about the impact of stormwater infiltration on flow regimes was reviewed. Infiltration systems were found to be efficient at attenuating high-flow hydrology (reducing peak magnitudes and frequencies) at a range of scales (parcel, streetscape, catchment). Several modelling studies predict a positive impact of stormwater infiltration on baseflow, and empirical evidence is emerging, but the fate of infiltrated stormwater remains unclear. It is not known how infiltrated water travels along the subsurface pathways that characterise the urban environment, in particular the 'urban karst', which results from networks of human-made subsurface pathways, e.g. stormwater and sanitary sewer pipes and associated high permeability trenches. Seepage of groundwater into and around such pipes is possible, meaning some infiltrated stormwater could travel along artificial pathways. The catchment-scale ability of infiltration systems to restore groundwater recharge and base flow is thus ambiguous. Further understanding of the fate of infiltrated stormwater is required to ensure infiltration systems deliver optimal outcomes for waterway flow regimes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Hosseini, M; Kerachian, R				Hosseini, Marjan; Kerachian, Reza			A data fusion-based methodology for optimal redesign of groundwater monitoring networks	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												In this paper, a new data fusion-based methodology is presented for spatio-temporal (S-T) redesigning of Groundwater Level Monitoring Networks (GLMNs). The kriged maps of three different criteria (i.e. marginal entropy of water table levels, estimation error variances of mean values of water table levels, and estimation values of long-term changes in water level) are combined for determining monitoring sub-areas of high and low priorities in order to consider different spatial patterns for each sub-area. The best spatial sampling scheme is selected by applying a new method, in which a regular hexagonal gridding pattern and the Thiessen polygon approach are respectively utilized in sub-areas of high and low monitoring priorities. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and a S-T kriging models are used to simulate water level fluctuations. To improve the accuracy of the predictions, results of the ANN and S-T kriging models are combined using a data fusion technique. The concept of Value of Information (VOI) is utilized to determine two stations with maximum information values in both sub-areas with high and low monitoring priorities. The observed groundwater level data of these two stations are considered for the power of trend detection, estimating periodic fluctuations and mean values of the stationary components, which are used for determining non-uniform sampling frequencies for sub-areas. The proposed methodology is applied to the Dehgolan plain in northwestern Iran. The results show that a new sampling configuration with 35 and 7 monitoring stations and sampling intervals of 20 and 32 days, respectively in sub-areas with high and low monitoring priorities, leads to a more efficient monitoring network than the existing one containing 52 monitoring stations and monthly temporal sampling.

J	Qi, SQ; Hou, DY; Luo, J				Qi, Shengqi; Hou, Deyi; Luo, Jian			Optimization of groundwater sampling approach under various hydrogeological conditions using a numerical simulation model	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												This study presents a numerical model based on field data to simulate groundwater flow in both the aquifer and the well-bore for the low-flow sampling method and the well-volume sampling method. The numerical model was calibrated to match well with field drawdown, and calculated flow regime in the well was used to predict the variation of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration during the purging period. The model was then used to analyze sampling representativeness and sampling time. Site characteristics, such as aquifer hydraulic conductivity, and sampling choices, such as purging rate and screen length, were found to be significant determinants of sampling representativeness and required sampling time. Results demonstrated that: (1) DO was the most useful water quality indicator in ensuring groundwater sampling representativeness in comparison with turbidity, pH, specific conductance, oxidation reduction potential (ORP) and temperature; (2) it is not necessary to maintain a drawdown of less than 0.1 m when conducting low flow purging. However, a high purging rate in a low permeability aquifer may result in a dramatic decrease in sampling representativeness after an initial peak; (3) the presence of a short screen length may result in greater drawdown and a longer sampling time for low-flow purging. Overall, the present study suggests that this new numerical model is suitable for describing groundwater flow during the sampling process, and can be used to optimize sampling strategies under various hydrogeological conditions.

Coupling fine particle and bedload transport in gravel-bedded streams	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Fine particles in the silt- and clay-size range are important determinants of surface water quality. Since fine particle loading rates are not unique functions of stream discharge this limits the utility of the available models for water quality assessment. Data from 38 minimally developed watersheds within the United States Geological Survey stream gauging network in California, USA reveal three lines of evidence that fine particle release is coupled with bedload transport. First, there is a transition in fine particle loading rate as a function of discharge for gravel-bedded sediments that does not appear when the sediment bed is composed of sand, cobbles, boulders, or bedrock. Second, the discharge at the transition in the loading rate is correlated with the initiation of gravel mobilization. Third, high frequency particle concentration and discharge data are dominated by clockwise hysteresis where rising limb discharges generally have higher concentrations than falling limb discharges. These three observations across multiple watersheds lead to a conceptual model that fine particles accumulate within the sediment bed at discharges less than the transition and then the gravel bed fluidizes with fine particle release at discharges above the transition discharge. While these observations were individually recognized in the literature, this analysis provides a consistent conceptual model based on the coupling of fine particle dynamics with filtration at low discharges and gravel bed fluidization at higher discharges.

J	Zhang, YY; Gao, Y; Yu, Q				Zhang, Yongyong; Gao, Yang; Yu, Qiang			Diffuse nitrogen loss simulation and impact assessment of stereoscopic agriculture pattern by integrated water system model and consideration of multiple existence forms	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Agricultural nitrogen loss becomes an increasingly important source of water quality deterioration and eutrophication, even threatens water safety for humanity. Nitrogen dynamic mechanism is still too complicated to be well captured at watershed scale due to its multiple existence forms and instability, disturbance of agricultural management practices. Stereoscopic agriculture is a novel agricultural planting pattern to efficiently use local natural resources (e.g., water, land, sunshine, heat and fertilizer). It is widely promoted as a high yield system and can obtain considerable economic benefits, particularly in China. However, its environmental quality implication is not clear. In our study, Qianyanzhou station is famous for its stereoscopic agriculture pattern of Southern China, and an experimental watershed was selected as our study area. Regional characteristics of runoff and nitrogen losses were simulated by an integrated water system model (HEQM) with multi-objective calibration, and multiple agriculture practices were assessed to find the effective approach for the reduction of diffuse nitrogen losses. Results showed that daily variations of runoff and nitrogen forms were well reproduced throughout watershed, i.e., satisfactory performances for ammonium and nitrate nitrogen (NH4-N and NO3-N) loads, good performances for runoff and organic nitrogen (ON) load, and very good performance for total nitrogen (TN) load. The average loss coefficient was 62.74 kg/ha for NH4-N, 0.98 kg/ha for NO3-N, 0.0004 kg/ha for ON and 63.80 kg/ha for TN. The dominating form of nitrogen losses was NH4-N due to the applied fertilizers, and the most dramatic zones aggregated in the middle and downstream regions covered by paddy and orange orchard. In order to control diffuse nitrogen losses, the most effective practices for Qianyanzhou stereoscopic agriculture pattern were to reduce farmland planting scale in the valley by afforestation, particularly for orchard in the downstream regions, followed by fertilizer application optimization.

In the proposed approach, we use the spatially lumped catchment model StreamGEM to predict daily stream flow and nitrate concentration (mg L-1 NO3-N) in four contrasting mesoscale headwater catchments based on four years of daily rainfall, potential evapotranspiration, and stream flow measurements, and monthly or daily nitrate concentrations. Posterior model parameter distributions were estimated using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling code DREAMzs and a log likelihood function assuming heteroscedastic, t-distributed residuals. Despite high uncertainty in some model parameters, the flow and nitrate calibration data was well reproduced across all catchments (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency against Log transformed data, NSL, in the range 0.62-0.83 for daily flow and 0.17-0.88 for nitrate concentration). The slight increase in the size of the residuals for a separate validation period was considered acceptable (NSL in the range 0.60-0.89 for daily flow and 0.10-0.74 for nitrate concentration, excluding one data set with limited validation data). Proportions of flow and nitrate discharge attributed to near-surface, fast seasonal groundwater and slow deeper groundwater were consistent with expectations based on catchment geology. The results for the Weida Stream in Thuringia, Germany, usingmonthly as opposed to daily nitrate data were, for all intents and purposes, identical, suggesting that four years of monthly nitrate sampling provides sufficient information for calibration of the StreamGEM model and prediction of catchment dynamics. This study highlights the remarkable effectiveness of process based, spatially lumped modelling with commonly available monthly stream sample data, to elucidate high resolution catchment function, when appropriate calibration methods are used that correctly handle the inherent uncertainties.

J	Bouderbala, A				Bouderbala, Abdelkader			Assessment of Water Quality Index for the Groundwater in the Upper Cheliff Plain, Algeria	JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA												Assessment of groundwater suitability for drinking and agricultural purposes was carried out in the plain of upper Cheliff. The study area covers an area of 375 km(2) and lies in a semiarid climate. Groundwater is the major source for domestic and agricultural activity in this area. Groundwater samples were collected from 19 wells during dry and wet periods in 2012, and they were analyzed for major cations and anions and compared with drinking and irrigation specification standards. The concentration of the majority of chemical constituents exceeds the standards of WHO as a result of various sources of pollution. It indicates the dominance of groundwater types: Ca-Mg-Cl, and Ca-Mg-HCO3. Suitability of groundwater for drinking was evaluated based on the water quality index; it shows more than 60% of samples have very poor quality for dry and wet periods, which means water is severely contaminated and unsuitable for drinking purpose. In terms of the irrigation usage, generally groundwater is suitable for both periods in the major part of the plain. The Mineralization processes in this area is determined by the lithology of the aquifer (exchange water-rock), by anthropogenic factors (discharges of urban sewage, use of fertilizers) and also by evaporation (semi-arid climate).																	0016-7622	0974-6889				SEP	2017	90	3					347	356		10.1007/s12594-017-0723-7								WOS:000411210300011

Results indicated the heavily polluted regions and an alarming water quality deterioration trend between May 2006 and May 2014. A combination of land use/land cover (LULC) maps and socioeconomic data was considered to investigate the causative factors of the water quality distribution, as well as the deterioration.

However, water quality prediction remains a key parameter for groundwater resources management and planning. The geochemical study of groundwater of a multilayered aquifer system in Tunisia is recognized by measurements of the pH, EC, total dissolved solids (TDS), major ion concentration and nitrates of 36 samples from pumping wells covering the aquifer extension and analyzed using standard laboratory and field methods. The calcite precipitation, gypsum, anhydrite and halite dissolution, and direct and reverse ion exchange are the principal process of chemical evolution in the Nadhour-Saouaf aquifer system. Using stepwise regression, the concentration groups of (Ca, Cl, and NO3), (Cl, SO4, and Mg), and (Ca and Na) exhibit significant prediction of TDS in Plio-Quaternary, Miocene, and Oligocene aquifer levels, respectively. The highest values of R-2 and adjusted R-2 close to 1 revealed the accuracy of the developed models which is confirmed by the weak difference between the measured and estimated values varying between -12 and 8%. The important uncertainty parameters that affected the estimated TDS are assessed by the sensitivity analysis method. The concentration of (Cl), (Ca and Cl), and (Na) are the major parameters affecting the TDS sensitivity of the Plio-Quaternary, Miocene, and Oligocene aquifer levels, respectively. Hence, the developed TDS models provide a more simple and easy alternative to other methods used for groundwater quality estimation and prediction as proven from external validation on groundwater samples unconsidered in the model construction.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				SEP	2017	10	17							382	10.1007/s12517-017-3170-2								WOS:000410814700006

Generally, nutrient contents gradually decreased from the estuary to the central bay, which confirmed that terrigenous inputs from Sanya River and Sanya Harbor were the primary nutrient sources. The results of K-means cluster analysis suggested the Luhuitou fringing reef is in danger of being affected by the pollution source. The results of nutrient diffusive fluxes at the sediment-seawater interface indicated diffusion from pore water to overlying water. Compared with other coral reef areas around the world, nutrient levels in Luhuitou fringing reef were at the medium level. Significant correlation between temporal variation of nutrients and living coral cover was not found, which suggests that low nutrient enrichment, ranging from 1.89 to 2.89 mu mol/L for DIN and from 0.1 to 0.49 mu mol/L for PO43-, may not be responsible for the coral reef decline on Luhuitou fringing reef from 2002 to 2014.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				SEP	2017	33	5					1148	1160		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-15-00190.1								WOS:000409252500014

In the studied soil environments, the average moisture content was 28.07%, soil salinity was 5.86 ppt, and total nitrogen was 1.02 mg/g. In water environments, the average dissolved oxygen was 9.04 mg/L, water salinity was 13.66 ppt, nitrate nitrogen (NOx-N) was 1.0712 mg/L, and ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) was 0.3790 mg/L. The correlation analysis of P. australis communities revealed that there was a relatively strong negative correlation between soil salinity and annual production (r = -0.584, N = 22). The ordination using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) of edaphic factors and water quality factors showed that soil salinity, water salinity, and water nitrate-nitrogen play important roles in types of P. australis communities. It was separated as three coastal habitat Phragmites community types by cluster analysis and three Phragmites community types including brackish water group in both freshwater and seawater groups by CCA. The understanding of Phragmites distribution in three habitat types would help inform successful management.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				SEP	2017	33	5					1210	1216		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-16-00065.1								WOS:000409252500020

Fraction of young water as an indicator of aquifer vulnerability along two regional flow paths in the Mississippi embayment aquifer system, southeastern USA	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Wells along two regional flow paths were sampled to characterize changes in water quality and the vulnerability to contamination of the Memphis aquifer across a range of hydrologic and land-use conditions in the southeastern United States. The flow paths begin in the aquifer outcrop area and end at public supply wells in the confined parts of the aquifer at Memphis, Tennessee. Age-date tracer (e.g. SF6, H-3, C-14) data indicate that a component of young water is present in the aquifer at most locations along both flow paths, which is consistent with previous studies at Memphis that documented leakage of shallow water into the Memphis aquifer locally where the overlying confining unit is thin or absent. Mixtures of young and old water were most prevalent where long-term pumping for public supply has lowered groundwater levels and induced downward movement of young water. The occurrence of nitrate, chloride and synthetic organic compounds was correlated to the fraction of young water along the flow paths. Oxic conditions persisted for 10 km or more down dip of the confining unit, and the presence of young water in confined parts of the aquifer suggest that contaminants such as nitrate-N have the potential for transport. Long-term monitoring data for one of the flow-path wells screened in the confined part of the aquifer suggest that the vulnerability of the aquifer as indicated by the fraction of young water is increasing over time.

J	Jurado, A; Vazquez-Sune, E; Pujades, E				Jurado, Anna; Vazquez-Sune, Enric; Pujades, Estanislao			Potential uses of pumped urban groundwater: a case study in Sant AdriA del Bess (Spain)	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Urban groundwater has often been over-exploited for industrial uses. Now, this usage tends to be reduced or the resource abandoned due to pollution and/or changes in land use. The use and the subsequent disuse of groundwater has resulted in rising water tables that damage underground structures (e.g., building basements and underground car parks and tunnels), leading to the need for additional pumping in urban areas. In the case of the underground parking lot of Sant AdriA del Bess (Barcelona, NE Spain), large amounts of urban groundwater are pumped to avoid seepage problems. Can this pumped groundwater be used for other purposes (e.g., drinking water and urban irrigation) instead of wasting this valuable resource? To answer this question, it was necessary to quantify the groundwater recharge and to assess the evolution of groundwater quality. The limiting factor at this study site is the groundwater quality because ammonium and some metals (iron and manganese) are present at high concentrations. Hence, further treatment would be needed to meet drinking water requirements. The pumped groundwater could also be used for supplementing river flow for ecological benefit and/or for mitigating seawater intrusion problems. Currently, only a small amount of this urban groundwater is used for cleaning public areas and watering public gardens. This situation highlighted the urgent need to manage this resource in a responsible and more efficient manner, especially in moments of high water demand such as drought periods.

Inventory of managed aquifer recharge sites in Europe: historical development, current situation and perspectives	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Different types of managed aquifer recharge (MAR) schemes are widely distributed and applied on various scales and for various purposes in the European countries, but a systematic categorization and compilation of data has been missing up to now. The European MAR catalogue presented herein contains various key parameters collected from the available literature. The catalogue includes 224 currently active MAR sites found in 23 European countries. Large quantities of drinking water are produced by MAR sites in Hungary, Slovakia, the Netherlands, Germany, Finland, Poland, Switzerland and France. This inventory highlights that, for over a century, MAR has played an important role in the development of European water supply and contributes to drinking-water production substantially. This development has occurred autonomously, with "trial-and-error" within the full range of climatically and hydrogeologically diverse conditions of the European countries. For the future, MAR has the potential to facilitate optimal (re)use and storage of available water resources and to take advantage of the natural purification and low energy requirements during MAR operations. Particularly with respect to the re-use of wastewater treatment-plant effluent and stormwater, which is currently underdeveloped, the use of MAR can support the public acceptance of such water-resource efficient schemes. Particularly for the highly productive and urbanized coastal zones, where the pressure on freshwater supplies increases by growing water demand, salinization and increased agricultural needs for food production (such as along the Mediterranean and North Sea coasts), MAR is expected to be increasingly relied on in Europe.																	1431-2174	1435-0157				SEP	2017	25	6					1909	1922		10.1007/s10040-017-1554-8								WOS:000407923900025						
J	Mogaji, KA; San Lim, H				Mogaji, Kehinde Anthony; San Lim, Hwee			Development of a GIS-based catastrophe theory model (modified DRASTIC model) for groundwater vulnerability assessment	EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS												This study developed a new paradigm for groundwater vulnerability assessment by modifying the standard DRASTIC index (DI) model based on catastrophe theory. The developed paradigm was called the catastrophe theory-based DI (CDI) model. The proposed model was applied to assess groundwater vulnerability to pollution index (GVPI) in Perak Province, Malaysia. The area vulnerability index was modeled by considering the DRASTIC multiple vulnerability causative factors (VCFs) obtained from different data sources. The weights and ranking of the VCFs were computed by using the inner fuzzy membership mechanism of the CDI model. The estimated vulnerability index values of the CDI model were processed in a geographic information system (GIS) environment to produce a catastrophe theory-DRASTIC groundwater vulnerability to pollution index (CDGVPI) map, which demarcated the area into five vulnerability zones. The produced CDGVPI map was validated by applying the water quality status-vulnerability zone relationship (WVR) approach and the relative operating characteristic (ROC) curve method. The performance of the developed CDI model was compared with that of the standard DI model. The validation results of the WVR approach exhibits 89.29% prediction accuracy for the CDI model compared with 75% for the DI model. Meanwhile, the ROC validation results for the CDI and DI models are 88.8% and 78%, respectively. The GIS-based CDI model demonstrated better performance than the DI model. The GVPI maps produced in this study can be used for precise decision making process in environmental planning and groundwater management.

J	Wohl, E				Wohl, Ellen			The significance of small streams	FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE					Water and Environmental Sustainability Symposium	OCT 20, 2015	Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA		Tsinghua Univ			Headwaters, defined here as first- and second-order streams, make up 70%-80% of the total channel length of river networks. These small streams exert a critical influence on downstream portions of the river network by: retaining or transmitting sediment and nutrients; providing habitat and refuge for diverse aquatic and riparian organisms; creating migration corridors; and governing connectivity at the watershed-scale. The upstream-most extent of the channel network and the longitudinal continuity and lateral extent of headwaters can be difficult to delineate, however, and people are less likely to recognize the importance of headwaters relative to other portions of a river network. Consequently, headwaters commonly lack the legal protections accorded to other portions of a river network and are more likely to be significantly altered or completely obliterated by land use.																	2095-0195	2095-0209				SEP	2017	11	3			SI		447	456		10.1007/s11707-017-0647-y								WOS:000405707000002

According to German and European legislation, hygienic monitoring is not mandatory for such water bodies which are neither drinking water sources nor categorized as bathing waters. Consequently, relatively little is known about the occurrence of-potentially pathogenic-bacteria and viruses in Germany's streams and rivers. The Holtemme was selected for a case study because it is relatively well monitored for both chemical water quality and aquatic ecology, but not for hygiene. Originating in the mountains of Harz Nature Park, the 47 km long Holtemme is characterized by a strong longitudinal gradient in chemical water quality, which is related to different land uses and the influx of treated wastewater from two urban areas (Wernigerode and Halberstadt). Waste water loads received by the Holtemme are comparatively high when compared to similarly small streams. In 2015, total coliform concentrations between more than 200 and 77,010 bacteria per 100 mL, and fecal coliform concentrations between 5 and 24,060 bacteria per 100 mL were observed in the Holtemme's main channel. The highest concentrations were typically found below the outlets of the two wastewater treatment plants. The treated wastewater contained total and fecal coliform concentrations of up to 200,500 and 83,100 per 100 mL, respectively; however, there were significant temporal variations. While the observed concentrations are unproblematic from a legal perspective (because no maximum permissible limits are defined for streams in Germany), they would exceed the tolerable limits for bathing waters in the EU, indicating moderate to critical pollution limits.																	2095-0195	2095-0209				SEP	2017	11	3			SI		544	553		10.1007/s11707-017-0648-x								WOS:000405707000010

Tolerable erosion concept is a tool for awareness and assessment of soil erosion status and its economic, social, and environmental hazards. This study was conducted to design a framework for evaluating and identifying spatial patterns of erosion hazard in Haji-Ghushan watershed, based on tolerable erosion concept, by using the SWAT model. The framework was consisted of two parts: the erosion tolerance index (ETI), and the sediment-phosphorous index (SPI) for evaluating onsite and offsite effects of soil erosion, respectively. Four hazard levels were defined for each index. The results of sediment simulation indicated that the maximum rate of erosion belonged to agricultural lands located on steep slopes in the central part of the watershed, and the minimum rate was from forest lands, despite their steep slopes. The map of spatial,distribution of erosion hazard showed that, in terms of both onsite and offsite effects, a major part of the watershed (around 65%) had experienced an erosion rate lower than the erosion tolerance threshold; hence, these areas were not faced with erosion hazard. The spatial distribution of the areas exposed to the onsite erosion hazard, however, was differed from those confronted by the offsite erosion hazard. Identified high hazard areas based on the erosion offsite impacts were mainly located in sub-basins close to the watershed outlet where the sediment and phosphorous yield was high due to the high sediment-phosphorous delivery ratio. High hazard areas with high risk of soil degradation and productivity reduction are distributed throughout the watershed, depending on the magnitude of the erosion rate. These findings revealed that, in addition to erosion rate, sediment delivery ratio is also an important parameter in evaluating soil erosion hazard. For achieving the sustainable agro-environment, it is necessary to consider both the onsite and offsite effects of soil erosion to identify the high hazard areas. Also the results showed that the designed framework was capable of identifying the high hazard and hot spot areas well. The findings of this study are useful for officials and policy makers of soil conservation and environmental protection agencies in the region.

The four treatments were control (without amendment), gypsum, rice straw compost, and gypsum + rice straw compost. The experiments were carried out in a completely randomized design with three replicates. Saturated electrical conductivity (ECe) and exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) values of soils treated with gypsum, or gypsum + rice straw compost, reached the salinity and sodicity classification limits of 4 dS m(-1) and 15% (US Salinity Laboratory Staff, 1954), respectively, after eight years of leaching experiments. However, despite 10 years of leaching experiments, neither the control nor the rice straw compost alone treatment reached the salinity and sodicity classification limits. The addition of gypsum and rice straw compost resulted in a reduction in soil bulk density and a corresponding increase in soil porosity in highly saline-sodic soils (p <= 0.05). The results of mean weight diameter (MWD) showed that the application of soil amendments increased MWD significantly (p <= 0.05); the highest MWD was observed for the gypsum + rice straw compost treatment and was twice the magnitude of the control.																	0341-8162	1872-6887				SEP	2017	156						131	138		10.1016/j.catena.2017.04.008								WOS:000404305700014

Facies variations in response to Holocene sea-level and climate change on Bora Bora, French Polynesia: Unravelling the role of synsedimentary siderite in a tropical marine, mixed carbonate-siliciclastic lagoon	MARINE GEOLOGY												Five mixed carbonate-siliciclastic sedimentary facies were identified in the barrier-reef lagoon of Bora Bora using microfacies and statistical analyses of 70 sediment samples taken at high resolution from two vibrocores. Fades and fades successions were interpreted with respect to Holocene sea-level and climate changes. The windward lagoon core is characterized by sideritic marly wackestones and foraminifera-sideritic wackestones, deposited around 7700 years BP (years before present) during the early-mid Holocene transgression. At that time, extensive weathering and erosion of iron-bearing minerals from the volcanic island, due to a wetter climate, were expressed in the formation of synsedimentary siderite in lagoonal sediments. The enrichment in delta O-18 (+ 032 to + 0.54 parts per thousand) in the siderite grains indicates marine to mixed marine-meteoric conditions during precipitation. Siderite formation resulted from microbial degradation of organic material, indicated by depleted delta C-13 values (- 13.61 to - 14.48160) that led to reducing conditions in lagoonal sediments, and resulted in iron reduction in the presence of dissolved bicarbonate. The chemical compositions of the siderites changes upcore, from relatively high Fe (91-95 mol%) and low Mn (5-6 mol%) at the core base to relatively low Fe (83-88 mol%) and high Mn (11-16 mol%) at the core top. The substitutions of Fe by Mn, Ca and Mg at grain margins illustrate changes in pore-water chemistry towards more oxygenated conditions and reflect sea-level rise and elevated rainfall during the early-mid Holocene. A drier climate during the mid-late Holocene was accompanied by reduced iron input and the proportion of siderite decreased, approaching zero in the upper section of the core. In the leeward lagoon core, siderite is again common in the lower section, and decreases in abundance upcore. Mollusc-foraminifera many packstones and mollusc wackestones accumulated similar to 5400-3500 years BP during the mid-Holocene in the windward core. Early in this period rotalid and miliolid foraminifera dominated. These are tolerant of environmental stress such as changes in water quality, nutrients or salinity. From the mid-Holocene to the present, textularid foraminifera are common in both cores, and indicate normal marine lagoonal conditions. Since the mid-late Holocene sea-level highstand and fall to modern level, mudstones have dominated in both cores. During the last 1000 years coral fragments have increased in abundance in the windward lagoon, presumably as a result of lagoonward progradation of fringing reefs in the mid-late Holocene. Since the late Holocene, motus on the windward side of Bora Bora have hampered sediment transport and lagoonward pro gradation of sand aprons. Increasing numbers of peloids, largely hardened faecal pellets, in the windward core in the last 1000 years may reflect early submarine lithification within the lagoon. Our study shows that during the Holocene, sea-level and climate change have influenced sediment import, composition and distribution in the Bora Bora lagoon. The sensitive response of the environment to external changes demonstrates the potential of tropical reef lagoons as archives of climate and sea-level changes.																	0025-3227	1872-6151				AUG 1	2017	390						1	22		10.1016/j.margeo.2017.05.002								WOS:000413381800001

D.; Hirji, Rafik; Dube, Timothy			Remote sensing of surface water quality in relation to catchment condition in Zimbabwe	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH												The degradation of river catchments is one of the most important contemporary environmental problems affecting water quality in tropical countries. In this study, we used remotely sensed Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to assess how catchment condition varies within and across river catchments in Zimbabwe. We then used non-linear regression to test whether catchment condition assessed using the NDVI is significantly (alpha = 0.05) related with levels of Total Suspended Solids (TSS) measured at different sampling points in thirty-two sub-catchments in Zimbabwe. The results showed a consistent negative curvilinear relationship between Landsat 8 derived NDVI and TSS measured across the catchments under study. In the drier catchments of the country, 98% of the variation in TSS is explained by NDVI, while in wetter catchments, 64% of the variation in TSS is explained by NDVI. Our results suggest that NDVI derived from free and readily available multispectral Landsat series data (Landsat 8) is a potential valuable tool for the rapid assessment of physical water quality in data poor catchments. Overall, the finding of this study underscores the usefulness of readily available satellite data for near-real time monitoring of the physical water quality at river catchment scale, especially in resource-constrained areas, such as the sub-Saharan Africa.

Sensitivity of the mayfly Adenophlebia auriculata (Ephemeroptera: Leptophlebiidae) to MgSO4 and Na2SO4	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH												Acid mine drainage (AMD) continues to deteriorate water quality in freshwater ecosystems. Sulphates, a major salt component in AMD, can exacerbate AMD effects in freshwater because salts are toxic to aquatic life in high concentrations. Sulphates are predominant in South African AMD impacted freshwater ecosystems. In this study, the sensitivity of nymphs of the mayfly Adenophlebia auriculata (Ephemeroptera: Leptophlebiidae) was investigated by exposing the organisms to magnesium sulphate (MgSO4) and sodium sulphate (Na2SO4) as models of mining salinisation in short-term (96 h) and long-term (240 h) in static system tests. Short-term and long-term lethal concentrations of each salt were estimated using regression analyses. The results indicated that A. auriculata was more sensitive to MgSO4 (LC50 = 3.81 g/L) than Na2SO4 (LC50 = 8.78 g/L) after short-term exposures. However, this species became sensitive to Na2SO4 (LC10 = 0.19 g/L) but tolerant to MgSO4 (LC10 = 0.35 g/L) after long-term exposures. These results suggest that the 0.25 g/L sulphate compliance limit for South Africa is inadequate to protect A. auriculata from Na2SO4 toxicity in the long-term, yet it overprotects this species from MgSO4 exposures in the short-term. The findings of this study are an important major step in understanding the ecological effects of AMD to aquatic life. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Hydrochemical modelling of water quality in terms of emerging micropollutants in Mpumalanga, Gauteng and North West Provinces	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH												Emerging micropollutants (EMPs) are ubiquitous in aquatic systems and are associated with a wide range of eco-toxicological effects worldwide. There remains a lack of scientific understanding of the major underlying hydrochemical factors behind variations in concentration heterogeneities of EMPs in time and space. This study was therefore conducted to determine major hydrochemical processes controlling water quality and the occurrence of EMPs mainly, carbamazepine (CBZ), tonalide (AHTN), galaxolide (HHCB), caffeine (CAF), technical 4-nonylphenol (NP) and bisphenol A (BPA) in water from Mpumalanga, Gauteng and North West Provinces in South Africa. Grab water samples were collected bi-monthly between June 2014 and April 2016 from 44 water sources using standard sampling procedures. BPA, NP, CAF, HHCB, AHTN, CBZ were extracted, cleaned and enriched using autotrace-SPE at neutral pH and analyzed using GC x GC-TOFMS. Kruskal Wallis-test was used to test for temporal variations in occurrence of the analytes. The Geochemist's Workbench (R) Release 11 software, Surfer Golden Graphics for surface mapping, PHREEQC software and bivariate ion plots were used determine the major hydro-geochemical processes. The mean concentrations of EMPs varied from 3.48 mu g/L for CAF to 421.53 mu g/L for HHCB. Although the Kruskal Wallis test revealed no any statistically significant temporal variations in concentrations of the analytes in water samples at 95% confidence level, their occurrence and distribution vary spatially with BPA being the most widely distributed EMP and was present in 62% of the sampled sites. Municipal waste water inputs, agricultural pollution, ion-exchange reactions, carbonate and silicate weathering were the major processes controlling water quality in the study area. This study may assist water resource managers to ably address and manage water pollution resulting from a number of natural and anthropogenic hydrochemical processes in the study area.

Modeling phytoremediation of nitrogen-polluted water using water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes)	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH												Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) has a great potential for purification of wastewater through physical, chemical and biological mechanisms. In an attempt to improve the quality of effluents discharged from waste stabilization ponds at the University of Dar es Salaam, a pilot plant was constructed to experiment the effectiveness of this plants for transformation and removal of nitrogen. Samples of wastewater were collected and examined for water quality parameters, including pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and various forms of nitrogen, which were used as input parameters in a kinetic mathematical model. A conceptual model was then developed to model various processes in the system using STELLA 6.0.1 software. The results show that total nitrogen was removed by 63.9%. Denitrification contributed 73.8% of the removed nitrogen. Other dominant nitrogen removal mechanisms are net sedimentation and uptake by water hyacinth, which contributed 16.7% and 9.5% of the removed nitrogen, respectively. The model indicated that in presence of water hyacinth biofllm about 1.26 g Nm(-2)day(-1) of nitrogen was removed. However, in the absence of biofilm in water hyacinth pond, the permanent nitrogen removal was only 0.89 g Nm(-2)day(-1). This suggests that in absence of water hyacinth, the efficiency of nitrogen removal would decrease by 29.4%. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Assessment of drinking water quality and rural household water treatment in Balaka District, Malawi	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH												Access to drinking water from unsafe sources is widespread amongst communities in rural areas such as Balaka District in Malawi. This situation puts many individuals and communities at risk of waterborne diseases despite some households adopting household water treatment to improve the quality of the water. However, there still remains data gaps regarding the quality of drinking water from such sources and the household water treatment methods used to improve public health. This study was, therefore, conducted to help bridge the knowledge gap by evaluating drinking water quality and adoption rate of household water treatment and storage (HWTS) practices in Nkaya, Balaka District. Water samples were collected from eleven systematically selected sites and analyzed for physico-chemical and microbiological parameters: pH, TDS, electrical conductivity (EC), turbidity, F-, Cl-, NO3-, Na, K, Fe, Faecal Coliform (FC) and Faecal Streptococcus (FS) bacteria using standard methods. The mean results were compared to the World Health Organization (WHO) and Malawi Bureau of Standards (MBS) (MS 733:2005) to ascertain the water quality for drinking purposes. A total of 204 randomly selected households were interviewed to determine their access to drinking water, water quality perception and HWTS among others. The majority of households (72%, n = 83) in Njerenje accessed water from shallow wells and rivers whilst in Phimbi boreholes were commonly used. Several households (>95%, n = 204) were observed to be practicing HWST techniques by boiling or chlorination and water storage in closed containers. The levels of pH (7.10-7.64), F- (0.89-1.46 mg/L), Cl- (5.45-89.84 mg/L), NO3- (0-0.16 mg/L), Na (20-490 mg/L), K (2.40-14 mg/L) and Fe (0.10-0.40 mg/L) for most sites were within the standard limits. The EC (358-2220 mu S/cm), turbidity (0.54-14.60 NTU), FC (0-56 cfu/100 mL) and FS (0-120 cfu/100 mL) - mainly in shallow wells, were found to be above the WHO and MBS water quality specifications. The majority of the water samples (73%, n = 11) were classified as of "Intermediate risk" (FC 11 -100 cfu/100 mL), hence not suitable for human consumption without prior treatment. This calls for large scale adoption of HWTS and continued monitoring of the water sources used in the study areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Remote sensing and Geographic Information System techniques were used to determine the geometric and hydrologic parameters required for estimating model parameters. The Snyder Unit Hydrograph method was used for ungauged subcatchment simulations based on parameter transfer from gauged subcatchments. The Marimba and Mukuvisi subcatchments were considered as the gauged subcatchments based on data completeness for the simulation period (2004-2010). Before extrapolating the calibrated model setup to eight ungauged subcatchments, the feasibility of model parameter transferability was tested, using the proxy - catchment approach and evaluated using the Nash Sutcliffe (NSE) and Relative Volume Error (RVE) criterion. Results showed that the model successfully predicted gauged catchment runoff and peakflows for the calibration (Marimba NSE = 68%, RVE = 5.8%; Mukuvisi NSE = 64%, RVE = -8.9%) and validation (Marimba NSE = 61%, RVE = 8.1%; Mukuvisi NSE = 57%, RVE = 9.9%) periods. The study demonstrates the suitability of HEC-HMS for continuous runoff simulation in a complex watershed with numerous subcatchments and channel reaches. The ungauged subcatchments contribute to 51% of Upper Manyame Catchment's runoff. Ruwa and Lake Chivero sub catchments had the highest ungauged subcatchment contribution to Upper Manyame Catchment runoff (19% and 15% respectively). This work will have a significant contribution for the future development of water resources programs in Upper Manyame Catchment in particular and in other data-scarce catchments.

Spatial patterns of DOC concentration and DOM optical properties in a Brazilian tropical river-wetland system	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												The Cerrado (savanna) and Pantanal (wetland) biomes of Central Western Brazil have experienced significant development activity in recent decades, including extensive land cover conversion from natural ecosystems to agriculture and urban expansion. The Cuiaba River transects the Cerrado biome prior to inundating large areas of the Pantanal, creating one of the largest biodiversity hot spots in the world. We measured dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and the optical absorbance and fluorescence properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from 40 sampling locations spanning Cerrado and Pantanal biomes during wet and dry seasons. In the upper, more agricultural region of the basin, DOC concentrations were highest in the rainy season with more aromatic and humified DOM. In contrast, DOC concentrations and DOM optical properties were more uniform for the more urbanized middle region of the basin between wet and dry seasons, as well as across sample locations. In the lower region of the basin, wet season connectivity between the river and the Pantanal floodplain led to high DOC concentrations, a fourfold increase in humification index (HIX) (an indicator of DOM humification), and a 50% reduction in the spectral slope (S-R). Basin-wide, wet season values for S-R, HIX, and FI (fluorescence index) indicated an increasing representation of terrestrially derived DOM that was more humified. Parallel factor analysis identified two terrestrially derived components (C1 and C2) representing 77% of total fluorescing DOM (fDOM). A third, protein-like fDOM component increased markedly during the wet season within the more urban-impacted region.

The detailed hydrogeochemical study indicates that mine discharges are mostly highly acidic (pH 3.4-6.1) with very high concentration of Cu (9.2-60.8 mg/L). Water releases from the tailing pond is also acidic in nature (pH 2.39-2.48) and contains high concentration of Cu (15.6-65.2 mg/L). The water quality of the mine discharges and tailing is mainly affected by the oxidation of chalcopyrite, which presents abundantly in the host rock along with minor amount of pyrite. The blue coloured secondary mineral that precipitates along the course of the mine effluents is dominated by amorphous copper hydroxysulfate. Alpersite, gypsum, epsomite and hexahydrite occur as efflorescent salts during the summer time, and store very high concentration of metals. Alpersite contains Zn (285-391 mg/kg), Ni (62-78 mg/kg) and Cu (7.8-10.9%) whereas epsomite contains Zn (132-160 mg/kg), Ni (35-43 mg/kg) and Cu (3465-4184 mg/kg). Among the trace elements in tailing, Cu has the highest concentration ranges (98.2-4492 mg/kg) followed by Mn (131.4-760 mg/kg), Zn (54.3-241 mg/kg), Ni (25.7-170.3 mg/kg), Pb (12.5-46.4 mg/kg) and Cd (0.72-1.48 mg/kg). Tailing rich with efflorescent salt has maximum concentration of metals as well as maximum potential for releasing metals into the aqueous system.				Sahoo, Prafulla/N-5100-2018; Equeenuddin, Sk.

A major component in 13 spring water samples was analyzed using various techniques. The waters of the thermal springs at Guelma basin vary in temperature between 20 and 94 degrees C. Q-mode hierarchical cluster analysis suggests three groups. The water springs were classified as low, moderate and high salinity. Mineral saturation indices (SI) calculated from major ions indicate the spring waters are supersaturated with the most of the carbonate minerals, and all of the spring water samples are under-saturated with evaporite minerals. The thermal spring waters have a meteoric origin, and all samples are immature with strong mixing between warm and shallow waters, where the temperatures of reservoirs to which the thermal waters are related ranged between 64 degrees and 124 degrees C. The deep circulation of meteoric waters in the study area is supplied by the high geothermal gradient around 4.5 degrees C per 100 m and reaches a high temperature before rising to the surface. The estimated circulation depths ranged from 1425 and 3542 m.

The agricultural activity supports the social and economic pressure. Considering prolonged drought conditions and surface water insufficiency, increasing supplies rely on deep aquifers in spite of the critical status of the water quality used. Intense agriculture development has placed oases durability and crop quality to high risks of soil fertility loss, land degradation, and water availability issues, due to severe climate conditions, overexploitation of groundwater resources, intense desertification, overuse of soil, and poor land management. The recent contamination of the largest aquifer in southern Tunisia (Continental Intercalaire) by petroleum flows adds another dimension to the problem of water crisis and soil salinization in the region of interest. In this study, 41 water samples from CI wells were correspondingly collected for hydrochemical analyses. Major and minor element concentrations were evaluated by different standard methods. The obtained dataset indicates that the western side possesses low salinity hazard, whereas Nefzaoua and El Fedjej areas reveal highly mineralized water unsuitable for irrigation purposes. A number of assessment ratios (KR, TH, SAR, ESP, PS, etc.) and graphical methods (Riverside and Wilcox) confirm this classification. The combination of geochemical indicators with geographic information system permits the assessment of water quality on the basis of two different indexes. The resulted maps show, in turn, scattered classification between the western field with acceptable water quality and El Fedjej-Nefzaoua areas where the CI water is unsuitable for agricultural activities. Besides water chemistry evaluation, the assessment of soil composition, particularly toxic element concentrations, constitutes reliable criteria for monitoring the effectiveness of agricultural practices and the suitability of irrigation water. Hence, the concentrations of four heavy metals have been monitored along three soil profiles ranging from the surface to 80 cm of depth. The results are within permissible limits. The vertical distribution of Ni, Pb, Cu, and Zn is related mainly to physiochemical soil parameters, difference in moisture, and fine fraction distribution.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				AUG	2017	10	16							350	10.1007/s12517-017-3148-0								WOS:000408570300002						
J	Mohallel, SA; Gomaa, MA				Mohallel, Saad Ahmed; Gomaa, Mohammed Ahmed			Studying the impacts of groundwater evolution on the environment, west Qena city, Egypt	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												The current research has been conducted to evaluate groundwater aquifers qualitatively in the area located in the Western side of Qena city. The Quaternary aquifer represents the main groundwater source in the study area. It exists under unconfined to semiconfined conditions at depths varying between 4 m due North and 80 m in the South. The chemical analyses of the groundwater samples indicate that 77% of the total samples are fresh and 20% are brackish, while only 3% are saline. In addition, the iso-salinity contour map indicates that the salinity increases towards the central and northern parts of the study area. The total and permanent hardness increase as water salinity increases and vice versa in case of temporary hardness in the groundwater samples. The chemical water types and the ion ratios indicate meteoric origin of groundwater as well as the dissolution of terrestrial and marine salts. The contribution of recent recharge from the River Nile to a few groundwater wells in the study area varies from low to high. In addition, the most recharge sources are from the precipitation. Nitrate concentrations in groundwater increase towards the central and Northern areas significantly elevated in response to increasing anthropogenic land uses. Much of the solutes and physicochemical parameters in these waters are under the undesirable limits of World Health Organization (WHO) for drinking purpose, and a plot of sodium adsorption ratio versus EC shows that about 23% of the groundwater samples are good water quality, about 45% of groundwater samples are moderate quality, and 23% of the groundwater samples are intermediate water class, while the rest of samples (9%) are out of the range.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				AUG	2017	10	16							372	10.1007/s12517-017-3151-5								WOS:000408570300024

Srinivasa			Correlation between corrosion indices and corrosiveness of groundwater: a study with reference to selected areas of Krishna District, Andhra Pradesh, India	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The aim of the present study was to determine the aggressiveness of groundwater samples towards corrosion of various commercially important metals and to study the correlation between theoretical and experimental values of corrosiveness. For this purpose, 20 groundwater samples were collected in different mandals of Krishna District, Andhra Pradesh, India, and the metals selected were carbon steel, aluminium, copper and cupronickel alloy. The corrosiveness was determined by using gravimetric measurements. Further, corrosion and scaling indices, namely Langelier index (LI), aggressive index (AI), Ryznar index (RI), Puckorius index (PI) and Larson-Skold index (LS), were calculated with the help of various water quality parameters of all the samples to estimate their corrosivity. The experimental values of corrosion rates were attempted to correlate with various indices calculated and quality parameters determined in case of all the samples. It is observed that there is a significant lack of correlation between the indices and corrosion rates. Among the five indices taken into account, LI, AI and RI indicate scaling tendency of water samples, as inferred by their mean values, 0.657, 12.576 and 6.612, respectively, while the other two indices, PI and LS with the mean values of 8.141 and 1.188, respectively, suggest the corrosive behaviour. Further, the mean values of correlation coefficients, 0.18 and 0.27 for PI and LS, respectively, are higher compared with those for LI, AI and RI. The mean values of correlation coefficients of dissolved oxygen, chlorides and electrolytic conductivity are 0.33, 0.25 and 0.25, respectively, which are relatively higher compared with those of other quality parameters. The probable reasons for low correlation coefficients are explored based on the statistical data. Also, it was concluded that one of the significant factors, namely dissolved oxygen which has strong influence on corrosion of metals, was considered in none of the indices, leading to very low correlation between the theoretical and experimental values of corrosiveness.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				AUG	2017	76	16							568	10.1007/s12665-017-6908-y								WOS:000408499100022

This thematic issue, which was initiated by four water- related research associations (German Hydrological Society; German Limnological Society; Hydrological Sciences Commission within German Water Association; Working Group Hydrology within German Geographical Society), is a testimony of both the quality and diversity of the water research currently undertaken by Germany's scientific community. Key topics include hydrology and hydromorphology; water quality; aquatic and riparian ecosystems; water in agriculture and forestry; and water management and supply. The manuscripts contained in this thematic issue do not only cover a period of more than two millennia, but also address all types of water resources and a multitude of both established and newly developed methods that help us to better understand the processes governing the hydrological cycle, aquatic ecosystems and the management and operation of various water infrastructures.

In order to assess this, groundwater, river water and mine water samples were collected from Korba Coalfield and analysed for potentially toxic trace elements (PTEs) along with in situ parameters. Thereby, an integrated approach of pollution evaluation indices [heavy metal pollution index (HPI), heavy metal evaluation index (HEI) and contamination index (Cd)] and statistical techniques are applied to the results. Paired-sample t tests reveal that the PTE concentrations of the pre-monsoon samples are higher than those of the post-monsoon samples. At a few locations, the concentration of Fe (56%), As (56%), Al (26%), Mn (19%) in pre-monsoon and Mn (46%), Ni (15%), Ba (15%), Pb (8%) in post-monsoon seasons exceeds the acceptable limit of Indian drinking standards. However, HPI values are below the critical pollution index value of 100 in both seasons in spite of an excess of these elements. The pollution indices evaluated by the multiple of the mean values approach reveal that 100, 94, 87% of the pre-monsoon and 92, 92, 85% of the post-monsoon samples belong to the "low-to-medium'' category with respect to the HPI, HEI and Cd indices. The thematic map depicting the spatial distribution of the contamination index (Cd) testifies the role of a `` dilution effect'' that results in lower pollution loads in the post-monsoon samples than the pre-monsoon ones. The results of cluster analysis confirm that the quality of the water is mainly controlled by geogenic processes and anthropogenic inputs, besides dilution effects.

Major ions and water isotopes were measured. Results show that hydrological processes and hydrogeochemical evolution of shallow groundwater were greatly disturbed by human activities. Excessive pumping resulted in significant declines of groundwater levels over the study area. This also induced infiltration of surface water into groundwater. A groundwater depression cone was the conflux center of groundwater surrounded by recharge zones including alluvial fans and surface water in alluvial plain. Pumping almost was the only way to discharge groundwater. Emission of SOx and NOx contributed at least 11% of rock weathering by dissolving into infiltrating precipitation. Surface waters containing sewage replenished ambient groundwater with an average mixing ratio of 74 +/- 17% due to groundwater level drawdown. As a result, groundwater had elevated concentrations of Na+ and SO42- with Na+ exchanged into aquifer sediments. About 29 +/- 16% of Na+ was exchanged from groundwater into soil matrix. Agriculture nitrate was high only in the recharge zones. The most important result is that the transformation of the study area from a place rich in water resource into an area lack of water just took several decades with the joint action of the heavily human activities. Our study also indicates that shallow groundwater could sensitively respond to and record environmental changes.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				AUG	2017	76	16							571	10.1007/s12665-017-6918-9								WOS:000408499100025

Groundwater appraisal of Dhekiajuli, Assam, India: an insight of agricultural suitability and arsenic enrichment	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The present work is an effort to develop an appraisal of the hydrogeochemical regime for the aquifers of Dhekiajuli, Sonitpur district, Assam, which is imperative considering: (i) excessive use of groundwater for irrigation; (ii) reported high arsenic (As) contamination; (iii) application of fertilizer is an inevitable process undergoing in this region to achieve higher yield owing to deteriorating water quality; and (iv) study area being the location of many tea estates of Assam, that export tea in many foreign countries. The highest As concentration of 44.39 mu g/L was detected in this study (Bachasimalu and Sitalmari region), implying high As-contaminated aquifers being used for drinking and irrigation purposes in the area. The relative abundance pattern of major cations and anions was in the order of Na+ > Mg2+ > Ca2+ > K+ and HCO3- > Cl- > SO42-, respectively. Majority of the samples belong to Na+-K+-Cl--HCO3- and mixed water type. Closer inspection of Piper plot reveals that a higher As value ( > 40 mu g/L) was prevalent in HCO3- water type. Results of hydrogeochemical plots suggest silicate and carbonate weathering, ion exchange and anthropogenic activities to be the dominant processes governing groundwater contamination, including As which is further supported from PCA loadings. The Singri area to the east of the affected areas and adjacent to the Brahmaputra River has oxic aquifers owing to the absence of mass deposition of younger sediments, while reducing conditions prevails in the Bachasimalu and Sitalmari region. High positive correlation between As and Fe (r = 0.83**) and a negative correlation between ORP and Fe (r = -0.68**) further add that Fe (hydr)oxides are the direct source of As release in the affected region, the mechanism being reductive hydrolysis of such (hydr) oxides. The study implies that although groundwater is suitable for irrigation use, there is a high probability of As getting into the food chain through tea and other edible plants irrigated with As-contaminated water; thus, the area has a maximum probability of facing health hazards caused by As-contaminated groundwater.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				AUG	2017	76	15							530	10.1007/s12665-017-6841-0								WOS:000407545200023

The model was calibrated and validated for hydrology, sediment and water quality for the period 2003-2012. The model was run under two climate changes, two land use changes and four combined change scenarios for near-future period (2020-2049). The results revealed that projected climate change impacts include an increase in streamflow (maximum increases of 52% under RCP 2.6 in December and 170% under RCP 8.5). Projected sediment concentrations under climate change scenarios showed a monthly average decrease of 10%. For land use change scenarios, agricultural development scenario indicated an opposite direction of changes in orthophosphate (increases in all months with an average increase of 6% under agricultural development scenario), leading to the conclusion that land use change is the dominant factor in nutrient concentration changes. Combined impacts results indicated that streamflows in late fall and winter months increased while in summer and early fall decreased.

As part of the waterway for the South-to-North Water Diversion Project of China, the water quality and trophic status of Lake Dongping are crucial for the successful operation of this project. In order to better understand the controlling factors of water quality and trophic status of Lake Dongping and to provide data for studying ecological baseline of lake restoration, the distribution and the controlling factors of subfossil chironomids were studied here. Our results show that a total of 41 taxa of subfossil chironomids are present in Lake Dongping. The dominant taxa consist of Stempellinella-Zavrelia (30.88%), Propsilocerus akamusi-type (26.79%), Paratanytarsus (13.15%), Cricotopus sylvestris-type (9.12%), and Hydrobaenus conformis-type (6.67%). Among them, the nutrient-tolerant taxa of Stempellinella-Zavrelia and eutrophic taxa of Propsilocerus akamusi-type are widely present in the lake, indicating that Lake Dongping is in a transition from mesotrophication to eutrophication. Redundancy analysis reveals that total phosphorus, water depth, and sulfate (SO42-) concentrations are dominant factors controlling the spatial distribution of subfossil chironomids, which explain 12, 9, and 8.5% of the variance, respectively. Therefore, in order to secure the water quality for the South-to-North Water Diversion Project, it is crucial to regulate the input of nutrient and sulfate to Lake Dongping.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				AUG	2017	76	15							524	10.1007/s12665-017-6858-4								WOS:000407545200017

Understanding how to maintain a healthy state of the water cycle has become an important proposition for sustainable development of human society. In this paper, natural-social attributes of the water cycle are synthesized and 19 evaluation indices are selected from four dimensions, i.e., water-based ecosystem integrity, water quality, water resource abundance and water resource use. A hierarchical water-cycle health evaluation system is established. An analytic hierarchy process is used to set the weight of the criteria layer and index layer, and the health threshold for each index is defined. Finally, a water-cycle health composite-index assessment model and fuzzy recognition model are constructed based on the comprehensive index method and fuzzy mathematics theory. The model is used to evaluate the state of health of the water cycle in Beijing during 2010-2014 and in the planning year (late 2014), considering the transfer of 1 billion m(3) of water by the South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP). The results show health scores for Beijing of 2.87, 3.10, 3.38, 3.11 and 3.02 during 2010-2014. The results of fuzzy recognition show that the sub healthy grade accounted for 54%, 49%, 61% and 49% of the total score, and all years had a sub -healthy state. Results of the criteria layer analysis show that water ecosystem function, water quality and water use were all at the sub -healthy level and that water abundance was at the lowest, or sick, level. With the water transfer from the SNWDP, the health score of the water cycle in Beijing reached 4.04. The healthy grade accounted for 60% of the total score, and the water cycle system was generally in a healthy state. Beijing's water cycle health level is expected to further improve with increasing water diversion from the SNWDP and industrial restructuring. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Coupling habitat suitability and ecosystem health with AEHRA to estimate E-flows under intensive human activities	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Sustaining adequate environmental flows (e-flows) is a key principle for maintaining river biodiversity and ecosystem health, and for supporting sustainable water resource management in basins under intensive human activities. But few methods could correctly relate river health to e-flows assessment at the catchment scale when they are applied to rivers highly impacted by human activities. An effective method is presented in this study to closely link river health to e-flows assessment for rivers at the catchment scale. Key fish species, as indicators of ecosystem health, were selected by using the foodweb model. A multi-species-based habitat suitability model (MHSI) was improved, and coupled with dominance of the key fish species as well as the Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) to enhance its accuracy in determining the fish-preferred key hydrologic habitat variables related to ecosystem health. Taking 5964 fish samples and concurrent hydrological habitat variables as the basis, the combination of key variables of flow-velocity and water-depth were determined and used to drive the Adapted Ecological Hydraulic Radius Approach (AEHRA) to study e-flows in a Chinese urban river impacted by intensive human activities. Results showed that upstream urbanization resulted in abnormal river-course geomorphology and consequently abnormal e-flows under intensive human activities. Selection of key species based on the foodweb and trophic levels of aquatic ecosystems can reflect a comprehensive requirement on e-flows of the whole aquatic ecosystem, which greatly increases its potential to be used as a guidance tool for rehabilitation of degraded ecosystems at large spatial scales. These findings have significant ramifications for catchment e-flows assessment under intensive human activities and for river ecohealth restoration in such rivers globally. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Li, SY; Ye, C; Zhang, QF				Li, Siyue; Ye, Chen; Zhang, Quanfa			11-Year change in water chemistry of large freshwater Reservoir Danjiangkou, China	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Danjiangkou Reservoir, an important drinking water source, has become a hot spot internationally due to its draining catchment has been increasingly affected by anthropogenic activities. However, its natural water chemistry (major elements) received little attention though it is crucial for water quality and aquatic ecology. Major ions during 2004-2014 were determined using stoichiometry to explore their shifts and the driving factors in the Danjiangkou Reservoir. Results show significant differences in monthly, spatial and annual concentrations of major ions. Waters are controlled by carbonate weathering with the dominant ions of Ca2+ and HCO3- total contributing 74% to the solutes, which are consistent with regional geography. Carbonate dissolution was produced by sulfuric acid and carbonic acid in particular. The relative abundance of Ca2+ gradually decreases, Na+ + K+ abundance, however, has doubled in the recent 11 years. Population and human activities were the major drivers for several major ions, i.e., and Na+ concentrations were explained by population and GDP, and SO42- by GDP, industrial sewage and energy consumption. Estimation indicated that domestic salts and atmospheric deposition contributed 56% and 22% to Cl-, respectively. We conclude waters in the Reservoir are naturally controlled by rock weathering whilst some key elements largely contributed by anthropogenic activities. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This study presents a new fuzzy-based multi-objective compromise methodology to determine the socio-optimal and sustainable policies for hydro-environmental management of groundwater resources, which simultaneously considers the conflicts and negotiation of involved stakeholders, uncertainties in decision makers' preferences, existing uncertainties in the groundwater parameters and groundwater quality and quantity issues. The fuzzy multi-objective simulation-optimization model is developed based on qualitative and quantitative groundwater simulation model (MODFLOW and MT3D), multi-objective optimization model (NSGA-II), Monte Carlo analysis and Fuzzy Transformation Method (FTM). Best compromise solutions (best management policies) on trade-off curves are determined using four different Fuzzy Social Choice (FSC) methods. Finally, a unanimity fallback bargaining method is utilized to suggest the most preferred FSC method. Kavar-Maharloo aquifer system in Fars, Iran, as a typical multi-stakeholder multi-objective real-world problem is considered to verify the proposed methodology. Results showed an effective performance of the framework for determining the most sustainable allocation policy in groundwater resource management. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Overexploitation of groundwater in this plain has led to water level decline and caused serious problems such as land subsidence, aquifer destruction and water quality degradation. The increasing population and agricultural development along with drought and climate change, have further increased the pressure on water resources in this region over the last years. In order to overcome such crisis, introduction of surface water into an aquifer at particular locations can be a suitable solution. A wide variety of methods have been developed to recharge groundwater, one of which is aquifer storage and recovery (ASR). One of the fundamental principles of making such systems is delineation of suitable areas based on scientific and natural facts in order to achieve relevant objectives. To that end, the Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) in conjunction with the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) was applied in this study. More specifically, nine main parameters including depth of runoff as the considered source of water, morphology of the earth surface features such as geology, geomorphology, land use and land cover, drainage and aquifer characteristics along with quality of water in the aquifer were considered as the main layers in GIS. The runoff water available for artificial recharge in the basin was estimated through Soil Conservation Service (SCS) curve number method. The weighted curve number for each watershed was derived through spatial intersection of land use and hydrological soil group layers. Other thematic layers were extracted from satellite images, topographical map, and other collateral data sources, then weighed according to their influence in locating process. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method was then used to calculate weights of individual parameters. The normalized weighted layers were then overlaid to build up the recharge potential map. The results revealed that 34% of the total area is suitable and very suitable for groundwater recharge. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Seawater-flooding events and impact on freshwater lenses of low-lying islands: Controlling factors, basic management and mitigation	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												An unprecedented set of hydrologic observations was collected after the Dec 2008 seawater-flooding event on Roi-Namur, Kwajalein Atoll, Republic of the Marshall Islands. By two days after the seawater flooding that occurred at the beginning of dry season, the observed salinity of water withdrawn by the island's main skimming well increased to 100% seawater concentration, but by ten days later already decreased to only 10-20% of seawater fraction. However, the damaging impact on the potability of the groundwater supply (when pumped water had concentrations above 1% seawater fraction) lasted 22 months longer. The data collected make possible analyses of the hydrologic factors that control recovery and management of the groundwater-supply quality on Roi-Namur and on similar low-lying islands. With the observed data as a guide, three-dimensional numerical-model simulation analyses reveal how recovery is controlled by the island's hydrology. These also allow evaluation of the efficacy of basic water quality management/mitigation alternatives and elucidate how groundwater withdrawal and timing of the seawater-flooding event affect the length of recovery. Simulations show that, as might be expected, by adding surplus captured rainwater as artificial recharge, the freshwater-lens recovery period (after which potable groundwater may again be produced) can be shortened, with groundwater salinity remaining lower even during the dry season, a period during which no artificial recharge is applied. Simulations also show that the recovery period is not lengthened appreciably by groundwater withdrawals during recovery. Simulations further show that had the flooding event occurred at the start of the wet season, the recovery period would have been about 25% (5.5 months) shorter than actually occurred during the monitored flood that occurred at the dry-season start. Finally, analyses show that artificial recharge improves freshwater-lens water quality, making possible longer use of groundwater as a water supply throughout each year, even when no seawater flooding has occurred.

J	Goebel, M; Pidlisecky, A; Knight, R				Goebel, Meredith; Pidlisecky, Adam; Knight, Rosemary			Resistivity imaging reveals complex pattern of saltwater intrusion along Monterey coast	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Electrical Resistivity Tomography data were acquired along 40 km of the Monterey Bay coast in central California. These data resulted in electrical resistivity images to depths of approximately 280 m.b.s.l., which were used to understand the distribution of freshwater and saltwater in the subsurface, and factors controlling this distribution. The resulting resistivity sections were interpreted in conjunction with existing data sets, including well logs, seismic reflection data, geologic reports, hydrologic reports, and land use maps from the region. Interpretation of these data shows a complex pattern of saltwater intrusion resulting from geology, pumping, and recharge. The resistivity profiles were used to identify geological flow conduits and barriers such as palaeo-channels and faults, localized saltwater intrusion from individual pumping wells, infiltration zones of surface fresh and brackish water, and regions showing improvements in water quality due to management actions. The use of ERT data for characterizing the subsurface in this region has led to an understanding of the spatial distribution of freshwater and saltwater at a level of detail unattainable with the previously deployed traditional well based salinity mapping and monitoring techniques alone. Significant spatial variability in the extent and geometry of intrusion observed in the acquired data highlights the importance of adopting continuous subsurface characterization methods such as this one.

The impacts of environmental variables on water reflectance measured using a lightweight unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based spectrometer system	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												Remote sensing methods to study spatial and temporal changes in water quality using satellite or aerial imagery are limited by the inherently low reflectance signal of water across the visible and near infrared spectrum, as well as environmental variables such as surface scattering effects (sun glint), substrate and aquatic vegetation reflectance, and atmospheric effects. This study exploits the low altitude, high resolution remote sensing capabilities of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms to examine the major environmental variables that affect water reflectance acquisition, without the confounding influence of atmospheric effects typical of higher-altitude platforms. After observation and analysis, we found: (1) multiple water spectra measured at the same location had a standard deviation of 10.4%; (2) water spectra changes associated with increasing altitude from 20 m to 100 m were negligible; (3) the difference between mean reflectance at three off-shore locations in an urban water body reached 29.9%; (4) water bottom visibility increased water reflectance by 20.1% in near shore areas compared to deep water spectra in a clear water lake; (5) emergent plants caused the water spectra to shift towards a shape that is characteristic of vegetation, whereas submerged vegetation showed limited effect on water spectra in the studied lake; (6) cloud and sun glint had major effects and caused water spectra to change abruptly; while glint and shadow effects on spectra may balance each other under certain conditions, the water reflectance can also be unpredictable at times due to wave effects and their effects on lines-of-site to calm water; (7) water spectra collected under a variety of different conditions (e.g. multiple locations, waves) resulted in weaker regression models compared to spectra collected under ideal conditions (e.g. single location, no wave), although the resulting model coefficients were relatively stable. The methods and results from this study contribute to better understanding of water reflectance acquisition using remote sensing, and can be applied in UAV-based water quality assessment or to aid in validation of higher altitude imagery.

J	Bouderbala, A				Bouderbala, Abdelkader			Assessment of groundwater quality and its suitability for domestic and agricultural uses in Low-Isser plain, Boumedres, Algeria	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												The assessment of the suitability of groundwater for drinking and irrigation uses was carried out in the alluvial plain of Low-Isser in the north of Algeria. The plain covers an area of 533 km2 and lies in a Mediterranean sub-humid climate. Groundwater is the main source for domestic uses and agricultural activities in this area. Groundwater samples were collected from 15 wells during dry and wet seasons in 2015, and they were analyzed for major cations and anions and compared with drinking and irrigation specification standards. The comparison of chemical concentration with WHO drinking water standards of 2006 shows that more than 30% of groundwater samples are unsuitable for drinking, and the majority of groundwater samples fell on the hard and very hard categories. Suitability of groundwater for drinking was also evaluated based on the water quality index (WQI). It shows more than 80% of samples have good or permissible water quality for dry and wet seasons. In terms of the irrigation usage, generally, groundwater in the study area is suitable for different uses in both seasons according to SAR, %Na, RSBC, and PI. However, water rock exchange processes and groundwater flow have been responsible for the dominated water type Ca-Mg-Cl.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				AUG	2017	10	15							333	10.1007/s12517-017-3119-5								WOS:000407429400015

The use of multivariate statistical analysis in the assessment of groundwater hydrochemistry in some parts of southwestern Nigeria	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Multivariate statistical methods including factor analysis (FA), cluster analysis (CA), and correlation analysis have been used to evaluate the spatial variations and the interpretation of a complex water quality data set of some parts of Oyo State in southwestern Nigeria. Thirty water samples were collected from different stations, and 16 parameters were determined. Correlation analysis shows that the relationship between the parameters with high character of ion was higher than that of the parameters with low character of ion and that the variation in relationship shows the complexity in ground-water quality and the effect of the interactions between rock and water. Regression analysis was used for the prediction of values of one variable using the knowledge of other variables, for which more data are available. FA shows five distinct factors, which explained 84.3% of the total variance in water quality data set. The five factors are anthropogenic, ion exchange, weathering/leaching, anthropogenic, and nitrogen, which explained 28, 23, 14.2, 10.0, and 6.9% of the total variance, respectively. Hierarchical cluster analysis grouped the parameters into three major clusters. This study shows the uses of multivariate statistical methods for the interpretation of complex data sets in the analysis of spatial variations in water quality. This would therefore enhance planning for future studies.

While the surface water resources are perfectly managed and operated by means of dams and small dams built for several years, the groundwater resources remain long unknown and unusable because of the lack of relevant working tools (e.g., methods, formulas, maps, etc.) for planners and engineers working in the field of water resources exploration. To highlight the hydrodynamic processes of groundwater in shallow aquifers of the basins of northern Algeria, we conducted a study using 81 subwatersheds collected from different locations at the basins; taking into account the climatic and geomorphological factors, to understand water usage trends, analyse patterns, tap good shallow aquifers and ensure long lasting supplies of water through arid periods, mapping and modelling of groundwater are fundamental to problem resolution. Multivariate statistical techniques as well as cluster and principal component analysis were applied to the data on groundwater flow, with the objective of defining the main controls on the groundwater flows at the basins. These statistical techniques showed the presence of three groundwater flow groups with increasing importance according to precipitation. The first group was mainly influenced by climatic factors, the second was more controlled by the communication between the surface and underground flows and the third group revealed the influence of geomorphological factors on groundwater flows.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				AUG	2017	10	15							336	10.1007/s12517-017-3079-9								WOS:000407429400018

P, India	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												The unconfined coastal alluvial aquifers, although occurring in limited extent along ocean tracts, cater to the growing water requirements of most of the seaside habitation. By virtue of the physical location, the chemistry of ground-water in marine environment undergoes rapid modifications and is also susceptible to contamination. Through this paper, an attempt is made to chronicle the temporal changes in water chemistry and extent of contamination in the sandy aquifers utilizing the closely monitored data of 13 sampling sessions spread over 4 years. The water is of weak alkaline nature and less mineralized, electrical conductivity (EC) being <1000 mu S/cm in many samples. Major ion composition indicates that 60 to 80% of the samples are polluted with nitrates. Apart from nitrate, the water is also contaminated with respect to pH, EC, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, and SO4(2-) as about 5 to 20% of samples in different seasons have some of these parameters in more than the maximum permissible limits of Bureau of Indian Standards drinking water standards. Ionic abundance is in the order of WCl- > Na+ > Ca2+ > HCO3- > Mg2+ > SO42- > NO3-. Na+ and Cl-are almost in similar proportions implying affect of coastal climate on water quality. Even though spatial variations among constituent species are limited, the water can be classified into two distinct facies viz. Ca-Mg-Cl and Na-ClSO4 types. The stoichiometry analysis of long-term water chemistry data enunciate that multiple processes were involved in evolution of aquatic chemistry. Water-rock interaction with the aquifer matrix and carbonate dissolution was the most significant. It was further influenced by evaporation process and anthropogenic inputs which are authenticated by mean ionic ratios of Na+/Cl-, SO42-/Cl, Mg2+/Ca2+, and HCO3-/Cl-. Nitrate contamination, which is more rapid in habitat areas, can be attributed to poor sewerage and domestic waste disposal mechanism. Fertilizer inputs and continuous irrigation and agriculture activity can be accounted for the nitrate enrichment in agriculture areas. With the contaminant transport dynamics being uniform in the aquifer, difference in the intensity of contamination can be attributed to land use variations. Point source pollution from domestic and animal waste landfills is causing enormous damage to the groundwater. The study substantiate that shallow phreatic coastal aquifers suffers more from human interference than coastal climate effect.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				AUG	2017	10	15							321	10.1007/s12517-017-3114-x								WOS:000407429400003

Channel routing is a typical example of the mathematical conceptualization of watershed landscape and processes in hydrologic modeling. We investigated the sensitivity of accuracy, equifinality, and uncertainty of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) modeling to channel dimensions to demonstrate how a conceptual representation of a watershed system affects streamflow and sediment modeling. Results showed the amount of uncertainty and equifinality strongly responded to channel dimensions. On the other hand, the model performance did not significantly vary with the changes in the channel representation due to the degree of freedom allowed by the conceptual nature of hydrologic modeling in the parameter calibration. Such findings demonstrated good modeling performance statistics do not necessarily mean small output uncertainty, and partial improvements in the watershed representation may neither increase modeling accuracy nor reduce uncertainty. We also showed the equifinality and uncertainty of hydrologic modeling are case-dependent rather than specific to models or regions, suggesting great caution should be used when attempting to transfer uncertainty analysis results to other modeling studies, especially for ungauged watersheds.

J	Shabani, A; Zhang, XD; Ell, M				Shabani, Afshin; Zhang, Xiaodong; Ell, Mike			Modeling Water Quantity and Sulfate Concentrations in the Devils Lake Watershed Using Coupled SWAT and CE-QUAL-W2	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Devils Lake is an endorheic lake in the Red River of the North basin in northeastern North Dakota. During the last two decades, the lake water level has risen by nearly 10m, causing floods that have cost more than 1 billion USD in mitigation measures. Another increase of approximately 1.5m in the lake water level would cause spillage into the Sheyenne River. To alleviate this potentially catastrophic spillage, two artificial outlets were constructed. However, the artificial drainage of water into the Sheyenne River raises water quality concerns because the Devils Lake water contains significantly higher concentrations of dissolved solids, particularly sulfate. In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was coupled with the CE-QUAL-W2 model to simulate both water balance and sulfate concentrations in the lake. The SWAT model performed well in simulating daily flow in tributaries with E-NS>0.5 and |PBIAS|<25%, and reproduced the lake water level with a root mean square error of 0.35m for the study period from 1995 to 2014. The water temperature and sulfate concentrations simulated by CE-QUAL-W2 for the lake are in general agreement with the field observations. The model results show that the operation of the two outlets since August 2005 has lowered the lake level by 0.70m. Furthermore, the models show pumping water from the two outlets raises sulfate concentrations in the Sheyenne River from similar to 100 to >500mg/L.

Agricultural drainage ditches function to remove water quickly from farmed landscapes. Conventional ditch designs lack the form and function of natural stream systems and tend to be unstable and provide inadequate habitat. In October of 2009, 1.89km of a conventional drainage ditch in Mower County, Minnesota, was converted to an alternative system with a two-stage channel to investigate the improvements in water quality, stability, and habitat. Longitudinal surveys show a 12-fold increase in the pool-riffle formation. Cross-sectional surveys show an average increase in bankfull width of approximately 10% and may be associated to an increased frequency in large storm events. The average increase in bankfull depth was estimated as 18% but is largely influenced by pool formation. Rosgen Stability Analyses show the channel to be highly stable and the banks at a low risk of erosion. The average bankfull recurrence interval was estimated to be approximately 0.30years. Overall, the two-stage ditch design demonstrates an increase in fluvial stability, creating a more consistent sediment budget, and increasing the frequency of important instream habitat features, making this best management practice a viable option for addressing issues of erosion, sediment imbalance, and poor habitat in agricultural drainage systems.																	1093-474X	1752-1688				AUG	2017	53	4					886	902		10.1111/1752-1688.12541								WOS:000407043700011

Improving Predictive Models of In-Stream Phosphorus Concentration Based on Nationally-Available Spatial Data Coverages	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Spatial data are playing an increasingly important role in watershed science and management. Large investments have been made by government agencies to provide nationally-available spatial databases; however, their relevance and suitability for local watershed applications is largely unscrutinized. We investigated how goodness of fit and predictive accuracy of total phosphorus (TP) concentration models developed from nationally-available spatial data could be improved by including local watershed-specific data in the East Fork of the Little Miami River, Ohio, a 1,290km(2) watershed. We also determined whether a spatial stream network (SSN) modeling approach improved on multiple linear regression (nonspatial) models. Goodness of fit and predictive accuracy were highest for the SSN model that included local covariates, and lowest for the nonspatial model developed from national data. Septic systems and point source TP loads were significant covariates in the local models. These local data not only improved the models but enabled a more explicit interpretation of the processes affecting TP concentrations than more generic national covariates. The results suggest SSN modeling greatly improves prediction and should be applied when using national covariates. Including local covariates further increases the accuracy of TP predictions throughout the studied watershed; such variables should be included in future national databases, particularly the locations of septic systems.

Evaluation of bank filtration as a pretreatment method for the provision of hygienically safe drinking water in Norway: results from monitoring at two full-scale sites	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Two case studies were carried out in central Norway in order to assess the performance of bank filtration systems in cold-climate fluvial aquifers relying on recharge from humic-rich surface waters with moderate microbial contamination. Three municipal wells and two surface-water sources at operative bank filtration systems were monitored for naturally occurring bacteriophages, fecal indicators, natural organic matter (NOM) and physico-chemical water quality parameters during a 4-month period. Aquifer passage effectively reduced the microorganism and NOM concentrations at both study sites. Bacteriophages were detected in 13 of 16 (81%) surface-water samples and in 4 of 24 (17%) well-water samples, and underwent 3 +/- 0.3 log(10) reduction after 50-80-m filtration and 20-30 days of subsurface passage. NOM reductions (color: 74-97%; dissolved organic carbon: 54-80%; very hydrophobic acids: 70%) were similar to those achieved by conventional water-treatment processes and no further treatment was needed. Both groundwater dilution and sediment filtration contributed to the hygienic water quality improvements, but sediment filtration appeared to be the most important process with regard to microbial and NOM reductions. A strengths-weaknesses-opportunities-threats analysis showed that bank filtration technology has a high potential as a pretreatment method for the provision of hygienically safe drinking water in Norway.																	1431-2174	1435-0157				AUG	2017	25	5					1257	1269		10.1007/s10040-017-1576-2								WOS:000406286200005

Interpreting temporal variations in river response functions: an example from the Arkansas River, Kansas, USA	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Groundwater/surface-water interactions can play an important role in management of water quality and quantity, but the temporal and spatial variability of these interactions makes them difficult to incorporate into conceptual models. There are simple methods for identifying the presence of groundwater/surface-water interactions; however, identifying flow mechanisms and pathways can be challenging. More complex methods are available to better identify these mechanisms and pathways but are often too time consuming or costly. In this work, a simple method for interpreting and identifying flow mechanisms and sources using temporal variations of river response functions is presented. This approach is demonstrated using observations from two sites along the Arkansas River in Kansas, USA. A change in flow mechanisms between the rising and falling limbs of river hydrographs was identified, along with a second surface-water source to the aquifer, a finding that was validated with stable isotope analyses.																	1431-2174	1435-0157				AUG	2017	25	5					1271	1282		10.1007/s10040-017-1545-9								WOS:000406286200006

The SBR method is validated against synthetic data competitively with other conventional robust and non-robust methods. From the results, it is verified that the estimation accuracies of the SBR method are consistent and superior to those of other methods, and the uncertainties are reasonably estimated; the others have no uncertainty analysis option. To validate further, actual groundwater data are employed and analyzed comparatively with Gaussian process regression (GPR). For all cases, the trend and the associated uncertainties are reasonably estimated by both SBR and GPR regardless of Gaussian or non-Gaussian skewed data. However, it is expected that GPR has a limitation in applications to severely corrupted data by outliers owing to its non-robustness. From the implementations, it is determined that the SBR method has the potential to be further developed as an effective tool of anomaly detection or outlier identification in groundwater state data such as the groundwater level and contaminant concentration.																	1431-2174	1435-0157				AUG	2017	25	5					1491	1500		10.1007/s10040-017-1561-9								WOS:000406286200019

In this study, fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) were used to estimate five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (COD), suspended sediment (SS), total nitrogen (TN), pH, total phosphorus (TP), ammonia nitrogen (NH3+-N), turbidity (NTU), and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in inland freshwater streams. The study area was located in Ebinur Lake Watershed, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China. Our results showed that the four fluorescence components were successfully extrapolated by the PARAFAC factor analysis modeling from the fluorescence EEM data including microbial humic-like (C1), terrestrial humic-like organic substances (C2, C4), and protein-like organic substances (C3). The four PARAFAC components were selected as the water quality monitoring index of river water samples. Three-dimensional fluorescence index analysis showed that terrigenous organic pollution was the main organic pollution type in the watershed. This indicates that the watershed is subject to human disturbance, given the large variation of organic pollution in the water body. There was a significant correlation between the three-dimensional fluorescence index, the fluorescence components, and surface water quality index. In addition, the application of three-dimensional fluorescence index and fluorescence component to establish water quality index produced a model fitting coefficient greater than 0.5, which demonstrated that the accuracy of the model was in line with monitoring requirements in practice. This implies that the use of three-dimensional fluorescence index and three-dimensional fluorescence component to monitor Ebinur Lake Watershed water quality has a great potential.

Pairing paleolimnological inference models with mechanistic water column models enhances assessment of lake water quality	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Reconciliation of paleolimnology inference models with hindcasts from mechanistic water column models aided the reconstruction of past relationships for total phosphorus/dissolved oxygen and acid neutralizing capacity/pH in highly polluted lake ecosystems in New York State. Pre-disturbance Onondaga Lake, Syracuse, NY, was shown to have experienced seasonal hypolimnetic anoxia even under oligotrophic (< 10 ug l(-1)) phosphorus levels. In the Adirondack Mountains of New York State the paired modeling confirmed that, while many lakes have the potential to eventually recover from acidification by atmospheric deposition, approximately 30% likely experienced naturally acidic conditions (pH < 6) prior to increases in industrial emissions. Comparison between the model results illuminated areas of individual model inadequacy, improved understanding of lake ecology, and increased confidence in the ability of predictive water column models to accurately develop restoration scenarios representing improved conditions. The work presented here is the first such comparison modeling for total phosphorus, dissolved oxygen, and acid neutralizing capacity. The technique remains to be more widely applied geographically and extended to less heavily stressed lake systems. Because a fossil inference and mechanistic hindcast should independently lead to similar results, comparison modeling is a potentially powerful tool for examining past interactions between ecosystem structure and ecosystem functioning.

Knowledge about the quality of surface or groundwater used to irrigate crops in that region is low. This paper aims to contribute to the knowledge of the quality of groundwater for agricultural use through the characterization of the spatial variability. Assuming a random spatial distribution of 45 samples which were collected in situ were determined: acidity and alkalinity (pH), electrical conductivity (EC), Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), cations and anions and trace elements; in addition to the agricultural index: Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR), Residual Sodium Carbonate (RSC), Soluble Sodium Percentage (SSP), Sodium Percentage (% Na), Kelly Ratio (KR), Magnesium Adsorption Ratio (MAR), Permeability Index (PI), Effective Salinity (ES), Salinity Potential (SP) and Osmotic Potential (OP). In general, SSP, % Na, KR, PI are low, there is only one anomalous point (9) with high values at W of the study area. Similarly, PS, ES, Cl, Na and SAR are low except point 16 and conversely, RSC and pH are high, except at this point located in the center of the study area. The results allow us to infer that the water in that aquifer presents no problems or sodicity toxic ions. In 27 sites sampled values above 250 mu mhos/cm were found at 25 degrees C, classified as medium to high risk of salinity, unsuitable for agricultural use. Analysis of the combined effect of the presence of sodium (SAR) and salinity (EC or TDS) shows that 27 of analyzing sites have restricted water medium at very high for use in irrigation.

Measuring Flow Rate in Crystalline Bedrock Wells Using the Dissolved Oxygen Alteration Method	GROUNDWATER												Determination of vertical flow rates in a fractured bedrock well can aid in planning and implementing hydraulic tests, water quality sampling, and improving interpretations of water quality data. Although flowmeters are highly accurate in flow rate measurement, the high cost and logistics may be limiting. In this study the dissolved oxygen alteration method (DOAM) is expanded upon as a low-cost alternative to determine vertical flow rates in crystalline bedrock wells. The method entails altering the dissolved oxygen content in the wellbore through bubbler aeration, and monitoring the vertical advective movement of the dissolved oxygen over time. Measurements were taken for upward and downward flows, and under ambient and pumping conditions. Vertical flow rates from 0.06 to 2.30 Lpm were measured. To validate the method, flow rates determined with the DOAM were compared to pump discharge rates and found to be in agreement within 2.5%.																	0017-467X	1745-6584				JUL-AUG	2017	55	4					588	592		10.1111/gwat.12512								WOS:000408992800014	28329412

This paper focuses on a new permeability-improvement technology, liquid carbon dioxide phase change fracturing technology. This technology can be classified as physical blasting by using the phase energy of liquid carbon dioxide in the drilling underground coal mine. According to the results of field tests, by applying the liquid carbon dioxide phase change fracturing technology, the radius of the damaged area in the coal body around the drilling reached 5 m. Also, compared with the original coal body, the permeability of the damaged area increased approximately six times. In addition, based on the permeability of the damaged area, the influence of the liquid carbon dioxide phase change fracturing technology on the gas drainage radius was analyzed by numerical calculation. It can be observed from the numerical results that the effect of gas drainage was improved greatly by the liquid carbon dioxide phase change fracturing operation. Research results of this paper can contribute to safe and efficient mining of coal mines.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				JUL	2017	10	14							314	10.1007/s12517-017-3103-0								WOS:000407428400009

Hydrogeochemical assessment of surface and groundwater resources of Korba coalfield, Central India: environmental implications	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												The present study assesses the impact of coal mining on surface and groundwater resources of Korba Coalfield, Central India. Accordingly, water samples collected from various sources are analyzed for major ions, trace elements, and other mine effluent parameters. Results show that the groundwater samples are slightly acidic, whereas river water and mine water samples are mildly alkaline. Elevated concentrations of Ca2+, Na+, HCO3-, and SO42- alongside the molar ratios (Ca2+ + Mg2+)/(SO4 (2-)+ HCO3-) < 1 and Na+/Cl- > 1 suggest that silicate weathering (water-rock interaction) coupled with ion exchange are dominant solute acquisition processes controlling the chemistry of groundwater in the study area. The overall hydrogeochemistry of the area is dominated by two major hydrogeochemical facies (i. e., Ca-Cl-SO4 and Ca-HCO3). Analysis of groundwater and river water quality index (GRWQI) elucidates that majority (82%) of samples are of "excellent" to "good" category, and the remaining 12% are of "poor" quality. Similarly, the effluent water quality index (EWQI) indicates that 6 out of 8 samples belong to excellent quality. Concentration of trace element constituents such as As, Zn, Cu, Cr, and Cd is found to be well within the stipulated limits for potable use, except for Fe, Mn, and Pb. Suitability of water samples for irrigation purpose, established using standard tools like Wilcox and USSL diagrams, reveal "excellent to permissible" category for majority of the samples. The present study also substantiates the effectiveness of the measures implemented for the treatment of mine effluent water.

Geochemical Characteristics and Evaluation of Minor and Trace Elements Pollution in Groundwater of Tuticorin City, Tamil Nadu, India using Geospatial Techniques	JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA												In this work the major and trace elements pollution levels in groundwater of Tuticorin city of Tamil Nadu was investigated. This coastal city with numerous large and small scale industries has increasingly affected the water quality by dumping effluents. The mean major and trace elements levels in groundwater in descending order: Si > Sr > Zn > Fe > Rb > Se > Al > Mn > Cu > As > Cr > Ba > V > Ni > Pb > Mo > Co > Sb > Cd > Ag. The concentrations of As, Se, Pb, Ba, Al, Fe and V (0.084, 0.150, 0.057, 0.837, 0.357 and 0.052) in some of the groundwater samples exceed the standard value of world health organization (WHO, 2004). Interrelationship between the elements was done by correlation matrix and factor analysis which indicates the contribution from industrial and irrigation fields. Spatial interpolation of inverse distance method (IDW) maps of all the elements suggested that discharge of effluents from chemical factory (STERLITE, TAC, SPIC, HEAVY WATER PLANT, NILA SEA FOODS), municipal wastewater, fertilizers were added to the natural sources. Results of this research suggests that proper measures should be taken to protect the vital groundwater resources in the Tuticorin city.																	0016-7622	0974-6889				JUL	2017	90	1					62	68		10.1007/s12594-017-0664-1								WOS:000406259500008

Groundwater quality assessment for drinking purpose in Raipur city, Chhattisgarh using water quality index and geographic information system	JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA												An effort has been made to comprehend the groundwater quality of Raipur city for drinking purpose utilizing Water Quality Index (WQI) and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques. In this study thirty four groundwater samples were collected during May, 2015. Standard methods has been adopted in groundwater sampling which are prescribed by the American Public Health Association (APHA, 1995). Eight water quality parameters have been considered to ascertained water quality index viz. pH, chloride, fluoride, calcium, magnesium, alkalinity, hardness and nitrate. The Bureau of Indian Standard (BIS, 2009) has been considered to assess the suitability of groundwater for drinking purposes and for the calculation of WQI. This study reveals that 76% area is falling under excellent, very good and good category and 24% area is falling under poor, very poor and unfit category as per the WQI classification. The predicted accuracy of the obtained result is around 97.05% reflecting capability of adopted techniques. Anthropogenic activities are influencing the groundwater quality of the study area. The present study is helpful in proper planning and management of available water resource for drinking purpose.

J	Babbar, R; Babbar, S				Babbar, Richa; Babbar, Sakshi			Predicting river water quality index using data mining techniques	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												This paper demonstrates the application of data mining techniques to predict river water quality index. The usefulness of these techniques lies in the automated extraction of novel knowledge from the data to improve decision-making. The popular classification techniques, namely k-nearest neighbor, decision trees, Naive Bayes, artificial neural networks, rule-based and support vector machines were used to develop the predictive environment to classify water quality into understandable terms based on the Overall Index of Pollution. Experimentation was conducted on two types of data sets: synthetic and real. A repeated k-fold cross-validation procedure was followed to design the learning and testing frameworks of the predictive environment. Based on the validation results, it was found that the error rate in defining the true water quality class was 20 and 28%, 11 and 24%, 1 and 38% and 10 and 20% for the k-nearest neighbor, Naive Bayes, artificial neural network and rule-based classifiers for synthetic and real data sets, respectively. The decision tree and support vector machines classifiers were found to be the best predictive models with 0% error rates during automated extraction of the water quality class. This study reveals that data mining techniques have the potential to quickly predict water quality class, provided data given are a true representation of the domain knowledge.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JUL	2017	76	14							504	10.1007/s12665-017-6845-9								WOS:000406241000037						
J	Disli, E				Disli, E.			Hydrochemical characteristics of surface and groundwater and suitability for drinking and agricultural use in the Upper Tigris River Basin, Diyarbakir-Batman, Turkey	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Investigations were undertaken into the quality of surface water and groundwater bodies within the Upper Tigris Basin in Turkey to determine their suitability for potable and agricultural use. In the study area, the majority of the groundwater and surface water samples belong to the calcium-magnesium-bicarbonate type (Ca-Mg-HCO3) or magnesium-calcium-bicarbonate type (Mg-Ca-HCO3). Chemical analysis of all water samples shows that the mean cation concentrations (in mg/L) were in the order Ca2+ > Mg2+ > Na+ > K+ and that of anions are in the order HCO3- > SO42- > Cl- > CO3- for all groundwater and surface water samples. The Mg (2+)/Ca2+ ratio ranges from 0.21 to 1.30 with most of the values greater than 0.5, indicating that weathering of dolomites is dominant in groundwater. The analysis reveals that all of the samples are neutral to slightly alkaline (pH 7.0-8.7). Groundwater and surface water suitability for drinking usage was evaluated according to the World Health Organization and Turkish Standards (TSE-266) and suggests that most of the samples are suitable for drinking. Various determinants such as sodium absorption ratio, percent sodium (Na %), residual sodium carbonate and soluble sodium percentage revealed that most of the samples are suitable for irrigation. According to MH values, all of the well water samples were suitable for irrigation purposes, but 80 and 81.82% of Zillek springs and surface water samples were unsuitable. As per the PI values, the water samples from the study area are classified as Class I and Class II and are considered to be suitable for irrigation.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JUL	2017	76	14							500	10.1007/s12665-017-6820-5								WOS:000406241000033

N.; Chaudhury, Shibani			Optimization of the quality of reverse osmosis-treated coal bed water in relation to its effect on soil health	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												During the time of extraction of coal bed methane (CBM) gas, vast quantity of imbedded water is also simultaneously released to the surface. Quality of this water is generally very poor owing to high salt content, and discharge of such water to the land surface frequently results in serious deterioration of the soil health through expansion of salinity and alkalinity problems. Use of reverse osmosis (RO) technology has appeared to be an effective proposition for bringing down the ionic concentrations of coal bed water (CBW) and facilitating their safe release. However, reclaiming the large volume of CBW through RO is expensive and is difficult to be afforded by many CBM producers from developing countries. In this study, we assessed the possibility of releasing an intermediate-quality RO-treated CBW which will not affect the health of the flooded soils and also will involve lesser cost of RO operation. The study showed that the quality of RO-treated CBW below 2 mmho/cm did not affect the incubated soil very adversely with regard to the major soil health attributes. However, exchangeable sodium percentage of the RO water-treated soil exhibited sharp increments when the EC value of the RO water increased to 2.0 mmho/cm resulting in development of high alkalinity. It is, therefore, suggested that while treating CBW with RO technology for discharging the resultant water to adjacent areas, it is not necessary to produce highly purified reclaimed water. Instead of going for high level of reclamation, discharge of a moderate-quality treated water may be an effective proposition for improving the economy of CBW reclamation without affecting the health of the CBW-influenced soils.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JUL	2017	76	14							474	10.1007/s12665-017-6809-0								WOS:000406241000007						
J	Neogi, B; Singh, AK; Pathak, DD; Chaturvedi, A				Neogi, Babita; Singh, Abhay Kumar; Pathak, D. D.; Chaturvedi, Aaditya			Hydrogeochemistry of coal mine water of North Karanpura coalfields, India: implication for solute acquisition processes, dissolved fluxes and water quality assessment	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Mine water samples collected from different mines of the North Karanpura coalfields were analysed for pH, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids (TDS), total hardness (TH), major anions, cations and trace metals to evaluate mine water geochemistry and assess solute acquisition processes, dissolved fluxes and its suitability for domestic, industrial and irrigation uses. Mine water samples are mildly acidic to alkaline in nature. The TDS ranged from 185 to 1343 mg L-1 with an average of 601 mg L-1. Ca2+ and Mg2+ are the dominant cations, while SO42- and HCO3- are the dominant anions. A high concentration of SO42- and a low HCO3(-)/(HCO3- + SO42-) ratio (< 0.50) in the majority of the water samples suggest that either sulphide oxidation or reactions involving both carbonic acid weathering and sulphide oxidation control solute acquisition processes. The mine water is undersaturated with respect to gypsum, halite, anhydrite, fluorite, aluminium hydroxide, alunite, amorphous silica and oversaturated with respect to goethite, ferrihydrite, quartz. About 40% of the mine water samples are oversaturated with respect to calcite, dolomite and jarosite. The water quality assessment shows that the coal mine water is not suitable for direct use for drinking and domestic purposes and needs treatment before such utilization. TDS, TH, F-, SO42-, Fe, Mn, Ni and Al are identified as the major objectionable parameters in these waters for drinking. The coal mine water is of good to suitable category for irrigation use.

Uncertainty assessment of the multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network model with implementation of the novel hybrid MLP-FFA method for prediction of biochemical oxygen demand and dissolved oxygen: a case study of Langat River	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Accurate prediction of the chemical constituents in major river systems is a necessary task for water quality management, aquatic life well-being and the overall healthcare planning of river systems. In this study, the capability of a newly proposed hybrid forecasting model based on the firefly algorithm (FFA) as a metaheuristic optimizer, integrated with the multilayer perceptron (MLP-FFA), is investigated for the prediction of monthly water quality in Langat River basin, Malaysia. The predictive ability of the MLP-FFA model is assessed against the MLP-based model. To validate the proposed MLP-FFA model, monthly water quality data over a 10-year duration (2001-2010) for two different hydrological stations (1L04 and 1L05) provided by the Irrigation and Drainage Ministry of Malaysia are used to predict the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and dissolved oxygen (DO). The input variables are the chemical oxygen demand (COD), total phosphate (PO4), total solids, potassium (K), sodium (Na), chloride (Cl), electrical conductivity (EC), pH and ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N). The proposed hybrid model is then evaluated in accordance with statistical metrics such as the correlation coefficient (r), root-mean-square error, % root-mean-square error and Willmott's index of agreement. Analysis of the results shows that MLP-FFA outperforms the equivalent MLP model. Also, in this research, the uncertainty of a MLP neural network model is analyzed in relation to the predictive ability of the MLP model. To assess the uncertainties within the MLP model, the percentage of observed data bracketed by 95 percent predicted uncertainties (95PPU) and the band width of 95 percent confidence intervals (d-factors) are selected. The effect of input variables on BOD and DO prediction is also investigated through sensitivity analysis. The obtained values bracketed by 95PPU show about 77.7%, 72.2% of data for BOD and 72.2%, 91.6% of data for DO related to the 1L04 and 1L05 stations, respectively. The d-factors have a value of 1.648, 2.269 for BOD and 1.892, 3.480 for DO related to the 1L04 and 1L05 stations, respectively. Based on the values in both stations for the 95PPU and d-factor, it is concluded that the neural network model has an acceptably low degree of uncertainty applied for BOD and DO simulations. The findings of this study can have important implications for error assessment in artificial intelligence-based predictive models applied for water resources management and the assessment of the overall health in major river systems.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JUL	2017	76	14							503	10.1007/s12665-017-6842-z								WOS:000406241000036

V.; Kaur, Harjeet			An evaluation of irrigation water suitability in the Dwarka river basin through the use of GIS-based modelling	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												A GIS-based irrigation water quality (IWQ) assessment of the Dwarka river basin was undertaken using water suitability indicators including determinations of values of: soluble sodium percentage, exchangeable sodium ratio or Kelly ratio, residual sodium carbonate, magnesium adsorption ratios, total hardness, sodium adsorption ratio and permeability indices, electrical conductivity, and fluoride concentrations (F-). Inverse distance weighted algorithms and weighted overlays were used to categorise irrigation water quality into a number of zones. The IWQ zonation analysis revealed that about 10% (42.15 km(2)) of the total area had water quality unsuitable for irrigation thereby potentially exposing a population of 35744 people from 110 villages to health risks, whereas the remaining 91.31% (393 km(2)) of the study area is considered to have suitable irrigation water. The villages of Nawapara, Sehara and Deucha have been particularly affected by poor water quality, potentially exposing 294 (100%), 114 (97%) and 1556 (87.76%) of the total village population, respectively, to health effects. Combined efforts of government agencies and NGOs in educating the local communities regarding artificial groundwater recharge, rainwater harvesting, watershed management can play a crucial role in the long run in minimising the potential impacts of poor water quality in these areas.

Quantifying flow interval-pollutant loading relationships in a rapidly urbanizing mixed-land-use watershed of the Central USA	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Rapid urbanization and agricultural development have altered flow and pollutant loading regimes resulting in poorly understood pollutant transport regimes and inadequately conceived management practices. Four years of hydrologic and water quality data (i.e., stream flow, suspended sediment, nitrate, nitrite, total ammonium, total inorganic nitrogen, and total phosphorus) were collected using a five-site nested-scale study design in a representative mixed-land-use watershed. Cumulative nested sub-basin drainage areas ranged from 79 to 208 km(2). Daily flow and load duration analyses were used to quantify land use impacts to flow-mediated pollutant loading at multiple flow intervals including high flows (0-10%), moist conditions (10-40%), mid-range flows (40-60%), dry conditions (60-90%), and low flows (90-100%). Pollutant loads ranged across four orders of magnitude for suspended sediments, and three orders of magnitude for nutrient loads during the high flow interval when nearly all of the total pollutant loads were transported (e.g., 99% of suspended sediments, 92% of total inorganic nitrogen, and 95% of total phosphorus loads). Results from stepwise multiple linear regression analyses showed significant relationships between land use, flow, and pollutant load at high flows, moist conditions, and mid-range flow intervals (R-2 < 75.7; p < 0.035). No significant relationships (p < 0.05) were detected during dry conditions, or low flow intervals. Results highlight the need for consideration of combined flow and pollutant loading targets appropriate for watersheds modified by current and ongoing land use and point to a need for long-term and broad-scale efforts to develop achievable hydrologic and water quality recommendations especially in rapidly urbanizing mixed-land-use watersheds.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JUL	2017	76	14							484	10.1007/s12665-017-6819-y								WOS:000406241000017

The Biological Flora of Coastal Dunes and Wetlands: Halodule wrightii Ascherson	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Information on the seagrass Halodule wrightii was assembled describing its taxonomy, phylogeny, and geographic distribution and its plant communities, ecology, population biology, reproduction, and biotic interactions. The objective was to review the current understanding of its role as a pioneer species that thrives in nutrient-rich waters and has a broad tolerance range to abiotic factors, such as salinity, temperature, depth, and light. Its short life cycle, high degree of vegetative reproduction, and rapid growth allow it to colonize areas that have undergone disturbances, e.g., those affected by hurricanes. It occurs in monospecific stands or mixed with other seagrasses (Ruppia maritima, Thalassia testudinum, Syringodium filiforme, Zostera marina) and exhibits both vegetative and sexual reproduction but does not flower often. Worsening water quality is the main cause of seagrass decline in the world, along with other human activities, such as fishing, dredging, boating, and tourism. Given its usefulness, it is important to establish programs for the restoration and management of this species.

In this study, hydrogeochemical and isotope methods were employed to determine regional and local hydrogeology and characteristics of the basin. Optical, thermal and radar remote sensing products were used to update geological and structural maps of the basin and determine sampling points using the judgment sampling method. A total of 363 samples from wells, springs, rivers, lakes, swamps and rain were collected for this study, and an additional 270 water quality data sets were added from previous studies. These data were analyzed for their hydrogeochemical characteristics and isotope signatures. Analysis of the oxygen, deuterium and tritium isotopes shows the groundwater of the basin is modern water. Among all basins in Ethiopia, the Baro-Akobo Basin shows the highest enrichment. This indicates the proximity of the rainfall sources, which presumably are the Sudd and other wetlands in South Sudan. The hydrochemical properties of the waters show evapotranspiration is the dominant hydrologic process in the basin and explains the large amount of water that is lost in the lowland plain. Analysis of radon-222 shows no significant groundwater flux over the wetlands, which are part of Machar Marshes. This shows evaporation to be dominant hydrologic process in this zone. Results from all analyses help explain the limited holding capacity of the aquifers in the recharge zone and their vulnerability to anthropogenic impacts and climate variability. There is a trend of decreasing surface flow and rainfall and increasing water soil erosion.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JUL	2017	76	13							466	10.1007/s12665-017-6773-8								WOS:000405283600021

In the present study, a study of the hydrogeochemical characteristics of groundwater was undertaken in the Sonipat district of Haryana in India together with the use of stable isotope (delta O-18 and delta D) measurements and GIS analysis. A total of 53 groundwater samples were collected from seven blocks of the district, and 14 water quality parameters and stable isotopes (delta O-18 and delta D) were analysed to infer hydrogeochemical processes taking place in the area. The integration of hydrochemistry with GIS is very helpful to understand the factors governing in the area. The majority of the samples showed Na-Cl type of hydrochemical facies. The trilinear plot for major cations and anions in groundwater indicates dominance of sodium, calcium, chloride and bicarbonate ions. Nitrate plumes in the groundwater appear to be migrating in groundwater from the central and south-western parts of the area towards the urbanized areas. A total of 64% of the samples exceed the maximum permissible limit of 1.5 mg/L given by WHO for fluoride. Besides natural sources such as silicate and carbonate weathering, ion exchange, and reverse ion exchange, the leaching of surficial salts and untreated industrial wastes along with unregulated abstraction are contributing to poor groundwater quality in the study area. An assessment of saturation indices has shown that groundwater in the area is unsaturated with respect to anhydrite, halite and gypsum suggesting significant contribution of Ca2+, Mg2+ and other ions in the groundwater. A scatter plot of delta O-18 versus Cl also suggests mixing of saline water with fresh groundwater.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JUL	2017	76	13							465	10.1007/s12665-017-6789-0								WOS:000405283600020						
J	Su, H; Kang, WD; Xu, YJ; Wang, JD				Su, He; Kang, Weidong; Xu, Yuanjun; Wang, Jiading			Evaluation of groundwater quality and health risks from contamination in the north edge of the Loess Plateau, Yulin City, Northwest China	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Groundwater is a vital source for domestic and irrigation purposes in the loess area of Northwest China where climate is arid. However, the quality of groundwater in this area is deteriorating due to intensive industrial and agricultural activities, and this has a great adverse impact on human health. In order to better understand the pollution status of groundwater and the health risks to local residents, comprehensive water quality index was applied to assess the quality of drinking water in Yulin City, Northwest China, and sodium adsorption ratio, sodium percentage, residual sodium carbonate and permeability index were used to evaluate the quality of irrigation water. Moreover, the health risks caused by ingestion of groundwater were evaluated using the model proposed by the Ministry of Environmental Protection of the PR China. The results show that all groundwater samples for irrigation will not induce soil salinization, but more than half of them are not suitable for drinking, and Fe, Mn, TH, Mg2+ and NO3-N are the common contaminants which are mainly from natural processes, industrial and agricultural activities. The health risk assessment indicates that children face greater non-carcinogenic risk than adults. The order of contribution of contaminants to non-carcinogenic risk is NO3- > As > F- > Fe > Mn > Ba2+ > Cr6+ > Zn > NO2-. The average carcinogenic risk of carcinogens (Cr6+ and As) is 1.17 x 10(-4) and 1.37 x 10(-4) for adults and children, respectively, which surpasses the permissible level (1 x 10(-6)) stipulated by the Ministry of Environmental Protection of the PR China. Hence, effective measures are highly demanded to manage groundwater pollution and reduce the risks to human health.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JUL	2017	76	13							467	10.1007/s12665-017-6781-8								WOS:000405283600022

Interrelationship between geochemical elements of sediment and groundwater at Samrak Park Delta of Nakdong River Basin in Korea: multivariate statistical analyses and artificial neural network approaches	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												This research was conducted at Samrak Park Delta of Nakdong River Basin in Busan Metropolitan City, Korea. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the interrelationship of geochemical elements in sediments and groundwater through multivariate statistical analyses and a multilayer perceptron artificial neural network model. The mean concentrations of chemical elements were Si (46%), Fe (16.9%), Al (15.7%), K (7.5%) and Ca (4.5%) in sediments, and Na (8650 mg/L), Mg (999 mg/L), Ca (432 mg/L), K (293 mg/L) and Cl (17,640 mg/L) in groundwater, respectively. The principal component analysis produced 3 kinds of factors with the variances of 63.37, 27.02 and 9.62%, respectively. It is suggested that the chemical components of sediments and groundwater were mainly originated from source rocks and seawater intrusion, with the minor impacts of irrigation and industry. Cluster analysis also showed that chemical elements were mainly controlled by the natural geogenic sources and seawater intrusion. Multilayer perceptron of artificial neural network (ANN) presented the good interrelationship between sediment and groundwater. The determination coefficients (R-2) between ANN predicted values and observed values in groundwater showed the high values of 0.61-0.97 except Mg, Mn and Sr. It is revealed that the chemical components of sediment and groundwater were derived from local geological origin and from the minor impact of anthropogenic sources. Multivariate analyses and ANN contributed to the identification of the mutual relationship between the geochemical elements of sediment and those of groundwater.

However, human activities significantly decreased groundwater quality. In this study, the spatiotemporal variation of groundwater quality was evaluated in an arid area where long-term paper wastewater irrigation has been implemented. For this study, seven wells were regularly monitored for physicochemical parameters over a period of 1 year. Statistical and graphical approaches were applied to interpret the spatiotemporal variation of groundwater quality parameters in the wastewater irrigation zone. Correlation analysis was also carried out to reveal the sources of some major ions. The results indicate that the groundwater type in the study area is dominated by the Cl-Na, followed by the HCO3-Na, the HCO3-Ca center dot Mg, and the SO4 center dot Cl-Ca center dot Mg types. Groundwater in the area is significantly contaminated locally with fluoride, nitrite and ammonia, and the chemical oxygen demand levels were increased in some groundwater monitoring wells. Most contaminants showed an increasing trend from the Yellow River water irrigation zone toward the wastewater irrigation zone. Rock weathering, mineral dissolution, and cation exchange are important processes controlling groundwater quality, but human activities, such as wastewater irrigation, play an undeniable role in affecting groundwater quality in this area. The results of this study contribute to the understanding of the formation and circulation of groundwater under human activities and provide a scientific basis for regional water quality evaluation, water quality improvement, and protection.

The 19 lakes were divided into two groups according to EC (threshold value = 800 mu S cm(-1)): fresh water (N = 13) and brackish water lakes (N = 6). The fluorescent characteristics of CDOM in the 19 lakes were investigated using excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy (EEM) coupled with parallel factor (PARAFAC) and multivariate analysis. Two humic-like components (C1 and C3), one tryptophan-like component (C2), and one tyrosine-like component (C4) were identified by PARAFAC. The component C4 was not included in subsequent analyses due to the strong scatter in some colloidal water samples from brackish water lakes. The correlations between F-max for the three EEM-PARAFAC extracted CDOM components C1-C3, the fluorescence indices (FI370 and FI310) and the water quality parameters (i.e., TN, TP, Chl-a, pH, EC, turbidity (Turb) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC)) were determined by redundancy analysis (RDA). The results of RDA analysis showed that spatial variation in land cover, pollution sources, and salinity/EC gradients in water quality affected F-max for the fluorescent components C1-C3 and the fluorescence indices (FI370 and FI310). Further examination indicated that the CDOM fluorescent components and the fluorescence indices (FI370 and F1310) did not significantly differ (t-test, p > 0.05) in fresh water (N = 13) and brackish water lakes (N = 6). There was a difference in the distribution of the average F-max for the CDOM fluorescent components between Cl to C3 from agricultural sources and urban wastewater sources in hypereutrophic brackish water lakes. The F-max for humic-like components Cl and C3 spatially varied with land cover among the 19 lakes. Our results indicated that the spatial distributions of F-max for CDOM fluorescent components and their correlations with water quality can be evaluated by EEM-PARAFAC and multivariate analysis among the 19 lakes across semiarid regions of Northeast China, which has potential implication for lakes with similar genesis.

Assessment of nutrient loadings of a large multipurpose prairie reservoir	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The relatively low water flow velocities in reservoirs cause them to have high capacities for retaining sed-iments and pollutants, which can lead to a reduction in downstream nutrient loading. Hence, nutrients can progressively accumulate in reservoirs, resulting in the deterioration of aquatic ecosystems and water quality. Lake Diefenbaker (LD) is a large multipurpose reservoir, located on the South Saskatchewan River (SSR), that serves as a major source of freshwater in Saskatchewan, Canada. Over the past several years, changes in land use (e.g. expansion of urban areas and industrial developments) in the reservoir's catchment have heightened concerns about future water quality in the catchment and in the reservoir. Intensification of agricultural activities has led to an increase in augmented the application of manure and fertilizer for crops and pasture. Although previous research has attempted to quantify nutrient retention in LD, there is a knowledge gap related to the identification of major nutrient sources and quantification of nutrient export from the catchment at different spatial scales. Using the SPAtially Referenced Regression On Watershed (SPARROW) model, this gap has been addressed by assessing water quality regionally, and identifying spatial patterns of factors and processes that affect water quality in the LD catchment. Model results indicate that LD retains about 70% of the inflowing total nitrogen (TN) and 90% of the inflowing total phosphorus (TP) loads, of which fertilizer and manure applied to agricultural fields contribute the greatest proportion. The SPARROW model will be useful as a tool to guide the optimal implementation of nutrient management plans to reduce nutrient inputs to LD. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The widely-tested steady-state Hooghoudt (ssH) equation, implemented in the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM2, version 2.94.00), serves in simulating subsurface drainage. However, transient methods such as the integrated Hooghoudt (inH) and van Schilfgaarde (vanS) equations have seldom been implemented in models. In the present study, RZWQM2's hydrologic component was modified to initiate the soil water redistribution process when rainfall occurred. The three drainage equations (ssH, inH and vanS) were tested in each of two versions of RZWQM2 (original and modified). Field data from Iowa (2007-2008) and Ontario (2009-2010) were used to evaluate different model version x equation combinations' simulation accuracy at both daily and hourly scales, evaluated using the percent of bias (PBIAS), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE), and the Index of Agreement (IoA). On a daily scale and across equations, for the Iowa data the original model (PBIAS <= 14.96, NSE <= 0.40, >= 0.69) was outperformed by the modified model (PBIAS <= 6.48, NSE >= 0.70, IoA >= 0.76). Similarly, for the Ontario data, the original model (PBIAS <= 8.87,NSE >= 0.19, IoA >= 0.65) was outperformed by the modified model (PBIAS <= 3.59,NSE >= 0.31,IoA >= 0.67). However, based on a parity of PBIAS, NSE and IoA values, hourly scale tile drainage computed using the modified model equipped with transient equations did not improve model performance compared with the original ssH equation.

It varies spatio-temporally over large waterbodies and its well distributed measurement on field is tedious and time consuming. Generally, normalized difference turbidity index (NOT!), or band ratio, or regression analysis between turbidity concentration and band reflectance, approaches have been adapted to retrieve turbidity using multispectral remote sensing data. These techniques usually provide qualitative rather than quantitative estimates of turbidity. However, in the present study, spectral similarity analysis, between the spectral characteristics of spaceborne hyperspectral remote sensing data and spectral library generated on field, was carried out to quantify turbidity in the part of Chilika Lake, Odisha, India. Spatial spectral contextual image analysis, spectral angle mapper (SAM) technique was evaluated for the same. The SAM spectral matching technique has been widely used in geological application (mineral mapping), however, the application of this kind of techniques is limited in water quality studies due to non availability of reference spectral libraries. A spectral library was generated on field for the different concentrations of turbidity using well calibrated instruments like field spectro-radiometer, turbidity meter and hand held global positioning system. The field spectra were classified into 7 classes of turbidity concentration as <5, 5-10, 10-15, 15-25, 25-45, 45-100 and >100 NTU for analysis. Analysis reveal that at each location in the lake under consideration, the field spectra matched with the image spectra with SAM score of 0.8 and more. The observed turbidity at each location was also very much falling in the estimated turbidity class range. It was observed that the spectral similarity approach provides more quantitative estimate of turbidity as compared to NDTI. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Metal-fluxes characterization at a catchment scale: Study of mixing processes and end-member analysis in the Meca River watershed (SW Spain)	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Fluxes of acidity and contaminants from acid mine drainage (AMD) sources to the receiving surface water bodies were studied in a mining-impacted watershed (Meca River, SW Spain) using a novel methodology based on the joint application of EMMA and MIX codes. The application of EMMA and elemental ratios allowed delimiting the end-members responsible for water quality variations at a catchment scale. The further application of MIX quantified the significant impact of AMD on the river quality; less than 10% of AMD relative contribution is enough to maintain acidic conditions during most of the year. The mixing model also provided information about the element mobility, distinguishing those elements with a quasi conservative behavior (e.g., Cu, Zn, Al, Co or Ni) from those affected by mineral precipitation/dissolution (e.g., K, Si, Na, Sr, Ca, Fe, Pb, or As). Floods are the main driver of dissolved and, mainly particulate, contaminants in the catchment. Thus, the first rainfall events in November only accounted for 19% of the annual Meca flow but yielded between 26 and 43% of the net acidity and dissolved metal loads (mainly, Fe, As and Pb). Concerning particulate transport, around 332 tons of particulate Fe, 49 tons of Al, 0.79 tons of As and 0.37 tons of Pb were recorded during these first floods. The particulate As concentration can be up to 34 times higher than the dissolved one during floods and between 2 and 4 times higher for Fe, Pb and Cr.

V.; Nayak, Anurag			Evaluation of long-term trends in extreme precipitation: Implications of in-filled historical data use for analysis	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												This study focuses on the assessment of biases from infilling missing precipitation data on the detection of long-term change using parametric and non-parametric statistical techniques. Long-term historical precipitation data available for almost 100 years at 53 rain gages in south Florida, USA, with gages having varying lengths of missing data are used for the study. Precipitation data with gaps and time series with spatial interpolated data are analyzed. Chronologically complete datasets are often used in climate variability studies by analyzing data in multiple temporal windows. The temporal windows selected in this work coincide with Atlantic multi-decadal oscillation (AMO) cool and warm phases that strongly influence precipitation extremes and characteristics in the study region. Selection of these windows has helped in evaluating the extremes derived based on infilled and unfilled data. The frequency of occurrence of precipitation extremes over a pre-specified threshold is also analyzed. Results indicate that infilled precipitation data introduce large biases in the statistical trends and over and under-estimate low and high extremes respectively. Evaluation of three extreme precipitation indices (i.e. Rx1 day, R25mm and R50mm) indicates that bias increases with increase in amount of missing data. Nonparametric hypothesis tests indicate that statistical distributions of data of infilled and unfilled data are different when the data infilled is more than 5% of the entire data. Infilled data also introduced high variability in precipitation extremes in AMO cool and warm phases along with the changes in the frequency of occurrence of extreme events over a threshold.

Upon reaching freshwater, these nutrients can lead to extensive growth of harmful algae, which results in eutrophication. Many Chinese lakes are subject to such eutrophication, especially in highly polluted areas, and as such, understanding nutrient fluxes to these lakes offers insights into the varying processes governing pollutant fluxes as well as lake water quality. Here we analyse water quality data, recorded between 2006 and 2014 in 862 freshwater lakes in four geographical regions of China, to assess the input of phosphorus from human activity. We find that improvements in sanitation of both rural and urban domestic wastewater have resulted in large-scale declines in lake phosphorus concentrations in the most populated parts of China. In more sparsely populated regions, diffuse sources such as aquaculture and livestock farming offset this decline. Anthropogenic deforestation and soil erosion may also offset decreases in point sources of pollution. In the light of these regional differences, we suggest that a spatially flexible set of policies for water quality control would be beneficial for the future health of Chinese lakes.

J	Arslan, S				Arslan, Sebnem			Assessment of groundwater and soil quality for agricultural purposes in Kopruoren basin, Kutahya, Turkey	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES												This research evaluated the irrigation water and agricultural soil quality in the Kopruoren Basin by using hierarchical cluster analysis. Physico-chemical properties and major ion chemistry of 19 groundwater samples were used to determine the irrigation water quality indices. The results revealed out that the groundwaters are in general suitable for irrigation and have low sodium hazard, although they are very hard in nature due to the dominant presence of Ca+2, Mg+2 and HCO3- ions. Water samples contain arsenic in concentrations below the recommended guidelines for irrigation (59.7 14.7 mu g/l), however, arsenic concentrations in 89% of the 9 soil samples exceed the maximum allowable concentrations set for agricultural soils (81 +/- 243 mg/kg). Nickel element, albeit not present in high concentrations in water samples, is enriched in all of the agricultural soil samples (390 +/- 118.2 mg/kg). Hierarchical cluster analysis studies conducted to identify the sources of chemical constituents in water and soil samples elicited that the chemistry of the soils in the study area are highly impacted by the soil parent material and both geogenic and anthropogenic pollution sources are responsible for the metal contents of the soil samples. On the other hand, water chemistry in the area is affected by water-rock interactions, anthropogenic and agricultural pollution. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ahmed, AH; Rayaleh, WE; Zghibi, A; Ouddane, B				Ahmed, Abdoulkader Houssein; Rayaleh, Waiss Elmi; Zghibi, Adel; Ouddane, Baghdad			Assessment of chemical quality of groundwater in coastal volcano sedimentary aquifer of Djibouti, Horn of Africa	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES												This research is conducted to evaluate the current status of hydrogeochemical contaminants and their sources in groundwater in the volcano-sedimentary aquifer of Djibouti. Groundwater samples were mostly collected from the volcanic and inferoflux aquifers and then were analyzed for quality on physicochemical parameters (EC, pH, Temperature, Cl-, SO42-, HCO3-, NO3-, Na+ Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Br-, F-), minor and trace elements (Li, Ba, B, Sr, Si, Al, Cr, Fe, Mn, Mo, Pb, Co, Cu, Ni, Zn, Ti, V, As, Se). The interpretations of hydrochemical data are shown numerically and graphically through the Piper diagram such as the multivariate statistical analysis, binary diagram, the calculation of the saturation indexes, the index of base exchanges and ratio of Na+/Cl-, HCO3-/Cl-. The seawater ratio and ionic deviation in the groundwater were calculated using the chloride concentration. These processes can be used as indicators of seawater intrusion progress. This study reveals three groundwater quality groups and how the quality of water supply has been deteriorated through the process of seawater intrusion. The seawater intrusion extends into the Gulf basalts aquifer that covers nearly 12% of the whole area according to some observations. Some toxic elements present in drinking water (As and Se) have already exceeded the maximum permissible in almost the entire of the Gulf basalts aquifer affected by seawater intrusion. Indeed, some correlations were found between As, Se, with electrical conductivity and among other minor and trace elements such as Br, B, Sr, Co and Cr. It indicates that all these elements are mainly controlled by naturel/geogenic processes. The Principal component Analysis and the Hierarchical Cluster Analysis have led to the confirmation of the hypotheses developed in the previous hydrochemical study in which two factors explain the major hydrochemical processes in the aquifer. These factors reveal first the existence of an intensive intrusion of seawater and second the mechanisms of contamination through the recharge processes of groundwater. Consequently, the assessment of water quality and the determination of the risk of water contamination by pollution seems to be very useful for an effective management of groundwater resources, and also for preventing salinization and minimizing the phenomena of seawater intrusion.

One component of monitoring is measuring the phytoplankton community composition and detecting whether that has changed. From April to October 2012, by using ships-of-opportunity (SOOP), we collected simultaneous samples from 15 stations in the Gulf of Finland and the Baltic Proper to study the spatial variability in the phytoplankton species composition and biomass throughout the growing season. The analysis was performed with 10 dominant taxa constituting 83-97% of the total phytoplankton biomass. We set the criterion of the statistically significant (p < 0.05) Bray-Curtis similarity for the station pairs to be mutually representative according to the species composition and biomass. Our results indicated that in areas of similar hydrological conditions, it is sufficient to have sampling stations in 50-65 km distance between one another, but in the areas with varying hydrographical conditions, i.e. coastal areas, higher spatial coverage may be needed. Whenever possible, it is recommended to combine monitoring efforts between the Baltic Sea countries in the offshore areas, including SOOP. The need for further harmonization of phytoplankton analysis between countries is addressed in order to have comparable data sets by different countries. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Rainfall and streamflow sensor network design: a review of applications, classification, and a proposed framework	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Sensors and sensor networks play an important role in decision-making related to water quality, operational streamflow forecasting, flood early warning systems, and other areas. In this paper we review a number of existing applications and analyse a variety of evaluation and design procedures for sensor networks with respect to various criteria. Most of the existing approaches focus on maximising the observability and information content of a variable of interest. From the context of hydrological modelling only a few studies use the performance of the hydrological simulation in terms of output discharge as a design criterion. In addition to the review, we propose a framework for classifying the existing design methods, and a generalised procedure for an optimal network design in the context of rainfall-runoff hydrological modelling.

From soil water to surface water - how the riparian zone controls element transport from a boreal forest to a stream	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Boreal headwaters are often lined by strips of highly organic soils, which are the last terrestrial environment to leave an imprint on discharging groundwater before it enters a stream. Because these riparian soils are so different from the Podzol soils that dominate much of the boreal landscape, they are known to have a major impact on the biogeochemistry of important elements such as C, N, P and Fe and the transfer of these elements from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems. For most elements, however, the role of the riparian zone has remained unclear, although it should be expected that the mobility of many elements is affected by changes in, for example, pH, redox potential and concentration of organic carbon as they are transported through the riparian zone. Therefore, soil water and groundwater was sampled at different depths along a 22m hillslope transect in the Krycklan catchment in northern Sweden using soil lysimeters and analysed for a large number of major and trace elements (Al, As, B, Ba, Ca, Cd, Cl, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Fe, K, La, Li, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Pb, Rb, Se, Si, Sr, Th, Ti, U, V, Zn, Zr) and other parameters such as sulfate and total organic carbon (TOC). The results showed that the concentrations of most investigated elements increased substantially (up to 60 times) as the water flowed from the uphill mineral soils and into the riparian zone, largely as a result of higher TOC concentrations. The stream water concentrations of these elements were typically somewhat lower than in the riparian zone, but still considerably higher than in the uphill mineral soils, which suggests that riparian soils have a decisive impact on the water quality of boreal streams. The degree of enrichment in the riparian zone for different elements could be linked to the affinity for organic matter, indicating that the pattern with strongly elevated concentrations in riparian soils is typical for organophilic substances. One likely explanation is that the solubility of many organophilic elements increases as a result of the higher concentrations of TOC in the riparian zone. Elements with low or modest affinity for organic matter (e.g. Na, Cl, K, Mg and Ca) occurred in similar or lower concentrations in the riparian zone. Despite the elevated concentrations of many elements in riparian soil water and groundwater, no increase in the concentrations in biota could be observed (bilberry leaves and spruce shoots).

Sediment Budgets in Cold Environments (SEDIBUD)	SEP 01-04, 2014	Environm Res Station Schneefernerhaus, GERMANY	I A G	Environm Res Station Schneefernerhaus			Suspended sediment transport can affect water quality and aquatic ecosystems, and its quantification is of the highest importance for river and watershed management. Suspended sediment concentration (SSC) and discharge were measured at two locations in the Estero Morales, a Chilean Andean stream draining a small basin (27 km(2)) hosting glacierized areas of about 1.8 km(2). Approximately half of the suspended sediment yield (470 t year(-1) km(-2)) was transported during the snowmelt period and half during glacier melting. The hysteresis patterns between discharge and SSC were calculated for each daily hydrograph and were analysed to shed light on the location and activity of different sediment sources at the basin scale. During snowmelt, an unlimited supply of fine sediments is provided in the lower and middle part of the basin and hysteresis patterns tend to be clockwise as the peaks in SSC precede the peak of discharge in daily hydrographs. Instead, during glacier melting the source of fine sediments is the proglacial area, producing counterclockwise hysteresis. It is suggested that the analysis of hysteretic patterns over time provides a simple concept for interpreting variability of location and activity of sediment sources at the basin scale.

We hypothesized that urban infrastructure significantly alters downstream water quality and contributes to variability in GHG saturation and emissions. We measured gas saturation and estimated emission rates in headwaters of two urban stream networks (Red Run and Dead Run) of the Baltimore Ecosystem Study Long-Term Ecological Research project. We identified four combinations of stormwater and sanitary infrastructure present in these watersheds, including: (1) stream burial, (2) inline stormwater wetlands, (3) riparian/floodplain preservation, and (4) septic systems. We selected two first-order catchments in each of these categories and measured GHG concentrations, emissions, and dissolved inorganic and organic carbon (DIC and DOC) and nutrient concentrations biweekly for 1 year. From a water quality perspective, the DOC: NO3- ratio of streamwater was significantly different across infrastructure categories. Multiple linear regressions including DOC: NO (-)(3) and other variables (dissolved oxygen, DO; total dissolved nitrogen, TDN; and temperature) explained much of the statistical variation in nitrous oxide (N2O, r(2) = 0.78), carbon dioxide (CO2, r(2) = 0.78), and methane (CH4, r(2) = 0.50) saturation in stream water. We measured N2O saturation ratios, which were among the highest reported in the literature for streams, ranging from 1.1 to 47 across all sites and dates. N2O saturation ratios were highest in streams draining watersheds with septic systems and strongly correlated with TDN. The CO2 saturation ratio was highly correlated with the N2O saturation ratio across all sites and dates, and the CO2 saturation ratio ranged from 1.1 to 73. CH4 was always supersaturated, with saturation ratios ranging from 3.0 to 2157. Longitudinal surveys extending form headwaters to third-order outlets of Red Run and Dead Run took place in spring and fall. Linear regressions of these data yielded significant negative relationships between each gas with increasing watershed size as well as consistent relationships between solutes (TDN or DOC, and DOC: TDN ratio) and gas saturation. Despite a decline in gas saturation between the headwaters and stream outlet, streams remained saturated with GHGs throughout the drainage network, suggesting that urban streams are continuous sources of CO2, CH4, and N2O. Our results suggest that infrastructure decisions can have significant effects on downstream water quality and greenhouse gases, and watershed management strategies may need to consider coupled impacts on urban water and air quality.																	1726-4170	1726-4189				JUN 13	2017	14	11					2831	2849		10.5194/bg-14-2831-2017								WOS:000403227200001

Because of this issue, many of these tailings ponds have been treated by restoration and sealing processes in recent years. In this work, the efficacy of geophysical techniques (electrical resistivity imaging and ground penetrating radar) as tools for assessing the effectiveness of the insulating process of these structures has been analysed. For this purpose, we selected the abandoned mining district of Linares-La Carolina (Southern Spain) where, during the mining activity, these materials were stockpiled without corrective measures. This study demonstrates the usefulness of electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) for characterising the inner structure of abandoned tailings ponds, determining the geometry of such deposits and evaluating the potential risks that they pose. Furthermore, ERI makes it possible to visualise higher moisture zones associated with the leaking of leachates that circulate through these residues. The presence of humid areas could denote defects at the sealing stage. The ground penetrating radar (GPR) technique was very useful for an accurate analysis of the most superficial part, where the seal is constructed. In particular, the technique made it possible to differentiate between various encapsulation levels created during sealing, as well as detect imperfections in the insulation layers and zones with higher moisture at a low depth. A chemical quality analysis of the surface waters surrounding the dumps studied indicates that, with the exception of As, the concentrations of most metal(loid)s analysed (Al, Ba, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Rb, Se, Sr and Zn) have significantly decreased after the restoration works. However, it appears that leaks continue to appear in some sludge pond sectors that favour the mobilisation and even incorporation of certain toxic elements from the mining waste into the riverbed. Therefore, Pb (20 mu g/L) and Se (1.5 mu g/L) dissolved in the surface waters continue to exceed the maximum concentrations allowed by the European Union environmental quality standards.

The threat to the water quality is becoming more and more serious. However, how to detect the pesticides quickly in the water becomes an important problem. Ground on acetylcholinesterase' (AChE) inhibition, the paper states the construction of an amperometric biosensor for carbamate insecticide carbofuran's highly sensitive detection. Using an enzyme biosensor ground on poly diallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDDA) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE), then immobilizing the Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) for modifying GCE with layer-by-layer (LBL) technique directly. Detect the inhibition of Aches with the amperometric i-t response. The pesticide concentration is correlated to the percentage inhibition of enzyme activity. Comparing with the enzyme biosensor {PDDA/MWNTs}(5)/ED/AChE/GCE we built previously with detection limit to be 10(-11) g/L and recovery to be 99.8 +/- 5.7% to 10(-8) g/L, nowadays, the new enzyme electrode shows a good linearity ranging from 10(-12) g/L to 10(-6) g/L between the lg[carbofuran] and inhibition rates, and the detection limit is 10(-12) g/L. The improvement of the electrode structure contributes significantly to the sensibility of detection for pesticide in seawater.

Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) can be used to establish a framework and propose a series of techniques and tools to assess water quality at the watershed scale. While TMDLs have been developed for water quality management by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, scientists and stakeholders, the development of TMDLs in China is hindered due to the lack of comprehensive data collection system and by the difficulties in incorporating seasonal variations efficiently and accurately. In this study, load duration curves (LDCs) were used to calculate TMDLs for ammonia and to quantify the corresponding monthly and seasonal variations in the TMDL. The analysis indicated that the ammonia TMDL was affected by flow patterns, ranging from a maximum of 9418 kg.d(-1) in high flow zones to a minimum of 48 kg.d(-1) in low flow zones. Seasonally, the TMDL varied from 232 kg.d(-1) in spring to 390 kg.d(-1) in summer, 110 kg.d(-1) in autumn, and 25 kg.d(-1) in winter. The monthly load allocation for ammonia was in the range of 3.0 to 18 kg.d(-1). The results provide policymakers with quantitative limits of nutrients loadings with seasonal variations which can be used to implement various water quality targets. This approach also provides a convenient way for water quality assessment when current pollution data is available and proposes seasonal targets of total amount control for local EPA implementing refined water quality management strategy under current economic development level and management ability as well as.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				SUM	2017					80		80	85		10.2112/SI80-011.1								WOS:000405827600011

The physicochemical analysis of the groundwater wells shows the major ions in the order of Na+> Mg2+> Ca2+> B3+ > K+ and Cl- > HCO3- > SO42- > NO32- > F- > PO43-. Groundwater quality is classified as very hard-brackish water type. Ninety-five percent of the wells are classified as saline water type with high NO32- concentrations. Based on water quality index (WQI), the groundwater falls into one of three categories: fair water (10%), poor water (15%), very poor (45%), and worst (30%). The high WQI values are because of high Na+, Cl-, SO42-, and NO32- concentrations, while synthetic pollution index (SPI) values indicate that most about 80% of the wells are seriously polluted. Langelier Saturation Index (LSI) indicates that most of data are either slightly scale forming or corrosive water or slightly corrosive but non-scale forming, and 75% of the wells are suitable for construction purposes (have SO42- concentrations < 300 mg/L). The groundwater reaches alarming situation, where almost chemically unsuitable for drinking purposes and the water to be used after proper treatment such as desalination.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				JUN	2017	10	12							257	10.1007/s12517-017-3036-7								WOS:000404550300002

One hundred twenty-two samples were collected from the Aosta Valley region in the years 2007 and 2008 (61 per year), and analysed for pH, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids (TDS), total hardness, major cations and anions. The pH of the samples in both years indicated a near-neutral to alkaline nature of the groundwater. The cation and anion chemistry showed the general ionic abundance as: Ca2+ > Mg2+ > Na+ > K+ and HCO3- > SO42- > Cl- > NO3- > F in both years. Ca2+-Mg2+-HCO3- and Ca2+-Mg2+-Cl--SO42- were the dominant hydrogeochemical facies. The computed saturation indices demonstrated that the groundwater was supersaturated with respect to dolomite and calcite in both years. The groundwater chemistry of the study area was mainly controlled by the dissolution of carbonate, sulphate and silicate minerals, as well as ion exchange processes. A comparison of the groundwater quality in relation to drinking water standards showed that most of the water samples were suitable for drinking and domestic uses. The computed water quality index (WQI) values of the study area groundwater ranged from 24 to 84 in the year 2007 and from 22 to 82 in the year 2008, and all the location fell under the Excellent to Good category. Quality assessment for irrigation uses revealed that the groundwater was good to permissible quality for irrigation; however, locally higher salinity, residual sodium carbonate (RSC) and magnesium hazard (MH) restricted its suitability for irrigation at a few sites.

Since the late 1980s, water scarcity research has attracted much political and public attention. We here review a variety of indicators that have been developed to capture different characteristics of water scarcity. Population, water availability, and water use are the key elements of these indicators. Most of the progress made in the last few decades has been on the quantification of water availability and use by applying spatially explicit models. However, challenges remain on appropriate incorporation of green water (soil moisture), water quality, environmental flow requirements, globalization, and virtual water trade in water scarcity assessment. Meanwhile, inter-and intra-annual variability of water availability and use also calls for assessing the temporal dimension of water scarcity. It requires concerted efforts of hydrologists, economists, social scientists, and environmental scientists to develop integrated approaches to capture the multi-faceted nature of water scarcity.

J	Richardson, M; Kumar, P				Richardson, Meredith; Kumar, Praveen			Critical Zone services as environmental assessment criteria in intensively managed landscapes	EARTHS FUTURE												The Critical Zone (CZ) includes the biophysical processes occurring from the top of the vegetation canopy to the weathering zone below the groundwater table. CZ services provide a measure for the goods and benefits derived from CZ processes. In intensively managed landscapes, cropland is altered through anthropogenic energy inputs to derive more productivity, as agricultural products, than would be possible under natural conditions. However, the actual costs of alterations to CZ functions within landscape profiles are unknown. Through comparisons of corn feed and corn-based ethanol, we show that valuation of these CZ services in monetary terms provides a more concrete tool for characterizing seemingly abstract environmental damages from agricultural production systems. Multiple models are combined to simulate the movement of nutrients throughout the soil system, enabling the measurement of agricultural anthropogenic impacts to the CZ's regulating services. Results indicate water quality and atmospheric stabilizing services, measured by soil carbon storage, carbon respiration, and nitrate leaching, among others, can cost more than double that of emissions estimated in previous studies. Energy efficiency in addition to environmental impact is assessed to demonstrate how the inclusion of CZ services is necessary in accounting for the entire life cycle of agricultural production systems. These results conclude that feed production systems are more energy efficient and less environmentally costly than corn-based ethanol.

Global aquifers dominated by fossil groundwaters but wells vulnerable to modern contamination	NATURE GEOSCIENCE												The vulnerability of groundwater to contamination is closely related to its age. Groundwaters that infiltrated prior to the Holocene have been documented in many aquifers and are widely assumed to be unaffected by modern contamination. However, the global prevalence of these 'fossil' groundwaters and their vulnerability to modern-era pollutants remain unclear. Here we analyse groundwater carbon isotope data (C-12, C-13, C-14) from 6,455 wells around the globe. We show that fossil groundwaters comprise a large share (42-85%) of total aquifer storage in the upper 1 km of the crust, and the majority of waters pumped from wells deeper than 250 m. However, half of the wells in our study that are dominated by fossil groundwater also contain detectable levels of tritium, indicating the presence of much younger, decadal-age waters and suggesting that contemporary contaminants may be able to reach deep wells that tap fossil aquifers. We conclude that water quality risk should be considered along with sustainable use when managing fossil groundwater resources.

The threat to groundwater quality by nitrate pollution has always been of considerable concern in loess regions. In this paper, correspondence analysis, stoichiometric analysis, ratios of major ions and some qualitative analysis are employed to discuss the spatial variability of nitrate (NO3-), identification of NO3- pollution sources and its potential pollution paths based on 112 water samples in Tongchuan region on the middle edge of Loess Plateau of China. Results indicate that the NO3- concentrations ranged from 0.25 to 173 mg/L, 20.54% of water samples exceeded the Standards for Drinking Water Quality from China (<= 44 mg/L), and 15.18% of samples exceeded the Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality from World Health Organization (<= 50 mg/L); the water samples with high NO3- concentrations primarily concentrated in river valleys, and the types were mainly pore waters and individual surface waters. Sewage or manure from livestock effluent was the primary sources of NO3- in some surface waters, pore water samples with high NO3- were closely related to agricultural input or a mixing process. Groundwater recharges from surface water and vertical infiltration in river valleys with shallow groundwater depth were considered as the potential pollution paths for NO3- ions in the study area based on nitrate nitrogen distribution in soil profile. Driven by concentration difference and local seepage system, these NO3- ions diffused around and groundwater buried in great depth was consequently polluted. Therefore, river valleys should be listed as the prior protection areas in loess regions; in addition, the time lag between land use changes and groundwater quality response should also be paid attention to in nitrate pollution prevention, particularly in the thick unsaturated zones.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JUN	2017	76	12							423	10.1007/s12665-017-6756-9								WOS:000404390900016

Assessing the suitability of groundwater for irrigation is carried out for the first time in the High Mekerra watershed. Groundwater samples were collected during the wet season (March 2013) and the dry season (July 2013) and analyzed for determining the physicochemical properties. The indices used in the quality assessment were the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), sodium percentage (%Na+), permeability index (PI), magnesium hazard (MH), Kelly's ratio (KR), and irrigation water quality index (IWQI), incorporating the spatial variation using the GIS-based multi-criteria system. Result showed that most of groundwater samples have low sodium hazard and high to very high salinity hazard and could be used for irrigation on almost all types of soil with little risk of exchangeable sodium. The GIS-based multi-criteria system highlighted the spatial variation of groundwater quality for irrigation in the study area. This spatial distribution indicated that groundwater is generally of moderate quality and that the Ras el Ma aquifer quality is better than for Mouley Slissen aquifer.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				JUN	2017	10	11							233	10.1007/s12517-017-3019-8								WOS:000403720000002

Classification of aquifer vulnerability using K-means cluster analysis	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Groundwater is one of the main sources of drinking and agricultural water in arid and semi-arid regions but is becoming increasingly threatened by contamination. Vulnerability mapping has been used for many years as an effective tool for assessing the potential for aquifer pollution and the most common method of intrinsic vulnerability assessment is DRASTIC (Depth to water table, net Recharge, Aquifer media, Soil media, Topography, Impact of vadose zone and hydraulic Conductivity). An underlying problem with the DRASTIC approach relates to the subjectivity involved in selecting relative weightings for each of the DRASTIC factors and assigning rating values to ranges or media types within each factor. In this study, a clustering technique is introduced that removes some of the subjectivity associated with the indexing method. It creates a vulnerability map that does not rely on fixed weights and ratings and, thereby provides a more objective representation of the system's physical characteristics. This methodology was applied to an aquifer in Iran and compared with the standard DRASTIC approach using the water quality parameters nitrate, chloride and total dissolved solids (TDS) as surrogate indicators of aquifer vulnerability. The proposed method required only four of DRASTIC's seven factors - depth to groundwater, hydraulic conductivity, recharge value and the nature of the vadose zone, to produce a superior result. For nitrate, chloride, and TDS, respectively, the clustering approach delivered Pearson correlation coefficients that were 15, 22 and 5 percentage points higher than those obtained for the DRASTIC method.

Sediment carbon fate in phreatic karst (Part 1): Conceptual model development	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Recent research has paid increased attention to quantifying the fate of carbon pools within fluvial networks, but few, if any, studies consider the fate of sediment organic carbon in fluviokarst systems despite that karst landscapes cover 12% of the earth's land surface. The authors develop a conceptual model of sediment carbon fate in karst terrain with specific emphasis upon phreatic karst conduits, i.e., those located below the groundwater table that have the potential to trap surface-derived sediment and turnover carbon. To assist with their conceptual model development, the authors study a phreatic system and apply a mixture of methods traditional and novel to karst studies, including electrical resistivity imaging, well drilling, instantaneous velocimetry, dye tracing, stage recording, discrete and continuous sediment and water quality sampling, and elemental and stable carbon isotope fingerprinting. Results show that the sediment transport carrying capacity of the phreatic karst water is orders of magnitude less than surface streams during storm-activated periods promoting deposition of fine sediments in the phreatic karst. However, the sediment transport carrying capacity is sustained long after the hydrologic event has ended leading to sediment resuspension and prolonged transport. The surficial fine grained laminae occurs in the subsurface karst system; but unlike surface streams, the light-limited conditions of the subsurface karst promotes constant heterotrophy leading to carbon turnover. The coupling of the hydrological processes leads to a conceptual model that frames phreatic karst as a biologically active conveyor of sediment carbon that recharges degraded organic carbon back to surface streams. For example, fluvial sediment is estimated to lose 30% of its organic carbon by mass during a one year temporary residence within the phreatic karst. It is recommended that scientists consider karst pathways when attempting to estimate organic matter stocks and carbon transformation in fluvial networks. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Sediment carbon fate in phreatic karst (Part 2): Numerical model development and application	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The authors develop a numerical model to elucidate time-distributed processes controlling sediment carbon fate in phreatic karst. Sediment carbon processes simulated in the new numerical model include in conduit erosion and deposition, sediment carbon transport, surficial fine grained laminae evolution, carbon pool mixing, microbial oxidation, and the understudied process of sediment carbon exchange during equilibrium transport. The authors perform a model evaluation procedure that includes generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation to quantify uncertainty of the model results. Modeling results suggest that phreatic karst conduits sustain sediment transport activity long after surface storm events cease. The sustained sediment transport has the potential to shift the baseflow sediment yield of the phreatic karst to be on par with stormflow sediment yield. The sustained activity is suggested to promote the exchange of sediment carbon between the water column and subsurface karst deposits during equilibrium sediment transport conditions. In turn, the sediment carbon exchange impacts the mixing of new and old carbon pools and the flux of carbon from phreatic karst. Integrated numerical model results from this study support the concept that phreatic karst act as a biologically active conveyor of sediment carbon that temporarily stores sediment, turns over carbon at higher rates than surface streams, and recharges degraded carbon back to the fluvial system. The numerical modeling method adopted in this paper shows the efficacy of coupling carbon isotope fingerprinting with water quality modeling to study sediment carbon in phreatic karst.

Scaling effects of riparian peatlands on stable isotopes in runoff and DOC mobilisation	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												We combined 13 months of daily isotope measurements in stream water with daily DOC and 15 min FDOM (fluorescent component of dissolved organic matter) data at three nested scales to identify how riparian peatlands generate runoff and influence DOC dynamics in streams. We investigated how runoff generation processes in a small, riparian peatland-dominated headwater catchment (0.65 km(2)) propagate to larger scales (3.2 km(2) and 31 km(2)) with decreasing percentage of riparian peatland coverage. Isotope damping was most pronounced in the 0.65 km(2) headwater catchment due to high water storage in the organic soils encouraging tracer mixing. At the largest scale, stream flow and water isotope dynamics showed a more flashy response. The isotopic difference between the sites was most pronounced in the summer months when stream water signatures were enriched. During the winter months, the inter site difference reduced. The isotopes also revealed evaporative fractionation in the peatland dominated catchment, in particular during summer low flows, which implied high hydrological connectivity in the form of constant seepage from the peatlands sustaining high baseflows at the headwater scale. This connectivity resulted in high DOC concentrations at the peatland site during baseflow (similar to 5 mg l(-1)). In contrast, at the larger scales, DOC was minimal during low flows (similar to 2 mgl(-1)) due to increased ground-water influence and the disconnection between DOC sources and the stream. High frequency data also revealed diel variability during low flows. Insights into event dynamics through the analysis of hysteresis loops showed slight dilution on the rising limb, the strong influence of dry antecedent conditions and a quick recovery between events at the riparian peatland site. Again, these dynamics are driven by the tight coupling and high connectivity of the landscape to the stream. At larger scales, the disconnection between the landscape units increases and the variable connectivity controls runoff generation and DOC dynamics. The results presented here suggest that the processes occurring in riparian peatlands in headwater catchments are less evident at larger scales which may have implications for the larger scale impact of peatland restoration projects.

This model unifies VEMALA-ICECREAM, VEMALA-N and VEMALA 1.1 as it uses their independent terrestrial loading and implements a simplification of the biogeochemical model RIVE and phytoplankton model AQUAPHY in the river network. VEMALA v.3 simulates the transport and transformations of nitrate, ammonium, organic nitrogen, phosphate, particulate inorganic phosphorus, organic phosphorus, phytoplankton, suspended sediments and total organic carbon during their travel to the sea. The model's results were satisfactory in the Aurajoki river basin (South-Western Finland) in simulating nutrients daily loads, with all Nash and Sutcliffe coefficients (NSE) ranging from 0.51 to 0.89 against observations, and monthly loads (NSE = 0.4-0.97 against estimations). Simulations of total nitrogen and total phosphorus loads were comparable to estimated annual loads with the exception of a few exceptional years. The quantification of the nutrient cycling river processes were consistent with the Aurajoki river ecosystem with maximum summer rates for mineralisation 0.1 mgC L-1 d(-1) and denitrification 55 mgN m(-2) d(-1) resulting in a loss of 4% of the annual nitrogen load entering the river. VEMALA v3 unites the previous versions of VEMALA to better predict the co-impact of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphate on algal growth and therefore eutrophication. Simulation of bioavailable nutrients rather than total nutrients will allow the distinction in the quality of the various loading sources, farming actions and loading reduction actions. In the Aurajoki simulation, nitrate and ammonium represented on average 74% and 3% respectively of the total nitrogen load to the Baltic Sea, while phosphate constituted 38% of the total phosphorus load to the sea. Thus, the biological impact in the river and the sea will be better assessed to help water managers implement the Water Framework Directive in Finland. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Jones, CS; Wang, B; Schilling, KE; Chan, KS				Jones, Christopher S.; Wang, Bo; Schilling, Keith E.; Chan, Kung-sik			Nitrate transport and supply limitations quantified using high-frequency stream monitoring and turning point analysis	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Agricultural landscapes often leak inorganic nitrogen to the stream network, usually in the form of nitrate-nitrite (NOx-N), degrading downstream water quality on both the local and regional scales. While the spatial distribution of nitrate sources has been delineated in many watersheds, less is known about the complicated temporal dynamics that drive stream NOx-N because traditional methods of stream grab sampling are often conducted at a low frequency. Deployment of accurate real-time, continuous measurement devices that have been developed in recent years enables high-frequency sampling that provides detailed information on the concentration-discharge relation and the timing of NOx-N delivery to streams. We aggregated 15-min interval NOx-N and discharge data over a nine-year period into daily averages and then used robust statistical methods to identify how the discharge regime within an artificially-drained agricultural watershed reflected catchment hydrology and NOx-N delivery pathways. We then quantified how transport and supply limitations varied from year-to-year and how dependence of these limitations varied with climate, especially drought. Our results show NOx-N concentrations increased linearly with discharge up to an average "turning point" of 1.42 mm of area-normalized discharge, after which concentrations decline with increasing discharge. We estimate transport and supply limitations to govern 57 and 43 percent, respectively, of the NOx-N flux over the nine-year period. Drought effects on the NOx-N flux linger for multiple years and this is reflected in a greater tendency toward supply limitations in the.three years following drought. How the turning point varies with climate may aid in prediction of NOx-N loading in future climate regimes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Following the historical inundation by paleo-seawater during coastal progradation, the aquifer has been undergone progressive freshening and land reclamation to enable settlements and farming. The hydrochemical data of water samples showed a broad hydrochemical change, from Na-Cl through Na-HCO3 to Ca-HCO3 types, suggesting that groundwater was overall evolved through the freshening process accompanying cation exchange. The principal component analysis (PCA) of the hydrochemical data indicates the occurrence of three major hydrogeochemical processes occurring in an aquifer, namely: 1) progressive freshening of remaining paleo-seawater, 2) water-rock interaction (i.e., dissolution of silicates), and 3) redox process including sulfate reduction, as indicated by heavy sulfur and oxygen isotope compositions of sulfate. To quantitatively assess the hydrogeochemical processes, the end-member mixing analysis (EMMA) and the forward mixing modeling using PHREEQC code were conducted. The EMMA results show that the hydrochemical model with the two-dimensional mixing space composed of PC 1 and PC 2 best explains the mixing in the study area; therefore, we consider that the groundwater chemistry mainly evolved by mixing among three end-members (i.e., paleo-seawater, infiltrating rain, and the K-rich groundwater). The distinct depletion of sulfate in groundwater, likely due to bacterial sulfate reduction, can also be explained by EMMA. The evaluation of mass balances using geochemical modeling supports the explanation that the freshening process accompanying direct cation exchange occurs through mixing among three end-members involving the K-rich groundwater. This study shows that the multiple end-members mixing model is useful to more successfully assess complex hydrogeochemical processes occurring in a salinized aquifer under freshening, as compared to the conventional interpretation using the theoretical mixing line based on only two end-members (i.e., seawater and rainwater).

Mining and milling operations, such as pit dewatering or treated effluent release, can potentially influence the hydrology and the water quality downstream of the operations. This study presents the methodology used to predict water volumes and water quality discharging downstream in surface water bodies. A compartment model representing the three subsequent lakes included in the management system was set up using the software GoldSim. The water balance allows predicting lake volumes at the daily time step. A mass balance model developed for conservative elements was also developed and allows validating the proportions of inputs and outputs issued from the water balance model. This model was then used as predictive tool to evaluate the impact of different scenarios of effluents management on volumes and chemistry of surface water for short and longer time periods. An additional significant benefit of this model is that it can be used as an input for geochemical modelling to predict the concentrations of all constituents of concern in the receiving surface water.

Such adverse effects are of particular concern in permanently stratified meromictic lakes. Yet little is known about when and how meromixis and hypoxia became established (or vanished) prior to anthropogenic impacts, or how human activities such as deforestation, erosion and nutrient cycling affected the mixing regimes of lakes. We used calibrated hyperspectral imaging (HSI) data in the visible and near infrared range from a fresh, varved sediment core taken in Lake Jaczno, NE Poland, to map sedimentary pigments at very high resolution (sub-varve scale) over the past 1700 years. HSI-inferred bacteriopheophytin a (bphe a, produced by anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria) serves as a proxy for meromixis, whereas HSI-inferred green pigments (chlorophyll a and diagenetic products) can be used as estimators of aquatic productivity. Meromixis was established and vanished long before significant human disturbance in the catchment was observed in the late eleventh century AD. Under pre-anthropogenic conditions, however, meromixis was interrupted frequently, and the lake mixing regime flickered between dimixis and meromixis. During two periods with intense deforestation and soil erosion in the catchment, characterised by sedimentary facies rich in clay and charcoal (AD 1070-1255 and AD 1670-1710), the lake was mostly dimictic and better oxygenated than in periods with relative stability and a presumably closed forest around the lake, i.e. without human disturbances. After ca. AD 1960, meromixis became established quasi-permanently as a result of eutrophication. The persistent meromixis of the last similar to 60 years is unusual with respect to the record of the last 1700 years.

Ecosystem services in the Taihu Lake Basin have been overexploited and jeopardized. Based on land-use and land-cover change (LUCC) data from 1979, 1984, 2000, and 2010, in conjunction with the adjusted ecosystem service values (ESV), changes in ESV were analyzed in detail. Results revealed that LUCC resulted in a substantial decrease in total ESV from $3.92 billion in 1979 to $2.98 billion in 2010. The ESV of cropland decreased from $1.64 billion in 1979 to $1.34 billion in 2010, which represented a 20.28% reduction. The ESV of water areas decreased from $1.08 billion in 1979 to $0.36 billion in 2010, which represented a 65.62% reduction mainly because of a decline in water quality. In terms of annual change rate, cropland and water areas showed a sustained downward trend. Spatially, ESV declines were mainly observed in Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, and Shanghai, probably due to a combination of economic progress, population growth, and rapid urbanization. The research results can be a useful reference for policymakers in mitigating ESV decline.																	2095-0195	2095-0209				JUN	2017	11	2					310	320		10.1007/s11707-016-0612-1								WOS:000402454100009

The analysis is based on data from multiple mathematical methods, along with information obtained from Remote Sensing, Geographic Information System and Global Position System technology. The results show that the annual runoff and sediment load discharged into Dingzi Bay display significant decreasing trends overall, and marked downward steps were observed in 1966 and 1980. Around 60%-80% of the decline is attributed to decreasing precipitation in the Wulong River Basin. The landform types in Dingzi Bay have changed significantly since the 1950s, especially over the period between 1981 and 1995. Large areas of tidal flats, swamp, salt fields, and paddy fields have been reclaimed, and aquaculture ponds have been constructed. Consequently, the patterns of erosion and deposition in the bay have changed substantially. Despite a reduction in sediment input of 65.68% after 1966, low rates of sediment deposition continued in the bay. However, deposition rates changed significantly after 1981 owing to large-scale development in the bay, with a net depositional area approximately 10 times larger than that during 1961-1981. This geomorphic evolution stabilized following the termination of large-scale human activity in the bay after 1995. Overall, Dingzi Bay has shown a tendency towards silting-up during 1952-2010, with the bay head migrating seaward, the number of channels in the tidal creek system decreasing, and the tidal inlet becoming narrower and shorter. In conclusion, large-scale development and human activity in Dingzi Bay have controlled the geomorphic evolution of the bay since the 1950s.																	2095-0195	2095-0209				JUN	2017	11	2					385	396		10.1007/s11707-016-0586-z								WOS:000402454100015

The concept has found some success with point source water pollution, but very few trades have occurred in over 50 programs in the United States (U.S.) that have focused on nonpoint sources (NPSs). To understand why success has been slow, we identified three environments needed for programs to succeed: physical, economic, and institutional. We estimate that only 5% of watersheds in the U.S. currently listed as nutrient impaired provide a viable physical environment for trading nitrogen; 13% are suitable for phosphorus. Economic and institutional challenges would shrink that domain even further. Therefore, we find places with the ideal physical, economic, and institutional environments necessary for feasible WQT programs are virtual policy utopias - rare places with ideal environments. Fortunately, a growing literature provides the tools necessary to identify where these policy utopias are and to expand that domain through a better understanding about how to manage WQT programs more effectively.																	1093-474X	1752-1688				JUN	2017	53	3					514	520		10.1111/1752-1688.12532								WOS:000402846200002

USE OF SWAT TO ESTIMATE SPATIAL SCALING OF PHOSPHORUS EXPORT COEFFICIENTS AND LOAD REDUCTIONS DUE TO AGRICULTURAL BMPS	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Phosphorus export coefficients (kg/ha/yr) from selected land covers, also called phosphorus yields, tend to get smaller as contributing areas get larger because some of the phosphorus mobilized on local fields gets trapped during transport to regional watershed outlets. Phosphorus traps include floodplains, wetlands, and lakes, which can then become impaired by eutrophication. The Sunrise River watershed in east central Minnesota, United States, has numerous lakes impaired by excess phosphorus. The Sunrise is tributary to the St. Croix River, whose much larger watershed is terminated by Lake St. Croix, also impaired by excess phosphorus. To support management of these impairments at both local and regional scales, a Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model of the Sunrise watershed was constructed to estimate load reductions due to selected best management practices (BMPs) and to determine how phosphorus export coefficients scaled with contributing area. In this study, agricultural BMPs, including vegetated filter strips, grassed waterways, and reduction of soil-phosphorus concentrations reduced phosphorus loads by 4-20%, with similar percentage reductions at field and watershed spatial scales. Phosphorus export coefficients from cropland in rotation with corn, soybeans, and alfalfa decreased as a negative power function of contributing area, from an average of 2.12 kg/ha/yr at the upland field scale (similar to 0.6 km(2)) to 0.63 kg/ha/yr at the major river basin scale (20,000 km(2)).																	1093-474X	1752-1688				JUN	2017	53	3					547	561		10.1111/1752-1688.12523								WOS:000402846200005

URBAN STREAMFLOW RESPONSE TO IMPORTED WATER AND WATER CONSERVATION POLICIES IN LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Los Angeles has a long history of importing water; however, drought, climate change, and environmental mitigation have forced the City to focus on developing more local water sources (target of 50% local supply by 2035). This study aims to improve understanding of water cycling in Los Angeles, including the impacts of imported water and water conservation policies. We evaluate the influence of local water restrictions on discharge records for 12 years in the Ballona Creek (urban) and Topanga Creek (natural) watersheds. Results show imported water has significantly altered the timing and volume of streamflow in the urban Ballona watershed, resulting in runoff ratios above one (more streamflow than precipitation). Further analysis comparing pre- vs. during-mandatory water conservation periods shows there is a significant decrease in dry season streamflow during-conservation in Ballona, indicating that prior to conservation efforts, heavy irrigation and other outdoor water use practices were contributing to streamflow. The difference between summer streamflow pre- vs. during-conservation is enough to serve 160,000 customers in Los Angeles. If Los Angeles returns to more watering days, educating the public on proper irrigation rates is critical for ensuring efficient irrigation and conserving water; however, if water restrictions remain in place, the City must take the new flow volumes into account for complying with water quality standards in the region.																	1093-474X	1752-1688				JUN	2017	53	3					626	640		10.1111/1752-1688.12515								WOS:000402846200010

We employ a macro modeling system to determine the aggregate economic and water quality impacts of CNMP implementation on AFOs in the entire basin. Results of the study indicate that implementing CNMPs on AFOs will help reduce sediment and organic nutrient losses from their current levels at moderate cost.

Stochastic multicomponent reactive transport analysis of low quality drainage release from waste rock piles: Controls of the spatial distribution of acid generating and neutralizing minerals	JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY												In mining environmental applications, it is important to assess water quality from waste rock piles (WRPs) and estimate the likelihood of acid rock drainage (ARD) over time. The mineralogical heterogeneity of WRPs is a source of uncertainty in this assessment, undermining the reliability of traditional bulk indicators used in the industry. We focused in this work on the bulk neutralizing potential ratio (NPR), which is defined as the ratio of the content of non-acid-generating minerals (typically reactive carbonates such as calcite) to the content of potentially acid-generating minerals (typically sulfides such as pyrite). We used a streamtube-based Monte-Carlo method to show why and to what extent bulk NPR can be a poor indicator of ARD occurrence. We simulated ensembles of WRPs identical in their geometry and bulk NPR, which only differed in their initial distribution of the acid generating and acid neutralizing minerals that control NPR. All models simulated the same principal acid-producing, acid-neutralizing and secondary mineral forming processes. We show that small differences in the distribution of local NPR values or the number of flow paths that generate acidity strongly influence drainage pH. The results indicate that the likelihood of ARD (epitomized by the probability of occurrence of pH < 4 in a mixing boundary) within the first 100 years can be as high as 75% for a NPR = 2 and 40% for NPR = 4. The latter is traditionally considered as a "universally safe" threshold to ensure non-acidic waters in practical applications. Our results suggest that new methods that explicitly account for mineralogical heterogeneity must be sought when computing effective (upscaled) NPR values at the scale of the piles.					Mayer, K.

J	Hunt, RJ; Johnson, WP				Hunt, Randall J.; Johnson, William P.			Pathogen transport in groundwater systems: contrasts with traditional solute transport	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Water quality affects many aspects of water availability, from precluding use to societal perceptions of fit-for-purpose. Pathogen source and transport processes are drivers of water quality because they have been responsible for numerous outbreaks resulting in large economic losses due to illness and, in some cases, loss of life. Outbreaks result from very small exposure (e.g., less than 20 viruses) from very strong sources (e.g., trillions of viruses shed by a single infected individual). Thus, unlike solute contaminants, an acute exposure to a very small amount of contaminated water can cause immediate adverse health effects. Similarly, pathogens are larger than solutes. Thus, interactions with surfaces and settling become important even as processes important for solutes such as diffusion become less important. These differences are articulated in "Colloid Filtration Theory", a separate branch of pore-scale transport. Consequently, understanding pathogen processes requires changes in how groundwater systems are typically characterized, where the focus is on the leading edges of plumes and preferential flow paths, even if such features move only a very small fraction of the aquifer flow. Moreover, the relatively short survival times of pathogens in the subsurface require greater attention to very fast (< 10 year) flow paths. By better understanding the differences between pathogen and solute transport mechanisms discussed here, a more encompassing view of water quality and source water protection is attained. With this more holistic view and theoretical understanding, better evaluations can be made regarding drinking water vulnerability and the relation between groundwater and human health.																	1431-2174	1435-0157				JUN	2017	25	4			SI		921	930		10.1007/s10040-016-1502-z								WOS:000401787800003						
J	Worthington, SRH; Smart, CC				Worthington, Stephen R. H.; Smart, C. Christopher			Transient bacterial contamination of the dual-porosity aquifer at Walkerton, Ontario, Canada	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Contamination of the Paleozoic carbonate aquifer at Walkerton (Ontario, Canada) by pathogenic bacteria following heavy rain in May 2000 resulted in 2,300 illnesses and seven deaths. Subsequent tracer testing showed that there was rapid groundwater flow in the aquifer, and also rapid exchange between the aquifer and the ground surface. Electrical conductivity (EC) profiling during a 3-day pumping test showed that most flow was through bedding-plane fractures spaced about 10 m apart, that there were substantial contrasts in EC in the major fracture flows, and that there were rapid changes over time. Total coliform sampling revealed transient groundwater contamination, particularly after heavy rain and lasting up to a few days. These characteristics can be understood in terms of the dual-porosity nature of the aquifer. Most of the storage is in the matrix, but this can be considered to be static in the short term. Almost all transport is through the fracture network, which has rapid groundwater flow (similar to 100 m/day) and rapid transmission of pressure pulses due to the high hydraulic diffusivity. Rapid recharge can occur through thin and/or fractured overburden and at spring sites where flow is reversed by pumping during episodes of surface flooding. These characteristics facilitated the ingress of surface-derived bacteria into the aquifer, and their rapid transport within the aquifer to pumping wells. Bacterial presence is common in carbonate aquifers, and this can be explained by the well-connected, large-aperture fracture networks in these dual-porosity aquifers, even though many, such as at Walkerton, lack karst landforms.																	1431-2174	1435-0157				JUN	2017	25	4			SI		1003	1016		10.1007/s10040-016-1514-8								WOS:000401787800010

Disparities among the Nordic countries in the approach to providing safe drinking water from groundwater are discussed, and recommendations are given for the future. Groundwater recharge is typically high in autumn or winter months or after snowmelt in the coldest regions. Most inland aquifers are unconfined and therefore vulnerable to pollution, but they are often without much anthropogenic influence and the water quality is good. In coastal zones, previously emplaced marine sediments may confine and protect aquifers to some extent. However, the water quality in these aquifers is highly variable, as the coastal regions are also most influenced by agriculture, sea-water intrusion and urban settlements resulting in challenging conditions for water abstraction and supply. Groundwater is typically extracted from Quaternary deposits for small and medium municipalities, from bedrock for single households, and from surface water for the largest cities, except for Iceland, which relies almost entirely on groundwater for public supply. Managed aquifer recharge, with or without prior water treatment, is widely used in Finland to extend present groundwater resources. Especially at small utilities, groundwater is often supplied without treatment. Despite generally good water quality, microbial contamination has occurred, principally by norovirus and Campylobacter, with larger outbreaks resulting from sewage contamination, cross-connections into drinking water supplies, heavy rainfall events, and ingress of polluted surface water to groundwater.

It focused on microbial water pollution in low-income regions. Risk factors for faecal contamination of groundwater-fed drinking-water sources were evaluated in a case study in Juba, South Sudan. The study was based on counts of thermotolerant coliforms in water samples from 129 sources, collected by the humanitarian aid organisation M,decins Sans FrontiSres in 2010. The factors included hydrogeological settings, land use and socio-economic characteristics. The results showed that the residuals of a conventional probit regression model had a significant positive spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I = 3.05, I-stat = 9.28); therefore, a spatial model was developed that had better goodness-of-fit to the observations. The most significant factor in this model (p-value 0.005) was the distance from a water source to the nearest Tukul area, an area with informal settlements that lack sanitation services. It is thus recommended that future remediation and monitoring efforts in the city be concentrated in such low-income regions. The spatial model differed from the conventional approach: in contrast with the latter case, lowland topography was not significant at the 5% level, as the p-value was 0.074 in the spatial model and 0.040 in the traditional model. This study showed that statistical risk-factor assessments of groundwater contamination need to consider spatial interactions when the water sources are located close to each other. Future studies might further investigate the cut-off distance that reflects spatial autocorrelation. Particularly, these results advise research on urban groundwater quality.

Urban groundwater quality in sub-Saharan Africa: current status and implications for water security and public health	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Groundwater resources are important sources of drinking water in Africa, and they are hugely important in sustaining urban livelihoods and supporting a diverse range of commercial and agricultural activities. Groundwater has an important role in improving health in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). An estimated 250 million people (40% of the total) live in urban centres across SSA. SSA has experienced a rapid expansion in urban populations since the 1950s, with increased population densities as well as expanding geographical coverage. Estimates suggest that the urban population in SSA will double between 2000 and 2030. The quality status of shallow urban groundwater resources is often very poor due to inadequate waste management and source protection, and poses a significant health risk to users, while deeper borehole sources often provide an important source of good quality drinking water. Given the growth in future demand from this finite resource, as well as potential changes in future climate in this region, a detailed understanding of both water quantity and quality is required to use this resource sustainably. This paper provides a comprehensive assessment of the water quality status, both microbial and chemical, of urban groundwater in SSA across a range of hydrogeological terrains and different groundwater point types. Lower storage basement terrains, which underlie a significant proportion of urban centres in SSA, are particularly vulnerable to contamination. The relationship between mean nitrate concentration and intrinsic aquifer pollution risk is assessed for urban centres across SSA. Current knowledge gaps are identified and future research needs highlighted.

Long term evaluation of specific parameters regarding water quality can now be achieved, thanks to the increased number of archived Earth Observation satellite data, now covering decades. Within this study, 12 years of MODIS information were used to compute surface water turbidity products that were further temporal binned into composite datasets (e.g. monthly, annual). A regional algorithm, based on local in situ measurements, was used in order to inverse remote sensing reflectance values into turbidity units. The interpretation of the final maps revealed important characteristics of the processes that play a major role in the regional turbidity dynamics. Observations were made regarding the relation between surface water turbidity and Danube River's discharge rates, winds, currents and also the bottom sedimentary characteristics of the shelf area. We discuss how different regions are affected by various external factors, depending on their geographical location, and we reinforce the idea that the river solid input is not the only parameter controlling water clarity in the Danube Delta coastal area, resuspension processes playing also an important role.

The analysis covers two main groups of particles: phytoplankton and non-algal. For this purpose we use the extensive database of optical measurements acquired from 2006 to 2013 during 40 cruises of r/v Oceania in various regions of the southern Baltic: open waters, coastal waters, the Gulf of Gdansk, the Pomeranian Bay and river mouths. Expressions are derived for each of these regions to describe the seasonal variations of the dependence of the light absorption coefficients for phytoplankton a(ph)(440) and non-algal particles a(NAP)(440) on concentrations of chlorophyll a (Tchla) and suspended particulate matter in sea water (SPM). With a knowledge of these dependences, one can determine the overall absorption coefficient for all suspended particles in any part of the Baltic Sea in particular seasons from known Tchla and SPM concentrations using the relationship a(p)(440) = a(ph)(440) + a(NAP)(440) = f(Tchla, SPM). These dependences reflect the characteristics of a study area and season, and their application increases the accuracy of determination of the overall absorption properties of suspended particles and their main constituents as confirmed by statistical error reduction, e.g. standard error factor falls from 1.46 to 1.38. The relationships derived in this work can be applied in the local remote sensing algorithms used for monitoring the southern Baltic. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

S.			Bedload as an indicator of heavy metal contamination in a Brazilian anthropized watershed	CATENA												Heavy metal contamination has long been a water quality concern worldwide. Most studies have focused on heavy metal concentration in water through suspended sediment and bottom sediment; however, the concentration transported by river-bottom sediment, known as bedload, has not been taken into account. In order to fill this gap, this study aimed to determine the concentration of Hg, Pb, Cd, Ni, Cu, Cr, Zn, As, Fe and Mn in bedload of Ipojuca River which is an environmentally impacted river in Brazil. The use of bedload in heavy metal contamination studies raises the following question: Is the bedload an adequate indicator of heavy metal contamination? To answer this question, sediment contamination assessment was performed using sediment contamination indices, principal component analysis, and comparison with background values and sediment quality guidelines (SQGs). Comparing with sediment quality guidelines, the Probable Effect Level (PEL) and Threshold Effect Level (TEL) seem to underestimate the harmful effect on sediment-dwelling organisms, being essential either to calibrate the SQGs for site specific conditions or develop site specific guidelines. The pollution load index (PLI) indicated that the upstream and downstream sites were not polluted and polluted, respectively. Principal component analysis explained roughly 91% and 81% of the total variance in heavy metal contamination upstream and downstream, respectively, and distinguished natural and anthropogenic contributions in Ipojuca River. Multiple lines of evidence suggested that heavy metal concentrations in bedload were an adequate and feasible indicator of anthropogenic impacts. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study aims to spatially analyse the land degradation sensitivity in south-western Romania, a region currently known for this type of environmental deterioration. The analysis is based on mapping and assessing land susceptibility to degradation by means of a multifactorial approach using GIS techniques, such as the well-established MEDALUS (Mediterranean Desertification and Land Use) method. Widely used in the Mediterranean region and other areas worldwide due to advantageous features such as simplicity, flexibility and rapid implementation, the method was used in this study for the analysis of the main indicators identified to be driving forces of land degradation, i.e. Climate Quality Index, Soil Quality Index, Vegetation Quality Index and Management Quality Index The paper aims to adjust the method in relation to local conditions by considering certain additional variables (sub-indicators) for computing the main indicators, as well as by integrating a new regionally relevant indicator for this environmental issue Water Quality Index. The final results, assessed with the proposed Land Degradation Sensitivity Index (based on 21 sub-indicators, of which 15 are included in the original MEDALUS method, and 6 are additional), showed that approximately 70% of the total study area is critically sensitive to degradation, mainly due to high agricultural pressures and very low vegetation cover. Surprisingly, in terms of administration, it was found that >80% of the region's territorial administrative units include sectors which are critically exposed to degradation that exceed half their area. The results can constitute a basic support for regional-level decision makers who can implement the appropriate measures in order to attenuate the restrictive environmental conditions.

Functional diversity of microbial communities in pristine aquifers inferred by PLFA- and sequencing-based approaches	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Microorganisms in groundwater play an important role in aquifer biogeochemical cycles and water quality. However, the mechanisms linking the functional diversity of microbial populations and the groundwater physico-chemistry are still not well understood due to the complexity of interactions between surface and subsurface. Within the framework of Hainich (north-western Thuringia, central Germany) Critical Zone Exploratory of the Collaborative Research Centre AquaDiva, we used the relative abundances of phospholipid-derived fatty acids (PLFAs) to link specific biochemical markers within the microbial communities to the spatio-temporal changes of the groundwater physico-chemistry. The functional diversities of the microbial communities were mainly correlated with groundwater chemistry, including dissolved O-2, Fe-t and NH4+ concentrations. Abundances of PLFAs derived from eukaryotes and potential nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (11Me16:0 as biomarker for Nitro-spira moscoviensis) were high at sites with elevated O-2 concentration where groundwater recharge supplies bioavailable substrates. In anoxic groundwaters more rich in Fe-t, PLFAs abundant in sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), iron-reducing bacteria and fungi increased with Fe-t and HCO3- concentrations, suggesting the occurrence of active iron reduction and the possible role of fungi in meditating iron solubilization and transport in those aquifer domains. In more NH4+ -rich anoxic groundwaters, anammox bacteria and SRB-derived PLFAs increased with NH4+ concentration, further evidencing the dependence of the anammox process on ammonium concentration and potential links between SRB and anammox bacteria. Additional support of the PLFA-based bacterial communities was found in DNA- and RNA-based Illumina MiSeq amplicon sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes, which showed high predominance of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria Nitrospira, e.g. Nitrospira moscoviensis, in oxic aquifer zones and of anammox bacteria in more NH4+ -rich anoxic groundwater. Higher relative abundances of sequence reads in the RNA-based datasets affiliated with iron-reducing bacteria in more Fe-t-rich groundwater supported the occurrence of active dissimilatory iron reduction. The functional diversity of the microbial communities in the biogeochemically distinct groundwater assemblages can be largely attributed to the redox conditions linked to changes in bioavailable substrates and input of substrates with the seepage. Our results demonstrate the power of complementary information derived from PLFA-based and sequencing-based approaches.

Emergent archetype patterns of coupled hydrologic and biogeochemical responses in catchments	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Relationships between in-stream dissolved solute concentrations (C) and discharge (Q) are useful indicators of catchment-scale processes. We combine a synthesis of observational records with a parsimonious stochastic modeling approach to test how C-Q relationships arise from spatial heterogeneity in catchment solute sources coupled with different timescales of reactions. Our model indicates that the dominant driver of emergent archetypical dilution, enrichment, and constant C-Q patterns was structured heterogeneity of solute sources implemented as correlation of source concentration to travel time. Regardless of the C-Q pattern, with weak correlation between solute-source concentration and travel time, we consistently find lower variability in C than in Q, such that the predominant solute export regime is chemostatic. Consequently, the variance in exported loads is determined primarily by variance of Q. Efforts to improve stream water quality and ecological integrity in intensely managed catchments should lead away from landscape homogenization by introducing structured source heterogeneity.

The European Community Water Framework Directive establishes guidelines for the classification of all water bodies across Europe and chemical and biological indicators were used to this scope. In particular, the Chlorophyll type A index (Chl-a) is a shared indicator of trophic status and monitoring activities may be useful to explain its spatial distribution and to discover local dangerous behaviours (for example the anoxic events). Differently by the classical approach based on an "average'' values over a period, we propose a functional clustering model that takes into account temporal and spatial dependence of Chl-a concentrations in the Adriatic Sea for defining appropriate clusters of sites. We use satellite monthly data, during the period 2002-2012, and we model the spatial dependence among the sites by means of a Markov random field model. Compared to similar attempts in literature by Jiang and Serban (2012) our formulation includes spatial covariates. This inclusion allows for more flexibility to obtain more homogeneous and representative clusters of sites in the Adriatic Sea. The estimation of the model and the identification of the number of clusters are carried out using a pseudolikelihood function. A small simulation study complements the real data analysis.

Seasonality of Coliform Bacteria Detection Rates in New Jersey Domestic Wells	GROUNDWATER												It is important that indicators of fecal pollution are reliable. Coliform bacteria are a commonly used indicator of fecal pollution. As other investigators have reported elsewhere, we observed a seasonal pattern of coliform bacteria detections in domestic wells in New Jersey. Examination of a statewide database of 10 years of water quality data from 93,447 samples, from 78,207 wells, generated during real estate transactions, revealed that coliform bacteria were detected in a higher proportion of wells during warm weather months. Further examination of the seasonal pattern of other data, including well water pH, precipitation, ground and surface water temperatures, surface water coliform bacteria concentrations, and vegetation, resulted in the hypothesis that these bacteria may be derived from nonfecal (or environmentally adapted) as well as fecal sources. We provide evidence that the coliform seasonality may be the result of seasonal changes in groundwater extraction volumes (and to a lesser extent precipitation), and temperature-driven changes in the concentration of surface or near-surface coliform sources. Nonfecal coliform sources may not indicate the presence of fecal wastes and hence the potential presence of pathogens, or do so in an inconsistent fashion. Additional research is needed to identify the sources of the coliforms detected in groundwater.																	0017-467X	1745-6584				MAY-JUN	2017	55	3					346	361		10.1111/gwat.12482								WOS:000404746300009	27775834

In the present study, three outlier identification methods the three sigma rule (3 sigma), inter quantile range (IQR), and median absolute deviation (MAD) that take advantage of the ensemble regression method are proposed by considering non-Gaussian characteristics of groundwater data. For validation purposes, the performance of the methods is compared using simulated and actual groundwater data with a few hypothetical conditions. In the validations using simulated data, all of the proposed methods reasonably identify outliers at a 5% outlier level; whereas, only the IQR method performs well for identifying outliers at a 30% outlier level. When applying the methods to real groundwater data, the outlier identification performance of the IQR method is found to be superior to the other two methods. However, the IQR method shows limitation by identifying excessive false outliers, which may be overcome by its joint application with other methods (for example, the 3 sigma rule and MAD methods). The proposed methods can be also applied as potential tools for the detection of future anomalies by model training based on currently available data. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Effects of in-stream structures and channel flow rate variation on transient storage	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												In-stream structures can potentially enhance surface and subsurface solute retention. They form naturally in small streams and their installation has gained popularity in stream restoration for multiple purposes, including improved water quality. Yet few studies have quantified the cumulative effect of multiple structures on solute transport at the reach scale, nor how this varies with changing stream flow. We built a series of weirs in a small stream to simulate channel spanning structures such as natural debris dams and stream restoration log dams and boulder weirs. We conducted constant rate conservative (NaCl) tracer injections to quantify the effect of the weirs on solute transport at the reach scale. We used a one dimensional solute transport model with transient storage to quantify the change of solute transport parameters with increasing number of weirs. Results indicate that adding weirs significantly increased the cross-sectional area of the surface stream (A) and transient storage zones (A(s)) while exchange with transient storage (cc) decreased. The increase in A and As is due to backwater behind weirs and increased hydrostatically driven hyporheic exchange induced by the weirs, while we surmise that the reduction in alpha is due at least in part to reduced hydrodynamically driven hyporheic exchange in bed ripples drowned by the weir backwater. In order for weir installation to achieve net improvement in solute retention and thus water quality, cumulative reactions in weir backwater and enhanced hydrostatically driven hyporheic exchange would have to overcome the reduced hydrodynamically driven exchange. Analysis of channel flow variation over the course of the experiments indicated that weirs change the relationship between transient storage parameters and flow, for example the trend of increasing a with flow without weirs was reversed in the presence of weirs. Effects of flow variation were substantial, indicating that transient storage measurements at a single point in time typically cannot be extrapolated to estimate net annual effects. Thus, rigorous evaluation of water quality effects of stream restoration structures requires measurements at multiple channel flow rates. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.					Rana, S.M.

In this paper, two scenarios were considered for Multi-Station (MS) nitrate load modeling of the Little River watershed. In the first scenario, Markovian characteristics of streamflow-nitrate time series were proposed for the MS modeling. For this purpose, feature extraction criterion of Mutual Information (MI) was employed for input selection of artificial intelligence models (Feed Forward Neural Network, FFNN and least square support vector machine). In the second scenario for considering seasonality-based characteristics of the time series, wavelet transform was used to extract multi-scale features of streamflow-nitrate time series of the watershed's sub-basins to model MS nitrate loads. Self-Organizing Map (SOM) clustering technique which finds homogeneous sub series clusters was also linked to MI for proper cluster agent choice to be imposed into the models for predicting the nitrate loads of the watershed's sub-basins. The proposed MS method not only considers the prediction of the outlet nitrate but also covers predictions of interior sub-basins nitrate load values. The results indicated that the proposed FFNN model coupled with the SOM-MI improved the performance of MS nitrate predictions compared to the Markovian-based models up to 39%. Overall, accurate selection of dominant inputs which consider seasonality-based characteristics of streamflow-nitrate process could enhance the efficiency of nitrate load predictions.

Data and techniques that allow detailed identification and quantification of pyrite oxidation are therefore crucial for assessing and predicting the adverse water quality changes that may be associated with this process. In this study, we explore the benefits of combining stable sulphur isotope analysis with reactive transport modelling to improve the identification and characterisation of pyrite oxidation during an aquifer storage and recovery experiment in a chemically and physically heterogeneous aquifer. We characterise the stable sulphur isotope signal (634S) in both the ambient groundwater and the injectant as well as its spatial distribution within the sedimentary sulphur species. The identified stable sulphur isotope signal for pyrite was found to vary between 32 and +34%o, while the signal of the injectant ranged between +9.06 and +14.45%0 during the injection phase of the experiment. Both isotope and hydrochemical data together suggest a substantial contribution of pyrite oxidation to the observed, temporally variable delta S-34 signals. The variability of the delta S-34 signal in pyrite and the injectant were both found to complicate the analysis of the stable isotope data. However, the incorporation of the data into a numerical modelling approach allowed to successfully employ the delta S-34 signatures as a valuable additional constraint for identifying and quantifying the contribution of pyrite oxidation to the redox transformations that occur in response to the injection of oxygenated water.

M.; Han, Dawei			Representing radar rainfall uncertainty with ensembles based on a time-variant geostatistical error modelling approach	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The application of radar quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) to hydrology and water quality models can be preferred to interpolated rainfall point measurements because of the wide coverage that radars can provide, together with a good spatio-temporal resolutions. Nonetheless, it is often limited by the proneness of radar QPE to a multitude of errors. Although radar errors have been widely studied and techniques have been developed to correct most of them, residual errors are still intrinsic in radar QPE. An estimation of uncertainty of radar QPE and an assessment of uncertainty propagation in modelling applications is important to quantify the relative importance of the uncertainty associated to radar rainfall input in the overall modelling uncertainty. A suitable tool for this purpose is the generation of radar rainfall ensembles. An ensemble is the representation of the rainfall field and its uncertainty through a collection of possible alternative rainfall fields, produced according to the observed errors, their spatial characteristics, and their probability distribution. The errors are derived from a comparison between radar QPE and ground point measurements. The novelty of the proposed ensemble generator is that it is based on a geostatistical approach that assures a fast and robust generation of synthetic error fields, based on the time-variant characteristics of errors. The method is developed to meet the requirement of operational applications to large datasets. The method is applied to a case study in Northern England, using the UK Met Office NIMROD radar composites at 1 km resolution and at 1 h accumulation on an area of 180 km by 180 km. The errors are estimated using a network of 199 tipping bucket rain gauges from the Environment Agency. 183 of the rain gauges are used for the error modelling, while 16 are kept apart for validation. The validation is done by comparing the radar rainfall ensemble with the values recorded by the validation rain gauges. The validated ensemble is then tested on a hydrological case study, to show the advantage of probabilistic rainfall for uncertainty propagation. The ensemble spread only partially captures the mismatch between the modelled and the observed flow. The residual uncertainty can be attributed to other sources of uncertainty, in particular to model structural uncertainty, parameter identification uncertainty, uncertainty in other inputs, and uncertainty in the observed flow.

Trace organic chemical attenuation during managed aquifer recharge: Insights from a variably saturated 2D tank experiment	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Meaningful model-based predictions of water quality and quantity are imperative for the designed footprint of managed aquifer recharge installations. A two-dimensional (2D) synthetic MAR system equipped with automated sensors (temperature, water pressure, conductivity, soil moisture, oxidation-reduction potential) and embedded water sampling ports was used to test and model fundamental subsurface processes during surface spreading managed aquifer recharge operations under controlled flow and redox conditions at the meso-scale. The fate and transport of contaminants in the variably saturated synthetic aquifer were simulated using the finite element analysis model, FEFLOW. In general, the model concurred with travel times derived from contaminant breakthrough curves at individual sensor locations throughout the 2D tank. However, discrepancies between measured and simulated trace organic chemical concentrations (i.e., carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, tris (2-chloroethyl) phosphate, trimethoprim) were observed. While the FEFLOW simulation of breakthrough curves captured overall shapes of trace organic chemical concentrations well, the model struggled with matching individual data points, although compound-specific attenuation parameters were used. Interestingly, despite steady-state operation, oxidation-reduction potential measurements indicated temporal disturbances in hydraulic properties in the saturated zone of the 2D tank that affected water quality.

A position percent interpolation equation was established to determine nodal vertical-coordinates and match boundaries. For 3-D simulations of subsurface zones, an additional mesh generation method was proposed to create quadrilaterals for filling the empty regions along river reaches and around junctions with storage, ponds or lakes. In order to deal With special storage region with an odd number of boundary nodes, an additional triangle was inserted. Five topological optimization templates were proposed to improve the quality of degenerated elements. This paper proposed the basic algorithms to generate quadrilateral-prism meshes through stretching the quadrilateral mesh along vertical directions based on material domains. Aiming at four types of fractures, corresponding extraction methods were presented to preserve geometric features. In order to accommodate the need for overland and subsurface simulations, 1-D/2-D/3-D correspondence was established between rivers, junctions, ponds, lakes, control structures and finite element meshes. Finally, several realistic hydrologic and geologic examples for meshing multi-domain areas were provided to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the mesh generator developed in this paper.

Toward mountains without permanent snow and ice	EARTHS FUTURE												The cryosphere in mountain regions is rapidly declining, a trend that is expected to accelerate over the next several decades due to anthropogenic climate change. A cascade of effects will result, extending from mountains to lowlands with associated impacts on human livelihood, economy, and ecosystems. With rising air temperatures and increased radiative forcing, glaciers will become smaller and, in some cases, disappear, the area of frozen ground will diminish, the ratio of snow to rainfall will decrease, and the timing and magnitude of both maximum and minimum streamflow will change. These changes will affect erosion rates, sediment, and nutrient flux, and the biogeochemistry of rivers and proglacial lakes, all of which influence water quality, aquatic habitat, and biotic communities. Changes in the length of the growing season will allow low-elevation plants and animals to expand their ranges upward. Slope failures due to thawing alpine permafrost, and outburst floods from glacier-and moraine-dammed lakes will threaten downstream populations.Societies even well beyond the mountains depend on meltwater from glaciers and snow for drinking water supplies, irrigation, mining, hydropower, agriculture, and recreation. Here, we review and, where possible, quantify the impacts of anticipated climate change on the alpine cryosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere, and consider the implications for adaptation to a future of mountains without permanent snow and ice.

Water samples were collected between 2007 and 2008 from 8 sites along a 510 km downstream transect of the NR, and chemical and isotopic compositions of the water samples were evaluated to identify natural and anthropogenic sources contributing to the water chemistry of the NR. The results showed that the major ion concentrations were mainly controlled by chemical weathering that occurred in the watershed, in which a silicate weathering is more dominant than a carbonate weathering. The Sr-87/(86) Sr ratios of the water samples were in a range from 0.71043 to 0.71520 within those of the Mesozoic volcanogenic sedimentary rocks long developed in the watershed, thereby supporting the fact that the water chemistry is governed by a chemical weathering. The delta S-34 values varied in a narrow range of 1.8-3.1%, regardless of spatial and seasonal variations. Mass balance calculations indicated that the contributions of chemical weathering and anthropogenic sources during summer time increased along a downstream transect, from 67.3 +/- 1.3 to 73.6 +/- 0.5% and from 6.0 to 15.7%, respectively. In contrast, the contribution of chemical weathering during winter time decreased from 82.7 +/- 0.8 to 72.5 +/- 0.3%, while anthropogenic contribution increased up to 22.2%. These results indicated that the water chemistry of the NR was mainly caused by a chemical weathering, followed by anthropogenic inputs and rainwater. This study will provide baseline information for comparing the water quality issue before and after the implementation of the Four Rivers Restoration Project of South Korea.

These analyses were conducted to trace the provenance of the sediments. Textural parameters reveal that the lake sediments consist predominantly clay and silt fractions. The C/N ratio of the sediments indicates a mixed source of TOC, both autochthonous and allochthonous in origin. The log (Fe2O3/K2O) Vs. log (SiO2/Al2O3) graph of the sediments discriminates the rock types of the catchment area that are Fe-shale, Fe-sand, wacke, shale and litharenite. The Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA) falls between 59.11 to 90.16% and Chemical Index of Weathering (CIW) between 63.97 to 99.68% and these values are higher than the Post-Archaean Australian Shale (PAAS), indicating moderate to highly chemically weathered lake floor sediments. Plagioclase Index of Alteration (PIA) values (60.74-99.63%) suggests the occurrence of plagioclase feldspars in the lake floor sediments. Geochemical characteristics signify a mixed-nature of provenance of the lake floor sediments due to the tectonic settings of the lake basin in a complex catchment area.																	0016-7622	0974-6889				MAY	2017	89	5					563	572		10.1007/s12594-017-0645-4								WOS:000402076300010

We analyzed eighteen (18) physic-chemical parameters (temperature, pH, conductivity, chlorides, sulfates, phosphates, nitrogenous components, oxygenates dissolved, oxidizible material, dry residue, total hardness, suspension materials....). The main physic-chemical parameters of the quality of the water were thus measured then an analysis in main components was realized from the average values of every parameter; we were able to reveal so the existence of a spatial variation relatively marked with these descriptors, revealing four components very uneven and well differentiated. The interpretation of the results by means of these tools allowed to understand (include) that the parameters responsible for the quality of waters are connected for the component 1 (anthropological contributions: organic and mineral) and the components 2 and 3 respectively bound in the effects of seasonality's and the anthropological activities. The component 4 could be connected with the agricultural activities.

Alternative futures of dissolved inorganic nitrogen export from the Mississippi River Basin: influence of crop management, atmospheric deposition, and population growth	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Nitrogen (N) export from the Mississippi River Basin contributes to seasonal hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). We explored monthly dissolved inorganic N (DIN) export to the GOM for a historical year (2002) and two future scenarios (year 2022) by linking macroeonomic energy, agriculture market, air quality, and agriculture land management models to a DIN export model. Future scenarios considered policies aimed at encouraging bioenergy crop production and reducing atmospheric N-emissions, as well as the effect of population growth and the states' infrastructure plans on sewage fluxes. Model-derived DIN export decreased by about 9% (from 279 to 254 kg N km(-2) year(-1)) between 2002 and 2022 due to a 28% increase in area planted with corn, 24% improvement in crop N-recovery efficiency (NRE, to 0.52), 22% reduction in atmospheric N deposition, and 23% increase in sewage inputs. Changes in atmospheric and sewage inputs had a relatively small effect on DIN export and the effect of bioenergy crop production depended on nutrient management practices. Without improved NRE, increased production of corn would have increased DIN export by about 14% (to 289 kg N km(-2) year(-1)) between 2002 and 2022. Model results suggest that meeting future crop demand while reducing the areal extent of hypoxia could require aggressive actions, such improving basin-level crop NRE to 0.62 or upgrading N-removal capabilities in waste water treatment plants beyond current plans. Tile-drained cropland could contribute up to half of DIN export; thus, practices that reduce N losses from tile drains could also have substantial benefit.

Impact of seasonal changes in stream metabolism on nitrate concentrations in an urban stream	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Nitrate (NO3-) dynamics in urban streams differ from many natural streams due to stormwater runoff, sewage inputs, decreased groundwater discharge, often limited hyporheic exchange, increased primary productivity, and limited carbon input. We investigated NO3- dynamics in a first-order urban stream in Syracuse, NY, which has urbanized headwaters and a geomorphologically natural downstream section. Twice-monthly water sampling, NO3- injection tests, NO3- isotopic analysis, filamentous algae mat density, and riparian shading were used to identify processes regulating NO3- dynamics in the stream over a 12-month period. The urban headwater reach had low NO3- (0.006-0.2 mg N/L) in the spring through fall, with a minimum uptake length of 900 m, no canopy cover, and high algae mat density. The downstream natural reach (100% canopy cover during the summer and low algae mat density) had nitrate concentrations between 0.6 and 1.2 mg N/L from winter to summer, which decreased during autumn leaf-off. In the urban reach, autotrophic uptake by filamentous green algae is a major NO3- sink in summer. In the natural reach, the addition of organic matter to the stream at leaf-off led to a decrease in NO3- concentration followed by an increase in NO3- concentration in winter as gross primary productivity decreased. This study shows that the balance between autotrophy and heterotrophy in urban streams is variable and depends on an interplay of drivers such as temperature, light, and carbon inputs that are mediated by the riparian ecosystem.

For this purpose, monthly water sampling was performed from 11 sampling stations on streams that fed the dam. According to land surveys they have a potential to inflict pollution to the dam. Thus the physical and chemical parameters (i.e. pH, dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity, temperature, chemical oxygen demand, turbidity and suspended solids) were monitored monthly for 1-year period. Chloride, sulfate, total nitrogen, ammonium, nitrite, nitrate were monitored for a 6-month period, and the results were evaluated in accordance with the Turkish Regulation of Surface Water Quality Management. Results of the study show that the most important reasons for the- pollution in the dam are caused by domestic and industrial wastewaters, which were released to the system without being treated, or without being sufficiently treated, and also of agricultural activities. It was determined that electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, chemical oxygen demand, suspended solids, nitrite, nitrate, total nitrogen, sulfate, and chloride parameters which were high at the sampling stations where domestic and industrial wastewaters discharge were present. pH and temperature demonstrate a difference at a significant level by seasons. As a result of the study, it was determined that the water was of IVth quality in terms of nitrate, chemical oxygen demand, and total nitrogen, and it was of 111rd quality water with respect to ammonium, electrical conductivity, and dissolved oxygen. It was observed that the dam outflow water was of IVth quality with respect to nitrate, chemical oxygen demand, and total nitrogen, and of IIIrd quality with respect to dissolved oxygen and electrical conductivity. It is considered that the pollution problem in the Akkaya Dam can only be resolved with prevention studies on a watershed scale. Therefore, coordination between the institutions is necessary. The preparation for the integrated water management plan of the watershed will provide a significant contribution to the solution of the water quality problem. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Hydrochemical characterization and suitability assessment of groundwater in Baga-Calangute stretch of Goa, India	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The present study is the first attempt to determine the suitability of groundwater for drinking and irrigation in the Baga-Calangute stretch of Goa. The suitability of groundwater for potable use was assessed by comparing observed values against standards prescribed by the Bureau of Indian Standards, and the quality was classified based on the Weighted Arithmetic Water Quality Index. Most of the groundwater samples (90%) were found to be suitable for drinking except for hardness, chlorides, and nitrates. The percent sodium (%Na), residual sodium carbonate, soluble sodium percentage, sodium adsorption ratio, Kelly's ratio, and Permeability Index were found to be within the prescribed limits for irrigation purposes. The major mechanism controlling groundwater chemistry, i.e., rock-water interaction, was also studied, and it was found that silicate weathering plays a major role in the dissolution of minerals. Based on the hydrochemical characterization, the water was observed to be of the Ca-Na-SO4 composition type except for one sample which was of the Na-Cl composition type. Classification of the meteoric genesis suggested that the groundwater in surficial aquifers in the region had a deep meteoric percolation, and its chemistry is regulated by rock-water interaction.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				MAY	2017	76	9							341	10.1007/s12665-017-6679-5								WOS:000401323600013

Multivariate statistical analysis for the assessment of groundwater quality under different hydrogeological regimes	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Multivariate statistical analysis has been widely used for hydrogeochemical characterization of groundwater quality. In this study, hydrochemical data from three hydrological basins were used and two methods (factor and cluster analyses) were applied. The first area is the coastal area of Eastern Thermaikos Gulf where groundwater is influenced by seawater intrusion and geothermal fluids. The other two areas are the inland basins of Gallikos and Perdikas in which agricultural and industrial activities constitute the main anthropogenic pollution sources of groundwater. Initially, the aforementioned methods were applied for each area separately and resulted in a different number of significant factors and clusters, while the natural and anthropogenic influences were spatially determined in each area. Additionally, factor and cluster analyses were applied coupling data from all areas. Therefore, five clusters and three major factors were determined distinguishing the hydrochemical processes and impacts from anthropogenic activities in more detail. It is worth mentioning that the application of cluster analysis in the coupled groundwater samples of all studied areas resulted beneficially in the most hydrochemically complex area. Salinization dominates in the coastal area, while in Gallikos and Perdikas basins high concentrations of NO3 occur mainly due to agricultural activities and small livestock units. The numerous hydrochemical samples are identified as the main issue for the higher discretization and reliability of the second approach. Nevertheless, this study is associated with a number of limitations of multivariable statistical analysis regarding extreme concentrations of Cl and Na. This issue stimulates further research in overcoming and understanding these drawbacks.

All major groundwater quality descriptors and selected trace elements (iron, manganese, arsenic, and aluminum) were studied. The study demonstrated evidence of higher concentrations of bicarbonates (60-590 mg/L), total iron (2.2-5336 mu g/L), total manganese (0.1-804 mu g/L) and total arsenic (0.4-14.5 mu g/L) in certain samples with low values of Eh (-32.0 to +25.8) and NO3- (<= 8.2 mg/L) against WHO standards. Thirty-six percent of samples were rated as poor using the water quality index (WQI) criteria. No scaling potential was observed using the Langelier analysis. The majority of samples were of the mixed-bicarbonate type with the abundance order of cations as Ca2+>Na+>Mg2+>K+. Carbonate dissolution, silicate weathering and cation exchange were identified as possible main geochemical control mechanisms.

Large tracts of the Selenga River Basin have been developed for industry, urbanization, mining, and agriculture, resulting in the release of suspended solids (SS) that affect downstream water quality and primary productivity. This study addressed SS as the main factor controlling pollutant transport and the primary indicator of land degradation in the Selenga River system. Tributaries with larger areas dedicated to agricultural use had higher SS concentrations, reaching 862 mg L-1, especially during the high runoff and intensive cultivation season. Although the large SS flux was detected in the main river, the small tributaries were distinguished by high SS concentrations. The high SS concentration corresponded to widespread development in the watershed. Watersheds with high potential of SS release are sensitive to intensive land uses. SS in the river system had a constant elemental composition consisting mainly of Fe and Al oxides, indicating that surface soils were major constituents of the tributary SS. Three heavymetals (Zn, Cu, and Cr) appeared in high concentrations downstream of urban and mining areas (two-to sixfold increases), indicating that these contaminants are carried by SS. At two tributary junctions, the concentration of contaminants on the SS decreased due to a large influx of SS with low heavy metal contents. Changes in electric conductivity and pH at downstream of tributary junctions enhanced the sedimentation of SS and the removal of contaminants from the water phase after aggregation of the SS. Land use changes in the tributary watersheds are major controlling factors for the fate of contaminants in the river system.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				MAY	2017	76	9							346	10.1007/s12665-017-6664-z								WOS:000401323600018

Assessment of the quality of groundwater from different parts of southeastern Nigeria for potable use	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Groundwater samples from three different states of southeastern Nigeria were analyzed for a range of physicochemical parameters and heavy metal constituents in order to determine their potability as drinking water sources. The results indicate that the physicochemical parameters (pH, temperature, TDS, TH, electrical conductivity, Cl-, NO3- and SO42-) tested for have most of their values fall within the permissible limits given by the Nigerian and World Health Organization standards for drinking water quality. The results also reveal that apart from Cu and Pb the rest of the tested heavy metals (As, Zn, Ni, total Fe, Cd and Mn) recorded values that are significantly above the maximum permissible limits for drinking water purposes and therefore have the potential to cause health impacts for long-term potable use. On the basis of principal component analysis, the sources of the measured chemical constituents are likely to be predominantly geogenic (weathering of soluble minerals in the formations) and partly anthropogenic (industrial effluent, agricultural practices and mining activities). Single-factor ANOVA tests indicated insignificant differences in the datasets within/between states or geological units. Caution or adequate treatment is generally required when utilizing the groundwater from the area for drinking purpose due to the elevated metal concentrations and rating as poor to unsuitable water quality.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				MAY	2017	76	9							344	10.1007/s12665-017-6680-z								WOS:000401323600016

Stormwater is a carrier of non-point source pollutants and contains VOCs from land surfaces and air. Samples of stormwater and influent to sewage treatment plants were collected and analyzed for 61 VOCs, while the VOCs in emission sources, air and groundwater were investigated through literature reviews for comparison. The results showed that the most frequently detected VOCs in stormwater were similar to those in air. However, the atmospheric concentrations of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX), and methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) were too low to explain their frequent detection and high concentrations in stormwater. As a result, land surfaces seem to be a primary source of these VOCs in stormwater. Comparison of the VOCs in stormwater and groundwater showed that toluene and MTBE were frequently detected in both media, but more often and at higher concentrations in stormwater. This finding indicates that stormwater recharge is a source of toluene and MTBE in groundwater. Regarding groundwater, land surfaces seem to be a primary source of toluene, while urban air is the primary source in the case of MTBE. Specifically, the MTBE values in air were sufficiently high to explain its levels in groundwater, which had continually increased and remained low afterward. Furthermore, the high ratios of TEX (toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes) to benzene and MTBE in stormwater indicated that TEX had additional sources other than vehicles, most likely hydrocarbon solvents. These solvents seem to be a primary source of TEX and other frequently detected VOCs in stormwater. However, trichloroethylene (TCE), tetrachloroethylene (PCE) and their dechlorination intermediates were far more frequently detected and at higher concentrations in groundwater than in stormwater. Additionally, their concentrations frequently exceeded the water- quality criteria. It seems that halogenated solvents had produced contamination plumes of these chlorinated VOCs in the Seoul aquifer. Based on VOCs detected in Seoul, stormwater was mixed with groundwater in combined sewers and flowed into sewage treatment plants. The results imply that organic solvents should be handled with extreme care to protect groundwater quality.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				MAY	2017	76	9							338	10.1007/s12665-017-6666-x								WOS:000401323600010

In order to evaluate the effect on groundwater recharge, of decreasing surface-water bodies and land-use change caused by urbanization, the relevant groundwater systems and recharge pathways must be characterized in detail. To this end, water levels and water quality were monitored for 3 years regarding groundwater and adjacent surface-water bodies, at two typical suburban sites in Hanoi. Stable isotope (delta O-18, delta D of water) analysis and hydrochemical analysis showed that the water from both aquifers and aquitards, including the groundwater obtained from both the monitoring wells and the neighboring household tubewells, was largely derived from evaporation-affected surface-water bodies (e.g., ponds, irrigated farmlands) rather than from rivers. The water-level monitoring results suggested distinct local-scale flow systems for both a Holocene unconfined aquifer (HUA) and Pleistocene confined aquifer (PCA). That is, in the case of the HUA, lateral recharge through the aquifer from neighboring ponds and/or irrigated farmlands appeared to be dominant, rather than recharge by vertical rainwater infiltration. In the case of the PCA, recharge by the above-lying HUA, through areas where the aquitard separating the two aquifers was relatively thin or nonexistent, was suggested. As the decrease in the local surface-water bodies will likely reduce the groundwater recharge, maintaining and enhancing this recharge (through preservation of the surface-water bodies) is considered as essential for the sustainable use of groundwater in the area.

J	Olyaie, E; Abyaneh, HZ; Mehr, AD				Olyaie, Ehsan; Abyaneh, Hamid Zare; Mehr, Ali Danandeh			A comparative analysis among computational intelligence techniques for dissolved oxygen prediction in Delaware River	GEOSCIENCE FRONTIERS												Most of the water quality models previously developed and used in dissolved oxygen (DO) prediction are complex. Moreover, reliable data available to develop/calibrate new DO models is scarce. Therefore, there is a need to study and develop models that can handle easily measurable parameters of a particular site, even with short length. In recent decades, computational intelligence techniques, as effective approaches for predicting complicated and significant indicator of the state of aquatic ecosystems such as DO, have created a great change in predictions. In this study, three different AI methods comprising: (1) two types of artificial neural networks (ANN) namely multi linear perceptron (MLP) and radial based function (RBF); (2) an advancement of genetic programming namely linear genetic programming (LGP); and (3) a support vector machine (SVM) technique were used for DO prediction in Delaware River located at Trenton, USA. For evaluating the performance of the proposed models, root mean square error (RMSE), Nashe-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NS), mean absolute relative error (MARE) and, correlation coefficient statistics (R) were used to choose the best predictive model. The comparison of estimation accuracies of various intelligence models illustrated that the SVM was able to develop the most accurate model in DO estimation in comparison to other models. Also, it was found that the LGP model performs better than the both ANNs models. For example, the determination coefficient was 0.99 for the best SVM model, while it was 0.96, 0.91 and 0.81 for the best LGP, MLP and RBF models, respectively. In general, the results indicated that an SVM model could be employed satisfactorily in DO estimation. (C) 2016, China University of Geosciences (Beijing) and Peking University.

In aquatic systems, the application of atmospheric correction aims to minimize such effects and avoid the under or overestimation of remote sensing reflectance (R-rs). Accurately R-rs provides better information about the state of aquatic system, it means, establishing the concentration of aquatic compounds more precisely. The aim of this study is to evaluate the outputs from several atmospheric correction methods (Dark Object Subtraction DOS; Quick Atmospheric Correction - QUAC; Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Hypercubes - FLAASH; Atmospheric Correction for OLI 'lite' - ACOLITE, and Provisional Landsat-8 Surface Reflectance Algorithm - L8SR) in order to investigate the suitability of R-rs for estimating total suspended matter concentrations (TSM) in the Barra Bonita Hydroelectrical Reservoir. To establish TSM concentrations via atmospherically corrected Operational Land Imager (OLI) scene, the TSM retrieval model was calibrated and validated with in situ data. Thereby, the achieved results from TSM retrieval model application demonstrated that L8SR is able to provide the most suitable R-rs values for green and red spectral bands, and consequently, the lowest TSM retrieval errors (Mean Absolute Percentage Error about 10% and 12%, respectively). Retrieved R-rs from near infrared band is still a challenge for all the tested algorithms. (C) 2017 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

An evaluation of existent methods for estimation of embankment dam breach parameters	NATURAL HAZARDS												The study of dam-break analysis is considered important to predict the peak discharge during dam failure. This is essential to assess economic, social and environmental impacts downstream and to prepare the emergency response plan. Dam breach parameters such as breach width, breach height and breach formation time are the key variables to estimate the peak discharge during dam break. This study presents the evaluation of existing methods for estimation of dam breach parameters. Since all of these methods adopt regression analysis, uncertainty analysis of these methods becomes necessary to assess their performance. Uncertainty was performed using the data of more than 140 case studies of past recorded failures of dams, collected from different sources in the literature. The accuracy of the existing methods was tested, and the values of mean absolute relative error were found to be ranging from 0.39 to 1.05 for dam breach width estimation and from 0.6 to 0.8 for dam failure time estimation. In this study, artificial neural network (ANN) was recommended as an alternate method for estimation of dam breach parameters. The ANN method is proposed due to its accurate prediction when it was applied to similar other cases in water resources.																	0921-030X	1573-0840				MAY	2017	87	1					545	566		10.1007/s11069-017-2764-z								WOS:000399699100026

However, the related human disturbances and natural processes reflect a great complexity, which hinders quantitative Understanding. We here consider the Zaamar Goldfield in Mongolia, one of the world's largest placer mining sites, located in the Tuul River basin (upper Lake Baikal basin). A main study aim is to investigate relations between patterns of increased sediment loads along the Tuul River and the (spatially variable) area coverage of active or recently abandoned placer mines in the river vicinity. Specifically, we compare observed loads derived from nested catchment areas with the output from spatially distributed soil erosion modelling. Results showed that riverine sediment loads in mining areas reflect soil losses both from soil erosion and direct human impacts (e.g. waste water discharge), which are two to three orders of magnitude higher than the input from natural areas dominated by soil erosion alone. Notably, the sediment load contributions from the mining areas were insensitive to changes in hydrometeorological conditions, whereas contributions from natural areas were much lower during drier periods (as expected when governed by soil erosion by water). Accordingly, the relative contribution to the total sediment load (TSL) of metal-enriched soil from mining areas is likely to be particularly pronounced (with estimated values of about 80% of TSL) under drier hydrometeorological conditions. This is consistent with observations of considerably elevated metal concentrations under low flow conditions and implies that if annual average discharge continues to decrease in the Tuul River as well as the entire Selenga River system, increased metal concentrations may be one of the consequences.

The 3D ecological model ERGOM was validated and applied in a local set-up of the Kattegat, Denmark, using the off-line Flexsem framework. The model scenarios were conducted by changing the forcing by +/- 20% of nutrient inputs (bottom-up) and mesozooplankton mortality (top-down), and both types of forcing combined. The model results showed that cascading effects operated differently depending on the forcing type. In the single-forcing bottom-up scenarios, the cascade directions were in the same direction as the forcing. For scenarios involving top-down, there was a skipped-level-transmission in the trophic responses that was either attenuated or amplified at different trophic levels. On a seasonal scale, bottom-up forcing showed strongest response during winter-spring for DIN and ChI a concentrations, whereas top down forcing had the highest cascade strength during summer for ChI a concentrations and microzooplankton biomass. On annual basis, the system was more bottom-up than top-down controlled. Microzooplankton was found to play an important role in the pelagic food web as mediator of nutrient and energy fluxes. This study demonstrated that the best scenario for improved water quality was a combined reduction in nutrient input and mesozooplankton mortality calling for the need of an integrated management of marine areas exploited by human activities.

Many peatlands, such as those in the British Isles, Sweden, and Canada, have undergone increased erosion, resulting in degraded water quality and depleted soil carbon stocks. It is unclear how climate change may impact future peat erosion. Here we use a physically based erosion model (Pan-European Soil Erosion Risk Assessment-PEAT), driven by seven different global climate models (GCMs), to predict fluvial blanket peat erosion in the Northern Hemisphere under 21st-century climate change. After an initial decline, total hemispheric blanket peat erosion rates are found to increase during 2070-2099 (2080s) compared with the baseline period (1961-1990) for most of the GCMs. Regional erosion variability is high with changes to baseline ranging between -1.27 and +21.63 tha(-1) yr(-1) in the 2080s. These responses are driven by effects of temperature (generally more dominant) and precipitation change on weathering processes. Low-latitude and warm blanket peatlands are at most risk to fluvial erosion under 21st-century climate change.

However, there is a paucity of research that couples functional measures with assessments of ecosystem structure. In mid-sized and large rivers, effects of restoration on key ecosystem processes, such as ecosystem metabolism, have rarely been addressed and remain poorly understood. We compared three reaches of the third-order, gravel-bed river Ruhr in Germany: two reaches restored with moderate (R1) and substantial effort (R2) and one upstream degraded reach (D). Hydromorphology, habitat composition, and hydrodynamics were assessed. We estimated gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) using the one-station open-channel diel dissolved oxygen change method over a 50-day period at the end of each reach. Moreover, we estimated metabolic rates of the combined restored reaches (R1 + R2) using the two-station open-channel method. Values for hydromorphological variables increased with restoration intensity (D < R1 < R2). Restored reaches had lower current velocity, higher longitudinal dispersion and larger transient storage zones. However, fractions of median travel time due to transient storage were highest in R1 and lowest in R2, with intermediate values in D. The share of macrophyte cover of total wetted area was highest in R2 and lowest in R1, with intermediate values in D. Station R2 had higher average GPP and ER than R1 and D. The combined restored reaches R1 C R2 also exhibited higher GPP and ER than the degraded upstream river (station D). Restoration increased river autotrophy, as indicated by elevated GPP : ER, and net ecosystem production (NEP) of restored reaches. Temporal patterns of ER closely mirrored those of GPP, pointing to the importance of autochthonous production for ecosystem functioning. In conclusion, high reach-scale restoration effort had considerable effects on river hydrodynamics and ecosystem functioning, which were mainly related to massive stands of macrophytes. High rates of metabolism and the occurrence of dense macrophyte stands may increase the assimilation of dissolved nutrients and the sedimentation of particulate nutrients, thereby positively affecting water quality.

J	Choi, IK; Park, Y; Yu, JY				Choi, In-Kyu; Park, Youngyun; Yu, Jae-Young			Evaluation for reliability of groundwater quality in Korea	JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF KOREA												A few nationwide groundwater databases have been operated in Korea, but they have insufficient and lack-of-credibility water quality data. An appropriate groundwater management requires well equipped databases with reliable water quality data set. This study proposes theoretical and statistical criteria to test the reliability of water quality data. The theoretical criteria are prepared from the scientific reasoning, especially based on geochemical theories. The statistical criteria were set by the threshold values calculated from the Tukey box plot. Application of the criteria reveals that some of the data would be rejected and some others should be reevaluated. Approximately 24,000 dataset was extracted from http://www.groundwater.or.kr and used for the test. The water quality data within the threshold boundaries occupy 60.0 similar to 97.7% of the whole. The confidence range of the pH, ORP, EC, and TDS is 11.0 similar to 21.7 degrees C, 5.1 similar to 8.6, -121 similar to 218 mV (some correction needs), 0.5 similar to 565 mu S/cm, and 0.3 similar to 301 mg/L, respectively. The abnormal values outside threshold limits need to check if there is any determinated error in measurement. The main reasons for having abnormal values are probably incorrect input of the values malfunctioning of the equipments, and lack of the corresponding knowledge. To improve reliability of the dataset, it is necessary to follow verified instructions and guides to practice approach groundwater quality measurement and management, to provide regular training for the minimization of significant errors, to develop a database system being able to automatically screen abnormal values out.																	0435-4036	2288-7377				APR	2017	53	2					303	312		10.14770/jgsk.2017.53.2.303								WOS:000410116900006

We evaluated the statistical distribution and temporal trends of water quality parameters, their relationships with precipitation, the types of groundwater compositions, and the correlation between water qualities and land use. The results showed that nitrate-nitrogen had a statistically-significant positive correlation with precipitation, suggesting that anthropogenic contaminants above the ground surface would infiltrate into groundwater during precipitation. The groundwater at the study areas were mainly classified into Ca-(Cl+NO3) and Ca-HCO3 types. When the nitrate-nitrogen contamination was closely examined in view of land use, it was found to have a stronger correlation with precipitation in residential-agricultural areas than in forest areas. Notably, the concentrations of nitrate-nitrogen, ammonium-nitrogen, and chloride showed no obvious trends along the distance from burial areas to groundwater wells. All of the above results indicate that such environmental variables as land use may have a more prevailing impact on the water qualities around carcass burial areas. This study can be useful in designing the management plan and preparing environmental investigation manuals for the groundwater contamination that is suspected to result from carcass burial.

Groundwater in a karst aquifer near a selected dam site is deemed to be impacted greatly by the dam. This study uses the Kangir Reservoir of Iran as an example to illustrate the interrelationships of karst-groundwater condition, lithology of the dam reservoir, future climate changes, and overexploitation of water resources in the area. This study conducted a comprehensive analysis of water balance, groundwater flow, hydrochemistry, characteristics of geologic formations with respect to the quantity and quality of water, distribution of karst and evaporative formations in the catchment, and tectonic setting to highlight the importance of hydrogeological conditions on the water quality and quantity of the Kangir Reservoir. The main findings include, first, a major part of the highland karst aquifer in the Asmari Formation within the dam catchment does not drain into the dam reservoir. Instead, it leaks into the downstream Siahgel Region of the dam mainly along the Zarneh-Siahgel fault zone through the karstic Asmari Formation. Second, selecting the dam site on evaporative Gachsaran Formation causes degradation of water quality in the reservoir. The results of this study demonstrate that considering karst hydrogeological conditions is indispensable for dam site selection from the point of view of groundwater quantity and quality impacted by the dam.

Carbonate buffering and metabolic controls on carbon dioxide in rivers	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Multiple processes support the significant efflux of carbon dioxide (CO2) from rivers and streams. Attribution of CO2 oversaturation will lead to better quantification of the freshwater carbon cycle and provide insights into the net cycling of nutrients and pollutants. CO2 production is closely related to O-2 consumption because of the metabolic linkage of these gases. However, this relationship can be weakened due to dissolved inorganic carbon inputs from groundwater, carbonate buffering, calcification, and anaerobic metabolism. CO2 and O-2 concentrations and other water quality parameters were analyzed in two data sets: a synoptic field study and nationwide water quality monitoring data. CO2 and O-2 concentrations were strongly negatively correlated in both data sets (rho = -0.67 and rho = -0.63, respectively), although the correlations were weaker in high-alkalinity environments. In nearly all samples, the molar oversaturation of CO2 was a larger magnitude than molar O-2 undersaturation. We used a dynamically coupled O-2-CO2 model to show that lags in CO2 air-water equilibration are a likely cause of this phenomenon. Lags in CO2 equilibration also impart landscape-scale differences in the behavior of CO2 between high- and low-alkalinity watersheds. Although the concept of carbonate buffering and how it creates lags in CO2 equilibration with the atmosphere is well understood, it has not been sufficiently integrated into our understanding of CO2 dynamics in freshwaters. We argue that the consideration of carbonate equilibria and its effects on CO2 dynamics are primary steps in understanding the sources and magnitude of CO2 oversaturation in rivers and streams. Plain Language Summary Carbon dioxide (CO2) emission from streams and rivers is known to be large. The source of CO2 in these systems is of high interest to researchers because it provides important clues about the carbon cycle and the overall biogeochemical functioning of freshwaters. The scientific questions surrounding CO2 emissions from freshwaters have focused on whether CO2 is produced within the aquatic environment through the decomposition of organic material or whether CO2 is produced mostly in soil and groundwater and then delivered to freshwater environments where it is passively emitted to the atmosphere. Both explanations have a basis in reality, and yet neither fully explains the magnitude of estimated CO2 emissions. We examined how CO2 interacts with the rest of the carbonate buffering system to structure CO2 emission to the atmosphere. We found that daily cycles in photosynthesis and decomposition can create continuous CO2 oversaturation because of lags created through carbonate buffering. At the landscape scale, differences were evident in CO2 excess between watersheds having high versus low carbonate buffering. Our conclusions highlight that carbonate buffering is the primary control on CO2 concentration in surface waters and needs to be considered to understand the observations of CO2 excess in freshwaters.

DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF A PHYSICALLY BASED MODEL OF STREAMBANK EROSION FOR COUPLING WITH A BASIN-SCALE HYDROLOGIC MODEL SWAT	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												A comprehensive streambank erosion model based on excess shear stress has been developed and incorporated in the hydrological model Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). It takes into account processes such as weathering, vegetative cover, and channel meanders to adjust critical and effective stresses while estimating bank erosion. The streambank erosion model was tested for performance in the Cedar Creek watershed in north-central Texas where streambank erosion rates are high. A Rapid Geomorphic field assessment (RAP-M) of the Cedar Creek watershed was done adopting techniques developed by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), and the stream segments were categorized into various severity classes. Based on the RAP-M field assessment, erosion pin sites were established at seven locations within the severely eroding streambanks of the watershed. A Monte Carlo simulation was carried out to assess the sensitivity of different parameters that control streambank erosion such as critical shear stress, erodibility, weathering depth, and weathering duration. The sensitive parameters were adjusted and the model was calibrated based on the bank erosion severity category identified by the RAP-M field assessment. The average observed erosion rates were in the range 25367 mm year(-1). The SWAT model was able to reasonably predict the bank erosion rates within the range of variability observed in the field (R-2 = 0.90; E = 0.78).

EFFECTS OF SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF PRAIRIE VEGETATION IN AN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE ON CURVE NUMBER VALUES	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												The curve number (CN) method is used to calculate runoff in many hydrologic models, including the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The CN method does not account for the spatial distribution of land cover types, an important factor controlling runoff patterns. The objective of this study was to empirically derive CN values that reflect the strategic placement of native prairie vegetation (NPV) within row crop agricultural landscapes. CNs were derived using precipitation and runoff data from a seven-year period for 14 small watersheds in Iowa. The watersheds were planted with varying amounts of NPV located in different watershed positions. The least squares and asymptotic least squares methods (LSM) were used to derive CNs using an initial abstraction coefficient (lambda) of 0.2 and 0.05. The CNs were verified using leave-one-out cross-validation and adjustment for antecedent moisture conditions (AMC) was tested. The asymptotic method produced CN values for watersheds with NPV treatment that were 8.9 and 14.7% lower than watersheds with 100% row crop at lambda = 0.2 and lambda = 0.05, respectively. The derived CNs produced Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency values ranging from 0.4 to 0.7 during validation. Our analyses show the CNs verified best for the asymptotic LSM, when using lambda of 0.05 and adjusting for AMC. Further, comparison of derived CNs against an area weighted CN indicated that the placement of vegetation does impact the CN value.

EFFECTS OF IMPERVIOUS AREA AND BMP IMPLEMENTATION AND DESIGN ON STORM RUNOFF AND WATER QUALITY IN EIGHT SMALL WATERSHEDS	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												The effects of increases in effective impervious area (EIA) and the implementation of water quality protection designed detention pond best management practices (BMPs) on storm runoff and stormwater quality were assessed in Gwinnett County, Georgia, for the period 2001-2008. Trends among eight small watersheds were compared, using a time trend study design. Significant trends were detected in three storm hydrologic metrics and in five water quality constituents that were adjusted for variability in storm characteristics and climate. Trends in EIA ranged from 0.10 to 1.35, and changes in EIA treated by BMPs ranged from 0.19 to 1.32; both expressed in units of percentage of drainage area per year. Trend relations indicated that for every 1% increase in watershed EIA, about 2.6, 1.1, and 1.5% increases in EIA treated by BMPs would be required to counteract the effects of EIA added to the watersheds on peak streamflow, stormwater yield, and storm streamflow runoff, respectively. Relations between trends in EIA, BMP implementation, and water quality were counterintuitive. This may be the result of (1) changes in constituent inputs in the watersheds, especially downstream of areas treated by BMPs; (2) BMPs may have increased the duration of stormflow that results in downstream channel erosion; and/or (3) spurious relationships between increases in EIA, BMP implementation, and constituent inputs with development rates.

This paper attempts to investigate various factors and their influence on magnitude and extent of subsidence. The study was conducted in the Jharia coalfields, India where extraction of thick seams at shallow depths has damaged the ground surface in the form of subsidence. For precise pre- estimation of subsidence, it is therefore necessary to know the contribution of each factor to the occurrence of subsidence. In order to achieve the objectives of this study, several multivariate statistical techniques such as factor analysis (FA), principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA) have been used. Two factors were extracted using FA. Factor 1 and factor 2 account for 42.327% and 24.661% of the variability respectively. Factor 1 represents "natural factor" whereas factor 2 represents "subsidence coefficient". Spatial variations in regarding susceptibility to the subsidence were determined from hierarchical CA using the linkage distance. Further, the findings of this study would be helpful for prediction of magnitude of subsidence empirically.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				APR	2017	10	8							191	10.1007/s12517-017-2985-1								WOS:000400266200007						
J	Batabyal, AK				Batabyal, Asit Kumar			Hydrogeochemical processes and contaminants enrichment with special emphasis on fluoride in groundwater of Birbhum district, West Bengal, India	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The hydrogeochemistry of groundwater in rural parts of Birbhum district, West Bengal, India, has been studied to understand the contaminants and prime processes involved in their enrichment with a focus on F- concentration. The lithological units consist of Quaternary alluviums with underlying Rajmahal basaltic rocks of Middle Jurassic age. Groundwater occurs in the alluviums, weathered residuum and fracture zone of Rajmahal rocks. Studies show elevated concentration of Cl-, SiO2, Fe and F-; excess Cl- is attributed to anthropogenic inputs, SiO2 is ascribed to high degree of weathering of silica rich host rocks, and high Fe is due to the interaction of water with Fe-rich sediments under reducing condition. The F- concentration is found high (>1.20 mg/L) mainly in water from Rajmahal rocks revealing a lithological control on F- enrichment. The weathering of silicates and ion exchange are the leading controlling processes for major ions in groundwater. The F- enrichment is due to the dissolution of F--bearing minerals and perhaps also through anion exchange (OH- for F-) on clay minerals at high alkaline conditions; precipitation of CaCO3 favours CaF2 dissolution leading to elevated F- concentration. CaHCO3, the dominant water type, contains low F- while NaHCO3 and NaCl types exhibit high F- concentrations. Among the three spatial associations, Cluster-1 and Cluster-2 are CaHCO3 type; Cluster-3 shows NaHCO3 and NaCl waters with low Ca2+ and Mg2+ and high Na+ contents. Cluster-1 and Cluster-2 waters are, in general, drinkable barring the elevated Fe content, while Cluster-3 water is unsafe for drinking due to the high F- concentration.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				APR	2017	76	7							285	10.1007/s12665-017-6584-y								WOS:000399674700022

Serpentine geology links to water quality and heavy metals in sediments of a stream system in central Queensland, Australia	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Serpentinite soils, common throughout the world, are characterized by low calcium-to-magnesium ratios, low nutrient levels and elevated levels of heavy metals. Yet the water quality and heavy metal concentrations in sediments of streams draining serpentine geology have been little studied. The aim of this work was to collect baseline data on the water quality (for both wet and dry seasons) and metals in sediments at 11 sites on the Marlborough Creek system, which drains serpentine soils in coastal central Queensland, Australia. Water quality of the system was characterized by extremely hard waters (555-698 mg/L as CaCO3), high dissolved salts (684-1285 mg/L), pH (8.3-9.1) and dissolved oxygen (often >110% saturation). Cationic dominance was Mg > Na > Ca > K and for anions HCO3 > Cl > SO4. Al, Cu and Zn in stream waters were naturally high and exceeded Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council guidelines. Conductivity displayed the highest seasonal variability, decreasing significantly after wet season flows. There was little seasonal variation in pH, which often exceeded regional guidelines. Stream sediments were enriched with concentrations of Ni, Cr, Co and Zn up to 35, 21, 10 and 2 times the world average for shallow sediments, respectively. Concentrations for Ni and Cr were up to 60 and 16 times those of the relevant Interim Sediment Quality Guidelines Low Trigger Values, respectively. The distinctive nature of the water and sediment data suggests that it would be appropriate to establish more localized water quality and sediment guidelines for the creek system for the water quality parameters conductivity, Cu and Zn (and possibly Cr and Cd also), and for sediment concentrations of Cd, Cr and Ni.

Thermal groundwater contributions of arsenic and other trace elements to the middle Provo River, Utah, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Groundwater inputs can impact river water quality but are difficult to disentangle from agricultural, urban, and storm runoff. To better understand the multiple processes affecting water quality, we used major solute and trace element concentrations with continuous measurements of flow rates and specific conductance to track temporal and spatial changes in surface water and groundwater solute inputs into the middle Provo River, located in northern Utah, USA. Thermal groundwater was the most important source of major solutes and trace elements to the middle Provo River, with concentrations of As, B, Cs, Li, Sr, and Rb increasing dramatically (twofold to tenfold) downstream of thermal water inputs in the Snake Creek tributary. Snake Creek accounted for only 20% of the flow to the Provo River but increased the As concentrations similar to four-fold. Diffuse groundwater inputs, including thermal water, along the Provo River also contributed a measureable increase in solute concentrations. Mixing calculations indicate that groundwater contributed up to 10% of the total streamflow to the middle Provo River, causing an increase in thermal groundwater- derived trace element concentrations. In addition to natural groundwater inputs, water quality was impacted by anthropogenic trace and major element inputs from surface water tributaries. Nitrate, Ba, and V concentrations increased substantially downstream of agricultural/urban inputs. Specific conductance data showed that tributaries added solutes to the Provo River during runoff events, likely from the washoff of road salts. With evidence of both natural and anthropogenic inputs of trace and major elements to the middle Provo River, our study has implications for understanding water quality in complex coupled human-natural systems and demonstrates the influence of thermal groundwater inputs on water quality where such systems discharge.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				APR	2017	76	7							268	10.1007/s12665-017-6594-9								WOS:000399674700006

In order to prevent the expert judgments of the parameters weight that occurs when the Water Quality Index (WQI) method is used, the entropy method was used. Entropy and its weight were calculated, and parameters spatial autocorrelation was then determined. The spatial autocorrelation assessment confirmed the entropy theory results. The maximum spatial autocorrelation, minimum entropy and therefore the highest effectiveness rate on groundwater quality of Azarshahr Plain were found to be associated with bicarbonate. Using the entropy weighted WQI, the groundwater quality was classified into five categories: excellent, good, moderate, poor and extremely poor. According to the entropy weighted WQI, the groundwater quality of study area can be classified into "good'' to "poor'' domains.

Hierarchical approach to hydrological model calibration	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Hydrological models have been widely used for water resources management. Successful application of hydrological models depends on careful calibration and uncertainty analysis. Spatial unit of water balance calculations may differ widely in different models from grids to hydrological response units (HRU). The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) software uses HRU as the spatial unit. SWAT simulates hydrological processes at sub-basin level by deriving HRUs by thresholding areas of soil type, land use, and slope combinations. This may ignore some important areas, which may have great impact on hydrological processes in the watershed. In this study, a hierarchical HRU approach was developed in order to increase model performance and reduce computational complexity simultaneously. For hierarchical optimization, HRUs are first divided into two-HRU types and are optimized with respect to some relevant influence parameters. Then, each HRU is further divided into two. Each child HRU inherits the optimum parameter values of the parent HRU as its initial value. This approach decreases the total calibration time while obtaining a better result. The performance of the hierarchical methodology is demonstrated on two basins, namely Sarisu-Eylikler and Namazgah Dam Lake Basins in Turkey. In Sarisu-Eylikler, we obtained good results by a combination of curve number (CN2), soil hydraulic conductivity, and slope for generating HRUs, while in Namazgah use of only CN2 gave better results.

Uncontrolled flows from poorly constructed and uncapped artesian wells over the last 30 years have caused the deterioration of the quality of shallow groundwater and surface water. They also have been accelerating the discharge of saline water from deep aquifers and have caused the loss of shallow fresh groundwater resources through the downward percolation of fresh water to replace the extracted deep salty groundwater. A lack of adequate controls on the construction and maintenance of artesian wells is leading to widespread water quality problems in the region, which limits the ability of future generations to access high-quality water, a clear breach of the principle of intergenerational equity.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				APR	2017	76	7							291	10.1007/s12665-017-6610-0								WOS:000399674700028

This paper builds on a series of reports commissioned in 2012 (Water Climate Change Impacts Report Card [WCCRC], 2012) and published in a special issue of Progress in Physical Geography in 2015 that interpreted and synthesised the relevant, peer-reviewed scientific literature of climate change impacts on the UK's water environment. It aims to provide reliable, clear information about the potential impacts of climate change on hydrology and the water environment. We review new evidence since 2012 for historical and potential future changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration, river flows and groundwater levels, river and groundwater temperature/quality and, finally, aquatic ecosystems. Some new evidence exists for change in most of these hydrological components, typically in support of the spatial and temporal trends reported in WCCRC 2012. However, it remains the case that more research has been conducted on rainfall and river flows than evapotranspiration, groundwater levels, river and groundwater temperature, water quality or freshwater ecosystems. Consequently, there remains a clear disparity of robust evidence for historical and potential future change between the top and bottom of the hydroclimatological-hydroecological process chain. As was the case in WCCRC 2012, this remains a significant barrier to informed climate change adaptation in these components of the water environment.																	0309-1333	1477-0296				APR	2017	41	2					154	170		10.1177/0309133316679082								WOS:000400100500002

Stream-aquifer and in-stream processes affecting nitrogen along a major river and contributing tributary	JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY												This study assesses the spatio-temporal patterns of water and nutrient mass exchange in a stream-riparian system of a major river and a contributing tributary in an irrigated semi-arid region. Field monitoring is performed along reaches of the Arkansas River (4.7 km) and Timpas Creek (2.0 km) in southeastern Colorado during the 2014 growing season, with water quantity and water quality data collected using a network of in-stream sampling sites and groundwater monitoring wells. Mass balance approaches were used to identify temporal and spatial trends in flow, nitrogen (N), and salinity in stream-aquifer exchange. In the Arkansas River, percent decrease of N concentration along the study reach averaged 36% over the period, with results from a stochastic mass balance simulation indicating a 90% probability that 44% to 50% of NO3-N mass in the study reach (109-124 kg/day/km) was removed by in-stream processes between 1 September and 8 November. Results suggest that contact with organic-rich river bed sediments has a strong impact on N removal. A greater decrease in concentrations of NO3-N along the reach during the low flow period suggests the effect of both in-stream processes and dilution by inflowing groundwater that undergoes denitrification as it flows through the riparian and hyporheic zones into the river. In contrast, N concentration decreases in the smaller Timpas Creek were negligible. Results for the Arkansas River also are in contrast with other large agriculturally-influenced rivers, which have not exhibited capacity to remove N at significant rates. Results provide important insights across spatial and temporal scales and point to the need for investigating nutrient dynamics in large streams draining agriculturally-dominated watersheds.

Evaluation of groundwater quality in an untreated wastewater irrigated region and mapping-a case study of Avaniyapuram sewage farm, Madurai	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												The present study focused on evaluation of groundwater quality in Avaniyapuram Sewage Farm, Madurai. Totally, 45 groundwater samples were collected with different zones during pre-monsoon (PRM) and post-monsoon (POM) seasons, respectively. All the samples were analyzed as well as the various physical and chemical parameters like pH, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, total hardness, total alkalinity, and major cations such as, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, major anions such as NO3(-), SO42-, F-, and Cl-, and were compared with the standard guideline limits by WHO, ICMR, and BIS. Results indicated that the pH, EC, TDS, hardness as CaCO3, alkalinity as CaCO3, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, and Cl-, level in groundwater samples were above critical limits and it was found to be very high in the first 1-3-km range with epicenter of ASF. Box plot illustrates that seasonal effect slightly changes the order of abundance of both cation and anion. Hydrogeochemistry is studied to determine the ionic interaction for evaluating the hydrochemical processes. The correlation coefficient results illustrate that Cl- is strongly correlated with major cations and anions cause salinity. The geochemical data was interpreted using WQI in relation to drinking water quality proved that all the water samples were found to be poor and 60% of the samples are not suitable for drinking purposes and SAR, % Na, and MH shows that 50-60% of the groundwater samples were found suitable for irrigation. The results concluded that groundwater quality is 60% suitable for irrigation and poor for drinking; this may due to longterm use of wastewater irrigation.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				APR	2017	10	7							159	10.1007/s12517-017-2900-9								WOS:000399161100003

Assessment of spatial relationship between groundwater pollution vulnerability and quality indices in Kano, Nigeria	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Safeguarding groundwater from pollution is largely a global political decision. These decisions are basically supported by DRASTIC (D=Depth to water, R=Recharge, A=Aquifer media, S=Soil media, T=Topography, I=Impact of vadose zone, C=Hydraulic conductivity) analysis. Furthermore, water quality index (WQI) is an effective tool for groundwater quality evaluation and management. This study identifies the relationship between these two indices [i.e., pollution vulnerability index (PVI) andWQI]. The DRASTIC index of the study area was found to be from 60.4 to 178 characterized by very low, low, medium high, and very high vulnerability constituting of 12.88, 24.38, 34.11, 21.99, and 6.63% of the study area, respectively. In addition, the WQI of the area according to the analyzed parameters is between 10.19 and 55.63. It was established that a good correlation (61%) was found to exist between the two indices; which may be an indication that most pollutants present in the groundwater are likely due to anthropogenic activities on the land surface.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				APR	2017	10	7							168	10.1007/s12517-017-2897-0								WOS:000399161100012

Precipitation controlled spatial variations in groundwater quality indices-suitability for drinking and irrigation purposes in the basalts of South India	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Regional study on the impact of variations in input rainfall over groundwater quality and its suitability for utilitarian purposes is essential for its extraction and management. Water chemistry from 456 observations wells for 2007-2011 period in hard rock Basaltic terrain of Upper Godavari basin is supported with 8 field samples (in 2014) in this analysis. Based on mean annual rainfall (MAR), four narrow climatic zones are identified in the basin, defined as "humid" (MAR > 1600 mm), "sub-humid" (1600-1000 mm), "semi-arid" (1000-600 mm), and "arid" (MAR < 600 mm). NICB ratio (<+/- 10%), and anionic percentages demarcated the polluted areas from rest "good data", composing of 1818 samples. Hydrochemical facies are studied using Piper diagram, secondary alkalinity exceeded 50% and not one cation-anion pair exceeded 50%, and silicate-carbonate plot, arid zone nearer to silicate pole indicated the dominance of SiO2 in Ca/Na vs Mg/Na plot. These geochemical variations emphasize a detailed study on role of climatic gradient on groundwater suitability for different purposes, for groundwater extraction, and its management. Suitability of groundwater for drinking based on water quality indices (WQI) indicated 98% of the samples as suitable (WQI < 50%). TDS in humid zone is 150-500 and 500-1000 mg/L in rest of the zones with similar to 68% in permissible range, 15% as hard water (TDS > 600 mg/L) and not acceptable for drinking. Suitability of groundwater for irrigation is studied using sodium percentage (Na %), Wilcox diagram, sodium absorption ratio (SAR), US salinity diagram, residual sodium carbonate (RSC), permeability index (PI), Kelly's ratio (KR), ancd magnesium absorption ratio (MgAR). Na % in four zones is < 60% and permissible for irrigation. Very few water samples fall in "doubtful to unsuitable" and "unsuitable" category of Wilcox diagram. Region is observed to have SAR < 6, indicating that water would not cause any problem to the soil and crop. Humid and sub-humid zones belonged to C1S1 and C2S1 categories (low and medium sodium), while semi-arid extended to C3S1 category (salinity hazard zone) in US salinity plot. RSC for all the three zones ranged from 1 to 1.5 meq/L, with 90-95% of the area safe for irrigation. Out of 1818 samples, 1129 belonged to class 2 of PI classification (PI ranging from 25 to 75%) while rest 689 samples had PI > 75% (class 1). KR varied from 0.05 to 12.81, with 70-80% of the area having KR < 1. MgAR ratio ranged from 67% to 96%, with sub-humid, humid zones having higher Mg concentrations (increased salinity). Thus, 90% of the samples indicated non-alkaline water with 1% of normal alkalinity. Hence, the current study systematically analyzed the effect of precipitation and geology on groundwater quality and on its usability for various purposes. This stepwise procedure categorized the regions, and the same can be adopted for any regional hydrogeochemical studies.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				APR	2017	10	7							171	10.1007/s12517-017-2887-2								WOS:000399161100015

It serves to discharge treated waste-water of different types. In this work, the variations of the water quality of Wadi El Bey were studied and evaluated, during 2 years (2012-2013), using multivariate statistical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA). In addition, the similarities or dissimilarities among the sampling points were as well analyzed to identify spatial and temporal variations. The results obtained based on the cluster analysis, led to identify three similar water quality zones: relatively polluted (LP), moderately polluted (MP), and highly polluted (HP). The inorganic and organic parameters, temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, chemical oxygen demand, salmonella, and enterococcus, seemed to be the most significant parameters of water quality. Three factors were identified as responsible for the data structure, explaining 60.95% of the total variance. The first factor is the physical and non-organic chemical parameters explaining 23.48% of the total variance. The second and third factors are, respectively, the microbiological (21.26%) and organic-nutrient (16.2%). This study shows that multivariate statistical methods can help the water managers to understand the factors affecting the water quality.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				APR	2017	10	7							181	10.1007/s12517-017-2898-z								WOS:000399161100025

Solute transport characterization in karst aquifers by tracer injection tests for a sustainable water resource management	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Protection of water resources is a major challenge today, given that territory occupation and land use are continuously increasing. In the case of karst aquifers, its dynamic complexity requires the use of specific methodologies that allow establishing local and regional flow and transport patterns. This information is particularly necessary when springs and wells harnessed for water supply are concerned. In view of the present state of the art, this work shows a new approach based on the use of a LiCl based tracer injection test through a borehole for transport characterization from a local to a regional scale. Thus a long term tracer injection test was conducted in a particularly sensitive sector of the Egino karst massif (Basque Country, Spain). The initial displacement of tracer in the vicinity of the injection was monitored in a second borehole at a radial distance of 10.24 m. This first information, assessed by a radial divergent model, allows obtaining transport characteristic parameters in this immediate vicinity during injection. At a larger (regional) scale, the tracer reaches a highly transmissive network with mean traveling velocities to the main springs being from 4.3 to 13.7 m/h. The responses obtained, particularly clear in the main spring used for water supply, and the persistence of part of the tracer in the injection zone, pose reconsidering the need for their protection. Thus, although the test allows establishing the 24-h isochrone, which is the ceiling value in present European vulnerability approaches, the results obtained" advise widening the zone to protect in order to guarantee water quality in the springs. Overall, this stimulus-response test allows furthering the knowledge on the dynamics of solute transport in karst aquifers and is a particularly useful tool in studies related to source vulnerability and protection in such a complex medium.

J	Zhang, Q; Ball, WP				Zhang, Qian; Ball, William P.			Improving riverine constituent concentration and flux estimation by accounting for antecedent discharge conditions	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Regression-based approaches are often employed to estimate riverine constituent concentrations and fluxes based on typically sparse concentration observations. One such approach is the recently developed WRTDS ("Weighted Regressions on Time, Discharge, and Season") method, which has been shown to provide more accurate estimates than prior approaches in a wide range of applications. Centered on WRTDS, this work was aimed at developing improved models for constituent concentration and flux estimation by accounting for antecedent discharge conditions. Twelve modified models were developed and tested, each of which contains one additional flow variable to represent antecedent conditions and which can be directly derived from the daily discharge record. High-resolution (daily) data at nine diverse monitoring sites were used to evaluate the relative merits of the models for estimation of six constituents chloride (Cl), nitrate-plus-nitrite (NOx), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), total phosphorus (TP), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), and suspended sediment (SS). For each site-constituent combination, 30 concentration subsets were generated from the original data through Monte Carlo subsampling and then used to evaluate model performance. For the subsampling, three sampling strategies were adopted: (A) 1 random sample each month (12/year), (B) 12 random monthly samples plus additional 8 random samples per year (20/year), and (C) flow-stratified sampling with 12 regular (non-storm) and 8 storm samples per year (20/year). Results reveal that estimation performance varies with both model choice and sampling strategy. In terms of model choice, the modified models show general improvement over the original model under all three sampling strategies. Major improvements were achieved for NO. by the long-term flow -anomaly model and for Cl by the ADF (average discounted flow) model and the short-term flow -anomaly model. Moderate improvements were achieved for SS, TP, and TKN by the ADF model. By contrast, no such achievement was achieved for SRP by any proposed model. In terms of sampling strategy, performance of all models (including the original) was generally best using strategy C and worst using strategy A, and especially so for SS, TP, and SRP, confirming the value of routinely collecting stormflow samples. Overall, this work provides a comprehensive set of statistical evidence for supporting the incorporation of antecedent discharge conditions into the WRTDS model for estimation of constituent concentration and flux, thereby combining the advantages of two recent developments in water quality modeling.

J	De Caro, M; Crosta, GB; Frattini, P				De Caro, Mattia; Crosta, Giovanni B.; Frattini, Paolo			Hydrogeochemical characterization and Natural Background Levels in urbanized areas: Milan Metropolitan area (Northern Italy)	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Although aquifers in densely populated and industrialized areas are extremely valuable and sensitive to contamination, an estimate of the groundwater quality status relative to baseline conditions is lacking for many of them. This paper provides a hydrogeochemical characterization of the groundwater in the Milan metropolitan area, one of the most densely populated areas in Europe. First, a conceptual model of the study area based on the analysis of the spatial distribution of natural chemical species and indicator contaminants is presented. The hydrochemical facies of the study area depend on the lithology of catchments drained by the main contributing rivers and on the aquifer settings. The anthropogenic influence on the groundwater quality of superficial aquifers is studied by means of probability plots, concentration versus depth plots and spatial-temporal plots for nitrate, sulfate and chloride. These allow differentiation of contaminated superficial aquifers from deep confined aquifers with baseline water quality. Natural Background Levels (NBL) of selected species (Cl, Na, NH4, SO4, NO3, As, Fe, Mn and Zn) are estimated by means of the pre-selection (PS) and the component separation (CS) statistical approaches. The NBLs depend on hydrogeological settings of the study area; sodium, chloride, sulfate and zinc NBL values never exceed the environmental water quality standards. NBL values of ammonium, iron, arsenic and manganese exceed the environmental water quality standards in the anaerobic portion of the aquifers. On the basis of observations, a set of criteria and precautions are suggested for adoption with both PS and CS methods in the aquifer characterization of highly urbanized areas.

J	Kovacs, K; West, G; Xu, Y				Kovacs, Kent; West, Grant; Xu, Ying			The use of efficiency frontiers to evaluate the optimal land cover and irrigation practices for economic returns and ecosystem services	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Efficiency frontiers are a useful tool for governmental agencies that balance the protection of ecosystem services with the economic returns from an agricultural landscape because the tool illustrates that a compromise of objectives generates greater value to society than optimizing a sole objective. Policy makers facing the problem of groundwater overdraft on an agricultural landscape want to know if regulations or irrigation technology adoption will enhance both economic and ecosystem service benefits. Conjunctive water management with on-farm reservoirs and tail water recovery system is frequently suggested to alleviate groundwater and surface water quality problems in the Lower Mississippi River Basin of the United States, and this study evaluates the consequence of the adoption of this technology for the balance of ecosystem service and economic objectives. A compromise of objectives that maximizes the value to society provides 76% more value to society without reservoirs and 66% more value to society with reservoirs than the sole objective of economic returns. The reservoirs help an agricultural landscape maximizing economic returns to align more closely with a landscape maximizing the value to society, although there are still significant gains possible from finding a landscape that directly compromises on the objectives.

J	Hagemann, M; Park, MH				Hagemann, Mark; Park, Mi-Hyun			Capacity of semi-parametric regression models to predict extreme-event water quality in the Northeastern US	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												This study assessed the capacity of semi-parametric regression models to predict riverine solute concentrations during extreme high-flow hydrologic events, when such events are absent from the models' calibration data. Using a large dataset from 459 monitoring stations across the US Northeast, the models showed a tendency to overpredict extreme-event concentrations, with increasing bias and variance for increasingly extreme hydrologic conditions. The validation framework in this study effectively compared model performance across disparate hydrologic regimes and constituents, yet can be used to estimate individual model performance under an unobserved extreme-flow condition, regardless of whether any extreme-flow data are available for that model. The validation procedure can further be generalized to explore model performance in an arbitrarily defined extreme condition for a broad range of model types. Despite an overall increase in uncertainty for extreme-event concentration estimates, estimates under extreme hydrologic conditions could be improved by taking into account the observed bias in the aggregated regional database.

Sediment transport in steep forested catchments - An assessment of scale and disturbance	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Stream sediment loads (both bedload and suspended sediment) are problematic to measure due to the time and equipment needed. There is a dearth of such data sets globally let alone for Australia. However, such data are needed to quantify sediment transport type and rates, landscape evolution, effect of human disturbance as well as patterns and temporal response. Here we present the findings from 8 steepslope forested catchments dominated by headwater streams (size range 15-100 ha) in southeastern Australia where both bedload and suspended load have been measured over multiple years. The results demonstrate that suspended load is the dominant component and there is no consistent suspended to bedload ratio for the catchments. The suspended sediment to bedload ratio appears to be catchment specific. There was no relationship between total load (or bedload/suspended load) and average catchment slope, stream length, shape or any geomorphic descriptor. However catchment total load was found to be significantly related to catchment area. Of the 8 catchments examined here, 6 had been harvested for timber in previous decades (with large areas of forest removed) while 2 catchments had minimal disturbance (Control catchments). There was no difference in sediment loads from the harvested and Control catchments. The results demonstrate that although land disturbance had previously occurred the management practices employed in each catchment were effective in the long term. This provides confidence that the forest harvesting and subsequent management do not produce detrimental effects in the medium to long term. An assessment of erosion rates and likely soil production rates suggests that the catchments are eroding soil at the rate it is being produced.

The efficient and optimal decision-making on loading reduction is generally based on water quality modeling and the quantitative identification of nutrient sources at the watershed scale. The modeling process is influenced inevitably by inherent uncertainties, especially by uncertain parameters due to equifinality. Therefore, the emerging question is: if there is parameter uncertainty, how to ensure the robustness of the optimal decisions? Based on simulation-optimization models, an integrated approach of pattern identification and analysis of robustness was proposed in this study that focuses on the impact of parameter uncertainty in water quality modeling. Here the pattern represents the discernable regularity of solutions for load reduction under multiple parameter sets. Pattern identification is achieved by using a hybrid clustering analysis (i.e., Ward-Hierarchical and K-means), which was flexible and efficient in analyzing Lake Bali near the Yangtze River in China. The results demonstrated that urban domestic nutrient load is the most potential source that should be reduced, and there are two patterns for Total Nitrogen (TN) reduction and three patterns for Total Phosphorus (TP) reduction. The patterns indicated different total reduction of nutrient loads, which reflect diverse decision preferences. The robust solution was identified by the highest accomplishment with the water quality at monitoring stations that were improved uniformly with this solution. We conducted a process analysis of robust decision-making that was based on pattern identification and uncertainty, which provides effective support for decision making with preference under uncertainty.

Understanding the relationship between landscape characteristics and water quality is of great importance to improve water contamination prediction in unmonitored watersheds and for providing guidelines for watershed land use planning. In this study, five water sampling sites in the upper Dan River basin were established to monitor seasonal water chemical contamination over the period of 2000 to 2008. The relationships between land use patterns and water quality were analyzed across multiple-scales using redundancy analysis. The results showed that stream water quality variables displayed highly temporal variations, with electrical conductivity (EC), ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), and total suspended solids (TSS) all generally displaying higher levels in the wet season, while there were higher concentrations of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (CODcr), and dissolved oxygen (DO) in the dry season. The total contribution of land use patterns on overall water quality was stronger at the riparian scale than at the catchment and reach scales during the wet season. However, different land use metrics had different scale effects. Urban land had a higher positive relationship with degraded water quality at small scales than at large scales, whereas agricultural land displayed the opposite scale effects. Forest and grassland explained more water quality variations at the riparian scale than at other scales. Analyses of spatial development patterns suggested that size, density, aggregation, and diversity of landscape patterns were important factors impacting on stream water quality. The results provide important information regarding sustainable land use and landscape planning at multiple-scales that can be used to improve water quality. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Assortment and spatiotemporal analysis of surface water quality using cluster and discriminant analyses	CATENA												In this study, cluster analysis (CA) and discriminant analysis (DA) were used to assess the water quality and evaluate its spatial and temporal variations in South Florida. For this purpose, 15 years (2000-2014) data set of 12 water quality variables covering 16 monitoring stations, and about 35,000 observations were used. Agglomerative hierarchical CA grouped 16 monitoring sites into three groups (low pollution, moderate pollution, and high pollution) based on their similarity of water quality characteristics. DA, as an important data reduction method, and CA were used to assess the water pollution status and analysis of its spatiotemporal variation. It was found by the stepwise DA that five variables (chI-a, DO, TKN, TP and water temperature) were the most important discriminating water quality parameters responsible for temporal variations. In spatial DA, the stepwise mode identified seven variables (chl-a, DO, TKN, TP, magnesium, chloride, and sodium) and six variables (DO, TKN, TP, turbidity, magnesium, and chloride) as the most important discriminating variables responsible for spatial variations in wet and dry seasons, respectively. Different patterns associated with spatial variations were identified depending on the variables and considered season, however the overall trend of environment pollution problems was found from the low pollution (LP) region to high pollution (HP) region. It is believed that the results of this study could be very useful to the local authorities for the control and management of pollution and better protection of important riverine water quality.

Uncertainty and sensitivity in a bank stability model: implications for estimating phosphorus loading	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems is one of the most pressing water quality concerns in the United States and around the world. Bank erosion has been largely overlooked as a source of nutrient loading, despite field studies demonstrating that this source can account for the majority of the total phosphorus load in a watershed. Substantial effort has been made to develop mechanistic models to predict bank erosion and instability in stream systems; however, these models do not account for inherent natural variability in input values. To quantify the impacts of this omission, uncertainty and sensitivity analyses were performed on the Bank Stability and Toe Erosion Model (BSTEM), a mechanistic model developed by the US Department of Agriculture - Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS) that simulates both mass wasting and fluvial erosion of streambanks. Generally, bank height, soil cohesion, and plant species were found to be most influential in determining stability of clay (cohesive) banks. In addition to these three inputs, groundwater elevation, stream stage, and bank angle were also identified as important in sand (non-cohesive) banks. Slope and bank height are the dominant variables in fluvial erosion modeling, while erodibility and critical shear stress had low sensitivity indices; however, these indices do not reflect the importance of critical shear stress in determining the timing of erosion events. These results identify important variables that should be the focus of data collection efforts while also indicating which less influential variables may be set to assumed values. In addition, a probabilistic Monte-Carlo modeling approach was applied to data from a watershed-scale sediment and phosphorus loading study on the Missisquoi River, Vermont to quantify uncertainty associated with these published results. While our estimates aligned well with previous deterministic modeling results, the uncertainty associated with these predictions suggests that they should be considered order of magnitude estimates only.

A lab in the field: high-frequency analysis of water quality and stable isotopes in stream water and precipitation	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												High-frequency measurements of solutes and isotopes (O-18 and H-2) in rainfall and streamflow can shed important light on catchment flow pathways and travel times, but the workload and sample storage artifacts involved in collecting, transporting, and analyzing thousands of bottled samples severely constrain catchment studies in which conventional sampling methods are employed. However, recent developments towards more compact and robust analyzers have now made it possible to measure chemistry and water isotopes in the field at sub-hourly frequencies over extended periods. Here, we present laboratory and field tests of a membrane-vaporization continuous water sampler coupled to a cavity ring-down spectrometer for real-time measurements of delta O-18 and delta H-2 combined with a dual-channel ion chromatograph (IC) for the synchronous analysis of major cations and anions. The precision of the isotope analyzer was typically better than 0.03% for delta O-18 and 0.17% for delta H-2 in 10 min average readings taken at intervals of 30 min. Carryover effects were less than 1.2% between isotopically contrasting water samples for 30 min sampling intervals, and instrument drift could be corrected through periodic analysis of secondary reference standards. The precision of the ion chromatograph was typically similar to 0.1-1 ppm or better, with relative standard deviations of similar to 1% or better for most major ions in stream water, which is sufficient to detect subtle biogeochemical signals in catchment runoff. We installed the coupled isotope analyzer/IC system in an uninsulated hut next to a stream of a small catchment and analyzed stream water and precipitation samples every 30 min over 28 days. These high-frequency measurements facilitated a detailed comparison of event-water fractions via endmember mixing analysis with both chemical and isotope tracers. For two events with relatively dry antecedent moisture conditions, the event-water fractions were <21% based on isotope tracers but were significantly overestimated (40 to 82 %) by the chemical tracers. These observations, coupled with the storm-to-storm patterns in precipitation isotope inputs and the associated stream water isotope response, led to a conceptual hypothesis for runoff generation in the catchment. Under this hypothesis, the pre-event water that is mobilized by precipitation events may, depending on antecedent moisture conditions, be significantly shallower, younger, and less mineralized than the deeper, older water that feeds baseflow and thus defines the "pre-event" endmember used in hydrograph separation. This proof-of-concept study illustrates the potential advantages of capturing isotopic and hydrochemical behavior at a high frequency over extended periods that span multiple hydrologic events.

HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The design and evaluation of solutions for integrated surface water quality management requires an integrated modelling approach. Integrated models have to be comprehensive enough to cover the aspects relevant for management decisions, allowing for mapping of larger-scale processes such as climate change to the regional and local contexts. Besides this, models have to be sufficiently simple and fast to apply proper methods of uncertainty analysis, covering model structure deficits and error propagation through the chain of sub-models. Here, we present a new integrated catchment model satisfying both conditions. The conceptual "iWaQa" model was developed to support the integrated management of small streams. It can be used to predict traditional water quality parameters, such as nutrients and a wide set of organic micropollutants (plant and material protection products), by considering all major pollutant pathways in urban and agricultural environments. Due to its simplicity, the model allows for a full, propagative analysis of predictive uncertainty, including certain structural and input errors. The usefulness of the model is demonstrated by predicting future surface water quality in a small catchment with mixed land use in the Swiss Plateau. We consider climate change, population growth or decline, socio-economic development, and the implementation of management strategies to tackle urban and agricultural point and non-point sources of pollution. Our results indicate that input and model structure uncertainties are the most influential factors for certain water quality parameters. In these cases model uncertainty is already high for present conditions. Nevertheless, accounting for today's uncertainty makes management fairly robust to the foreseen range of potential changes in the next decades. The assessment of total predictive uncertainty allows for selecting management strategies that show small sensitivity to poorly known boundary conditions. The identification of important sources of uncertainty helps to guide future monitoring efforts and pinpoints key indicators, whose evolution should be closely followed to adapt management. The possible impact of climate change is clearly demonstrated by water quality substantially changing depending on single climate model chains. However, when all climate trajectories are combined, the human land use and management decisions have a larger influence on water quality against a time horizon of 2050 in the study.

J	Lu, CQ; Tian, HQ				Lu, Chaoqun; Tian, Hanqin			Global nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer use for agriculture production in the past half century: shifted hot spots and nutrient imbalance	EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA												In addition to enhancing agricultural productivity, synthetic nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) fertilizer application in croplands dramatically alters global nutrient budget, water quality, greenhouse gas balance, and their feedback to the climate system. However, due to the lack of geospatial fertilizer input data, current Earth system and land surface modeling studies have to ignore or use oversimplified data (e. g., static, spatially uniform fertilizer use) to characterize agricultural N and P input over decadal or century-long periods. In this study, we therefore develop global time series gridded data of annual synthetic N and P fertilizer use rate in agricultural lands, matched with HYDE 3.2 historical land use maps, at a resolution of 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees latitude-longitude during 1961-2013. Our data indicate N and P fertilizer use rates on per unit cropland area increased by approximately 8 times and 3 times, respectively, since the year 1961 when IFA (International Fertilizer Industry Association) and FAO (Food and Agricultural Organization) surveys of country-level fertilizer input became available. Considering cropland expansion, the increase in total fertilizer consumption is even larger. Hotspots of agricultural N fertilizer application shifted from the US and western Europe in the 1960s to eastern Asia in the early 21st century. P fertilizer input shows a similar pattern with an additional current hotspot in Brazil. We found a global increase in fertilizer N / P ratio by 0.8 gNg(-1) P per decade (p < 0.05) during 1961-2013, which may have an important global implication for human impacts on agroecosystem functions in the long run. Our data can serve as one of critical input drivers for regional and global models to assess the impacts of nutrient enrichment on climate system, water resources, food security, etc.				Lu, Chaoqun/A-6497-2012; Lu, Chaoqun/D-6694-2018; Tian, Hanqin/A-6484-2012	Lu, Chaoqun/0000-0002-1526-0513; Tian, Hanqin/0000-0002-1806-4091												1866-3508	1866-3516				MAR 3	2017	9	1					181	192		10.5194/essd-9-181-2017								WOS:000395412000001

Radon is present in areas with a high uranium and radium content, and it is the main contributor of the annual effective dose received by humans. The objective of this study was to evaluate concentrations of Rn-222 and the water quality of spring waters. Water was classified as calcium sulfated and sodium sulfated. Most of the water samples with high radon concentrations presented higher concentrations of sulfates, fluorides, and total dissolved solids. Rn-222 concentrations may be attributed to possible enhancement of Ra-226 due to temperature and salinity of water, as well as evaporation rate. In 100% of the sampled spring waters the Rn-222 levels exceeded the maximum acceptable limit which is proposed by international institutions. Aridity increases radiological risk related to Rn-222 dose because spring waters are the main supply source for local populations. The implementation of environmental education, strategies, and technologies to remove the contaminants from the water are essential in order to reduce the health risk for local inhabitants.																	2076-3263					MAR	2017	7	1							UNSP 12	10.3390/geosciences7010012								WOS:000410163000011

Numerous studies have been undertaken in the Krakowsko-Wielunska and Miechowska Uplands for over 40 years. As many as 246 springs were mapped in the 1970's and investigations have continued to the present. These have considered the type of spring, discharges, chemical composition of water, and spring surroundings including the species composition of habitats. The long period of observations has revealed changes of spring properties due to natural and anthropogenic factors. Only 38% of investigated springs maintained their natural character The majority were completely devastated and overwhelmed. Waste was found in more than 20 springs. Also a decrease in spring discharge of about 10-30% compared to the 1970's and 1990's was noticed. But there was no clear common tendency of improvement or degradation of water quality in the whole area. However the problem of spring water pollution still persists mostly due to agriculture activity and long distance air pollution transport. Interdisciplinary research and collaboration of scientists with local authorities seems to be the only way to solve the problem of spring water quality and adequate management of their surroundings. Results of the studies have provided knowledge and a basis for concrete management application.																	0705-3797					MAR	2017	40	1					38	46		10.18814/epiiugs/2017/v40i1/017006								WOS:000408520600005

Membrane bioreactor (MBR), integration of membrane and biological processes, is regarded as alternative method due to its high quality of effluent. Coagulants are often added into a bioreactor to comply with the rigid standard of phosphorus. Addition of a lot of coagulants have potential adverse effects on MBR performance such as membrane fouling and low removal efficiency. Therefore, this study attempted to investigate the impact on microorganism or membrane permeability when polyaluminium chloride (PAC) was added for phosphorus removal. In batch test, addition of PAC with lower basicity interfered with biological decomposition of organic matters. When the selected PAC with the highest basicity (71%) was employed in continuous MBR, the process showed stable TMP and high-quality treated water due to no negative effect on microorganism.

These conditions of Namgang Dam led to the growth of Salix subfragilis communities. Initially, they were distributed over small areas but over time, they rapidly proliferated to cover large areas. They generate large amounts of leaf debris particularly in the dry season, so that water quality could be deteriorated. And, in the flood season, they raise water levels by obstructing the water flow in tributary streams, this consequently leads to flooding damages. In addition, Salix subfragilis periodically undergoes self-thinning and the withered trunks and branches turn into driftwood. These problems pose difficulties to dam management. By the way, these communities began to wither in areas lower than the highest water level, after a long-term period of inundation in 2012. To determine the reason for the withering phenomena in this study, the relationship between water level(turbidity) and the withering of Salix subfragilis in dam reservoir was investigated, and the withering characteristics of Salix subfragilis communities were analyzed through aerial photographys and field surveys. Results of this study show that disruption of photosynthesis due to high turbidity during the long-term inundation is what was caused their withering.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				SPR	2017					79		70	74		10.2112/SI79-015.1								WOS:000403856800015

The thermal effluent is mixed with sea water and diffused to Youngil Bay. At the beginning of the 1990s, the thermal effluent affects brackish water zone of Hyeongsan River and Youngil Bay and becomes a main cause of red tide in this sea area, which starts to occur from January. Besides, the thermal effluent also affects coastal sea water quality and ecosystem raising the surrounding sea water temperature. In this study, we figured out the present circumstances and problems in the brackish water zone of Hyeongsan River estuary and Youngil Bay, which resulted from the thermal effluent in winter season. We also found out the cause of red tide on the basis of 8 measured categories on site, such as temperature, salinity, DO, COD, TN, TP, chlorophyll-a, and flow velocity, and performed a numerical analysis using the measured data to precisely investigate the occurrence mechanism of red tide. The results show that intrusion range of saline wedge in the lower layer of water depth is reduced in summer season because of increased river discharge, however, the river water and thermal effluent is diffused to Youngil Bay forming a typical estuary front with stratified condition. On the contrary, in winter season, a constant vertical density distribution, resulting from a strong mixing of the upper and lower water layers, is formed at downstream of the thermal effluent outlet. However, a thermohaline front, developing a less denser distribution than that developed in the strong mixing area, is formed at downstream of the strong mixing area. The formation of thermohaline front induces flow stagnation in Youngil Bay and subsequently obstructs river discharge to Youngil Bay. Thus, a mass of chlorophyll-a is bred by the thermal effluent and consequently a red tide.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				SPR	2017					79		174	178		10.2112/SI79-036.1								WOS:000403856800036

However, numerous accidents occur on the eastern coast because of the topographical characteristics of the beach, and most accidents are caused by rip currents. Additionally, in the summer, as many tourists prefer beaches near swash zones, exposure to non-point pollutant sources can occur, significantly harming the health of visitors. Enterococci have shown the strongest correlation to gastrointestinal symptoms in a study examining the relationship between swimming-associated gastrointestinal illness and microorganisms. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency found a direct relationship between the density of E. coli and enterococci in surface waters and increased swimmer-associated gastroenteritis. These reports suggest that E. coli and enterococci can be used as bacterial indicators compared to total coliform. Therefore, in this study, the safety of beach seawater was evaluated using E. coli and enterococci as bacterial indicators. Enterococcus and E. coli were isolated during the summer holiday season from the Gyeongpo Beach located on the eastern coast of Korea. The results indicated that the source of pollution near a swash zone, where people are crowded, was larger than that at the dry beach and near swimming zone.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				SPR	2017					79		249	253		10.2112/SI79-051.1								WOS:000403856800051

We also calculated the mangrove and central basin water areas and associated them to physico-chemical data to analyze them by means of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) due to high correlation among variables. Finally, we elaborated coded maps of each lagoon to represent the gradients of the variables with statistically significant loadings in either of the first two components accounting for 50 to 70% of total data variability.. In La Mancha, NH4, NO3 and RP but not salinity were associated with river outflows. In Grande and Chica, NH4, NO3 and RP were higher near the lagoon inlet, but the major river outflows was also in that area, confounding their actual source. Finally, NO3 were strongly associated with river outflows in Sontecomapan and El Ostion. However, the concentrations of tannins were directly associated with mangrove cover in the four lagoons. Our results indicate that the connection with the sea, the position of the inflowing rivers, and the morphology of the lagoon provides the "estuarine signature" of each lagoon.

It is important to revert this tendency and promote medium term studies that can help to foresee the unwanted effects, sometimes irreversible, of human activities on the environment. This paper includes results from hydrodynamic and water quality studies carried out in Petacalco Bay, Guerrero (Mexican Pacific) in order to present elements for future appropriate management of industrial outflows in the region. Around this bay theft are important rivers and small villages, a major port, chemical and thermoelectric plants, all discharging their (generally untreated) effluents directly into the sea. The results of this study show that the overall water quality is similar to natural concentrations found in the ocean. Nevertheless, eutrophization was found, associated with the fertilizer industry, and the hot water discharge from the thermoelectric plant generates hot plumes, which dissipate in the environment, despite the intense and variable hydrodynamic characteristics of the region.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				SPR	2017					77		39	50		10.2112/SI77-005.1								WOS:000403526200005

The multivariate statistical techniques were used in the hydrochemical evaluation of waters. Statistical analysis of water quality parameters was made to seeing the interrelationship between different variables in order to explain the water quality and pollution status of study area. For this purpose, water samples were taken from lake, river, stream, and springs which are represented by investigated area and water qualities were evaluated. Generally, Ca2+, Mg2+, and Cl-, HCO3- ions are dominant within surface water and water sources. Arsenic concentration increase is determined in Isikli spring and Kufi stream water samples. Also, aluminum concentration is high level in the Kufi stream water samples. This increase was related to igneous rocks as geogenic origin. Also, geogenic contamination was identified in R-mode factor and cluster analyses. There is high correlation between electrical conductivity and major ions of waters.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				MAR	2017	10	6							143	10.1007/s12517-017-2877-4								WOS:000396895200018

Evaluation of ground water quality contaminants using linear regression and artificial neural network models	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Contamination of groundwater is one of the major health concerns in the rapidly urbanizing and industrializing world. Since groundwater is one of the most important resources for the domestic, industrial, and agricultural purposes, the quality and quantity is of prime importance. Nitrite which is a reduced form of nitrate ion is one of the potential contaminants in the groundwater. The detection of nitrite ion is one of the laborious works and also it gets easily oxidized to nitrate ion and hence modeling approaches for the nitrite concentration will be one of the resilient quantification techniques. In the present study, the effective performance of the linear and non-linear models such as multiple linear regression (MLR), principal component regression (PCR), artificial neural network (ANN), and the integrated technique of principal components and artificial neural network (PC-ANN) is evaluated in the prediction of the nitrite concentration. The MLR and PCR showed better results either in generation step or in the validation step but not both. ANN shows better results in both generation and validation steps but the results in the validation steps, though good but accuracy is comparatively lower than the generation step. In the case of PC-ANN, the prediction of the model is found to be good both in the generation and in the validation steps. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency test clearly illustrates better performance of PC-ANN in comparison with other models in the present study for the quantification of nitrite concentration in groundwater.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				MAR	2017	10	6							128	10.1007/s12517-017-2867-6								WOS:000396895200003

However, the model had its own disadvantages in various aspects. In this work, several methods and the technologies have been introduced to improve on the traditional model. The type of the aquifer was replaced by the thickness of the aquifer, and the index of topography was removed. The indexes of the exploitation of the groundwater and the type of land use that reflected the special vulnerability were added to the system. Furthermore, considering the wideness of the study area, the fixed weights in the DRASTIC model were not suitable. An analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method and an entropy weight (Ew) method were introduced to calculate the weights of parameters. Then, the Spearman Rho correlation coefficients between IVI and the Nemerow synthetical pollution index (NI) of the groundwater quality were significantly improved, after the four steps of modification. The level differences with little gaps between Nemerow comprehensive pollution indexes and groundwater vulnerability occupied the proportion of the area from 75.68 to 84.04%, and finally, a single-parameter sensitivity analysis for the two models was used to compute the effective weights of these parameters. By comparison, the DRMSICEL model seems to perform better than the DRASTIC model in the study area. And the results show discrepancies between the vulnerability indices and groundwater quality as indicated by existence of vulnerable areas with bad water quality and vice versa.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				MAR	2017	10	6							144	10.1007/s12517-017-2885-4								WOS:000396895200019

To conduct this study the major ion concentrations, including HCO3-, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, SO42- and Cl- and water levels in ten water wells and the dam reservoir were measured during two periods ( June 2009 and June 2011), analyzed by factor analysis and plotted in water quality charts. The results of factor analysis show that most of the dissolved ions including Mg2+, Ca2+, SO42-, Cl- and HCO3-, particularly in 2009, were mainly originated from carbonate and evaporitic formations as well as from the playa lake ( Factor 1). In 2011, elevated salinity levels were found to be mainly related to intense evaporation during irrigation that are proportional to Na+ and K+ concentrations ( Factor 2) and depend on the type of crop and irrigation method. It was also found that the surface waters from deeper origins had less of an effect on groundwater recharge compared to upstream carbonate aquifers.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				MAR	2017	76	6							238	10.1007/s12665-017-6550-8								WOS:000398451000006

Short-term forecasting of saltwater occurrence at La Comte River (French Guiana) using a kernel-based support vector machine	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Saltwater intrusion into rivers is a major concern for freshwater exploitation and management in French Guiana (South America). To detect and analyse saltwater occurrence, a permanent station was installed on La Comte River to measure the electrical conductivity C. The objective of the present study was twofold. First, the temporal link between C, sea water level SWL and river discharge Q was explored during the dry seasons from 2009 to 2012 (total measurement duration of similar to 6 months). A lag of 3 h between C and SWL was evidenced (i.e. the C peaks are delayed by 3 h with high water conditions), as well as the co-occurrence of sea water intrusion with the low Q period. Second, a data-driven approach was set up through a kernel-based support vector machine SVM technique to forecast two events: (1) the forthcoming maximum value of C (for the next 3 h) exceeds 500 mu S/cm; (2) C exceeds 500 mu S/cm during more than 2 h. One potential drawback of such a data-driven approach is to fail to predict outside the range of calibration: this issue was thoroughly explored by means of an intensive bootstrap-based test exercise. It was showed that SVM has very high degree of predictive capability with accuracy and area under receiver operator curve above 90% in average. We additionally analyse the practical implementation of the SVM model with comparison to alternative popular classification techniques (logistic regression, random forest, linear and quadratic discriminant analysis): the SVM strength is to provide the nonlinear decision boundary without making a priori restrictive assumptions on its shape (like linear or quadratic methods) and without being too sensitive to noisy observations/outliers. Yet this strength can turn to be a weakness unless a careful examination of the shape is done from a physical perspective.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				MAR	2017	76	6							246	10.1007/s12665-017-6553-5								WOS:000398451000014

Reservoir dams are local for the accumulation of sediments transported from upstream. The amount of P release from sediments to water is potentially controlled by the retention characteristics of sediments. In this regard, 100 sediment samples were taken from surface sediments to determine the P retention capacity of sediments in Ekbatan Dam, Hamadan, Iran, and 15 water samples were collected from the interface of bottom sediments with lake water to determine different types of water P, including water-soluble P (WSP), dissolved reactive P (DRP), suspended solids P (SSP), and total P (TP). Firstly, some physical and chemical properties of sediments such as pH, cation exchangeable capacity (CEC), organic carbon (OC) content, equivalent CaCO3 (TNV), aluminum (Al) and iron (Fe) content were measured, and then WSP, TP, SSP, and DRP as well as P isotherms were determined. Moreover, three isotherm equations of Freundlich, Langmuir, and Temkin were fitted to the experimental data. Finally, the map of spatial variation of degree of P saturation (DPS) was plotted. The results revealed that the amount of DRP in water was at high level (0.02 mg L-1). The maximum adsorption in the sediments ranged from 83.93 to 634.13 mg kg(-1) that was significantly correlated with the physical and chemical properties of sediments, such as clay percentage, OC, and TNV. The equilibrium concentration of P at zero point was significantly higher than DRP. This demonstrated the release of P from sediments into water. P binding energy in the sediments ranged from 0.03 to 5.48 L mg(-1). There was a significant correlation between the binding energy and oxalate-extractable Fe, representing that the poorly crystalline or amorphous Fe would play a dominate role in the P adsorption under the slightly alkaline condition. The results suggested that the sediments not only had high P adsorption capacity and binding energy but released loosely bound WSP to water as well, which can cause eutrophication in the long term.

Suspended sediment transport dynamics in rivers: Multi-scale drivers of temporal variation	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												Suspended sediment is a natural part of river systems and plays an essential role in structuring the landscape, creating ecological habitats and transporting nutrients. It is also a common management problem, where alterations to sediment quantity and quality negatively impact ecological communities, increase flood hazard and shorten the lifespan of infrastructure. To address these challenges and develop sustainable management strategies, we need a thorough understanding of sediment sources, pathways and transport dynamics and the drivers that underlie spatial and temporal variability in suspended sediment transport in rivers. However, research to date has not sufficiently addressed the temporal complexity of sediment transport processes, which is limiting our ability to disentangle the hydro-meteorological, catchment, channel and anthropogenic drivers of suspended sediment transport in rivers. This review critically evaluates previously published work on suspended sediment dynamics to demonstrate how the interpretation of sediment sources and pathways is influenced by the temporal scale and methodology of the study. To do this, the review (i) summarizes the main drivers of temporal variation in suspended sediment transport in rivers; (ii) critically reviews the common empirical approaches used to analyze and quantify sediment sources and loads, and their capacity to account for temporal variations; (iii) applies these findings to recent case studies to illustrate how method and timescale affect the interpretation of suspended sediment transport dynamics; and finally (iv) synthesizes the findings of the review into a set of guidelines for a multi-timescale approach to characterize the sediment regime of a river. By recognizing a priori that study design and temporal scale have an impact on the interpretation of suspended sediment dynamics and employing methods that address these issues, future research will be better able to identify the drivers of suspended sediment transport in rivers, improve sediment transport modelling, and propose effective, sustainable solutions to sediment management problems.

J	Ahada, CPS; Suthar, S				Ahada, Chetan P. S.; Suthar, Surindra			Hydrochemistry of groundwater in North Rajasthan, India: chemical and multivariate analysis	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												This paper presents the hydrochemistry of groundwater of the northern districts of Rajasthan, India. Groundwater samples were collected from 50 sampling stations (rural and suburban areas) and analyzed for pH, EC, TDS, TH, NO3-, SO4 (2-), PO43-, Na (+), K (+), Mg2+, Ca (2+), Fe (2+), F(-)and Cl-. The pH varied from 6.54 to 9.51 in groundwater, slightly higher than WHO limit. The majority of sampling sites (80-100%) showed the high EC, TDS, TH and Na (+) contents in groundwater with an average value of 4.46 S/cm, 2856.1, 1774.4 and 426 mg/L, respectively. Na (+)/Cl(-)ratio was >1 in most of the sampling locations, which indicates the releasing of Na+ from silicate weathering. NO3- in groundwater ranged between (0.37 and 51.4 mg/L), and a few sites indicate an anthropogenic contribution of NO3- in groundwater. The F-in groundwater is a major issue in this area, and F-varied from 0.02 to 7.18 mg/L (with an average of 2.08 mg/L). Piper diagram identified Ca-Mg-HCO3 ([80%) and NaK- HCO(3)(-)as the dominant types of water of this area. The strong correlation between Na-Cl and K-Cl, Ca-Mg-SO4 suggests feldspar weathering in groundwater. Six components with a variance of 79% were extracted, which suggests cation exchange, rock-water interaction and anthropogenic activities as major factors affecting groundwater chemistry of this area. Water quality index of study area ranged between 178.58 and 944.8, and groundwater of about 58% of the study site fell under unsuitable for drinking category. The result of SAR analysis indicated the high Na+ content in groundwater (>10% sites), unsuitable for irrigation purposes. Langelier saturation index indicates that >60% sampling sites may have scaling problems due to excess CaCO3 in groundwater. Results suggest complex geological processes and anthropogenic pressure as major causes of deterioration of the overall quality of groundwater in this area.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				MAR	2017	76	5							203	10.1007/s12665-017-6496-x								WOS:000396208400016						
J	Khan, MYA; Gani, KM; Chakrapani, GJ				Ali Khan, Mohd Yawar; Gani, Khalid Muzamil; Chakrapani, Govind Joseph			Spatial and temporal variations of physicochemical and heavy metal pollution in Ramganga River-a tributary of River Ganges, India	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The River Ganges being the most sacred river and lifeline to millions of Indians in serving their water requirements is facing excessive threat of pollution. Under various river management and conservation strategies for its protection, the assessment of water quality of its main tributary Ramganga River is lacking. This study focuses on assessment of physicochemical and heavy metal pollution of the Ramganga River by application of multivariate statistical techniques. Sampling of Ramganga River at sixteen sampling sites was carried out in three seasons (summer, monsoon and winter) of 2014. The collected water samples were analyzed for physicochemical parameters and heavy metals. Results from cluster analysis (CA) of the data divided the whole stretch of the river into three clusters as elevation from 1304 to 259 m as less polluted, from 207 to 154 m as moderately polluted and from elevation 154 to 139 m as high-polluted stretches with anthropogenic as main sources of pollution in high-polluted stretch. Principal component analysis of the seasonal dataset resulted in three significant principal components (PC) in each season explaining 72-8% of total variance with strong loadings (>0.75) of PC1 on fluoride (F-), chloride (Cl-), sodium (Na+), calcium (Ca2+), magnesium Mg2+), bicarbonate (HCO3-), total dissolved solids and electrical conductivity. Temporal variation by one-way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) showed significant seasonal variation was in the pH, chemical oxygen demand, biochemical oxygen demand, turbidity, HCO3-, F-, Zn, cadmium (Cd) and Mn (p < 0.05). Turbidity showed approximately a twofold increase in monsoon season due to rainfall in the catchment area and subsequent flow of runoff into the river. Concentration of HCO3-, F- and pH also showed similar increase in monsoon. The concentration of Zn, Cd and Mn showed an increasing trend in summers compared to monsoon and winter season due to dilution effect in the monsoon season and its lasting effect in winters.

GIS-based FRASTIC model for pollution vulnerability assessment of fractured-rock aquifer systems	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												All groundwater is vulnerable to pollution, but the level of susceptibility depends on the spatial peculiarities of a region. Among the numerous vulnerability assessment methodologies, the geographical information system-based DRASTIC model is the most sophisticated and achieves reliable results even in complex areas. Fractured-rock aquifers are not only complex, but they are also potential sources of radioactive and other types of waste and are liable to high recharge rates. Hence, they can serve as a conduit for fluid (and potentially) contaminants. Therefore, in this study, a new parameter, 'fracture media' (F), is fashioned to replace the weakest parameter (i.e. depth to water, D) in the standardized DRASTIC model to create a new model (FRASTIC) for the complex fractured aquifer system. The proposed model was tested on a case study area (Kano, Nigeria), and the FRASTIC minimum and maximum indices obtained were in the range of 63-170. The region was characterized as having very low (covering 0.16% of the total study area), low (55.52%), medium (42.53%), and high (1.79%) vulnerability based on the standardized classification system. In addition, the modified FRASTIC model was further developed using the sensitivity analysis (SA) and recorded the highest vulnerable area coverage (32.86%) within Kano. Thus, the modified FRASTIC model is appropriate for the complex nature of the study area because it contributes appreciably to defining the vulnerable zones. The single-parameter SA was employed to obtain effective weights for two modified models, which were then implemented to improve efficacy. Conventional nitrate validation indicated that there is a strong correlation between nitrate and vulnerability for the modified models. In addition, a new approach for identifying the relationship between the water quality and vulnerability indices was developed by this study and was proven to be an effective validation tool.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				MAR	2017	76	5							197	10.1007/s12665-017-6520-1								WOS:000396208400010

Under the hydrochemical condition, the solar photocycle would result in changes of the water temperature, in photosynthesis and in iron photoreduction, which leads to substantial hydrochemical fluctuations, especially for heavy metals. It is important to consider the daily variations in water quality when developing a hydrochemical monitoring plan for an area with highly developed agriculture, such as the Tatun Volcano Group watershed area in this study. The results show that the water chemistry is highly complicated by both solar photocycles and hydrochemical fluctuations in the upstream area. Using principal component analysis, the contributions from the two factors can be successfully separated. During the daytime, the photocycle results in the formation of aluminum hydroxide, which can remove heavy metals from water. Consequently, the content of heavy metals, including As, Cu, Ni, Co and Ba, increases after sunset and can reach a maximum before sunrise, while Fe behaves inversely due to the photoreduction. The variation of As during a diel cycle can reach 97%. However, the content of most of the heavy metals during diel cycle is incomparable with those in the earlier studies due to the formation of aluminum hydroxide instead of iron hydroxide. The other significant factor, hydrochemical fluctuation, can explain the variation of major components in water including Cl, SO4. Rare earth elements (REEs) were also analyzed and can be an excellent natural tracer in this study. The distribution of REEs shows a depletion of light REEs and an even normalized concentration of middle and heavy REEs. It is theorized that the REEs in the water in this study derive mainly from the reservoir rock of geothermal water. In a hydrochemical monitoring plan, REEs can be an indicator for identifying an anthropogenic source.

J	Wu, JH; Xue, CY; Tian, R; Wang, S				Wu, Jianhua; Xue, Chenyang; Tian, Rui; Wang, Siting			Lake water quality assessment: a case study of Shahu Lake in the semiarid loess area of northwest China	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												A comprehensive assessment on lake water quality was carried out in Shahu Lake, northwest China, to provide valuable information about present lake water quality for decision making. Major ions, general parameters, bacteriological parameters, organics and trace metals monitored monthly in 2014 were considered. Monitored parameters were compared with quality criteria for surface water of China, and overall water quality assessment was carried out using an entropy weighted water quality index (EWQI) based on 20 selected parameters. Lake water quality was also assessed for irrigation purpose. The results show that the lake water is of Cl center dot SO4-Na facies with high salinity and COD. The geochemistry of the lake water is regulated by intense evaporation and human activities. TP, TN and F- are major inorganic contaminants, with over 50% of the water samples polluted by them. Oil, mainly attributed by leaky motor tourist boats, is the major organic pollutants in the lake water, with 10 samples (37.04%) showing higher oil content than the permissible limit. The concentrations of other inorganic and organic contaminants as well as trace metals are well below the permissible limits. The present study indicates that inorganic contamination in the lake water is more severe than organic pollution. The overall lake water quality, assessed by EWQI, is poor and very poor with SO42-, TDS, TH and Cl-being the dominant contributing factors. The lake water is suitable for irrigation in terms of alkalinity, but is unsuitable for irrigation from the salinity point of view. Accelerating the circulation and replenishment of the lake water is an important way of reducing contaminant concentrations. This study is important in providing comprehensive information on lake water quality for decision makers and valuable reference for international lake water researchers.

River-groundwater connectivity in a karst system, Wellington, New South Wales, Australia	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												The characterization of river-aquifer connectivity in karst environments is difficult due to the presence of conduits and caves. This work demonstrates how geophysical imaging combined with hydrogeological data can improve the conceptualization of surface-water and groundwater interactions in karst terrains. The objective of this study is to understand the association between the Bell River and karst-alluvial aquifer at Wellington, Australia. River and groundwater levels were continuously monitored, and electrical resistivity imaging and water quality surveys conducted. Two-dimensional resistivity imaging mapped the transition between the alluvium and karst. This is important for highlighting the proximity of the saturated alluvial sediments to the water-filled caves and conduits. In the unsaturated zone the resistivity imaging differentiated between air- and sediment-filled karst features, and in the saturated zone it mapped the location of possible water- and sediment-filled caves. Groundwater levels are dynamic and respond quickly to changes in the river stage, implying that there is a strong hydraulic connection, and that the river is losing and recharging the adjacent aquifer. Groundwater extractions (1,370 ML, megalitres, annually) from the alluvial aquifer can cause the groundwater level to fall by as much as 1.5 m in a year. However, when the Bell River flows after significant rainfall in the upper catchment, river-leakage rapidly recharges the alluvial and karst aquifers. This work demonstrates that in complex hydrogeological settings, the combined use of geophysical imaging, hydrograph analysis and geochemical measurements provide insights on the local karst hydrology and groundwater processes, which will enable better water-resource and karst management.

Partitioning and Transport Behavior of Pathogen Indicator Organisms at Four Cold Region Solid Waste Sites	JOURNAL OF COLD REGIONS ENGINEERING												Freshwater resources in rural Alaska communities, especially those underlain by permafrost, are particularly vulnerable to impacts from nearby waste facilities. The authors investigated the connection between rural solid waste facilities and transmission of pathogenic organisms into nearby water resources by evaluating the (1)prevalence of pathogen indicators E. coli and Enterococcus sp. proximal to cold region waste facilities, and (2)partitioning behavior of both organisms in a controlled snowmelt lysimeter test. Results reveal that E. coli and Enterococcus sp. preferentially attach to and migrate with soil particles in surface waters and are transported off-site during snowmelt runoff. Enterococcus sp. had higher and more sustained viability in cold environmental conditions than E. coli. E. coli and Enterococcus sp. were found in surface waters and soils in the concentration range of 0.7-3.5mean log most probably number (MPN)/100mLH2O.

Hydrologically-controlled leaching plots have often shown RBS to be effective at buffering nutrients and pesticides, but uncontrolled field studies have sometimes suggested limited effectiveness. The limited RBS effectiveness may be explained by the spatiotemporal hydrological heterogeneity near non -irrigated fields. This hypothesis was tested in conventional corn and soy fields in the St. Lawrence Lowlands of southern Quebec (Canada), where spring melt brings heavy and rapid runoff, while summer months are hot and dry. One field with a mineral soil (Saint-Roch-de-l'Achigan) and another with an organic-rich soil (Boisbriand) were equipped with passive runoff collectors, suction cup lysimeters, and piezometers placed before and after a 3 m-wide RBS, and monitored from 2011 to 2014. Soil topography of the RBS was mapped to a 1 cm vertical precision and a 50 cm sampling grid. On average, surface runoff intersects the RBS perpendicularly, but is subject to substantial local heterogeneity. Groundwater saturates the root zones, but flows little at the time of snowmelt. Groundwater flow is not consistently perpendicular to the RBS, and may reverse, flowing from stream to field under low water flow regimes with stream-aquifer connectivity, thus affecting RBS effectiveness calculations. Groundwater flow direction can be influenced by stratigraphy, local soil hydraulic properties, and historical modification of the agricultural stream beds. Understanding the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of surface and groundwater flows is essential to correctly assess the effectiveness of RBS in intercepting agro-chemical pollution. The implicit assumption that water flows across vegetated RBS, from the field to the stream, should always be verified.

Prediction and visualization of redox conditions in the groundwater of Central Valley, California	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Regional-scale, three-dimensional continuous probability models, were constructed for aspects of redox conditions in the groundwater system of the Central Valley, California. These models yield grids depicting the probability that groundwater in a particular location will have dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations less than selected threshold values representing anoxic groundwater conditions, or will have dissolved manganese (Mn) concentrations greater than selected threshold values representing secondary drinking water-quality contaminant levels (SMCL) and health-based screening levels (HBSL). The probability models were constrained by the alluvial boundary of the Central Valley to a depth of approximately 300 m. Probability distribution grids can be extracted from the 3-D models at any desired depth, and are of interest to water-resource managers, water-quality researchers, and groundwater modelers concerned with the occurrence of natural and anthropogenic contaminants related to anoxic conditions. Models were constructed using a Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) machine learning technique that produces many trees as part of an additive model and has the ability to handle many variables, automatically incorporate interactions, and is resistant to collinearity. Machine learning methods for statistical prediction are becoming increasing popular in that they do not require assumptions associated with traditional hypothesis testing. Models were constructed using measured dissolved oxygen and manganese concentrations sampled from 2767 wells within the alluvial boundary of the Central Valley, and over 60 explanatory variables representing regional-scale soil properties, soil chemistry, land use, aquifer textures, and aquifer hydrologic properties. Models were trained on a USGS dataset of 932 wells, and evaluated on an independent hold-out dataset of 1835 wells from the California Division of Drinking Water. We used cross-validation to assess the predictive performance of models of varying complexity, as a basis for selecting final models. Trained models were applied to cross-validation testing data and a separate hold-out dataset to evaluate model predictive performance by emphasizing three model metrics of fit: Kappa; accuracy; and the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC). The final trained models were used for mapping predictions at discrete depths to a depth of 304.8 m. Trained DO and Mn models had accuracies of 86-100%, Kappa values of 0.69-0.99, and ROC values of 0.92-1.0. Model accuracies for cross-validation testing datasets were 82-95% and ROC values were 0.87-0.91, indicating good predictive performance. Kappas for the cross-validation testing dataset were 0.30-0.69, indicating fair to substantial agreement between testing observations and model predictions. Hold-out data were available for the manganese model only and indicated accuracies of 89-97%, ROC values of 0.73-0.75, and Kappa values of 0.06-0.30. The predictive performance of both the DO and Mn models was reasonable, considering all three of these fit metrics and the low percentages of low-DO and high-Mn events in the data.

J	Elhaddad, E; Al-Zyoud, S				Elhaddad, Engy; Al-Zyoud, Sanaa			The quality assessment of pollution of Rosetta branch, Nile River, Egypt	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												The Nile River is the major source of water and soils in Egypt. Silt is the main soil component of it. The Nile is one of the international rivers; it passes through ten countries in Africa and is divided into two branches, Rosetta and Damietta at the end of the River. A hydrochemical facies study of the Rosetta branch was done. The geochemical processes which control the water quality and its suitability for drinking, fishing, and irrigation purposes were evaluated. Thus, the hydro-environmental status is studied. Fifteen water samples were collected for determining the physical and chemical parameters. The results show that several parameters are above the desired limits. High concentrations of total dissolved solids (TDS), electrical conductivity, total alkalinity, ammonia (NH3), electrical conductivity (EC), biological oxygen demand (BOD), chloride (Cl-), and sulfate (SO42-) were found. While a reduction in dissolved oxygen (DO) in the drains, especially Tala and El Rahawy drains, were noticed. In addition, residual sodium carbonate (RSC), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), sodium percent (Na %), and magnesium hazard (MH) were measured. The results show that the salinity values for the selected samples minimized their utilization for irrigation. The results indicate that the main geochemical process in the study area is cation exchange and evaporation which control the main ion distribution.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				MAR	2017	10	5							97	10.1007/s12517-017-2870-y								WOS:000396886700002

Weather whiplash in agricultural regions drives deterioration of water quality	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Excess nitrogen (N) impairs inland water quality and creates hypoxia in coastal ecosystems. Agriculture is the primary source of N; agricultural management and hydrology together control aquatic ecosystem N loading. Future N loading will be determined by how agriculture and hydrology intersect with climate change, yet the interactions between changing climate and water quality remain poorly understood. Here, we show that changing precipitation patterns, resulting from climate change, interact with agricultural land use to deteriorate water quality. We focus on the 2012-2013 Midwestern U.S. drought as a "natural experiment''. The transition from drought conditions in 2012 to a wet spring in 2013 was abrupt; the media dubbed this "weather whiplash''. We use recent (2010-2015) and historical data (1950-2015) to connect weather whiplash (drought-to-flood transitions) to increases in riverine N loads and concentrations. The drought likely created highly N-enriched soils; this excess N mobilized during heavy spring rains (2013), resulting in a 34% increase (10.5 vs. 7.8 mg N L-1) in the flow-weighted mean annual nitrate concentration compared to recent years. Furthermore, we show that climate change will likely intensify weather whiplash. Increased weather whiplash will, in part, increase the frequency of riverine N exceeding E.P.A. drinking water standards. Thus, our observations suggest increased climatic variation will amplify negative trends in water quality in a region already grappling with severe impairments.

Based on measurements at 46 sampling points in the study's coastal area in May, August, and October 2011, the seasonal and spatial characteristics of the chemical indicators and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) were analyzed. The chemical indicators for pH, chemical oxygen demand (COD), and reactive silicate (SiO3-Si) showed higher concentrations in the summer than in the spring and fall, whereas the nutrients of reactive phosphate (PO4-P) and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) presented complex seasonal characteristics under the combined influence of abundant nutrients from rivers and nutrient consumption by large algal bloom in August. Subsequently, two methods a fuzzy, integrated assessment and an organic pollution index were used to characterize the organic pollution. The trophic status of most coastal waters were oligotrophic and mesotrophic, and most coastal waters were clean in spring and summer, except in the vicinity of the harbor and estuaries, where the organic pollution index was generally high. Finally, Pearson correlation coefficients of various variables were analyzed, which demonstrated that, commonly, there was a significant positive correlation between COD and Chl-a. Because algal blooms in August changed the nutrients structure of the coastal waters, Chl-a, in a remarkably high concentration, had significant correlation with NO2-N, the atomic N/P ratio, and the atomic N/Si ratio. The algal bloom aggravated the current P limitation, and the atomic N/P ratio, the PO4-P concentration, and the COD can be selected as the three most-sensitive indicators of algal bloom in Qinhuangdao coastal water. These findings have provided scientific supports for local authorities who are taking measures to control pollution emissions and to prevent the recurrence of algal blooms.

Chemometrics such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Cluster analysis (CA) and Self-Organizing Map (SOM) were employed to identify anthropogenic and natural influences on estuary water quality. The scores of stations in the surface layer in the first principal component (PC1) were related to NH4-N, PO4-P, NO2-N, NO3-N, TP, and Chlorophyll a while salinity, turbidity, and SiO3-Si in the second principal component (PC2). Similarly, the scores of stations in the bottom layers in PC1 were related to PO4-P, NO2-N, NO3-N, and TP, while salinity, Chlorophyll a, NH4-N, and SiO3-Si in PC2. Results of the PCA identified the spatial distribution of the surface and bottom water quality, namely the Guangzhou urban reach, Middle reach, and Lower reach of the estuary. Both cluster analysis and PCA produced the similar results. Self-organizing map delineated the Guangzhou urban reach of the Pearl River that was mainly influenced by human activities. The middle and lower reaches of the PRE were mainly influenced by the waters in the South China Sea. The information extracted by PCA, CA, and SOM would be very useful to regional agencies in developing a strategy to carry out scientific plans for resource use based on marine system functions.																	2095-0195	2095-0209				MAR	2017	11	1					114	126		10.1007/s11707-016-0585-0								WOS:000394181200010

Using multiple watershed models to assess the water quality impacts of alternate land development scenarios for a small community	CATENA												Chesapeake Bay, the largest estuary in North America, is impaired by excess nutrient discharges, especially from urban and agricultural land. Watershed simulation models have provided key insights to understanding land -to water connections, but rarely are these models applied to guide local land management to explore and communicate uncertainty in the model predictions. In this study, three watershed simulation models; the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), the Generalized Watershed Loading Function (GWLF) model, and the Chesapeake Bay Program's Chesapeake Watershed Model (CBP-CWM) were implemented to predict water, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus discharges from small tributaries in the town of Queenstown, Maryland, USA. Based on our evaluation metrics, none of the models consistently provided better results. In general, there was a good agreement on annual average water flow between the SWAT and CBP-CWM models, and the GWLF and CBP-CWM models predicted similar TN and TP loads. Each model has strengths and weaknesses in flow and nutrient predictions, and predictions differed among models even when models were initialized with the same data. Using multiple models may enhance the quality of model predictions and the decision making process. However, it could also be the case that the complexity of implemented watershed models and resolution of our understanding currently are not yet suited to provide scientifically credible solutions.

J	de Oliveira, LM; Maillard, P; Pinto, EJD				de Oliveira, Lilia Maria; Maillard, Philippe; de Andrade Pinto, Eber Jose			Application of a land cover pollution index to model non-point pollution sources in a Brazilian watershed	CATENA												Non-point and point source pollution are a water quality problem in most parts of the World. Many studies have used the land use and land cover (LULC) to model non-point pollution sources. In this article we evaluate the relationship between LULC and five water quality parameters using different zones of analysis: riparian buffers (B) and exclusive contribution areas (ECA). The five parameters are nitrate, nitrite, total ammonia nitrogen, total phosphorous and dissolved oxygen. Analyses were performed on riparian zones of different widths and ECA5 to verify if the effect of the land cover on the water quality of the stream decreases with the increased distance. The urban and agricultural/pasture categories of LULC were characterized as pollution sources while vegetation (Forest and Riparian Forest) as pollution sink (filter). We proposed a Land Cover Pollution index (LCPI) which is a ratio between source and sink to substitute the individual LULC categories. The source and sink categories were selected considering our knowledge of the LULC relationship and the sign of the Pearson's Correlation Coefficient. The LCPI varied between 0.11 in the 150 m buffer (higher filter effect) and a maximum of 27.99 (largest source effect). Additionally, we transformed the water quality data in incremental loads per unit area so that each station could be considered independent from the others and be compared between themselves independently of the contribution area they represent. Our method also included only data from the rain season, the beginning of which was determined using the hydrograms of discharge data. Results indicate that the index is better than the individual LULC classes to explain this relationship, especially in riparian zones. In 12 out of 15 models the coefficient of determination (R-2) increased by 11 to 155%, when we use the index instead of the LULC classes. We believe that these good results can be attributed to the LCPI but also to the special processing of the water quality data making it more sound for statistical processing. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

River water quality changes in New Zealand over 26 years: response to land use intensity	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Relationships between land use and water quality are complex with interdependencies, feedbacks, and legacy effects. Most river water quality studies have assessed catchment land use as areal coverage, but here, we hypothesize and test whether land use intensity - the inputs (fertilizer, livestock) and activities (vegetation removal) of land use is a better predictor of environmental impact. We use New Zealand (NZ) as a case study because it has had one of the highest rates of agricultural land intensification globally over recent decades. We interpreted water quality state and trends for the 26 years from 1989 to 2014 in the National Rivers Water Quality Network (NRWQN) - consisting of 77 sites on 35 mostly large river systems. To characterize land use intensity, we analyzed spatial and temporal changes in livestock density and land disturbance (i.e., bare soil resulting from vegetation loss by either grazing or forest harvesting) at the catchment scale, as well as fertilizer inputs at the national scale. Using simple multivariate statistical analyses across the 77 catchments, we found that median visual water clarity was best predicted inversely by areal coverage of intensively managed pastures. The primary predictor for all four nutrient variables (TN, NOx, TP, DRP), however, was cattle density, with plantation forest coverage as the secondary predictor variable. While land disturbance was not itself a strong predictor of water quality, it did help explain outliers of land use-water quality relationships. From 1990 to 2014, visual clarity significantly improved in 35 out of 77 (34 = 77) catchments, which we attribute mainly to increased dairy cattle exclusion from rivers (despite dairy expansion) and the considerable decrease in sheep numbers across the NZ landscape, from 58 million sheep in 1990 to 31 million in 2012. Nutrient concentrations increased in many of NZ's rivers with dissolved oxidized nitrogen significantly increasing in 27/77 catchments, which we largely attribute to increased cattle density and legacy nutrients that have built up on intensively managed grasslands and plantation forests since the 1950s and are slowly leaking to the rivers. Despite recent improvements in water quality for some NZ rivers, these legacy nutrients and continued agricultural intensification are expected to pose broad-scale environmental problems for decades to come.

However, SWQM is costly and limited in terms of equipment and sites. The global popularity of social media and intelligent mobile devices with GPS and photography functions allows citizens to monitor surface water quality. This study aims to propose a method for SWQM using social media platforms. Specifically, a WeChat-based application platform is built to collect water quality reports from volunteers, which have been proven valuable for water quality monitoring. The methods for data screening and volunteer recruitment are discussed based on the collected reports. The proposed methods provide a framework for collecting water quality data from citizens and offer a primary foundation for big data analysis in future research.

These basins, situated between about 35 degrees S and 55 degrees S palaeolatitude, formed part of the East Gondwana interior rift, a precursor to the rift that 100 my later formed the Indian Ocean in this region. Timor lay near the main axis of the East Gondwana interior rift, whereas the Western Australian basins were marginal splays from the rift axis. The main depocentres developed as a result of faulting that was initiated during the Late Pennsylvanian. Detailed lithostratigraphic and biostratigraphic analyses have been made on the newly recognized Bua-bai limestone and the type Cribas Group in Timor, the Noonkanbah Formation in the Canning Basin, the Byro Group in the Merlinleigh Sub-basin of the Southern Camarvon Basin, and the Carynginia Formation in the northern Perth Basin. In Timor the succession, which is highly disrupted by faulting, was deposited under open-marine conditions probably in a shelf-basin setting. Restricted, very shallow-water seas flooded the Canning Basin and the Merlinleigh-Byro-Irwin sub-basins of the Southern Carnarvon and northern Perth basins and had highly variable oxygen levels and salinities typical of estuarine environments. A similar pattern of warming and bathymetric change is recognized in all studied basins. During the early part of the late Artinskian cool conditions prevailed, with water temperatures 0-4 degrees C forming sea ice in the Merlinleigh-Byro-Irwin rift. Rapid warming during the latter part of the late Artinskian was accompanied by maximum marine flooding close to the Artinskian-Kungurian boundary. Climatic and bathymetric conditions then allowed carbonate mounds, with larger fusulines and a variety of algae, to develop in the northern part of the rift system, and Tubiphytes, conodonts, and brachiopods with Tethyan affinities to migrate into the marginal-rift basins despite the generally adverse water quality at these depositional sites. Comparison between the stratigraphic record from the East Gondwana interior rift and coeval records from Lhasa and Sibumasu indicate a similar pattern of climate change during the Carboniferous to end Cisuralian. Similar trends probably are present in Eastern Australia although there is confusion over the correlation of some units. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

These extreme events can alter typical biogeochemical patterns in coastal systems. The extreme Elbe River flood in June 2013 not only caused major damages in several European countries but also generated large-scale biogeochemical changes in the Elbe estuary and the adjacent German Bight. The high-frequency monitoring network within the Coastal Observing System for Northern and Arctic Seas (COSYNA) captured the flood influence on the German Bight. Data from a FerryBox station in the Elbe estuary (Cuxhaven) and from a FerryBox platform aboard the M/V Funny Girl ferry (traveling between Busum and Helgoland) documented the salinity changes in the German Bight, which persisted for about 2 months after the peak discharge. The Elbe flood generated a large influx of nutrients and dissolved and particulate organic carbon on the coast. These conditions subsequently led to the onset of a phytoplankton bloom, observed by dissolved oxygen supersaturation, and higher than usual pH in surface coastal waters. The prolonged stratification also led to widespread bottom water dissolved oxygen depletion, unusual for the southeastern German Bight in the summer.

The present study provides a deeper understanding of the impact of seasonal change on the co-occurrence of As and F-, as both contaminants vary with climatic patterns. Groundwater samples were collected in pre- and post-monsoon seasons (n = 40 in each season) from the Brahmaputra flood plains (BFP) in northeast India to study the effect of season on As and F- levels. Weathering is a key hydrogeochemical process in the BFP and both silicate and carbonate weathering are enhanced in the post-monsoon season. The increase in carbonate weathering is linked to an elevation in pH during the post-monsoon season. A Piper diagram revealed that bicarbonate-type water, with Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ cations, is common in both seasons. Correlation between Cl- and NO3- (r = 0.74, p = 0.01) in the post-monsoon indicates mobilization of anthropogenic deposits during the rainy season. As was within the 10 mu g L-1 WHO limit for drinking water and F- was under the 1.5 mu g L-1 limit. A negative correlation between oxidation reduction potential and groundwater As in both seasons (r = -0.26 and -0.49, respectively, for pre-monsoon and post-monsoon, p = 0.05) indicates enhanced As levels due to prevailing reducing conditions. Reductive hydrolysis of Fe (hydr) oxides appears to be the predominant process of As release, consistent with a positive correlation between As and Fe in both seasons (r = 0.75 and 0.73 for pre- and post-monsoon seasons, respectively, at p = 0.01). Principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis revealed grouping of Fe and As in both seasons. F- and sulfate were also clustered during the pre-monsoon season, which could be due to their similar interactions with Fe (hydr) oxides. Higher As levels in the post-monsoon appears driven by the influx of water into the aquifer, which drives out oxygen and creates a more reducing condition suitable for reductive dissolution of Fe (hydr) oxides. An increase in pH promotes desorption of As oxyanions AsO43- (arsenate) and AsO33- (arsenite) from Fe (hydr) oxide surfaces. Fluoride appears mainly released from F--bearing minerals, but Fe (hydr) oxides can be a secondary source of F-, as suggested by the positive correlation between As and F- in the pre-monsoon season.

Hydrogeochemical studies were carried out in this area with the objective of identifying the geochemical processes influencing water quality and suitability of surface and groundwater for agricultural and domestic uses. Sixty-one groundwater and four surface water samples were collected from boreholes, dams and rivers and analysed for Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, HCO3-, Cl-, and SO42-, Fe-tot, PO43-, Mn-tot, NH4+, NO3-, NO2-. In addition, pH, total dissolved solids, electrical conductivity, total hardness, turbidity, colour, salinity and dissolved oxygen were analysed. Chloro-alkaline indices 1 and 2, and characterization of weathering processes suggest that the chemistry of groundwater is dominated by the interaction between water and rocks. Cation exchange and silicate weathering are the dominant processes controlling the chemical composition of the groundwater in the area studied. Mineral saturation indices indicate the presence of at least three groups of groundwater in the Vea catchment with respect to residence time. The meteoric genesis index suggests that 86% of the water samples belong to the shallow meteoric water percolation type. The findings further suggest that the groundwater and surface water in the basin studied are mainly Ca-Mg-HCO3 water type, regardless of the geology. Compared to the water quality guidelines of WHO, the study results on sodium absorption ratio, sodium percentage, magnesium hazard, permeability index and residual sodium carbonate indicate that groundwater and surface water in the Vea catchment are generally suitable for drinking and irrigation purposes.

The temporal trends from 1993 to 2012 in the concentrations of NO3-N and Cl from more than 3900 wells were estimated using the Mann-Kendall trend test and Sen's slope analysis and compared with the land use change trend for the period 1995-2009. The results indicate that the upward trends in NO3-N were associated with the expansion of agricultural lands, whereas Cl trends were considered to be affected by other factors in addition to the land use changes. In the mid-mountainous region, the deterioration in the groundwater quality by the both NO3-N and Cl was expected due to the continuous expansion of agricultural lands. In the lowland area, the NO3-N and Cl components showed different trends depending on the regions. In the eastern area, increasing trends in NO3-N were observed due to the development of new agricultural areas, while the Cl concentration was observed to decrease as a result of the regulation on groundwater extraction to reduce seawater intrusion. Our study highlights that a comprehensive interpretation of trends in NO3-N and Cl and land use changes for long-term periods can provide useful insights to prepare for suitable groundwater management plans in the whole island perspective.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				FEB	2017	76	4							176	10.1007/s12665-017-6466-3								WOS:000394965100038

Distribution of rare earth elements, thorium and uranium in streams and aquatic mosses of Central Portugal	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The distribution of 14 rare earth elements, Th and U was studied in streams of the study area at 21 sites. Aquatic mosses are known to accumulate even metabolically nonessential or toxic metals in concentrations much higher than their aqueous environment due to their unique morphology and physiology. Thus, the capacity of metal amplification in four aquatic mosses (Fontinalis squamosa, Brachythecium rivulare, Platyhypnidium riparioides and Thamnobryum alopecurum) was also evaluated as a potential bioindicator/biomonitoring tool. Thirteen REEs (0.001-2.81 mu g L-1) and U were detected in the stream water. Mean content of lighter rare earth elements (LREEs) was higher than that of heavier rare earth elements (HREEs). Fourteen REEs and two actinides were detected in moss samples, including Yb and Th which were below detection level in water samples. LREE uptake (0.17-12.2 mg kg(-1)) was greater than HREE uptake (0.02-0.78 mg kg(-1)) in all mosses. Uptake of LREEs was observed in the order: B. rivulare > T. alopecurum > F. squamosa > P. riparioides and that of HREEs in the order: T. alopecurum > B. rivulare > F. squamosa > P. riparioides. Mean U content (0.68-1.62 mg kg(-1)) in the mosses was found in the order: B. rivulare > F. squamosa > T. alopecurum > P. riparioides. Th content ranged from 0.4 to 2.36 mg kg(-1) in the order: B. rivulare > T. alopecurum > P. riparioides > F. squamosa. One-way ANOVA indicated a statistically significant difference (P <= 0.01) in mean concentrations of all elements (individually) in moss samples except for U. Highest bioconcentration factors of six REEs each were observed in B. rivulare (La, Ce, Sm, Eu, Tb and Dy) and T. alopecurum (Nd, Gd, Ho, Er, Tm and Lu). The highest BCFs for Pr and U were obtained in F. squamosa and P. riparioides, respectively. These species hold promise for biomonitoring studies in the future.

Germany does not face a significant water shortage problem, but it has three main challenges: protection of water quality, ensuring public water supply and public wastewater disposal, and protecting the public and infrastructure from floods. Capacity development is a key issue to overcome the challenges of water resources in any country including Germany. Engineers, technicians, and mechanics need to upgrade their knowledge on a regular basis to deal with the complex management and rapid technological developments. In order to create efficient training schemes, the Vocational Training Working Group of Global Water Partnership (GWP), part of the GWP Capacity Development Task Force, has worked on the definition of fundamental job profiles for the Water and Sanitation Sector (WASS). To cover all technical functions of the industrial water cycle, it was necessary to identify around thirty occupations. Then, a competence-based training approach was adopted. Additionally, an assessment approach was also developed based on comparing the level of competence of the workers to a standard level of competence for each job. The RWTH Aachen University with its partners have developed another game based approach (SeCom2.0) based on serious gaming technology to enable water professionals dealing with flood risk management to be trained on different flood situations in a virtual environment. SeCom2.0 has three main components that are connected by a database layer. In addition to the serious games component, there is a collaboration component and a learning management system. For nearly 100 members from the flood competence centre (HochwasserKompetenzCentrum) in Cologne, Germany gave input to simulate the real flooding scenarios, and the learners will have to deal with a flood scenario by protecting the city in a given time and using a given resources and tools. This work concluded that both competence-based and game-based approaches could be significantly improved by blending both approaches. This will improve the process of training; for example, the competence-based approach can be enriched by using game- based simulation by introducing the trainees to a simulation of different technologies in water utilities. This can save resources and money and enrich the training. More importantly is modifying the game-based approach using the approach of competence-based to focus on specific competencies and to make use of the competence standards in its assessment component. The first section of this introduces and categorizes water challenges in Germany. In the second and third section, the two approaches are introduced in details. The competence-based approach is introduced to the WASS while the games-based to the flood risk management. Finally, a conclusion and recommendations are illustrated.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				FEB	2017	76	3							131	10.1007/s12665-017-6416-0								WOS:000394967300011

Four distinct DOM components were identified: two main components regarding terrestrial humic-like materials (C1 and C2), one about terrestrial fulvic/humic-like materials (C3), and one related to autochthonous tryptophanlike materials (C4). The dominance of terrestrial fluorescence materials in DOM indicated that terrestrial inputs have critical effects on the surveyed lakes. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Canonical Corresponding Analysis (CCA) were applied to analyze DOM components and their relationship with the environmental variables. PCA graphs showed that there were spatial differences in DOM fluorophores among lakes with various environments. Components C1, C2, and C4 were correlated positively with PC1 axis (factor 1), while C3 was opposite. Component C1 and C3 showed positive correlations with PC2 axis (factor 2). The CCA and Pearson correlation analysis showed that sediment DOC was correlated significantly with sediment variables (TN, OM, and conductivity), water quality variables (TN, PO43-, and Chl a), and DOM components C1 and C3. All DOM components were related significantly to different environment variables, including water quality variables especially nutrient elements (NO3-, TN, Chl a, and DOC) and sediment variables (OM, NH4+, and HCl-P). The relationship between DOC and the lake comprehensive nutritive index TLI was marginally significant.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				FEB	2017	76	4							142	10.1007/s12665-017-6427-x								WOS:000394965100004

Hydrological and environmental controls of the stream nitrate concentration and flux in a small agricultural watershed	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Nitrate exports from diffuse sources constitute a major cause of eutrophication and episodic acidification in inland aquatic systems, and remedial action requires the identification of the influencing factors associated with these nitrate exports. This paper examines the combined effects of watershed complexity on nitrate concentration and flux in terms of the hydrological and environmental factors in heterogeneous nested subwatersheds in the Danjiangkou Reservoir Area (DRA), China. We established 15 sampling sites in the main stream and tributaries and conducted biweekly sampling in 2008-2012 to monitor the nitrate exports. The hydrological and environmental indices within the watershed were divided into sub watersheds and considered as potential influencing factors. In consideration of the high co-linearity of these influencing factors, we used partial least squares regression (PLSR) to determine the associations between the stream nitrate concentration or flux and 26 selected watershed characteristics. The number of components was unequal for the nitrate concentration and flux models. The optimal models explained 66.4%, 60.0% and 59.9% of the variability in nitrate concentration and 74.7%, 67.1% and 58.0% of the variability in nitrate flux annually, in the dry season, and in the wet season, respectively. According to the variable importance in the projection (VIP) values, the dominant first-order factors for the nitrate concentration were as follows: the areal percentages of agricultural, forest and residential areas; followed by the slope; the largest patch index (LPI); the flow path gradient (FPG); the slope gradient variance (SGV); and the splitting index (SPLIT). In addition to these factors, the runoff coefficient (RC), flashiness index (FI), and patch density (PD) affected the changes in the nitrate flux. This study illustrates the influence of hydrological and environmental factors on seasonal water quality and can serve as guidelines for better watershed modeling and effective water quality management.

Infiltration capacity of roadside filter strips with non-uniform overland flow	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The side slope to a roadside swale (drainage ditch) constitutes a filter strip that has potential for infiltration of road runoff, thereby serving as a stormwater quantity and quality control mechanism. A total of thirty-two tests were performed during three seasons in four different highways located in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, MN to analyze the infiltration performance of roadside filter strips and the effect of fractional coverage of water on infiltration. Three different application rates were used in the experiments. All the tests showed that water flow on the lateral slope of a roadside swale is concentrated in fingers, instead of sheet flow, at the typical road runoff intensities for which infiltration practices are utilized to improve surface water quality. A linear relationship between flux of water from the road and fraction of wetted surface was observed, for the intensities tested. The average percentage infiltration of the medium road runoff rate (1.55 x 10(-4) m(2)/s, without direct rainfall) experiments performed in fall was 85% and in spring 70%. For the high road runoff rate (3.1 x 10(-4) m(2)/s, without direct rainfall) tests the average amount of water infiltrated was 47% and for the low road runoff rate (7.76 x 10(-5) m(2)/s, without direct rainfall) tests it was 69%, both set of tests performed in spring and summer. The saturated hydraulic conductivity of swale soil was high, relative to the values typical of laboratory permeameter measurements for these types of soils. This is believed to be due to the macropores generated by vegetation roots, activity of macrofauna (e.g. earthworms), and construction/maintenance procedures. The trend was to have more infiltration when the saturated hydraulic conductivity was higher and for a greater side slope length, as expected. The vegetation, type of soil and length of the side slope are important to consider for constructing and maintaining roadside swales that will be efficient as stormwater control measures. These measurements indicate that the filter strip portion of a roadside swale typically infiltrates a substantial fraction of road runoff. However, the measurements do not incorporate the influence of direct rainfall upon the infiltration into filter strips. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	McGrane, SJ; Hutchins, MG; Miller, JD; Bussi, G; Kjeldsen, TR; Loewenthal, M				McGrane, Scott J.; Hutchins, Michael G.; Miller, James D.; Bussi, Gianbattista; Kjeldsen, Thomas R.; Loewenthal, Matt			During a winter of storms in a small UK catchment, hydrology and water quality responses follow a clear rural-urban gradient	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												This paper presents the hydrological and water quality response from a series of extreme storm events that passed across the UK during the winter of 2013/2014, in an experimental catchment with a strong rural-urban gradient across four nested sub-catchment areas. The Ray catchment in the upper Thames basin, UK, was extensively monitored using in-situ, high-resolution (15 min) flow and water quality instrumentation. Dissolved oxygen, ammonium, turbidity and specific conductivity are used to characterise the water quality dynamics. The impact of the Swindon sewage treatment works (SSTW) on water chemistry at the catchment outlet is considerable. Hydrological and water-quality response varies considerably during the events, with the rural catchments exhibiting a much slower hydrological response compared to urban areas. A simple hydrological model (TETIS) was developed to provide insight into water sources in nested subcatchments, highlighting the disparity of the hydrological dynamics across contrasting land-uses during events. The variation in stormwater runoff sources impacts water quality signals with urban sites contributing to dilution dynamics in ammonium, whereas the more rural site experiences a peak in ammonium during the same event. Dissolved oxygen concentrations vary on a rural-urban gradient and experience a notable sag at the Water Eaton outlet (4.4 mg/I) during the events, that would have resulted in significant ecological harm had they occurred during the summer in warmer temperatures. The water-quality legacy of these storms in the wider context of the hydrological year is somewhat negligible, with markedly poorer water quality signals being observed during the summer months of 2014. Although ammonium concentrations during the events are elevated (above the 'good' status threshold under the WFD), higher values are observed during spring and summer months. The high flows actually appear to flush contaminants out of the Ray and its subcatchments, though the urban sites demonstrate a resupply dynamic during interim dry periods. Data suggest winter storms following dry spells in urban catchments cause some short-lived and spatially extensive deteriorations in water quality. More chronic effects, although prolonged, are only seen downstream of SSTW. These are indicative of capacity of infrastructure being reached, and from the data do not appear to be severe enough to cause ecological harm. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Two SWAT models were created over two discrete time periods (1981-1990 and 2005-2014) for each watershed. National Land Cover Datasets 1992 and 2011 were, respectively, ingested into 1981-1990 and 2005-2014 models, along with corresponding weather data, to enable comparison of annual and seasonal runoff, soil water content, evapotranspiration (ET), water yield, and percolation between these two decades. Simulation results based on the calibrated models showed that surface runoff, soil water content, water yield, and percolation increased in all three watersheds. Elevated ET was also apparent, except in Skunk Creek watershed. Differences in annual water balance components appeared to follow changes in land use more closely than variation in precipitation amounts, although seasonal variation in precipitation was reflected in seasonal surface runoff. Subbasin-scale spatial analyses revealed noticeable increases in water balance components mostly in downstream parts of Bad River and Skunk Creek watersheds, and the western part of Upper Big Sioux River watershed. Results presented in this study provide some insight into recent changes in hydrological processes in South Dakota watersheds.

J	Radcliffe, DE; Mukundan, R				Radcliffe, D. E.; Mukundan, R.			PRISM vs. CFSR Precipitation Data Effects on Calibration and Validation of SWAT Models	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Precipitation is one of the most important drivers in watershed models. Our objective was to compare two sources of interpolated precipitation data in terms of their effect on calibration and validation of two Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) models. One model was a suburban watershed in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia. The precipitation sources were Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) data on a 4-km grid and climate forecast system reanalysis (CFSR) data on a 38-km grid. The PRISM data resulted in a better fit to the calibration data (Nash Sutcliffe efficiency [NSE]=0.64, Kling-Gupta efficiency [KGE]=0.74, p-factor=0.84, and r-factor=0.43) than the CFSR data (NSE=0.47, KGE=0.53, p-factor=0.67, and r-factor=0.39). Validation results were similar. Sensitive parameters were similar in both the PRISM and CFSR models, but fitted values indicated more rapid groundwater flow to the streams with the PRISM data. The same comparison was made in the Big Creek watershed located approximately 1,000km away, in central Louisiana. Results were similar with a more responsive groundwater system indicating PRISM data may produce better predictions of streamflow because of a more accurate estimate of rainfall within a watershed or because of a denser grid. Our study implies PRISM is providing a better estimate than CFSR of precipitation within a watershed when rain gauge data are not available, resulting in more accurate simulations of streamflows at the watershed outlet.

Testing of the Modified Streambank Erosion and Instream Phosphorus Routines for the SWAT Model	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												In some watersheds, streambanks are a source of two major pollutants, phosphorus (P) and sediment. P originating from both uplands and streambanks can be transported and stored indefinitely on floodplains, streambanks, and in closed depressions near the stream. The objectives of this study were to (1) test the modified streambank erosion and instream P routines for the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model in the Barren Fork Creek watershed in northeast Oklahoma, (2) predict P in the watershed with and without streambank-derived P, and (3) determine the significance of streambank erosion P relative to overland P sources. Measured streambank and channel parameters were incorporated into a flow-calibrated SWAT model and used to estimate streambank erosion and P for the Barren Fork Creek using modified streambank erosion and instream P routines. The predicted reach-weighted streambank erosion was 40kg/m vs. the measured 42kg/m. Streambank erosion contributed 47% of the total P to the Barren Fork Creek and improved P predictions compared to observed data, especially during the high-flow events. Of the total P entering the stream system, approximately 65% was removed via the watershed outlet and 35% was stored in the floodplain and stream system. This study successfully applied the SWAT model's modified streambank erosion and instream P routines and demonstrated that streambank-derived P can improve P modeling at the watershed scale.

It is expected to improve code development and maintenance; support data availability, analysis, and visualization; and enhance the model's capabilities in terms of the spatial representation of elements and processes within watersheds. The most important change is the implementation of landscape units and flow and pollutant routing across the landscape. Also, SWAT+ offers more flexibility than SWAT in defining management schedules, routing constituents, and connecting managed flow systems to the natural stream network. To test the basic hydrologic function of SWAT+, it was applied to the Little River Experimental Watershed (Georgia) without enhanced overland routing and compared with previous models. SWAT+ gave similar results and inaccuracies as these models did for streamflow and water balance. Taking full advantage of the new capabilities of SWAT+ regarding watershed discretization and landscape and river interactions is expected to improve simulations in future studies. While many capabilities of SWAT have already been enhanced in SWAT+ and new capabilities have been added, the model will continue to evolve in response to advancements in scientific knowledge and the demands of the growing worldwide user community.

Estimation of Catchment Nutrient Loads in New Zealand Using Monthly Water Quality Monitoring Data	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Causes of variation between loads estimated using alternative calculation methods and their repeatability were investigated using 20years of daily flow and monthly concentration samples for 77 rivers in New Zealand. Loads of dissolved and total nitrogen and phosphorus were calculated using the Ratio, L5, and L7 methods. Estimates of loads and their precision associated with short-term records of 5, 10, and 15years were simulated by subsampling. The representativeness of the short-term loads was quantified as the standard deviation of the 20 realizations. The L7 method generally produced more realistic loads with the highest precision and representativeness. Differences between load estimates were shown to be associated with poor agreement between the data and the underlying model. The best method was shown to depend on the match between the model and functional and distributional characteristics of the data, rather than on the contaminant. Short-term load estimates poorly represented the long-term load estimate, and deviations frequently exceeded estimated imprecision. The results highlight there is no single preferred load calculation method, the inadvisability of unsupervised load estimation and the importance of inspecting concentration-flow, unit load-flow plots and regression residuals. Regulatory authorities should be aware that the precision of loads estimated from monthly data are likely to be optimistic with respect to the actual repeatability of load estimates.																	1093-474X	1752-1688				FEB	2017	53	1					158	178		10.1111/1752-1688.12492								WOS:000394779000013

Numerical and Qualitative Contrasts of Two Statistical Models for Water Quality Change in Tidal Waters	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Two statistical approaches, weighted regression on time, discharge, and season and generalized additive models, have recently been used to evaluate water quality trends in estuaries. Both models have been used in similar contexts despite differences in statistical foundations and products. This study provided an empirical and qualitative comparison of both models using 29years of data for two discrete time series of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) in the Patuxent River estuary. Empirical descriptions of each model were based on predictive performance against the observed data, ability to reproduce flow-normalized trends with simulated data, and comparisons of performance with validation datasets. Between-model differences were apparent but minor and both models had comparable abilities to remove flow effects from simulated time series. Both models similarly predicted observations for missing data with different characteristics. Trends from each model revealed distinct mainstem influences of the Chesapeake Bay with both models predicting a roughly 65% increase in chl-a over time in the lower estuary, whereas flow-normalized predictions for the upper estuary showed a more dynamic pattern, with a nearly 100% increase in chl-a in the last 10years. Qualitative comparisons highlighted important differences in the statistical structure, available products, and characteristics of the data and desired analysis.

Water quality analysis of major ion chemistry shows elevated concentration of fluoride in groundwater samples. The fluoride concentration ranges from 1.4 to 5.9 mg/l and 1.5 to 5.8 mg/l in pre- and post-monsoons, respectively. The result clearly shows that the seasonal variation of fluoride in groundwater is due to recharge of rain water during monsoon. The water quality data was analyzed by hydrochemical facies ( Piper diagram), Gibbs plot, and various plots. Plots of Na versus Cl, Ca versus SO4, and ( Na+Cl)-(SO4+HCO3) versus (Na+K-Cl) shows positive and negative values, indicating that their source of high concentration are aquifer, evapotranpiration, and other anthropogenic sources. Saturation index of halite and gypsum shows that all groundwater samples were undersaturated and suggests that carbonate minerals influence the concentration. Using multivariate statistical techniques, viz., principal component ( factor analysis and cluster analysis), the analysis brought out impact of intensity of excess use of fertilizers and excess withdrawal of groundwater regime. Multivariate statistical techniques are potential tools and provide greater precision for identifying contaminant parameter linkages.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				FEB	2017	10	4							83	10.1007/s12517-017-2863-x								WOS:000396880600010

Intra-seasonal and inter-seasonal changes in endorheic and floodplain pans in relation to limnology, size, hydroperiod, and river connectivity were studied over two rainfall seasons across 36 pans at the Save Valley Conservancy. In the study region, floodplain pans were identified as pans that had connectivity with the Save River, while the endorheic pans (large and small) were hydrologically isolated basins. Seasonal trends for physicochemical variables were initial low and gradual increased for both rainfall seasons. Significant interseasonal differences for several physico-chemical variables were observed. No significant differences in physico-chemical variables were observed between large and small endorheic pans, with the except for vegetation cover, which was higher in large pans. Floodplain pans differed from the endorheic systems in pH, conductivity, nutrients and suspended solids. Connectivity was found to be insignificant, as connections between these systems were probably too infrequent. Seasonal pans were uniquely distinguished by their morphometric, physico-chemical and hydrological characteristics. Inevitably, they are vulnerable to climate change with the extent of their resilience currently unknown. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Sen, ZK; As-Sefry, S; Al-Harithy, S				Sen, Zekai; As-Sefry, Saleh; Al-Harithy, Saad			Strategic management of groundwater resources in the Arabian Peninsula: Wadi Na'man case	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Groundwater resources management in arid regions needs a special considerations, where each stage is affected by a wide variety of technical, social, and economic considerations, and therefore, in an integrated analysis, the foundation stone is the strategic planning, which should include ingredients of basic field data and their simple interpretations, identification of relevant parameters, sub-regions of water priority, and risk assessments. In arid regions, Quaternary deposit aquifer potentiality within any catchment (wadi) is partitioned into subdivisions for strategic planning according to rainfall pattern, morphology, geology, recharge features, and water quality. The climatologic, hydrologic, morphologic, geophysical, and hydrogeological factors combined together lead to a proper assessment of the water availability, abstractability, and recharge possibility in the area. In this paper, rather than deterministic classical approaches, uncertainty in the nature of different factors is explored during the assessment through simple risk concepts. Hence, each key factor (storativity, transmissivity porosity, saturation, and unsaturation thicknesses) is attached with respective risk values leading to groundwater volume calculations. The scenarios of possible strategic groundwater resources management are given on the human population and time bases. The application is presented for one of the major wadis, Wadi Na'man, in the central western part of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				FEB	2017	10	3							50	10.1007/s12517-016-2824-9								WOS:000394012200001

Modeling anthropogenic boron in groundwater flow and discharge at Volusia Blue Spring (Florida, USA)	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Volusia Blue Spring (VBS) is the largest spring along the St. Johns River in Florida (USA) and the spring pool is refuge for hundreds of manatees during winter months. However, the water quality of the spring flow has been degraded due to urbanization in the past few decades. A three-dimensional contaminant fate and transport model, utilizing MODFLOW-2000 and MT3DMS, was developed to simulate boron transport in the Upper Florida Aquifer, which sustains the VBS spring discharge. The VBS model relied on information and data related to natural water features, rainfall, land use, water use, treated wastewater discharge, septic tank effluent flows, and fertilizers as inputs to simulate boron transport. The model was calibrated against field-observed water levels, spring discharge, and analysis of boron in water samples. The calibrated VBS model yielded a root-mean-square-error value of 1.8 m for the head and 17.7 mu g/L for boron concentrations within the springshed. Model results show that anthropogenic boron from surrounding urbanized areas contributes to the boron found at Volusia Blue Spring.

J	Henry, DAW; Cumming, GS				Henry, Dominic A. W.; Cumming, Graeme S.			Can waterbirds with different movement, dietary and foraging functional traits occupy similar ecological niches?	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Competitive interactions potentially play an important role in structuring bird communities. It is unclear how differences in functional traits influence the niche dimensions of highly mobile waterbird species, particularly when they co-exist in spatiotemporally heterogeneous communities. We investigated the inter-relationships between waterbird trait groupings (movement, dietary and foraging habitat) and environmental variable groupings (rainfall, land cover, vegetation structure and water quality). Specifically, we tested whether the scale of environmental variables filtered movement traits and whether these traits operated in conjunction with dietary and foraging habitat traits to form distinct ecological niches in waterbirds. We conducted waterbird and environmental variable surveys in 60 sites, sampled seven times each at bimonthly intervals, in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Trait-environment relationships were tested using a combination of RLQ and fourth-corner analyses. Several significant trait-environment relationships emerged in bivariate correlations and multivariate ordination space. Movement traits correlated with the scale of environmental variables; migrant and nomadic species responded to broad scale environmental variables. Vegetation structure and land cover were particularly important in explaining the abundance of species foraging in emergent vegetation. Three groups emerged along a gradient in multivariate ordination space providing evidence for ecological niche separation of waterbirds with different movement traits. Our findings suggest that the scale of landscape resources can act as a filter of movement traits, and that in conjunction with dietary and foraging traits, waterbirds with different movement traits occupy distinct ecological niches.

J	Jarsjo, J; Tornqvist, R; Su, Y				Jarsjo, Jerker; Tornqvist, Rebecka; Su, Ye			Climate-driven change of nitrogen retention-attenuation near irrigated fields: multi-model projections for Central Asia	Environmental Earth Sciences												Agricultural intensification in semiarid regions comes at a cost of relatively high water losses through evapotranspiration and can contribute to releases of nutrients and pesticides that affect downstream water quality. In addition, highly managed river basins may be particularly sensitive to future climate change. However, effects on retention-attenuation of nutrients are difficult to quantify due to the complexity and variability of relevant processes. We here use the example case of the large (covering 1.3% of the earth's land surface) and extensively irrigated Aral Sea Drainage Basin (ASDB) in Central Asia, together with 73 general circulation model (GCM) projection results and field-data driven nitrogen retention-attenuation modeling, to investigate to which extent projected future climate change (for years 2025, 2050 and 2100) can influence nitrogen loads and concentrations in the water systems of the basin. Results for the principal Amu Darya River of the ASDB suggest that riverine concentrations of nitrogen will decrease considerably throughout the coming century. This is due to projected climate-related decreases in runoff and river discharge, which increases internal nitrogen recirculation ratios, average transport distances and nitrogen retention-attenuation. However, in groundwater near the agricultural fields, there is in contrast a risk of considerable nitrogen accumulation. More generally, the sensitivity of nitrogen concentrations in the ADRB to climate-driven changes in runoff and discharge is likely to be shared with many highly managed basins in arid and semiarid regions of Central Asia, and the world.

J	Sethy, SN; Syed, TH; Kumar, A				Sethy, Satya Narayan; Syed, Tajdarul H.; Kumar, Alok			Evaluation of groundwater quality in parts of the Southern Gangetic Plain using water quality indices	Environmental Earth Sciences												In India, persistent dependence on groundwater for intensively irrigated agriculture, industrial use and domestic activities imposes substantial threat to the quality and quantity of groundwater. This study assesses the suitability of groundwater for drinking purposes in parts of the Southern Gangetic Plain based on samples collected from 33 dug wells. In this scope, two robust indices are utilized, namely Groundwater Quality Index (GQI) and the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME) Water Quality Index (CCME_WQI), to assess the overall quality of groundwater by integrating observed water quality determinants like pH, TDS and major ion concentration. The concentration of major anions and cations is observed to be in the order of HCO3- > Cl- > SO42- > NO3- and Na+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > K+, respectively. The pH values of the analyzed samples vary between 6.2 and 7.37 during the post-monsoon (POM) period and between 6.6 and 7.9 during the pre-monsoon (PRM) period. Similarly, TDS concentrations are observed to vary between 6.7 and 1535 mg/l (POM) and 1.43 and 1327 mg/l (PRM). The values of GQI in the study area range between 10.41-108.56 and 16.03-130.06 for the PRM and POM periods, respectively. Among the groundwater samples collected during the PRM period, about 21, 73 and 6% are found to be excellent, good and poor quality, respectively. While the percentage of poor quality water for POM period is exactly the same as that of PRM, about 42 (52%) of the samples are found to be of excellent (good) quality for drinking purposes. The analysis of CCME_WQI for groundwater samples reveals that 3 (21%), 42 (36%), 33 (18%), 21 (24%) of the samples collected during PRM (POM) are classified to be of excellent, good, fair and marginal category, respectively. The spatial distribution of GQI and CCME_WQI illustrates that excellent quality water occurs primarily in the northeast part of the study area during the POM period. However, some localized patches with excellent quality are also observed in both the seasons. Results from this study will be crucial for proper utilization and management of already depleted groundwater resources of the study area.

In order to assess the effects of PES in the conservation soil area, the chemical and isotopic compositions of water from springs were characterized and the water baseline chemistry was established to provide a useful standard to monitor the water resources and to support the decision-making under current water management policies. A total of 32 water samples taken in four field surveys, during the dry and rainy season, and background chemical data from different information sources, were studied. The water salinity increases from southwest to northeast towards the urbanized area. The chemical composition of water is due to the occurrence of natural chemical interactions between water and rocks in aquifers and to the presence of effluents generated by human activities. In the forest area, water chemistry has not changed significantly over the past three decades and there are no major discernible trends in the compiled water chemistry data, suggesting that PES has contributed in part to maintain the initial condition in the aquifer recharge area. The natural reference levels proposed have allowed the current chemical conditions in the system to be understood and can be implemented to monitor water resources in the area of conservation soil in the Sierra de Las Cruces with an acceptable degree of reliability.

This would not be achievable unless continuous water quality monitoring is implemented. With the recent advances in remote sensing technology, this technology could assist us to produce accurate models for estimating water quality variables in the ecosystem of wetlands. The present study was carried out to evaluate the capability of remote sensing data to estimate the water quality variables [pH, total suspended solids (TSS), total dissolved solids (TDS), turbidity, nitrate, sulfate, phosphate, chloride and the concentration of chlorophyll a] in Zarivar International Wetland using linear regression (LR) and artificial neural network (ANN) models. For this purpose, spectral reflectance of bands 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the OLI sensor of Landsat 8 was utilized as the input data and the collected chemical and physical data of water samples were selected as the objective data for both ANN and LR models. Based on our results overall, ANN model was the proper model compared with LR model. The spectral reflectance in bands 5 and 4 of OLI sensor revealed the best results to estimate TDS, TSS, turbidity and chlorophyll in comparison with other used bands in ANN model, respectively. We conclude that OLI sensor data are an excellent means for studying physical properties of water quality and comparing its chemical properties.																	0921-030X	1573-0840				FEB	2017	85	3					1511	1527		10.1007/s11069-016-2641-1								WOS:000392302700010						
J	Geng, YQ; Wang, DM; Yang, WB				Geng, Yuqing; Wang, Dongmei; Yang, Wenbin			Effects of different inundation periods on soil enzyme activity in riparian zones in Lijiang	CATENA												The most important environmental processes in riparian zones are the release of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus from various organic compounds. The extracellular enzymes of soil microorganisms are involved in the bio-geochemical cycling of organic matter nutrients and may be important for regulating water quality. The objectives of the present study were to determine whether the activities of soil enzymes were affected by different inundation periods in the riparian zone and to identify major factors that influence soil enzyme activity. We subjected three study plots to different inundation conditions (long inundation, moderate inundation, and rare inundation) within the transects perpendicular to the river flow at three sites (Weijiadu, Lijiaocun, and Daxu) in Lijiang, Guilin City, China. Soil physicochemical properties, dissolved nutrient composition, and soil enzyme activities were analyzed. The activity of acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, and arylsulfatase significantly increased as the inundation frequency decreased, whereas the activity of glucosidase, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, glycine aminopeptidase, L-leucine aminopeptidase, and dehydrogenase were significantly higher in study plots that received long inundation than in those subjected to moderate or rare inundation. Linear regression indicated that most hydrolase and dehydrogenase activities were affected by soil clay content, soil organic matter, and soil water content, among other factors. NO3--N limited the activity of acid phosphatase, L-leucine aminopeptidase, and glycine aminopeptidase. Polyphenol oxidase activity was constrained by soil water content and available potassium but promoted by NO3--N. Our study demonstrated that imposing longer inundation periods can increase soil enzyme activities. To maintain microbial activity and to minimize water pollution, it is important to reduce high NO3--N loads. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Predicting the impact of seasonal fluctuations on the potential ecotoxicological risk of multiple contaminants in the River Scheldt discharge into the Western Scheldt estuary	CATENA												The study site, Land van Saeftinghe, is an area within the Western Scheldt estuary with Special Protection Area (SPA) status for the EU Birds directive. We used a combination of hydrodynamic and water quality monitoring, hydrodynamic and water quality and modeling, ecotoxicity modeling and observations on the ecological status to correlate the water quality to the observed ecological status of the study site. The monitoring and modeling results show that the copper concentrations are elevated above the Maximum Tolerable Concentration (MTR) during the whole year, while zinc and cadmium show a spring peak (>MTR). Other metals, and all the measured organic contaminants where below the MTR. The peak in the three metals during springtime translates into an increase in the ecotoxicity, as expressed by the calculated multi-substance Potentially Affected Fraction (ms-PAF). The ms-PAF peaked at 25% for all organisms, and 30% for benthic invertebrates. The observed ecological status for the study site at the time of monitoring (2000) was Maximum Ecological Potential (MEP). This result seems to be in contradiction with the exceedance of the MTR for three metals during spring time. However the calculated ms-PAF during the spring peak of 25% is deemed acceptable based on current policy, therefore potential ecotoxic stress is within acceptable boundaries. The ms-PAF results therefore do not contradict the MEP status. The evaluation of the ecological status versus the water quality within the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) can be improved by using the calculated ecotoxicity (ms-PAF) instead of the water quality. We propose an additional step for water bodies which are currently 'at risk', based on their chemical status. In this additional step, the ms-PAF is calculated for all contaminants in the water phase, not discriminating between priority and non-priority substances. The outcome of this calculation defines if the water body is at risk (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

While statistical models used to predict constituent concentrations have been developed considerably over the last few years, measures of uncertainty on constituent loads are rarely reported. Loads are the product of two predictions, constituent concentration and discharge, integrated over a time period, which does not make it straightforward to produce a standard error or a confidence interval. In this paper, a linear mixed model is used to estimate sediment concentrations. A bootstrap method is then developed that accounts for the uncertainty in the concentration and discharge predictions, allowing temporal correlation in the constituent data, and can be used when data transformations are required. The method was tested for a small watershed in Northwest Vietnam for the period 2010-2011. The results showed that confidence intervals were asymmetric, with the highest uncertainty in the upper limit, and that a load of 6262 Mg year(-1) had a 95% confidence interval of (4331, 12 267) in 2010 and a load of 5543Mg an interval of (3593, 8975) in 2011. Additionally, the approach demonstrated that direct estimates from the data were biased downwards compared to bootstrap median estimates. These results imply that constituent loads predicted from regression-type water quality models could frequently be underestimating sediment yields and their environmental impact.

J	Gooseff, MN; Wlostowski, A; McKnight, DM; Jaros, C				Gooseff, Michael N.; Wlostowski, Adam; McKnight, Diane M.; Jaros, Chris			Hydrologic connectivity and implications for ecosystem processes - Lessons from naked watersheds	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Hydrologic connectivity has received great attention recently as our conceptual models of watersheds and water quality have evolved in the past several decades. However, the structural complexity of most temperate watersheds (i.e. connections among shallow soils, deep aquifers, the atmosphere and streams) and the dynamic seasonal changes that occur within them (i.e., plant senescence which impacts evapotranspiration) create significant challenges to characterizing or quantifying hydrologic connectivity. The McMurdo Dry Valleys, a polar desert in Antarctica, provide a unique opportunity to study hydrologic connectivity because there is no vegetative cover (and therefore no transpiration), and no deep aquifers connected to surface soils or streams. Glacier melt provides stream flow to well-established channels and closed-basin, ice-covered lakes on the valley floor. Streams are also connected to shallow hyporheic zones along their lengths, which are bounded at similar to 75 cm depth by ice-cemented permafrost. These hydrologic features and connections provide water for and underpin biological communities. Hence, exchange of water among them provides a vector for exchange of energy and dissolved solutes. Connectivity is dynamic on timescales of a day to a flow season (6-12 weeks), as streamflow varies over these timescales. The timescales over which these connections occur is also dynamic. Exchanges between streams and hyporheic zones, for example, have been estimated to be as short as hours to as long as several weeks. These exchanges have significant implications for the biogeochemistry of these systems and the biotic communities in each feature. Here we evaluate the lessons we can learn about hydrologic connectivity in the MDV watersheds that are simplified in the context of processes occurring and water reservoirs included in the landscape, yet are sensitive to climate controls and contain substantial physical heterogeneity. We specifically explore several metrics that are simple and/or commonly employed in hydrologic analyses and interpret them in the context of connectivity between and among hydrologic features.

J	Kondolf, GM; Pinto, PJ				Kondolf, G. Mathias; Pinto, Pedro J.			The social connectivity of urban rivers	GEOMORPHOLOGY												By social connectivity we refer to the communication and movement of people, goods, ideas, and culture along and across rivers, recognizing longitudinal, lateral, and vertical connectivity, much as has been described for other riversfor hydrology and ecology. We focus on rivers as they pass through cities, and the relationships between these rivers and city dwellers. Historically, the most important longitudinal connectivity function of rivers was their role as major transport routes and the simplification of formerly complex, irregular banks and beds, into straight, uniform shipping channels has resulted in a loss of lateral and vertical connectivity, notably the quotidian uses such as fishing, washing clothes, water supply, swimming and other recreation. The scale of the river itself, and its scale in comparison to the scale of the city, largely determine the river's social function and the degree to which it influences city form. River width affects the perception of 'closeness' of the other bank, ease of bridging the river, influence of the river on the city's street pattern, and type of waterfront uses that occur. Up to 15 m wide, people can converse, whereas across rivers similar to 50 to similar to 200 m wide, people are not recognizable but still clearly visible, instilling the banks with a 'lively' atmosphere. At widths over similar to 200 m, people blur, yet moving vehicles and trees branches shaldng in wind may still provide some dynamic elements to an otherwise static landscape composed of building facades. In exceptionally wide rivers, the city on the opposite bank is little more than a skyline, which often becomes a signature and symbol of regional identity. In contemplating how people use rivers, we can define a range of human activities in relation to height above the water (i.e., instream to banktop), a vertical dimension of human connectivity with rivers. Many uses occur on the top of the bank, such as quiet contemplation, walking, or cycling along a riverside trail, while others depend on contact with the water itself, such as wading, diving, and canoeing (which presupposes adequate water quality). Many of these relationships are illustrated by the challenge of reconnecting Cairo with the Nile. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Subsurface ice contained in permafrost is similarly affected by climate change, causing persistent impacts on natural and human systems. In contrast to glaciers, permafrost is not observable spatially and therefore its presence and possible changes are frequently overlooked. Correspondingly, little is known about permafrost in the mountains of the Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH) region, despite permafrost area exceeding that of glaciers in nearly all countries. Based on evidence and insight gained mostly in other permafrost areas globally, this review provides a synopsis on what is known or can be inferred about permafrost in the mountains of the HKH region. Given the extreme nature of the environment concerned, it is to be expected that the diversity of conditions and phenomena encountered in permafrost exceed what has previously been described and investigated. We further argue that climate change in concert with increasing development will bring about diverse permafrost-related impacts on vegetation, water quality, geohazards, and livelihoods. To better anticipate and mitigate these effects, a deepened understanding of high-elevation permafrost in subtropical latitudes as well as the pathways interconnecting environmental changes and human livelihoods are needed.

As a results of these activities, the nature is impacted by a number of changes and anthropogenic pollution. In this study, drilling core samples from the Izmit Bay (IZC-01) in the Sea of Marmara, Surmene (SC-01) and Hopa (HC-01) coasts in the Black Sea have been investigated with lithological, sedimentological, paleontological and geochemical perspectives. The concentrations of heavy metals as Ba, As, Pb, Cd, Cr, Ni, Ti and Zn were considered from total of 45 samples which are covering 15 samples from each three cores. PLI (Pollution load index) values are calculated by using the results of As, Ba, Pb, Cr, Ni, and Zn elements, stand out 3.255 for the Gulf of Izmit, 2,195 and 1,706 for Surmene and Hopa in respectively. PLI values indicate accepted level of pollution above for the Gulf of Izmit and despite being dirty Surmene and Hopa relatively less polluted. In addition, EF values indicate a significant enrichment of the As, M and Cr and moderate enrichment of Pb and Zn elements at Izmit Gulf. In locations Hopa and Surmene; As, Ba and Cr elements showing insufficient enrichment and Ni, Pb and Zn was observed a significant enrichment. Besides, pollution related gypsum crystallization is also remarkable for Maramara core. The abundance and diversity of paleontological records in the cores are also compatible in line with the decreasing and increasing rate of pollution. Towards the deepest part of the all 3 cores, a reduction in the concentrations of elements such as Pb, Zn, Cr and As is seen. Radiocarbon dates obtained, from the shells of these reduction levels are mesured in Surmene 420 +/- 55 (BP) and Hopa 500 +/- 50 (BP). In addition, results of the other previous studies based on sedimentation rate and these ages are compatible. These specified age ranges were compared with opinions in the literature which are related to the beginning of Anthropocene and because of the overlaping, these clearly observed levels have been interpreted as the limit of the possible Anthropocene time.																	1016-9164						2017	60	2					145	168		10.25288/tjb.300672								WOS:000434458500001

Several studies have been undertaken to monitor this phenomenon from space by developing ocean color models that can quantify red tide by Chlorophyll a (Chl a) parameter. However, these models showed poor performance over this region due to the effect of water and atmospheric turbidity, despite of the use of atmospheric correction model on the data. This could be explained by the failure of this atmospheric correction model, which is based on assuming zero NIR reflectance (black pixel assumption) to correct the satellite imagery. In this paper, we have evaluated the black pixel assumption model and presented an empirical attempt that improve the estimation of water reflectance and Chl a. We found that the uncertainty of this model is mainly caused by the: (i) aerosol loading, which requires further correction (ii) water turbidity, and (iii) water depth.

The objective of this study is to establish a model for estimating SSS using in situ measurement datasets from FY2015 to FY2016 in Seto Inland Sea. To estimate SSS, we perfolined a bio-optical model combined with the CDOM absorption coefficient at 440 nm (alpha(y)(440)) as a proxy. Results showed that the estimated alpha(y)(440) had a reversely linear relationship with in situ SSS using winter datasets (R-2=0.66), which indicated the alpha(y)(440) is potential for modeling to estimate SSS, furtheunore, the bio-optical model can be used for water quality assessment in Seto Inland Sea.

In this paper, the images of GaoFen-1(GF1) and the China's first civilian high-resolution stereo mapping satellite, ZiYuan-3 (ZY-3) satellite, were used to get the land surface information in a small watershed in the water source area of middle route of South to North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP). The change of land surface was also extracted using images with different period. The effects of grain to green solutions implemented in small watershed management were then analyzed. The results indicate that high-resolution images with different periods have a great potential to monitor land cover change in small watershed and is expected to be useful for evaluating small watershed control efforts, in turn for the environment protection in water source area.																	2153-6996		978-1-5090-4951-6				2017							5105	5108										WOS:000426954605026

GRB has been taken as a case study. The physical, chemical and biological analysis has been interpreted using WQI. Based on the results of the analyses, spatial distribution maps of selected water quality parameters were prepared using GIS platform. A significant degradation in the WQ of the stations located in the lower reaches of the river basin is observed. Allahabad is the most polluted station followed by Kanpur and Varanasi. The most inferior WQ with OIP value of 4.18 (polluted class) is observed in the pre-monsoon season of 2010 at Varanasi station. The OIP based on the individual index values was estimated giving the values in terms of pollution indices.																	2153-6996		978-1-5090-4951-6				2017							5609	5612										WOS:000426954605152

But since they are impacted by climate change, there is a need for their constant monitoring. Due to climate changes the following grasslands growth conditions are modified: soil moisture, biomass and as a consequence carbon balance. Required multi-temporal and spatial observations are possible with satellite data. The objective of this paper is to present the long term observations of temperature and vegetation conditions (NDVI) of grasslands on the basis of MODIS satellite data as well as already performed and further scheduled frequent analysis of carbon balance, soil moisture and biomass performed with the application of Sentinell A; B and Sentinel2 A&B.																	2153-6996		978-1-5090-4951-6				2017							5782	5785										WOS:000426954605197

Difficulties associated with conducting field work (i.e., hazardous terrain) can affect the ability of resource managers to correctly identify wetland plant species in a timely fashion. Thus, in wetland sites where access can be difficult, differentiation of plant species from aerial imagery can be of use. In this work, we studied laboratory produced hyperspectral data to classify various wetland plants thereby determining optimal multispectral bands that can distinguish these species. We then used an unmanned aerial systems (UAS) mountable 5- band multispectral sensor to classify 11 different wetland plant species to determine effectiveness of the multispectral bands chosen by the preliminary hyperspectral analysis. Classification experiments on the hyperspectral data produced the overall accuracies of 94-97% with 20% training samples. Experiments on the UAS collected multispectral data produced overall accuracy of 75% when considering four classes and 58% overall accuracy when considering 11 classes.																	2153-6996		978-1-5090-4951-6				2017							5924	5927										WOS:000426954605232

The air quality parameters measured by low cost sensors, include CH4 and CO2 gas, while for water quality parameters measured include temperature, pH and electrical conductivity. The sensor node is based on Arduino UNO microcontroller, receiving the data from the sensors and transmitting to the database on Raspberry pi 3, remotely accessing all the data. It is extremely important to develop devices with the new commercial low-cost sensors to detect and measure gases in atmosphere to monitoring the carbon dioxide and methane due to their role as greenhouse gases and also gas leaks from wellbores can severely affect the health of people and animal.																	2153-6996		978-1-5090-4951-6				2017							5954	5957										WOS:000426954605240

Therefore, the change of agricultural landscape is at the top of the agenda for many policy makers and landscape planners. As a basis for conservation management, sufficient information about landscape structure should be providing. Jiangdu County is the main grain producing area in Jiangsu Province, where were taken as a case study area. In this study, the former landscape structure and the changes in landscape patterns during a period of about 10 years in study area were reconstructed and elucidated. Landscape pattern information in study area were extracted and analyzed by using Remote Sensing and Geographical Information System technology. Farmland, ponds cultured, forestland and settlement were extracted separately from the remote sensing images. The frequency index, landscape diversity index and landscape fragmentation index were calculated for analysis. The agriculture landscape pattern index was calculated and change characteristics were analyzed by using Fragstats software. Results show that within the study area, the agricultural landscape patterns changed significantly from 2006 to 2016, especially in farmland, ponds cultured and settlement. Landscape diversity index and fragmentation index of this study area increased.																	2334-3168						2017							311	314										WOS:000426987500060

Since the 1970s, the city has been supplied with surface water that is collected from 5 small watersheds and treated in a single main plant located in Ntoum, 40 km east of Libreville. There are few additional surface water resources available nearby, and the national water utility is desperately seeking cheap, alternative water resources. From 2007 to 2014, SEURECA and HYDROCONSEIL provided SEEG with hydrogeological expertise to develop groundwater resource near existing facilities. A thick limestone layer (Madiela limestone) had been previously drilled by oil companies. Madiela has very limited outcrops (5 km(2)), but proved to be highly productive (2000-10,000 m3/day per borehole), and we successfully developed a new well field. As (a) the aquifer extension is limited and (b) there is a risk of seawater intrusion, the well field was developed step-by-step and the water levels and water quality were carefully monitored (i.e., conductivity, which can indicate seawater intrusion). The aquifer storage capacity was measured through the long dry season drawdown as being 220,000 m(3) per m. This is sizeable, but insufficient was the aquifer to be mined. For this reason, we proposed a MAR strategy and monitored aquifer recharge during rainfall events. This recharge proved to be highly impressive (>20 million m(3)/year). Such a large recharge is higher than expected from direct infiltration in such a tiny aquifer outcrop. Additional recharge mechanisms have been investigated through geophysical prospecting, and the hydrogeological model has been updated accordingly. Presently, Ntoum well field produces 55,000 m3/day of good quality water without this having any significant impact on resource quality or quantity (i.e., no significant drawdown of the water table has been recorded). In light of the recharge efficiency, we have developed a MAR strategy that includes a new well field further to the north, with 4 additional deep wells.																	2511-2066	2511-2082	978-3-319-45465-8; 978-3-319-45464-1				2017							273	281		10.1007/978-3-319-45465-8_26								WOS:000426347900026

Since then, various short-term studies have shown water quality to degrade, and sedimentation to gradually fill the lake. The lake appears to have lost 42 % of its initial water capacity due to present mean sedimentation rates nearing 8000 m(3)/year. A sedimentary balance shows that this phenomenon can be attributed to watershed allochtonous particulate inflow for 87 %. Sediment fluxes and their lacustrine accumulation act in turn as in-lake nutrient sources accelerating the eutrophication process. As a conclusion for this study, some solutions are proposed to improve drinking water production sustainability.																	1958-573X						2017	11									10.4000/physio-geo.5544								WOS:000424626300021

The research presented in this paper is the first to address biofilms at selected occurrences of mineral water in Serbia (Bogatic, Metkovic and Belotic in the Macva District as well as Radaljska Banja, Lukovska Banja and Vranjska Banja) (in Serbian, banja denotes a spa town). The study period is from 2014 to 2016. The temperatures of the studied occurrences are in the 30-93.9 degrees C range and the chemical composition corresponds to the HCO3- -Na++ K+ and SO42-, HCO3--Na++ K+ types of mineral water. One of the objectives was to examine the condition of wellheads (incrustation, biofouling and corrosion), focusing on the presence of phototrophic microorganisms whose metabolites may lead to changes in mineral water quality, yield and chemistry. Analysis by light and scanning electron microscopy provides insight into the diversity of phototrophic microorganisms that populate biofilms near the points of emergence and on wellhead. The research reveals the presence of representatives of three groups of phototrophic microorganisms: Cyanobacteria, Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta. Cyanobacteria were the most numerous, dominated by the order Oscillatoriales with ten recorded genera, of which Leptolynbgya and Phormidium feature the largest numbers of species. The order Chroococcales are the second most numerous, with seven recorded genera, of which Gloeocapsa and Synechocystisare the most noteworthy. The largest numbers of representative taxa were noted at Radaljska Banja and Vranjska Banja, where mineral waters originate from lithostratigraphic units of igneous origin, followed by mineral water occurrences in karst aquifers (Bogatic and Belotic) and an intergranular aquifer (Metkovic). The smallest number of identified phototrophic microorganisms is noted at Lukovska Banja, where the origin is associated with a fractured aquifer formed in sedimentary and metamorphic rocks, with occasional diabase interbeds. Although many representative taxa are found on only one of the studied localities, such as Synechococcus bigranulatus and Pseudanabaena thermalis, those of the genera Leptolyngbya, Phormidium and Cosmarium laeve, as well as genera of the phylum Bacillariophyta, occur at several sampling sites. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to show the relationship between documented cyanobacterial and algal taxa and environmental parameters.																	0583-6050	1580-2612					2017	46	2-3					295	316										WOS:000423294700011

Expansion of landscape characterisation methods within the Hydrogeological Landscape Framework: application in the Australian Capital Territory	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												The Hydrogeological Landscape (HGL) Framework is a landscape-characterisation tool that is used to discern areas of similar physical, hydrogeological, hydrological, chemical and biological properties, referred to as HGL Units. The HGL Framework facilitates prioritisation of natural-resource management investment by identifying current and potential hazards in the landscape. Within prioritised regions, on-ground management actions are tailored for specific Management Areas within individual HGL Units. The HGL Unit boundaries are determined through expert interpretation of spatial and field based datasets, such as climate, landform, geology, regolith, soil, stream network, groundwater flow systems, water quality and vegetation assemblages. The resulting HGL Units are validated by an interdisciplinary team using field assessment and biophysical testing. The use of the HGL Framework for new applications creates opportunities for refinement of the existing methodology and products for end users. This paper uses an application in the Australian Capital Territory as a case study to illustrate two enhanced techniques for the landscape characterisation component of the HGL Framework: use of an unsupervised statistical learning algorithm, Self-Organising Maps (SOM), to further validate HGL Units; and landform modelling to assist in delineation of Management Areas. The combined use of SOM and landform modelling techniques provides statistical support to the existing expert and field-based techniques, ensuring greater rigour and confidence in determination of landscape patterns. This creates a more refined HGL Framework landscape-characterisation tool, facilitating more precise hazard assessment and strategic natural-resource management by end users.

Assessing the potential zone of groundwater recharge is extremely crucial for the protection of water quality and the management of groundwater systems. To identify the groundwater potential zone in the study area, thematic layers of lithology, slope, karst degrees, land cover, lineament and drainage density were generated using topographic maps, thematic maps, field data and satellite image, and were prepared, classified, weighted and integrated in a geographic information system (GIS) environment by the means of fuzzy logic. The fuzzy membership values have been assigned to different thematic layers according to their classification on respect for their contribution and their occurrence in groundwater. Based on the generated groundwater potential map, it was found that about 8% of the investigation area was categorized as very high potential for groundwater recharge, 31% as high, 28% as moderate, 17% as low and 16% as very low potential for groundwater recharge. Finally, the results were verified using well-yield data. The highest recharge potential area is located towards the downstream regions related to more fractured and karstified limestone.																	1947-5705	1947-5713					2017	8	2					194	206		10.1080/19475705.2016.1181676								WOS:000418899200003

Inactivation of Bacterial Spores and Vegetative Bacterial Cells by Interaction with ZnO-Fe2O3 Nanoparticles and UV Radiation	AIMS GEOSCIENCES												ZnO-Fe2O3 nanoparticles (ZnO-Fe NPs) were synthesized and characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The generation of chemical reactive hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot) was measured spectrophotometrically (UV-Vis) by monitoring of p-nitrosodimethylaniline (pNDA) bleaching. Inactivation of E. coli and B. subtilis spores in the presence of different concentrations of ZnO-Fe NPs, under UV365nm or visible radiation, was evaluated. We observed the best results under visible light, of which inactivation of E. coli of about 90% was accomplished in 30 minutes, while B. subtilis inactivation close to 90% was achieved in 120 minutes. These results indicate that the prepared photocatalytic systems are promising for improving water quality by reducing the viability of water-borne microorganisms, including bacterial spores.																	2471-2132						2017	3	4					498	513		10.3934/geosci.2017.4.498								WOS:000418528400001						
J	Shoko, C; Dube, T; Clark, D				Shoko, Cletah; Dube, Timothy; Clark, David			Total evaporation estimation for accurate water accounting purposes: an appraisal of various available estimation methods	GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL												The estimation of total evaporation is fundamental for water accounting, considering its influence on water availability. Moreover, the current increase in water consumption (e.g. in sub-Saharan Africa and the world over), land cover/use changes, deteriorating water quality and the climate change projections in most regions of the world underscore the need to understand water loss. So far, different approaches have been developed and implemented in estimating the variations of total evaporation, with varying accuracies. The aim of this work was therefore, to provide a review of these different approaches for estimating total evaporation, as well as a detailed discussion of their strengths and weaknesses. Findings from this review have shown that total evaporation estimates derived, using ground-based meteorological and micro-meteorological methods are inadequate for representing its large-scale spatial variations. On the other hand, remote sensing technology, which acquires data at different resolutions (i.e. radiometric, spectral, spatial and temporal), provides timely, up-to-date and relatively accurate spatial estimates of total evaporation over large geographic coverage, for sustainable and effective water accounting, which is key for well-informed and improved management of water resources at both catchment and regional scales. In this regard, more details on the remote sensing-based methods of estimating total evaporation are provided, especially considering the robust technological advancements and its potential in characterizing earth features over time and space.

Jahani Salt Diapir, Iran: hydrogeology, karst features and effect on surroundings environment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPELEOLOGY												The Jahani Salt Diapir (JSD), with an area of 54 km(2), is an active diapir in the Simply Folded Belt of the Zagros Orogeny, in the south of Iran. Most of the available studies on this diapir are focused on tectonics. The hydrogeology, schematic model of flow direction and hydrochemical effects of the JSD on the adjacent water resources are lacking, and thus, are the focus of this study. The morphology of the JSD was reevaluated by fieldwork and using available maps. The physicochemical characteristics of the springs and hydrometric stations were also measured. The vent of the diapir is located 250 m higher than the surrounding glaciers, and covered by small polygonal sinkholes (dolines). The glacier is covered by cap soils, sparse trees and pastures, and contains large sinkholes, numerous shafts, several caves, and 30 brine springs. Two main groups of caves were distinguished. Sub-horizontal or inclined stream passages following the surface valleys and vertical shafts (with short inlet caves) at the bottoms of nearly circular blind valleys. Salt exposure is limited to steep slopes. The controlling variables of flow route within salt diapirs are the negligible porosity of the salt rocks at depth more than about ten meters below the ground surface and the rapid halite saturation along the flow route. These mechanisms prevent deep cave development and enforce the emergence points of brine springs with low flow rates and small catchment area throughout the JSD and above the local base of erosion. Tectonics do not affect karst development, because the distributions of sinkholes and brine springs show no preferential directions. The type of spring water is sodium chloride, with a TDS of 320 g/l, and saturated with halite, gypsum, calcite and dolomite. The water balance budget of the JSD indicates that the total recharge water is 1.46 MCM (million cubic meter)/a, emerges from 30 brine springs, two springs from the adjacent karstic limestone, and flows into the Firoozabad River (FR) and the adjacent alluvium aquifer. The FR cuts through the northern margin of the salt diapir, dissolving the glacier salts at the contact with JSD, increasing the halite concentration of the 17.7 MCM/a of the FR from 100 mg/l to 12,000 mg/l. This is a permanent process because the active glacier flows rapidly down the steep slopes into the river gorge from the nearby vent. The possible relocation of the FR channel would enhance the FR water quality, but disrupt the natural beauty of the diapir.																	0392-6672	1827-806X					2017	46	3					445	457		10.5038/1827-806X.46.3.2133								WOS:000413996400010

Methods for assessing anthropogenic threats to freshwater ecosystems biodiversity	DNIPROPETROVSK UNIVERSITY BULLETIN SERIES-GEOLOGY GEOGRAPHY												The industrial and agricultural activities of mankind, which includes chemical pollution, building of dams and hydroelectric power stations and their use of the biomass of freshwater ecosystems, have had considerable impacts on freshwater ecosystems, the abundance of aquatic species, and the vital capacity of those species' populations. A variety of aquatic organisms are feasible indicators and they can be used for evaluation water quality through analysis of their population diversity, composition and abundance. The most significant threats for freshwater biodiversity and the integrity of aquatic ecosystems are activities in the watershed's terrestrial realm, disturbances occurring in aquatic and riparian environments and threats that affect freshwater organisms. There are changes of functional structure of biological community due to reducing biodiversity and the dominance of opportunistic species. A lot of changes in characteristics of biological communities can be assessed by using different kinds of evaluations, including the index of biological integrity, saprobity system and geographic information system technology. An effective predictor of great number of disturbances to freshwater ecosystems is the density of human population. Approaches that directly evaluate the level of threat to freshwater biodiversity typically use species composition and abundance data. Methods that indirectly assess the biotic community evaluate the ecological integrity of aquatic ecosystems. For large-scale, resource-limited, time-constrained biodiversity conservation planning, the most appropriate method for assessing the impairment of freshwater systems is relativistic evaluation of biological integrity using geospatial data. For aquatic threat assessments, the most meaningful level of analysis is the drainage basin and its subbasins. The concept of ecoregions covers all freshwater ecosystems. This approach provides biologically meaningful units for further large-scale studies of existing and potential threats to biodiversity. The size of drainage basins can be defined from digital elevation models, which exist as global network in high quality resolution. At the level of drainage basin, using high-resolution remote sensing imagery is often feasible from a financial and workload perspective.																	2313-2159	2409-9864					2017	25	1					71	79		10.15421/111709								WOS:000410864700009						
J	Whalley, K; Luo, W				Whalley, Kyle; Luo, Wei			The Pressure of Society on Water Quality: A Land Use Impact Study of Lake Ripley in Oakland, Wisconsin	AIMS GEOSCIENCES												Eutrophication of lakes occurs naturally over time, but the eutrophication rate can be accelerated by human activities. Agriculture land use can negatively impact water quality of lakes due to nutrient pollution. This research investigates the impacts of agricultural land use on the water quality of Lake Ripley in Oakland, Wisconsin from 1993 to 2011. This study performs a regression analysis which incorporates four years of National Land Cover Database (NLCD) data, eight spatial categories based on hydrological flow length across topographic surface, and a weighting technique to calculate land use percentages. The results indicate that the combination of agricultural land use and rainfall variables are significantly related to chlorophyll a and total phosphorus concentrations, while these variables do not appear to affect Secchi depth measurements. Due to the near flat topography of the Lake Ripley watershed, agricultural land use within the two spatial regions closest to Lake Ripley and its inlet stream had the largest impact on Lake Ripley's water quality.																	2471-2132						2017	3	1					14	36		10.3934/geosci.2017.1.14								WOS:000404166000002						
J	Walther, SC; Reinholtz, AL; Marcus, WA				Walther, Suzanne C.; Reinholtz, Amanda L.; Marcus, W. Andrew			The geographic distribution of small dams in Oregon using ecoregion and landform classification	PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Small dams fragment river landscapes, disrupting channel connectivity and impacting water quality and quantity. Although they impound volumetrically less total water than large dams, the ubiquity of small dams suggests their cumulative impacts could be significant. Documenting the distribution and characteristics of small dams is necessary to understanding and mitigating their impacts. In this study, we compare datasets of small dams in Oregon, compile a new comprehensive dataset, and document geographic variations in small dam distributions between different ecoregions. We used Oregon Water Resources Department dam and Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife fish passage barrier datasets to compare dam heights and contributing drainage areas between different ecoregions. Over 61% of Oregon's land area is above one or more small dam. We highlight the location of Oregon's small dams at valley margins, transition zones between flat plains and mountains, and areas of high population density. Given the hidden nature of small dams, evaluation of small dam impacts using public imagery is not effective. However, knowledge of small dam distributions given their association with landforms can aid in finding unrecorded dams, assessing approaches for evaluating their geomorphic impacts, and informing their management.																	0272-3646	1930-0557					2017	38	3					286	301		10.1080/02723646.2017.1286224								WOS:000400371000005

The geochemistry of hydraulic fracturing fluids	15TH WATER-ROCK INTERACTION INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM, WRI-15	Procedia Earth and Planetary Science				15th Water-Rock Interaction International Symposium (WRI)	OCT 16-21, 2016	Evora, PORTUGAL					The inorganic geochemistry of hydraulic fracturing fluids is reviewed with new insights on the role of entrapped formation waters in unconventional shale gas and tight sand formations on the quality of flowback and produced waters that are extracted with hydrocarbons. The rapid increase of the salinity of flowback fluids during production, combined with geochemical and isotopic changes, indicate mixing of the highly saline formation water with the injected water. The salinity increase suggests that the volume of the injected water that is returned to the surface with the flowback water is much smaller than previous estimates, and thus the majority of the injected water is retained within the shale formations. The high salinity of the flowback and produced water is associated with high concentrations of halides, ammonium, metals, metalloids, and radium nuclides that pose environmental and human health risks upon the release of the hydraulic fracturing fluids to the environment.

The target shales of the Elko Formation are unique fresh-water hydrocarbon reservoirs with relatively dilute source water (8.5 g/L total dissolved solids [TDS]). Additionally, the Elko Formation is underlain by a freshwater carbonate aquifer (0.2-0.3 g/L TDS) that outcrops downgradient of the exploration area. The water quality and isotopic data were used to evaluate pre-hydraulic fracturing conditions in this undeveloped area. The same data were also collected for groundwater and surface-water sites about two months and one year after exploration hydraulic fracturing. No systematic differences in water chemistry were observed between pre- and post-hydraulic fracturing samples. Based on water chemistry of shallow groundwater, surface water, and from the production zone, the most useful constituents identified for monitoring for potential future incursion of reservoir-associated fluids into the near-surface environment are TDS (or electrical conductivity), chloride, propane, methanol, ethanol, and 2-butoxyethanol. Groundwater flow and transport models were developed to evaluate the potential movement of hydrocarbons and hydraulic fracturing fluids from the targeted zones, which are about 1800 to 3600 m beneath the land surface, to shallow groundwater (< 300 m below land surface). Model simulations indicate that hydraulic fracturing fluid remains contained within the target shales for at least 1,000 years for most development scenarios. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published B.V.

Bioassays took place with water samples before and after the treatment system and in the river, once treated water is discharged. Due to the high toxicity of the water collected at the mouth of the mine (before the treatment plant), the bioassay was designed and developed with respect to the exposed organism and the characteristics of the water. The results obtained in the screening experiment show the high efficiency of the treatment plant in terms of ecotoxicity, using Artemia sp. toxicity test. (C) 2017 The Authors.

In this context, a set of soil-column experiments were conducted aiming to replicate the conditions of infiltration basins using soil as a depuration media for wastewater quality increment previous to managed aquifer recharge. The results showed a decrease in a set of contaminants analysed, when comparing to the inflow concentrations, showing that retention and degradation are occurring inside the experimented soil. Ultimately a set of conclusions were achieved that allowed to define the composition of a reactive layer to be installed in real scale infiltration basins that will act as a complementary wastewater treatment method.

Impacts of climate change, climate variability and management on soil and water quality in wetlands of South Australia	15TH WATER-ROCK INTERACTION INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM, WRI-15	Procedia Earth and Planetary Science				15th Water-Rock Interaction International Symposium (WRI)	OCT 16-21, 2016	Evora, PORTUGAL					Wetland systems worldwide have been influenced by anthropic change, such that finding a natural baseline is rare. The consequences for ecosystem biodiversity and resilience at landscape scale have been enormous. The compounding effects of climate change and variability, knowledge gaps in landscape connectivity and feedbacks make the task of managing wetlands as part of a larger landscape difficult. This paper presents a summary of the impacts of natural and anthropic factors on contaminant mobilisation in sulfidic wetland systems of Australia. It highlights the role of water-soil/sediment interactions, acid-neutralizing and buffering mechanisms, and the irreversibility of some changes during the drying and wetting of sub-aqueous wetland soils.

It is characterized by the scarcity of water resources including groundwater, which can be threatened by pollution. Therefore, degradation of water quality is growing because the human activity is increasing. The agricultural, urban and industrial activities have contributed in recent decades to increase the potential contamination of water resources. The aim of this project is to assess the vulnerability of groundwater to pollution in the PreSaharan zones (case of Tafilalet plain), so it will be an important tool for making decision in the water management sector. The method applied in this work is the DRASTIC method based on the integration of several hydrogeological parameters in a multicriteria analysis. The results of this study show that the moderate class of vulnerability is the most dominant; it represents 56% of the aquifer area, followed by low vulnerability class with 40%, and the high vulnerability don't exceed 4%, while the very low and very high vulnerability classes are not encountered in the area study.

Water quality and chemistry of the groundwater have been investigated by a systematic screening operation of tube wells in a locality in West Bengal (India). Groundwater is predominantly of Ca-HCO3-type and is occasionally enriched with Na and Cl- in shallow wells (15-20 m) which may be an indicator of local pollution source. The groundwater As distribution and their relationship with land-use characteristics suggest that As release is also influenced by local land use conditions (e.g., sanitation, surface water bodies and agricultural practices). The interconnectivity of these land use conditions with the aquifer underneath often facilitates As release creating heterogeneity in their distribution. (C) 2017 The Authors.

The environmental concerns related to hydraulic fracturing has been greatly attracted. One of most important environmental concerns is regional water quality which may be contaminated by produced waters through induced and natural fractures and wastewater discharge. At present, the baseline water quality must be firstly obtained to identify potential pollution of the activity and monitoring indicators should be studied for better environmental monitoring. We sampled shallow groundwater, produced waters, shale rock and soil in the Jiaoshiba shale-gas region, SW China and measurements have included water chemistry and isotopes. Preliminary results show that the present shallow karst groundwater quality is pretty good with the total dissolved solids (TDS) ranging from 129 to 343 mg/L and with water chemistry type of HCO3-Ca, However, some groundwaters have been polluted by agricultural activities. Produced waters have relatively high salinity with TDS ranging from 2 to 14 g/L. Laboratory experiment of fracturing liquid and shale rock interaction at simulated reservoir conditions shows that TDS in the flowback fluid increases 10 times and Ca2+, Na+, Cl- and SO42- make dominant contributions. The main geochemical reactions are inferred to be pyrite oxidation and the dissolution of calcite, dolomite and plagioclase, resulting in increases of major ions in the flowback fluid. The inorganic geochemical monitoring indicators for shale gas exploration of the Silurian Longmaxi formation has been determined. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. The Authors.

CH4 isotopic composition (-24.4 parts per thousand < delta C-13-CH4 < -14.0 parts per thousand and 285 parts per thousand < delta H-2-CH4 < -218 parts per thousand) falls in the range of typical abiotic gas. In the case of Cabeco de Vide mineral waters, the understanding of the resource will help to preserve the mineral water quality, creating public interest. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Health and environmental concerns cross society as well as research; water-quality questions are important issues, and those related to selenium are increasingly so. Many discussions focus on the permissible quantities and value of the standard for drinking water of 10 mu g.L-1, because the safety margin between nutritional requirements and toxic effects is complex to establish. Transdisciplinary approaches integrating current scientific issues to provide consistent answers to the multiple questions arising on Se origins, mechanisms and toxicity are needed. New approaches involve multi-scales studies of Se dynamics and transfer processes from host rock to groundwater and, through the soil and drinking water, to the human population and an evaluation of its effects from deficiency to excess. Finally, the measures required to achieve water standards or recover quality in water bodies should also be assessed to evaluate the solutions from the indirect human health, economic and environmental aspects.

The presence of calcite in fractures of local rocks maintains an alkaline pH in all the mass water. Oxygenation condition inside reservoir is almost constant. According to the bathymetry, the mass balance displays a variation of properties which are seasonally controlled by hydrological events. High loads of elements were detected in solution during dry season (November 2015): sulfates present a load of 11,378.65 tons, confirming that main inlets in the reservoir are mine drainages. The Arsenic has a similar behavior: a greater load in solution during dry season, with 9.85 tons compared with other periods (less or equal to 0.5 tons). The greatest loads of iron and manganese are present in rainy season (20.43 and 9.15 tons respectively). This suggests the existence of a mobilization of precipitated minerals on the channel that feeds the mass water and reach the bottom of the reservoir where reducing conditions are dominant, favoring their release to the aqueous phase. Oxygen concentration decreases by half between the seasons due to organic matter oxidation. This trend continued in November, because quantities in solution were very high. (C) 2017 The Authors.

This system is localized at south of Chiapas state, SE Mexico. It is considered one of most beauties landscapes of the country. Main importance is due to climatic and hydrological regulation of this region. However anthropic activities as deforestation and waste water spills begin to produce risky conditions to water quality. This work presents spatial and temporal variability of water quality considering the study of ten lagoons through three sampling periods. Two of these periods of field work, (april and september 2013) consider sampling of only one point at surface in each lagoon. A very extensive sampling was developed in august 2014 in ten lagoons. Results show that this karstic system can be divided in two groups of water quality. First group of lakes contains calcic-magnesic-bicarbonated-sulfated waters and second group contains calcic-magnesic-bicarbonated waters.

Formation of waste-rock drainage water on massive sulfide deposits of the Urals (Russia)	15TH WATER-ROCK INTERACTION INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM, WRI-15	Procedia Earth and Planetary Science				15th Water-Rock Interaction International Symposium (WRI)	OCT 16-21, 2016	Evora, PORTUGAL					The waste-rock stockpiles of copper pyrite mines are enriched by sulphide minerals; therefore their dissolution is the reason for the acidic waters formation. Hydrochemical processes responsible for the water quality of the formed waste-rock stockpiles are studied using several sites of the Urals as the examples. Sulphide mineralization causes the sulfate composition of water, iron, aluminum and magnesium to prevail among the cations. The comparison of mine and waste-rock drainage composition shows that waste-rock waters are more mineralized: TDC is 3-5 times higher and the aluminum, iron, copper and zinc concentrations are 4-8 times higher. The composition of rocks forming mine drainage and waste rock drainage is similar, thus it can be hypothesized that the hydrogeochemical processes of mine drainage and of the waste-rock piles waters do not have significant differences. However, the degree of rock disintegration and a temperature gradient in dumps is higher, while the rate of water interchange is lower. The set of hydrodynamic, geomechanical and temperature factors promote the formation of more acidic mineralized waters of the dump body. Computer simulation (Visual MINTEQ ver. 3.0/3.1) has shown that with the rate of sulphides oxidation of 3.6.10(3) mol/hour, the sulphides mass in the dumps would produce acidic leach-water in several hundred years.

J	Burg, A; Gavrieli, I; Guttman, J				Burg, Avihu; Gavrieli, Ittai; Guttman, Joseph			Concurrent Salinization and Development ofAnoxic Conditions in a Confined Aquifer, Southern Israel	GROUNDWATER												An ancient, brackish, anoxic, and relatively hot water body exists within the Yarqon-Tanninim Aquifer in southern Israel. A hydrogeological-geochemical conceptual model is presented, whereby the low water quality is the outcome of three conditions that are met simultaneously: (1) Presence of an organic-rich unit with low permeability that overlies and confines the aquifer; the confining unit contains perched horizons with relatively saline water. (2) Local phreatic/roofed conditions within the aquifer that enable seepage of the organic-rich brackish water from above. The oxidation of the dissolved organic matter in the seeping water consumes the dissolved oxygen and continues through bacterial sulfate reduction, with H2S as a product. These exothermic reactions result in some heating. (3) The seeping water comprises a relatively large portion of the water volume. In the presented case study, the latter condition first developed in the Late Pleistocene following climate change, which led to a dramatic decline in recharge. Consequently, water flow in the local basin has nearly ceased, as evident by old water ages, specific isotopic composition, and nearly equipotential water levels. The continuous seepage from above into the almost stagnant water body has resulted in degraded water quality. Seepages of organic-rich brackish water exist at other sites throughout the aquifer but have limited impact on the salinity and redox conditions due to the dynamic water flow, which flushes the seeping water, that is, the third condition is not met. The coexistence of the above three conditions may explain the development of anoxic and saline groundwater in other aquifers worldwide.																	0017-467X	1745-6584					2017	55	2					183	198		10.1111/gwat.12474								WOS:000395640200007	27727479

Permeable Asphalt: A New Tool to Reduce Road Salt Contamination of Groundwater in Urban Areas	GROUNDWATER												Chloride contamination of groundwater in urban areas due to deicing is a well- documented phenomenon in northern climates. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of permeable pavement on degraded urban groundwater. Although low impact development practices have been shown to improve stormwater quality, no infiltration practice has been found to prevent road salt chlorides from entering groundwater. The few studies that have investigated chlorides in permeable asphalt have involved sampling directly beneath the asphalt; no research has looked more broadly at surrounding groundwater conditions. Monitoring wells were installed upgradient and downgradient of an 860m(2) permeable asphalt parking lot at the University of Connecticut (Storrs, Connecticut). Water level and specific conductance were measured continuously, and biweekly samples were analyzed for chloride. Samples were also analyzed for sodium (Na), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg). Analysis of variance analysis indicated a significantly (p< 0.001) lower geometric mean Cl concentration downgradient (303.7 mg/L) as compared to upgradient (1280 mg/L). Concentrations of all alkali metals increased upgradient and downgradient during the winter months as compared to nonwinter months, indicating that cation exchange likely occurred. Despite the frequent high peaks of chloride in the winter months as well as the increases in alkali metals observed, monitoring revealed lower Cl concentrations downgradient than upgradient for the majority of the year. These results suggest that the use of permeable asphalt in impacted urban environments with high ambient chloride concentrations can be beneficial to shallow groundwater quality, although these results may not be generalizable to areas with low ambient chloride concentrations.																	0017-467X	1745-6584					2017	55	2					237	243		10.1111/gwat.12454								WOS:000395640200012	27576128

Two centuries of nitrogen dynamics: Legacy sources and sinks in the Mississippi and Susquehanna River Basins	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Global flows of reactive nitrogen (N) have increased significantly over the last century in response to agricultural intensification and elevated levels of atmospheric deposition. Despite widespread implementation conservation measures, N concentrations in surface waters are often remaining steady or continuing to increase. Although such lack of response has been attributed to time lags associated with legacy N stores in subsurface reservoirs, it is unclear what the magnitudes of such stores are and how they are partitioned between shallow soil and deeper groundwater reservoirs. Here we have synthesized data to develop a 214year (1800-2014) trajectory of N inputs to the land surface of the continental U.S. We have concurrently developed a parsimonious, process-based model, Exploration of Long-tErM Nutrient Trajectories (ELEMeNT) that pairs this input trajectory with a travel time-based approach to simulate transport and retention along subsurface pathways. Using the model, we have reconstructed historic nitrate yields at the outlets of two major U.S. watersheds, the Mississippi River Basin (MRB) and Susquehanna River Basin (SRB). Our results show significant N loading above baseline levels in both watersheds before the widespread use of commercial N fertilizers, largely due to the conversion of forest and grassland to row crop agriculture. Model results also allow us to quantify the magnitudes of legacy N in soil and groundwater pools and to highlight the dominance of soil legacies in MRB and groundwater legacies in SRB. Approximately 55% and 18% of the current annual N loads in the MRB and SRB were found to be older than 10years of age.

Imaging Hydrological Processes in Headwater Riparian Seeps with Time-Lapse Electrical Resistivity	GROUNDWATER												Delineating hydrologic and pedogenic factors influencing groundwater flow in riparian zones is central in understanding pathways of water and nutrient transport. In this study, we combined two-dimensional time-lapse electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) (depth of investigation approximately 2m) with hydrometric monitoring to examine hydrological processes in the riparian area of FD-36, a small (0.4km(2)) agricultural headwater basin in the Valley and Ridge region of east-central Pennsylvania. We selected two contrasting study sites, including a seep with groundwater discharge and an adjacent area lacking such seepage. Both sites were underlain by a fragipan at 0.6m. We then monitored changes in electrical resistivity, shallow groundwater, and nitrate-N concentrations as a series of storms transitioned the landscape from dry to wet conditions. Time-lapse ERI revealed different resistivity patterns between seep and non-seep areas during the study period. Notably, the seep displayed strong resistivity reductions (similar to 60%) along a vertically aligned region of the soil profile, which coincided with strong upward hydraulic gradients recorded in a grid of nested piezometers (0.2- and 0.6-m depth). These patterns suggested a hydraulic connection between the seep and the nitrate-rich shallow groundwater system below the fragipan, which enabled groundwater and associated nitrate-N to discharge through the fragipan to the surface. In contrast, time-lapse ERI indicated no such connections in the non-seep area, with infiltrated rainwater presumably perched above the fragipan. Results highlight the value of pairing time-lapse ERI with hydrometric and water quality monitoring to illuminate possible groundwater and nutrient flow pathways to seeps in headwater riparian areas.																	0017-467X	1745-6584				JAN-FEB	2017	55	1					136	148		10.1111/gwat.12461								WOS:000393955900016	27618484					
J	Zhang, YH; Liang, SX; Sun, ZC				Zhang Yihui; Liang Shuxiu; Sun Zhaochen			Measurement and Numerical Study of Vertical Mixing Microstructure in the Bohai Strait	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Vertical mixing plays an important role in three-dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality models. The purpose of this study is to analyze the characteristics of vertical mixing in strong tidal waters and the simulation capability of turbulence closure models under the influence of flow velocity variations and temperature distribution. The distribution characteristics of thermocline and vertical mixing in the Bohai Strait is analyzed through field observations conducted using the Turbulence Ocean Microstructure Acquisition Profiler in summer. Based on the measured temperature and mixing data, three-dimensional numerical models are established with various temperature distribution and turbulence closure schemes. It is concluded that the vertical eddy viscosity K-m and the thermal-diffusion coefficient K-h, using the Mellor and Yamada level 2.5 (MY-2.5) and the k-epsilon turbulence closure models, exhibit a significant change with change in flow velocity and a time delay compared with the flow velocity process disregarding the effect of wind. The vertical mixing coefficients due to changing flow velocity under isothermality or temperature stratification could vary by one or two orders of magnitude, respectively. Simulated mixing coefficients using two different turbulence closure models exhibit different variations under isothermality and temperature stratification and have a significant discrepancy with the measurement data. Thermocline evolution is compared using three different methods for K-m and K-h. It is found that the temperature mixes gradually using constant mixing coefficients in the vertical direction. When the mixing coefficients are computed with the MY-2.5 and k-epsilon models, the temperature mixes rapidly in the shallow water zone. The mixing of temperature is even faster in the lower layer than in the upper layer in the deepwater zone, leading to the thermocline moving toward the upper layer. Moreover, the temperature mixes faster in the k-epsilon model than in the MY-2.5 model.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				JAN	2017	33	1					158	172		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-15-00235.1								WOS:000394926100014

GIS-based prediction of stream chemistry using landscape composition, wet areas, and hydrological flow pathways	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Landscape morphology exerts strong, scale-dependent controls on stream hydrology and biogeochemistry in heterogeneous catchments. We applied three descriptors of landscape structure at different spatial scales based on new geographic information system tools to predict variability in stream concentrations for a wide range of solutes (Al, Ba, Be, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Na, S, Si, Sr, Sc, Co, Cr, Ni, Cu, As, Se, Rb, Y, Cd, Sb, Cs, La, Pb, Th, U, DOC, and Cl) using a linear regression analysis. Results showed that less reactive elements, which can be expected to behave more conservatively in the landscape (e.g., Na, K, Ca, Mg, Cl, and Si), generally were best predicted from the broader-scale description of landscape composition (areal coverage of peat, tills, and sorted sediments). These results highlight the importance of mineral weathering as a source of some elements, which was best captured by landscape-scale descriptors of catchment structure. By contrast, more nonconservative elements (e.g., DOC, Al, Cd, Cs, Co, Th, Y, and U), were best predicted by defining wet areas and/or flow path lengths of different patches in the landscape. This change in the predictive models reflect the importance of peat deposits, such as organic-rich riparian zones and mire ecosystems, which are favorable environments for biogeochemical reactions of more nonconservative elements. As such, using this understanding of landscape influences on stream chemistry can provide improved mitigation strategies and management plans that specifically target source areas, so as to minimize mobilization of undesired elements into streams.

Phosphorus cycling in urban aquatic ecosystems: connecting biological processes and water chemistry to sediment P fractions in urban stormwater management ponds	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Phosphorus (P) dynamics in urban landscapes may differ from that in natural landscapes due to different P sources and unique environmental conditions. However, many aspects of P cycles in urban areas, especially within engineered aquatic ecosystems, remain largely unknown. Through this work, we aim to contribute to better understanding of P cycling in urban aquatic ecosystems by investigating P fractions in sediment and their relationship with ambient chemistry in surface water from six urban stormwater management ponds located in Ontario, Canada. We found that organic P contributed up to 75% of total P in pond sediment, but this percentage decreased significantly between our two sampling events in June and September 2012. This decrease coincided with increased rates of extracellular enzyme (especially phosphatase) activities, which is indicative of fast mineralization processes in these ecosystems. Moreover, the decreased sediment organic P was matched by increased water column P concentration. This inverse relationship suggests that the large organic P pool in pond sediment, and its fast decomposition, contributed to internal release of P from sediment and increased water column P concentrations. The dominance of organic P in sediment and the putative role of relevant biological processes (i.e., decomposition and productivity) in urban ponds found in this study strongly contrast with classic water management expectations of physicochemically controlled P dynamics and long-term P storage in sediment of aquatic ecosystems. This difference suggests that urban stormwater ponds may perform poorly in terms of P retention and thereby contribute to poor water quality in terms of P pollution to downstream urban watersheds. Thus, stormwater pond design and future management strategies should consider these biogeochemical features of urban ponds, including internal P release, to help prevent eutrophication of downstream ecosystems.																	0168-2563	1573-515X				JAN	2017	132	1-2					203	212		10.1007/s10533-017-0293-1								WOS:000394351700012

The water quality parameters include pH, COD, DO, alkalinity, hardness, chloride, TDS, total suspended solids (TSS), turbidity, electric conductivity and phosphate. Regression analysis was performed using atmospherically corrected true reflectance values of original OLI bands, images after applying enhancement techniques (NDVI, principal components) and the values of the water quality parameters at different sample locations to obtain the empirical relationship. Most of the parameters were well correlated with single OLI bands with R-2 greater than 0.5, whereas phosphate showed a good correlation with NDVI image. The parameters like pH and DO showed a good relation with the principal component I and IV, respectively. The high concentration of pH, COD, turbidity and TSS and low concentration of DO infers the anthropogenic impact on lake.																	1010-6049	1752-0762					2017	32	3					274	285		10.1080/10106049.2016.1140818								WOS:000393207700004						
J	Li, SY; Bush, RT; Mao, R; Xiong, LH; Ye, C				Li, Siyue; Bush, Richard T.; Mao, Rong; Xiong, Lihua; Ye, Chen			Extreme drought causes distinct water acidification and eutrophication in the Lower Lakes (Lakes Alexandrina and Albert), Australia	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Droughts are set to increase in frequency and magnitude with climate change and water extraction, and understanding their influence on ecosystems is urgent in the Holocene. Low rainfall across the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) of Australia resulted in an unprecedented water level decline in the Lower Lakes (Lakes Alexandrina and Albert) at the downstream end of the river system. A comprehensive data covering pre-drought (2004-2006), drought (2007-2010) and post-drought (2010-2013) was firstly used to unravel drought effects on water quality in the contrasting main parts and margins of the two Lakes, particularly following water acidification resulting from acid sulfate soil oxidation. Salinity, nutrients and Chl-a significantly increased during the drought in the Lake main waterbody, while pH remained stable or showed minor shifts. In contrast to the Lake Alexandrina, total dissolved solid (TDS) and electrical conductivity (EC) during the post-drought more than doubled the pre-drought period in the Lake Albert as being a terminal lake system with narrow and shallow entrance. Rewetting of the exposed pyrite containing sediment resulted in very low pH (below 3) in Lake margins, which positively contributed to salinity increases via SO42- release and limestone dissolution. Very acidic water (pH 2-3) was neutralised naturally by lake refill, but aerial limestone dosing was required for neutralisation of water acidity during the drought period. The Lower Lakes are characterized as hypereutrophic with much higher salinity, nutrient and algae concentrations than guideline levels for aquatic ecosystem. These results suggest that, in the Lower Lakes, drought could cause water quality deterioration through water acidification and increased nutrient and Chl-a concentrations, more effective water management in the lake catchment is thus crucial to prevent the similar water quality deterioration since the projected intensification of droughts. A comparative assessment on lake resilience and recovering processes should be undertaken with a post-drought monitoring program. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, there is only limited information, and even fewer physical measurements, assessing the rate of sediment accumulation in reservoirs behind dams. Many of the dams within the Great Lakes Watershed were constructed between 100 and 120 years ago, and there is reasonable concern that these dams and their associated reservoirs may be reaching capacity with respect to sediment storage. As a reservoir reaches its sediment storage capacity, there are numerous risks. Excess sediment can compromise the water intake for supply systems. Dam failure or removal can potentially allow large quantities of impounded sediment to migrate downstream, negatively impacting fish habitat and water quality. This research investigates the historical function of dams as sediment storage points. Also, this research assesses the effect of anthropogenic influences including land use change and dam construction on sediment yield and accumulation within the Lake Rockwell and Ballville Dam watershed. To better understand the historical and current sediment yield within the Lake Erie watershed, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) models of the Lake Rockwell and Ballville Dam watersheds were developed. The resulting model suggests that the average of sediment accumulation rate within Lake Rockwell Dam reservoir varies between the minimum of 1.6 and the maximum of 4.6 g/cm(2)/yr from 1988 to 2007. Within the Ballville Dam reservoir, the rate varies between the minimum of 2.6 and the maximum of 23.2 g/cm(2)/yr from 1980 to 1999. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, calibration of the agricultural-hydrological system models is challenging because of model complexity, the existence of strong parameter correlation, and significant computational requirements. Therefore, only a limited number of simulations can be allowed in any attempt to find a near-optimal solution within an affordable time, which greatly restricts the successful application of the model. The goal of this study is to locate the optimal solution of the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM2) given a limited simulation time, so as to improve the model simulation and help make rational and effective agricultural-hydrological decisions. To this end, we propose a computationally efficient global optimization procedure using sparse-grid based surrogates. We first used advanced sparse grid (SG) interpolation to construct a surrogate system of the actual RZWQM2, and then we calibrate the surrogate model using the global optimization algorithm, Quantum-behaved Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO). As the surrogate model is a polynomial with fast evaluation, it can be efficiently evaluated with a sufficiently large number of times during the optimization, which facilitates the global search. We calibrate seven model parameters against five years of yield, drain flow, and NO3-N loss data from a subsurface-drained corn-soybean field in Iowa. Results indicate that an accurate surrogate model can be created for the RZWQM2 with a relatively small number of SG points (i.e., RZWQM2 runs). Compared to the conventional QPSO algorithm, our surrogate based optimization method can achieve a smaller objective function value and better calibration performance using a fewer number of expensive RZWQM2 executions, which greatly improves computational efficiency.

The objectives of this study were to isolate the impact of land leveling, performed on an agricultural field (Quebec, Canada) in spring 2012, on runoff and TSS load and to make recommendations to attenuate adverse environmental impacts of land leveling, if any. A total of 66 runoff events, including 22 with total suspended sediments (TSS) load estimates, from 2010 to 2014 were analyzed. To this end, deterministic models were coupled to an adaptive Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to estimate the unknown distribution of the parameters representing the most important effects, namely land leveling, tillage, and crop cover. Simulated runoff events were generated by the hydrological model SWMM version 5 while simulated TSS loads were generated by an empirical equation based on the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation version 2 (RUSLE2). Thanks to the algorithm used, it was demonstrated that land leveling significantly decreased total runoff volume at least for the two following years. The impact on peak flow was mixed: land leveling significantly decreased peak flow for a typical stratiform rainfall event but the effect was unclear for a typical convective rainfall event. Based on 90% confidence interval, TSS load increased from 10 to 1000 times immediately after land leveling"(spring 2012) compared to pre-land leveling events. The TSS load increase remained significant one year after land leveling, with TSS loads 5-20 times higher compared to pre-land leveling events. It would thus be recommended to grow crops with high ground coverage ratios coupled with cover crops during the year when land leveling is done. Sediment retention structures could also be installed at the beginning of the land leveling process to provide protection against the short term and delayed impact on water quality.

Monitoring the seasonal dynamics of physicochemical parameters from Atoyac River basin (Puebla), Central Mexico: multivariate approach	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Spatiotemporal variations of ten physicochemical parameters in the water quality of Atoyac River basin, Central Mexico, were obtained from 22 sampling sites (66 samples in total) located all along the basin for three different seasons (dry, rainy and winter). Multivariate statistical techniques such as correlation matrix, factor analysis (FA) and cluster analysis (CA) were used as a tool to understand the process. Physicochemical parameters such as temperature (T), pH, conductivity (lambda), dissolved oxygen (DO), spectral absorption coefficient (SAC), oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), turbidity, 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total suspended solids (TSS) were analyzed. Extremely high values of pH (10.24), conductivity (1870 mu S/cm) and reduced redox potential (-370.1 mV) were observed in the dry season, whereas elevated TSS of 2996 mg/L was detected during the rainy season. The results elucidated high influence from the adjoining industrial, agricultural and urban zones, making the river unsuitable for life. FA generated varifactors, which accounted for cumulative % of 75.04 (dry), 76.22 (rainy) and 79.96 (winter) clearly grouping the external factors responsible for these significant values indicating the source of contamination. Cluster analysis facilitated the ease of classifying the sampling sites based on the similarities of physicochemical parameters. This study carried out in different seasons using multivariate statistical techniques would definitely prove to be an efficient tool for the restoration and establishing the real-time monitoring stations along this important river basin of Mexico.

J	Arslan, H				Arslan, Hakan			Determination of temporal and spatial variability of groundwater irrigation quality using geostatistical techniques on the coastal aquifer of Carsamba Plain, Turkey, from 1990 to 2012	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The present study was conducted to investigate variations in groundwater quality parameters between 1990 and 2012, and to assess the suitability of groundwater for irrigation. Groundwater samples were taken in the summers of 1990 and 2012, and hydrochemical characteristics were investigated through Piper and USSL diagrams. The electrical conductivity (EC), sodium percentage (% Na), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), magnesium hazard (MR), potential salinity (PS), and Kelly's ratios (KI) were used as the indicators for the water quality. Water quality parameters were assessed through geostatistical techniques and geographical information systems. Initially, semivariograms were determined for each water quality index, and spatial distribution maps were created for each sampling period through ordinary kriging techniques. Results revealed excessive increases in EC, Na, and Cl values with time. EC values of groundwater were over 1.25 dS/m in 4.64% of the study area in 1990. The area increased to 37.38% in the year 2012. With regard to the Kelly Index, there were not any problems in the study area in 1990, but problems were encountered over 5.75% of the study area in the year 2012. While the ratio of problematic sites with regard to RSC was 2.44% in 1990, the ratio increased to 12.13% in the year 2012. Similar increases were also observed in other water quality parameters except for MR. Higher deteriorations were observed in water quality parameters through the eastern sections of the study area. From 1990 to 2012, increased deteriorations were observed in water quality parameters, and excessive groundwater withdrawal and resultant seawater intrusion were considered as the basic reasons for such deteriorations. Therefore, groundwater withdrawals along the coastal lines should be performed in a controlled fashion, and water quality should continuously be monitored.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JAN	2017	76	1							38	10.1007/s12665-016-6375-x								WOS:000392286300038

The threat to groundwater contamination is increasing day by day due to rapid increase in industrialization and urbanization. The present study aims at assessing the groundwater quality contamination threat around industrial cluster at Rajasthan State Industrial Development and Investment Corporation (RIICO) in Jaipur district of Rajasthan, India. The cluster does not have common effluent treatment plant, and very few units have their effluent treatment plants. Groundwater samples were collected around the industrial cluster and its vicinity and analyzed for major cations, anions and trace elements. The water quality data indicate that total dissolved solids exceed the drinking water standard set by the Bureau of Indian Standards in few samples, and trace elements of health significance are not detected in any sample. The soil analysis indicates that only the top surface near the point of disposal of the treated effluent is affected. In view of the thick alluvium of 60-80 m and the water table above 30 m, the effluents are retarded significantly before reaching the water table. The sodium adsorption ratio of water samples indicates its suitability for irrigation and falls in the category of fairly suitable to excellent. Piper plot reveals that dominant cations are Na+, K++ and Mg++ and dominant anions are HCO3- and CO3-. The Gibbs plot indicates that rock-water interactions influence the groundwater quality. The study reveals that the groundwater quality from most of the sources meets the requirements of drinking water standards, and there is enough environmental space available for the expansion of industrial belt in this RIICO hub.

Reconstructing the formation of a costal aquifer in Nampula province, Mozambique, from ERT and IP methods for water prospection	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												In continental margin basins, the hydrogeological setting is complex due to transgression/regression events that removed old sediments in the basin and formed new geologic units. Due to the geological complexity, the use of vertical electrical sounding has proven to be insufficient for groundwater explorations. The lack of understanding the geological underground has resulted in many boreholes with low yield or poor water quality. By performing electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and induced polarization (IP) measurements in 11 villages in Mongicual district, three different layers covering the basement were identified: a weathered autochthon layer, a weathered allochthon layer (paleo-coastal dune) and eolian white sand layer. The drilling at successful boreholes penetrates formations where the resistivity value is between 220 and 770 Omega m, whereas at unsuccessful boreholes the lower parts of the drilled range have resistivity values higher than 770 Omega m. Also, the thickness ratio of the weathered and semi-weathered layer in the unsuccessful boreholes is less than 1/3, whereas in all successful boreholes the ration is higher than 1/2. The difference between autochthon and allochthon layers was detected by heavy minerals content in the red eolian sand layer (Tupuito formation) that increased the chargeability value. The groundwater with a conductivity higher than 2000 mu S/cm is linked to the white eolian sand. The surface extension of white eolian sand layer is small to be mapped; therefore, bymapping the eolian white sand formation and the use of ERT and enhanced with IP method would lower the failure rate.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JAN	2017	76	1							36	10.1007/s12665-016-6364-0								WOS:000392286300036

This study has been done according to available information in the databank of Khuzestan Water and Power Authority and also new measures in the area. Based on available data, the water quality of Kheirabad and Zohre River in sampling stations is not suitable for drinking. The study area is located on Khuzestan Province-Behbahan city, Iran. The hardness of water samples is in the category of very hard (over 300 ppm CaCO3), and Fe, Mn and Pb values are more than standards. In new sampling and 12-month monitoring of anions, cations, heavy metals and microbial parameters indicate that Hg, Cd, Cr, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn, OC, T-coliforms and fecal coliforms in all stations for agricultural purposes and surface waters are more than standards and the sewage factories near the river have a noticeable effect on these contaminations. Furthermore, the high values of phosphate, ammonia and nitrate of some stations in wet seasons can be generated from agriculture wastes near the villages of the study area. In addition, because of outcrops of Gachsaran Formation in some stations, the concentration of ions is more than standards. So the results of Schuler diagrams indicate the water surface in the most cases is not suitable for drinking and based on Wilcox diagram all stations are located in C4S4 class.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JAN	2017	76	1							15	10.1007/s12665-016-6291-0								WOS:000392286300015

Surface water pathways and fluxes of metals under changing environmental conditions and human interventions in the Selenga River system	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												This paper presents the results of novel field campaigns in the extensive (447,000 km(2)) Selenga River basin, through which 304 samples of river water and 308 samples of suspended matter were collected during high and low water periods between 2011 and 2013. The Selenga River is the largest tributary (more than 50% of the inflow) to the Lake Baikal. Due to ongoing hydroclimatic change and human pressures under conditions of economic growth, the rivers of the area experience significant change in water quality. A key issue for improved understanding of regional impacts of the environmental change is to disentangle the influence of climate change from that of other pressures within the catchment. Our research aims to evaluate the pathways and mass flows of heavy metals and metalloids both in dissolved and suspended forms, taking a basin- scale perspective that previously has not been fully pursued in the Lake Baikal region. Results showed quality deterioration over short distances due to strong impact of hot spots from urban and industrial activities, including mining. The determined enrichment of dissolved metals in waters of Selenga River as well as the spatial and temporal variability of water and suspended sediment composition is further analyzed in the context of climatic, hydrological and land use drivers.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JAN	2017	76	1							1	10.1007/s12665-016-6304-z								WOS:000392286300001

Leather processing and its possible impact on groundwater quality in Silk Road sites: a case study from Chennai, India	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Water plays an important role in human civilisation. Since ancient times people started to settle in regions with ensured water availability. Trade was an important factor for the development of civilisation. Silk Road is an important route used for the trading between China and other countries across Eurasia. Not only silk, many goods including leather were exchanged during trading. Leather was processing lead to release of large amount of wastewater. This study was carried out to understand how the leather processing would have affected the groundwater quality in Silk Road sites by studying the current scenarios of groundwater quality near tanning industries. Chennai and nearby cities such as Ranipet and Vaniyambadi are chosen for case studies. Groundwater quality around the tanneries was poor due to high electrical conductivity and concentration of chromium. This is due to the effluents released by the tanneries into the ground or open drains without proper treatment. Similarly, the leather processing in Silk Road sites would have also affected the groundwater quality.

Some of these geothermal resources have been used for power generation and direct heating. Most of the high enthalpy geothermal systems are located in western part of Turkey. Alasehir is the most important geothermal site in western part of Turkey. Many geothermal wells have been drilled in Alasehir Plain to produce the geothermal fluid from the deep reservoir in the last 10 years. A blowout accident happened during a geothermal well drilling operation in Alasehir Plain, and significant amount of geothermal fluid surfaced out along the fault zone in three locations. When drilling string entered the reservoir rock about 1000 m, blowout occurred. As the well head preventer system was closed because of the blowout, high-pressure fluid surfaced out along the fault zone cutting the Neogene formation. In order to understand the geothermal fluid effects on groundwater chemistry, physical and chemical compositions of local cold groundwater were monitored from May 2012 to September 2014 in the study area. The geothermal fluid was found to be of Na-HCO3 water type, and especially, arsenic and boron concentrations reached levels as high as 3 and 127 mg/L, respectively. The concentrations of arsenic and boron in the geothermal fluid and groundwater exceeded the maximum allowable limits given in the national and international standards for drinking water quality. According to temporally monitored results, geothermal fluid has extremely high mineral content which influenced the quality of groundwater resources of the area where water resource is commonly used for agricultural irrigation.

J	Varanka, S; Hjort, J				Varanka, Sanna; Hjort, Jan			Spatio-temporal aspects of the environmental factors affecting water quality in boreal rivers	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												River water quality is the outcome of multiple processes and factors, which vary spatially and temporally. In this study, the key spatial and temporal scales and the most important environmental factors explaining river water quality at these scales were analysed by generalized additive models (GAMs). Water quality was studied through total phosphorus (median = 61.9 mu g l(-1)) and nitrogen (1388.1 mu g l(-1)), pH (6.7) and water colour (143.3 mg Pt l(-1)). Environmental factors covered variables from land use/cover, climate and other landscape characteristics. The spatial scales used were the closest 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1000 m buffer zones around the river channel, in addition to the entire catchment area. Temporality was studied through the entire year and four periods, which were determined by the natural variation in discharge. In the comparison of spatial scales of environmental factors, the variation in phosphorus, nitrogen and water colour was best explained using environmental data from the broadest scale, the entire catchment. In contrast, the variation in pH was best explained using data from the closest (50 m) buffer zone, the riparian area. In modelling temporal scales, the variation in water quality variables was best explained during discharge maximum periods and when the environmental data covering the entire year were considered. Nutrients were related specifically to agriculture, water colour to lake percentage and pH to pastures. The results showed the suitability of GAMs in water quality studies.

J	Ye, M; Sun, HW; Hallas, K				Ye, Ming; Sun, Huaiwei; Hallas, Katie			Numerical estimation of nitrogen load from septic systems to surface water bodies in St. Lucie River and Estuary Basin, Florida	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Nitrogen pollution is one of the most prevalent and challenging environmental problems worldwide. Wastewater treatment using onsite sewage treatment and disposal systems (aka septic systems) is one source of nitrogen sources in the environment. This study presents a numerical study for estimating nitrogen load from septic systems to surface water bodies in the St. Lucie River and Estuary Basin, Florida, USA. The load estimation is conducted using an ArcGIS-based nitrogen load estimation toolkit, a screening-level modeling software that considers key mechanisms (i.e., advection, dispersion, and denitrification) controlling nitrogen transport as well as spatial variability of model parameters (e.g., hydraulic conductivity, porosity, septic system locations, and surface water bodies). The simulated nitrogen plumes and load estimates demonstrate the importance of considering spatial variability in the load estimation for nitrogen pollution management. The load estimates are strongly correlated with nitrogen concentrations in surface water quality data, suggesting that septic systems are an important factor for water quality deterioration in the St. Lucie River. The estimates can be used directly to support Basin Management Action Plan (BMAP). Evaluating the load estimates in the BMAP context indicates that nitrogen load from septic systems is a significant nitrogen source in the St. Lucie River and Estuary Basin. It is found in this study that the load estimates depend on lengths of flow paths, groundwater flow velocities, and soil drainage conditions. These findings are useful for nitrogen pollution management in similar areas facing nitrogen pollution problems.

Spatial fit between water quality policies and hydrologic ecosystem services in an urbanizing agricultural landscape	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Sustaining hydrologic ecosystem services is critical for human wellbeing but challenged by land use for agriculture and urban development. Water policy and management strive to safeguard hydrologic services, yet implementation is often fragmented. Understanding the spatial fit between water polices and hydrologic services is needed to assess the spatial targeting of policy portfolios at landscape scales. We investigated spatial fit between 30 different public water policies and four hydrologic services (surface and groundwater quality, freshwater supply, and flood regulation) in the Yahara Watershed (Wisconsin, USA)-a Midwestern landscape that typifies tensions between agriculture, urban development, and freshwater resources. Spatial extent of water policy implementation was mapped, and indicators of hydrologic services were quantified for subwatersheds using empirical estimates and validated spatial models. We found a spatial misfit between the overall spatial implementation of water policy and regions of water quality concern, indicating a need for better targeting. Water quality policies can also be leveraged to protect other hydrologic services such as freshwater supply and flood regulation. Individual policy application areas varied substantially in their spatial congruence with each hydrologic service, indicating that not all services are protected by a single policy and highlighting the need for a broad spectrum of policies to sustain hydrologic services in diverse landscapes. We also identified where future policies could be targeted for improving hydrologic services. Joint spatial analysis of policies and ecosystem services is effective for assessing spatial aspects of institutional fit, and provides a foundation for guiding future policy efforts.

The integration of geochemical methods, multivariate statistical analysis, and geostatistical approaches were carried out on 169 groundwater samples to elucidate the regional factors and processes that influencing the geochemical composition of groundwater in coastal shallow aquifer of Terengganu, Malaysia. Hydrochemical modelling revealed that the abundance of Ca and Mg was contributed by carbonate and silicate weathering while higher HCO3 and Cl were resulted from reverse ion exchange reaction. Therefore, the dominant hydrogeochemical facies of groundwater was Ca-Mg-HCO3-Cl type. The influence of salinization resulting from seawater mixing to the groundwater was corroborated by Cl/HCO3 ratio, which affected around 50.9% of the groundwater samples slightly or moderately. Spatial mapping using ordinary kriging found that the threat of sea water intrusion is more prominent in the major river confluence especially around Terengganu and Marang River in the northeast and Dungun and Kemaman River confluence in southeast of study area. Moreover, factor analyses concluded that salinization, anthropogenic activities, reverse ion exchange, weathering processes, agricultural impact, and seasonal variations were the factors that regulate 63% of the major ion chemistry in study area. Finally, these findings showed the importance of understanding the hydrochemical characteristics for effective utilization, aquifer protection, and prediction of changes to minimize the effects of salinization and reduce human pollution such as agriculture and urbanization. It is essential steps in order to safeguard the utilization of groundwater resources for future generations.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				JAN	2017	10	2							49	10.1007/s12517-016-2828-5								WOS:000392065200029

We obtained and compiled the recent 30 years' field observational data on nutrients and phytoplankton communities to explore the changing ecosystem. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentration (DIN) has significantly increased, while phosphate concentration (DIP) dramatically decreased because of costal anthropogenic influence. The limited factors for phytoplankton have changed from nitrogen in the 1980s to phosphate in the mid-1990s. The net-collected phytoplankton communities has the miniaturized trend, while there is drastic increase of Chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentration. Even though the diatoms still dominate in phytoplankton community, the dominant species have slightly changed. The alga bloom greatly changed from diatoms dominated to dinoflagellates due to changes of nutrient structure. All these changes on nutrients and phytoplankton communities appear to be closely associated with human activities along the coast of the Daya Bay. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Fluoride contamination in groundwater resources of Alleppey, southern India	GEOSCIENCE FRONTIERS												Alleppey is one of the thickly populated coastal towns of the Kerala state in southern India. Groundwater is the main source of drinking water for the 240,991 people living in this region. The groundwater is being extracted from a multi-layer aquifer system of unconsolidated to semi-consolidated sedimentary formations, which range in age from Recent to Tertiary. The public water distribution system uses dug and tube wells. Though there were reports on fluoride contamination, this study reports for the first time excess fluoride and excess salinity in the drinking water of the region. The quality parameters, like Electrical Conductivity ( EC) ranges from 266 to 3900 ms/cm, the fluoride content ranges from 0.68 to 2.88 mg/L, and the chloride ranges between the 5.7 to 1253 mg/L. The mainwater types are Na-HCO3, NaCO3 and Na-Cl. The aqueous concentrations of F- and CO32- show positive correlation whereas F- and Ca2+ show negative correlation. The source of fluoride in the groundwater could be from dissolution of fluorapatite, which is a common mineral in the Tertiary sediments of the area. Long residence time, sedimente-groundwater interaction and facies changes (Ca-HCO3 to Na-HCO3) during groundwater flow regime are the major factors responsible for the high fluoride content in the groundwater of the area. High strontium content and high EC in some of the wells indicate saline water intrusion that could be due to the excess pumping from the deeper aquifers of the area. The water quality index computation has revealed that 62% of groundwater belongs to poor quality and is not suitable for domestic purposes as per BIS and WHO standards. Since the groundwater is the only source of drinking water in the area, proper treatment strategies and regulating the groundwater extraction are required as the quality deterioration poses serious threat to human health.

While complex computer simulation models can be used to identify these areas, resources needed for using such models are beyond reach for most water resources managers. Soil and water conservationists need simple, spatially explicit tools such as the USDA-NRCS's Soil Vulnerability Index (WI) to evaluate the inherent vulnerability of soils and the risk they pose to water quality when used for row crop agriculture. In this study, the SVI was evaluated in the Goodwater Creek Experimental Watershed (GCEW), a claypan watershed in Missouri, using three methods: professional judgment, comparison to the Conductivity Claypan Index (CCI) developed specifically for claypan soils, and comparison to model results. Factors affecting the critical areas identified by each method were assessed and classified areas were compared. Slope and depth to claypan had the most variability in GCEW and were found to be influential in determining area classification by each index. While the original definition of SVI included the soil type representative slope from the USDA SSURGO database, slope values provided by a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) improved the index usefulness by classifying visibly degraded and non-degraded areas in different categories. High and moderately high vulnerability areas identified with SVI, CCI and model results with DEM slopes were consistent and matched professional judgment. Additional testing of SVI is recommended in areas characterized by soils of different permeability and under different climates.
