Use of water quality surrogates to estimate total phosphorus concentrations in Iowa rivers	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: The study was focused on total phosphorus (TP) concentrations measured in rivers in Iowa, a Midwestern state located in the central United States. Study focus: Accurate measurement of TP concentrations in rivers is needed to quantify loads and evaluate the progress of nutrient reduction strategies. We evaluated the relation of water quality surrogates, turbidity, orthophosphorus (OP), chlorophyll a, chloride and discharge to TP concentrations at 43 different river monitoring sites over a 15-year period. New hydrological insights for the region: TP concentrations were highly correlated to turbidity (0.78 +/- 0.20) and OP (0.69 +/- 0.13) across all sites and less correlated to chlorophyll a (0.07 +/- 0.15), chloride (-0.10 +/- 0.24) and discharge (0.41 +/- 0.23). When the regression models included OP as a variable, the mean r(2) for all 43 sites was 0.90 +/- 0.08 and ten of the 43 sites had r2 values greater than 0.95. When OP was excluded in the regression model, the overall mean r2 values decreased to 0.72 +/- 0.14 and for six of the river sites, the r2 value decreased by 50%. Other variables (discharge, chlorophyll a, chloride) were included in the regression equations on a case-by-case basis. Including OP in the regression models was critically important for rivers draining the tile-drained Des Moines Lobe region.																	2214-5818					AUG	2017	12						111	121		10.1016/j.ejrh.2017.04.006								WOS:000415815000007

Study focus: Cretaceous sedimentary rocks in the western United States generally pose challenges to water quality, often through mobilization of salts and trace metals by irrigation. However, in the Arkansas River Basin of Colorado, patchy exposure of multiple Cretaceous formations has made it difficult to identify which formations are most problematic. This paper examines water quality in surface-water inflows along a 26-km reach of the Arkansas River relative to the presence or absence of the Cretaceous Niobrara Formation within the watershed. New hydrological insights for the region: Principal component analysis (PCA) shows Niobrarainfluenced inflows have distinctive geochemistry, particularly with respect to Na, Mg, SO42-, and Se. Uranium concentrations are also greater in Niobrara-influenced inflows. During the irrigation season, median dissolved solids, Se, and U concentrations in Niobrara-influenced inflows were 83%, 646%, and 55%, respectively, greater than medians where Niobrara Formation surface exposures were absent. During the non-irrigation season, which better reflects geologic influence, the differences were more striking. Median dissolved solids, Se, and U concentrations in Niobrara-influenced inflows were 288%, 863%, and 155%, respectively, greater than median concentrations where the Niobrara Formation was absent. Identification of the Niobrara Formation as a disproportionate source for dissolved solids, Se, and U will allow for more targeted studies and management, particularly where exposures underlie irrigated agriculture.

Many the groundwater samples belong to the Na+ - Cl-, Na2SO4- type, followed by Ca2+ - Mg2+ - Cl- type. Only a few samples are of the Na+ - HCO3- type. The spatial distributions of the major ions describe similar anomalies, with the highest concentrations found at the extreme northeastern margin of the oasis, as well as in its northern and northwestern parts. Fe is the most abundant toxic metal, followed by Cu and Mn. Anomalies of Cr, Ni and Zn are also detected. Rock/water interactions strongly affect the chemical composition of the groundwater. Dissolution and cation exchange are the main processes controlling the hydrogeochemistry. Most of the irrigation groundwater problems in the study area may be resolved using an effective drainage system. The estimated total annual dose due to ingestion of U-238, Th-232 and K-40 in groundwater samples reveals that the groundwater is safe for human consumption. However, the toxic metal content of the Bahariya groundwater exceeds the permissible levels for both irrigation and consumption, and the water must be filtered through suitable membranes to exclude these toxic metals. Regular monitoring of the quality of this water for drinking is strictly required.

J	Miller, JD; Hutchins, M				Miller, James D.; Hutchins, Michael			The impacts of urbanisation and climate change on urban flooding and urban water quality: A review of the evidence concerning the United Kingdom	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: United Kingdom (UK). Study focus: Climate change and urbanization pose significant threats for flooding and water quality in urban areas. This paper reviews the evidence concerning the combined impacts of urbanisation and climate on the urban water environment of inland catchments of the United Kingdom and assesses the degree of confidence in reported directions of change and response. It also assesses the utility of the evidence for setting environmental legislation and managing the urban water environment in the future and identifies knowledge gaps that limit effective and management interventions. New hydrological insights: There is a lack of nationally research focused on the dual impacts of climate change and urbanisation on flooding and water quality in UK urban areas. This is despite there being a clear acceptance that flood risk is increasing, water quality is generally not meeting desirable levels, and that combined population and climate change projections pose a pressing challenge. The available evidence has been found to be of medium-high confidence that both pressures will result in (i) an increase in pluvial and fluvial flood risk, and (ii) further reduction in water quality caused by point source pollution and altered flow regimes. Evidence concerning urban groundwater flooding, diffuse pollution and water temperature was found to be more sparse and was ascribed a low-medium confidence that both pressures will further exacerbate existing issues. The confidence ascribed to evidence was also found to reflect the utility of current science for setting policy and urban planning. Recurring factors that limit the utility of evidence for managing the urban environment includes: (i) climate change projection uncertainty and suitability, (ii) lack of sub-daily projections for storm rainfall, (iii) the complexity of managing and modelling the urban environment, and (iv) lack of probable national-scale future urban land use projections. Suitable climate products are increasingly being developed and their application in applied urban research is critical in the wake of a series of extreme flooding events across the UK and timely for providing state-of-the-art evidence on which to base possible future water quality legislation in a post Brexit-WFD era.

Pilot-scale drinking water treatment plant: effects of disinfection alternatives and filtration systems	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												A pilot-scale drinking water treatment plant was designed and manufactured to control disinfection by-product (DBP) levels through better removal of natural organic matter (NOM) and the application of disinfectant alternatives that produce lower DBPs levels. The designed pilot plant consists of several stages including disinfection (by chlorine, chlorine dioxide, or ozone), coagulation-flocculation (using alum or alum + cationic polymer), and a sedimentation and gravity filtration system, such as sand or granular activated carbon (GAC). The efficiency of the designed plant was evaluated according to the water quality produced in terms of turbidity, pH, alkalinity, total organic carbon, and ultraviolet absorption at 254 nm (UV254), phytoplankton, and DBP levels. Improved reductions of turbidity, algae, and NOM, and consequently lower DBP levels, could be obtained. The lowest DBPs levels were obtained through the treatment sequence: ClO2/modified coagulation/GAC, due to the combination of the high oxidation powers of ClO2 with the high adsorption capacity of GAC.

The influences of ions (Mg2+, SO42-, PO43-, SiO32-, Cl- and H+) on the performance of HPMA against CaCO3 scale are investigated by conducting static test. The effect of the mass ratio (beta = [HPMA]/[CaCO3]) on the performance of HPMA against CaCO3 scale is also studied. The effect of HPMA on the crystals of CaCO3 is examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results can be summarized as follows: the effect of beta on the performance of HPMA against CaCO3 scale mainly depends on CaCO3 concentration; the presence of Mg2+, SO42-, PO43- and SiO32- can change adsorption equilibrium of carboxyl ion of HPMA onto the CaCO3 crystal growth sites; both SO42- and SiO32- can enhance the performance of HPMA, but SiO32- causes performance declining in the presence of PO43- ; the presence of PO43- and Mg2+ may weaken the performance; Cl-can improve the performance and this effect increases with increasing Cl-concentration; pH value has a remarkable influence on the performance; SEM morphologies of CaCO3 scale are distorted with dosage of HPMA; Ca-HPMA formation is confirmed using Fourier transform infrared spectra.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				AUG	2017	85						36	45		10.5004/dwt.2017.21280								WOS:000412882200005						
J	Ramezanianpour, M; Sivakumar, M; Stojanovski, AG				Ramezanianpour, Mohammad; Sivakumar, Muttucumaru; Stojanovski, Aleksandar Gocev			Grey water treatment using a solar powered electro-coagulator and vacuum membrane distillation system	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												Grey water reuse has been identified as a sustainable solution to reduce the pressure on freshwater storages. Membrane distillation techniques provide high quality permeate from this insanitary source. However, grey water contains surfactants present in the form of linear alkylbenzene sulphonate (LAS) that reduces the contact angle between the feed solution and the membrane surface leads to the wetting phenomenon. Electro-coagulation (EC) with aluminium electrodes has been demonstrated as an effective technology that removes LAS significantly. The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of the current density and circulation rate of EC unit on the permeate water quality. For this purpose, synthetic grey water was treated at different operating conditions. It has been shown that, only after 12 min of EC, the turbidity, total suspended solids, chemical oxygen demand, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, total phosphorous, electrical conductivity and faecal coliforms were reduced by an average 94.4%, 89.9%, 83.8%, 71.0%, 73.1%, 96.1%, 30.2% and 1.32log, respectively. The EC permeate was sent to the solar powered vacuum membrane distillation (VMD) to produce pure water. Photovoltaic panels and a thermal collector supplied electricity and heat, respectively, for the combination of EC and VMD in order to use renewable energy.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				AUG	2017	85						46	54		10.5004/dwt.2017.21024								WOS:000412882200006

Pollution parameters were analyzed including pH, dissolved oxygen, biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), turbidity, electrical conductivity (EC), total suspended solids, nitrates, phosphates, sulfates and fecal coliform. All parameters of drains exceeded the permissible level of wastewater standards. Hudiara drain showed the highest pollution load in terms of COD: 429.86 t/d while in Babu Sabu drain, highest pollution load was calculated in terms of BOD: 162.82 t/d. Lab-scale treatment (oxidation ponds) was designed to treat the wastewater of the Babu Sabu drain, through combination of different algae species, namely Chaetomorpha sutoria, Sirogonium sticticum and Zygnema sp. Two different size ponds (horizontal and vertical), and three different concentration of algal samples (25, 50 and 75 g/3 L) were selected for 6 d retention time. Percentage removal efficiencies of parameters in vertical and horizontal ponds, that is, turbidity: 62.12%, 69.79%; EC: 79.3%, 83%; BOD: 86.6%, 88.5%; COD: 79.72%, 83.01%; FC: 100%, 100%; nitrates: 89.6%, 89.8%; sulfates: 96.9%, 97%; phosphates: 85.3%, 86.3% and TOC: 75.6%, 79% were observed, respectively. Maximum reduction was observed after day 6 in the 50 g/3 L algae setup in horizontal pond due to large surface area. Results concluded that algae-based treatment is the most energy efficient and cost-effective in improving water quality in drains.

J	Roy, R; Majumder, M				Roy, Ritabrata; Majumder, Mrinmoy			Comparison of surface water quality to land use: a case study from Tripura, India	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												Land use pattern of a location is a key factor to determine the quality of water in that area. A case study was performed to understand the influence of land use on the quality of surface water. Water quality indices of surface water from different locations within study area were compared with the land use pattern of that location. Multi-criteria decision-making methods, like weighted sum method, weighted product method and grey relational analysis, were used to determine the priority values (PV) of the different water quality parameters on the basis of important criteria like hazard potential, cost of mitigation, utilization potential and popularity among the researchers. Water quality indices of the samples were calculated from those PV by weighted average method. The indices were then compared with respective land use pattern to assess the relation between land use pattern and water quality. The results suggest that dense settlement, moderate to low vegetation and dense cultivation is good for surface water, whereas low settlement, dense vegetation and moderate cultivation is bad for surface water. These findings may be useful for managers and policy makers to manage land use for maintaining the optimum quality of surface water.

D.; Hirji, Rafik; Dube, Timothy			Remote sensing of surface water quality in relation to catchment condition in Zimbabwe	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH												The degradation of river catchments is one of the most important contemporary environmental problems affecting water quality in tropical countries. In this study, we used remotely sensed Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to assess how catchment condition varies within and across river catchments in Zimbabwe. We then used non-linear regression to test whether catchment condition assessed using the NDVI is significantly (alpha = 0.05) related with levels of Total Suspended Solids (TSS) measured at different sampling points in thirty-two sub-catchments in Zimbabwe. The results showed a consistent negative curvilinear relationship between Landsat 8 derived NDVI and TSS measured across the catchments under study. In the drier catchments of the country, 98% of the variation in TSS is explained by NDVI, while in wetter catchments, 64% of the variation in TSS is explained by NDVI. Our results suggest that NDVI derived from free and readily available multispectral Landsat series data (Landsat 8) is a potential valuable tool for the rapid assessment of physical water quality in data poor catchments. Overall, the finding of this study underscores the usefulness of readily available satellite data for near-real time monitoring of the physical water quality at river catchment scale, especially in resource-constrained areas, such as the sub-Saharan Africa.

Sensitivity of the mayfly Adenophlebia auriculata (Ephemeroptera: Leptophlebiidae) to MgSO4 and Na2SO4	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH												Acid mine drainage (AMD) continues to deteriorate water quality in freshwater ecosystems. Sulphates, a major salt component in AMD, can exacerbate AMD effects in freshwater because salts are toxic to aquatic life in high concentrations. Sulphates are predominant in South African AMD impacted freshwater ecosystems. In this study, the sensitivity of nymphs of the mayfly Adenophlebia auriculata (Ephemeroptera: Leptophlebiidae) was investigated by exposing the organisms to magnesium sulphate (MgSO4) and sodium sulphate (Na2SO4) as models of mining salinisation in short-term (96 h) and long-term (240 h) in static system tests. Short-term and long-term lethal concentrations of each salt were estimated using regression analyses. The results indicated that A. auriculata was more sensitive to MgSO4 (LC50 = 3.81 g/L) than Na2SO4 (LC50 = 8.78 g/L) after short-term exposures. However, this species became sensitive to Na2SO4 (LC10 = 0.19 g/L) but tolerant to MgSO4 (LC10 = 0.35 g/L) after long-term exposures. These results suggest that the 0.25 g/L sulphate compliance limit for South Africa is inadequate to protect A. auriculata from Na2SO4 toxicity in the long-term, yet it overprotects this species from MgSO4 exposures in the short-term. The findings of this study are an important major step in understanding the ecological effects of AMD to aquatic life. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Hydrochemical modelling of water quality in terms of emerging micropollutants in Mpumalanga, Gauteng and North West Provinces	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH												Emerging micropollutants (EMPs) are ubiquitous in aquatic systems and are associated with a wide range of eco-toxicological effects worldwide. There remains a lack of scientific understanding of the major underlying hydrochemical factors behind variations in concentration heterogeneities of EMPs in time and space. This study was therefore conducted to determine major hydrochemical processes controlling water quality and the occurrence of EMPs mainly, carbamazepine (CBZ), tonalide (AHTN), galaxolide (HHCB), caffeine (CAF), technical 4-nonylphenol (NP) and bisphenol A (BPA) in water from Mpumalanga, Gauteng and North West Provinces in South Africa. Grab water samples were collected bi-monthly between June 2014 and April 2016 from 44 water sources using standard sampling procedures. BPA, NP, CAF, HHCB, AHTN, CBZ were extracted, cleaned and enriched using autotrace-SPE at neutral pH and analyzed using GC x GC-TOFMS. Kruskal Wallis-test was used to test for temporal variations in occurrence of the analytes. The Geochemist's Workbench (R) Release 11 software, Surfer Golden Graphics for surface mapping, PHREEQC software and bivariate ion plots were used determine the major hydro-geochemical processes. The mean concentrations of EMPs varied from 3.48 mu g/L for CAF to 421.53 mu g/L for HHCB. Although the Kruskal Wallis test revealed no any statistically significant temporal variations in concentrations of the analytes in water samples at 95% confidence level, their occurrence and distribution vary spatially with BPA being the most widely distributed EMP and was present in 62% of the sampled sites. Municipal waste water inputs, agricultural pollution, ion-exchange reactions, carbonate and silicate weathering were the major processes controlling water quality in the study area. This study may assist water resource managers to ably address and manage water pollution resulting from a number of natural and anthropogenic hydrochemical processes in the study area.

Modeling phytoremediation of nitrogen-polluted water using water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes)	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH												Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) has a great potential for purification of wastewater through physical, chemical and biological mechanisms. In an attempt to improve the quality of effluents discharged from waste stabilization ponds at the University of Dar es Salaam, a pilot plant was constructed to experiment the effectiveness of this plants for transformation and removal of nitrogen. Samples of wastewater were collected and examined for water quality parameters, including pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and various forms of nitrogen, which were used as input parameters in a kinetic mathematical model. A conceptual model was then developed to model various processes in the system using STELLA 6.0.1 software. The results show that total nitrogen was removed by 63.9%. Denitrification contributed 73.8% of the removed nitrogen. Other dominant nitrogen removal mechanisms are net sedimentation and uptake by water hyacinth, which contributed 16.7% and 9.5% of the removed nitrogen, respectively. The model indicated that in presence of water hyacinth biofllm about 1.26 g Nm(-2)day(-1) of nitrogen was removed. However, in the absence of biofilm in water hyacinth pond, the permanent nitrogen removal was only 0.89 g Nm(-2)day(-1). This suggests that in absence of water hyacinth, the efficiency of nitrogen removal would decrease by 29.4%. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Assessment of drinking water quality and rural household water treatment in Balaka District, Malawi	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH												Access to drinking water from unsafe sources is widespread amongst communities in rural areas such as Balaka District in Malawi. This situation puts many individuals and communities at risk of waterborne diseases despite some households adopting household water treatment to improve the quality of the water. However, there still remains data gaps regarding the quality of drinking water from such sources and the household water treatment methods used to improve public health. This study was, therefore, conducted to help bridge the knowledge gap by evaluating drinking water quality and adoption rate of household water treatment and storage (HWTS) practices in Nkaya, Balaka District. Water samples were collected from eleven systematically selected sites and analyzed for physico-chemical and microbiological parameters: pH, TDS, electrical conductivity (EC), turbidity, F-, Cl-, NO3-, Na, K, Fe, Faecal Coliform (FC) and Faecal Streptococcus (FS) bacteria using standard methods. The mean results were compared to the World Health Organization (WHO) and Malawi Bureau of Standards (MBS) (MS 733:2005) to ascertain the water quality for drinking purposes. A total of 204 randomly selected households were interviewed to determine their access to drinking water, water quality perception and HWTS among others. The majority of households (72%, n = 83) in Njerenje accessed water from shallow wells and rivers whilst in Phimbi boreholes were commonly used. Several households (>95%, n = 204) were observed to be practicing HWST techniques by boiling or chlorination and water storage in closed containers. The levels of pH (7.10-7.64), F- (0.89-1.46 mg/L), Cl- (5.45-89.84 mg/L), NO3- (0-0.16 mg/L), Na (20-490 mg/L), K (2.40-14 mg/L) and Fe (0.10-0.40 mg/L) for most sites were within the standard limits. The EC (358-2220 mu S/cm), turbidity (0.54-14.60 NTU), FC (0-56 cfu/100 mL) and FS (0-120 cfu/100 mL) - mainly in shallow wells, were found to be above the WHO and MBS water quality specifications. The majority of the water samples (73%, n = 11) were classified as of "Intermediate risk" (FC 11 -100 cfu/100 mL), hence not suitable for human consumption without prior treatment. This calls for large scale adoption of HWTS and continued monitoring of the water sources used in the study areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Gumindoga, W; Rwasoka, DT; Nhapi, I; Dube, T				Gumindoga, Webster; Rwasoka, Donald T.; Nhapi, Innocent; Dube, Timothy			Ungauged runoff simulation in Upper Manyame Catchment, Zimbabwe: Application of the HEC-HMS model	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH												The Hydrologic Engineering Center Hydrologic Modelling System (HEC-HMS) model was applied to simulate runoff in the ten gauged and ungauged Upper Manyame subcatchments in Zimbabwe. Remote sensing and Geographic Information System techniques were used to determine the geometric and hydrologic parameters required for estimating model parameters. The Snyder Unit Hydrograph method was used for ungauged subcatchment simulations based on parameter transfer from gauged subcatchments. The Marimba and Mukuvisi subcatchments were considered as the gauged subcatchments based on data completeness for the simulation period (2004-2010). Before extrapolating the calibrated model setup to eight ungauged subcatchments, the feasibility of model parameter transferability was tested, using the proxy - catchment approach and evaluated using the Nash Sutcliffe (NSE) and Relative Volume Error (RVE) criterion. Results showed that the model successfully predicted gauged catchment runoff and peakflows for the calibration (Marimba NSE = 68%, RVE = 5.8%; Mukuvisi NSE = 64%, RVE = -8.9%) and validation (Marimba NSE = 61%, RVE = 8.1%; Mukuvisi NSE = 57%, RVE = 9.9%) periods. The study demonstrates the suitability of HEC-HMS for continuous runoff simulation in a complex watershed with numerous subcatchments and channel reaches. The ungauged subcatchments contribute to 51% of Upper Manyame Catchment's runoff. Ruwa and Lake Chivero sub catchments had the highest ungauged subcatchment contribution to Upper Manyame Catchment runoff (19% and 15% respectively).

J	Chang, CL; Li, MY				Chang, Chia-Ling; Li, Meng-Yuan			Predictions of Diffuse Pollution by the HSPF Model and the Back-Propagation Neural Network Model	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												Watershed models are important tools for predicting the possible change of watershed responses. Environmental models comprise the deterministic model and the probabilistic model. This study discusses the Hydrological Simulation Program Fortran (HSPF) and the Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPNN); these two models represent the deterministic model and the probabilistic model, respectively. As the properties of the two models are distinct, they have differing abilities to predict surface-runoff pollution. For the two models, the runoff simulation results are satisfactory. However, due to the limitation of the water quality monitoring records, pollution simulation is more difficult than runoff simulation. The results indicate that the prediction accuracy in the pollution simulation can be improved by adjusting the BPNN neurons. On the contrary, improving the prediction accuracy is limited by HSPF. Although the flexibility of BPNN is higher than HSPF, sufficient historical monitoring records are important for both of these models.																	1061-4303	1554-7531				AUG 1	2017	89	8					732	738		10.2175/106143017X14902968254665								WOS:000411925800007	28743327

Vulnerabilities of poverty, isolation, and rough geographical terrain complicate life for Appalachians who need access to adequate water supply and septic systems. In 2013, an inter-professional team of nursing, architecture, engineering, and law enforcement faculty and students developed a water-focused collaboration with community members in southeastern Kentucky. Greater accessibility to clean drinking water is a critical need in the area. Collaborative community engagement yielded effective and sustainable interventions. Inter-professional teams completed N=30 comprehensive home assessments examining factors such as water source utilization, septic system management, health status, and disaster preparedness. While the majority of homes evaluated had functional water supply and septic systems, the team observed straight piping as a means of waste disposal for several homes. Homeowners who did not have a residential water supply identified common gathering places where they typically obtain drinking water. To expand environmental assessment, the team collected water samples at 16 different sites where residents obtain drinking water or use it for recreational purposes. Testing of collected samples revealed 15 of 16 sites contained fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, or both. Because of the findings, the team and community key informants collaboratively developed interventions, such as relaying findings to community leaders, developing a WASH (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene)-related education program, and improving access to clean, safe water through the design and construction of a water kiosk. Outcome of interventions included greater awareness and knowledge of WASH related topics, improved access to clean water sources, and sustainable solutions to enhance overall quality of life, health and well-being.																	1936-7031	1936-704X				AUG	2017	161	1					1	18		10.1111/j.1936-704X.2017.3248.x								WOS:000411056200001

Prior to 1900, the central part of the watershed was marshland, and the edges of the watershed were used for grazing sheep and cattle. After 1900, cattle and sheep grazing were displaced by irrigated agriculture. Drainage ditches and channels were constructed to drain the marshes to "reclaim" the land for agriculture. Today, the drainage ditches and channels still exist in the watershed, which has undergone massive urban growth. Shallow groundwater discharges into these channels and ditches, which then flows as surface water, into Upper Newport Bay a thriving ecological habitat. Surface flows in these channels usually exceed the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) aquatic water quality criterion for selenium (Se) of 3.1 mu g/L (lotic) for protection of aquatic life. Selenium in surface flows is caused by groundwater inflows. The highest concentrations of Se in shallow groundwater in the watershed coincide with the marshland area that was displaced by agriculture. Concentrations of Se in shallow groundwater beneath the former marsh area often exceed 25 mu g/L and are as high as 478 mu g/L. In areas where marshes were absent, concentrations of Se in groundwater are usually less than 25 mu g/L. In the marsh, Se accumulated due to chemically reducing conditions in the organic-rich marshland soils that caused it to precipitate as elemental Se(0) and metal selenides, Se(-II). We hypothesize that the elevated concentrations of Se in groundwater where the marshes once existed are a direct result of the destruction of the marsh. Today, oxidizing groundwater flows through the soils where the marshes once existed, remobilizing Se as selenate, a water soluble and oxidized form of Se(+VI) that is highly mobile in aquifer systems.																	1936-704X					AUG	2017	161	1					48	65		10.1111/j.1936-704X.2017.3251.x								WOS:000411056200004

Interdisciplinary research over the last two decades has indicated that ecohydrological interfaces are often hot spots of ecological, biogeochemical, and hydrological processes and may provide refuge for biota during extreme events. Ecohydrological interfaces can have significant impact on global hydrological and biogeochemical cycles, biodiversity, pollutant removal, and ecosystem resilience to disturbance. The organizational principles (i.e., the drivers and controls) of spatially and temporally variable processes at ecohydrological interfaces are poorly understood and require the integrated analysis of hydrological, biogeochemical, and ecological processes. Our rudimentary understanding of the interactions between different drivers and controls critically limits our ability to predict complex system responses to change. In this paper, we explore similarities and contrasts in the functioning of diverse freshwater ecohydrological interfaces across spatial and temporal scales. We use this comparison to develop an integrated, interdisciplinary framework, including a roadmap for analyzing ecohydrological processes and their interactions in ecosystems. We argue that, in order to fully account for their nonlinear process dynamics, ecohydrological interfaces need to be conceptualized as unique, spatially and temporally dynamic entities, which represents a step change from their current representation as boundary conditions at investigated ecosystems. Plain Language Summary The movement of water, matter, organisms, and energy can be altered substantially at ecohydrological interfaces that we introduce here as a new concept to support the quantitative analysis of nonlinear system behavior stimulated by the complex and multifacetted interactions of hydrological, biogeochemical, and ecological processes across system boundaries. Ecohydrological interfaces are defined here as the dynamic transition zones that may develop at ecosystem (or subsystem) boundaries and control the movement and transformation of organisms, water, matter, and energy between adjacent systems. In this paper, we explore similarities and contrasts in the functioning of diverse freshwater ecohydrological interfaces across spatial and temporal scales. We use this comparison to develop an integrated, interdisciplinary framework, including a roadmap for analyzing ecohydrological processes and their interactions in ecosystems. We argue that, in order to fully account for their nonlinear process dynamics, ecohydrological interfaces need to be conceptualized as unique, spatially and temporally dynamic entities, which represents a step change from their current representation as boundary conditions at investigated ecosystems.

J	Destouni, G; Fischer, I; Prieto, C				Destouni, Georgia; Fischer, Ida; Prieto, Carmen			Water quality and ecosystem management: Data-driven reality check of effects in streams and lakes	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												This study investigates nutrient-related water quality conditions and change trends in the first management periods of the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD; since 2009) and Baltic Sea Action Plan (BASP; since 2007). With mitigation of nutrients in inland waters and their discharges to the Baltic Sea being a common WFD and BSAP target, we use Sweden as a case study of observable effects, by compiling and analyzing all openly available water and nutrient monitoring data across Sweden since 2003. The data compilation reveals that nutrient monitoring covers only around 1% (down to 0.2% for nutrient loads) of the total number of WFD-classified stream and lake water bodies in Sweden. The data analysis further shows that the hydro-climatically driven water discharge dominates the determination of waterborne loads of both total phosphorus and total nitrogen across Sweden. Both water discharge and the related nutrient loads are in turn well correlated with the ecosystem status classification of Swedish water bodies. Nutrient concentrations do not exhibit such correlation and their changes over the study period are on average small, but concentration increases are found for moderate-to-bad status waters, for which both the WFD and the BSAP have instead targeted concentration decreases. In general, these results indicate insufficient distinction and mitigation of human-driven nutrient components in inland waters and their discharges to the sea by the internationally harmonized applications of the WFD and the BSAP. The results call for further comparative investigations of observable large-scale effects of such regulatory/management frameworks in different parts of the world.

Unlike other hedonic studies of water quality, we test whether housing market responds to average water quality or more to extreme events. We also test the spatial and temporal extent of effects of water quality on housing prices. We find that poor coastal water quality, measured in terms of the concentration of chlorophyll, has a negative impact on housing prices that diminishes with distance from the shoreline. Furthermore, our finding suggests that housing prices are most influenced by the extreme environmental conditions, which may be accompanied by unpleasant odors, discoloration, and even fish kills. We further predict potential increases in home values associated under water quality improvement scenarios and find an increase in the values of homes in coastal communities along Narragansett Bay of about $18 million up to $136 million.

Managed aquifer recharge through off-season irrigation in agricultural regions	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Options for increasing reservoir storage in developed regions are limited and prohibitively expensive. Projected increases in demand call for new long-term water storage to help sustain agriculture, municipalities, industry, and ecological services. Managed aquifer recharge (MAR) is becoming an integral component of water resources around the world. However, MAR faces challenges, including infrastructure costs, difficulty in enhancing recharge, water quality issues, and lack of available water supplies. Here we examine, through simulation modeling of a hypothetical agricultural subbasin in the western U.S., the potential of agricultural managed aquifer recharge (Ag-MAR) via canal seepage and off-season field irrigation. Weather phenomenon in many regions around the world exhibit decadal and other multiyear cycles of extreme precipitation. An ongoing challenge is to develop approaches to store greater amounts of water during these events. Simulations presented herein incorporate Ag-MAR programs and demonstrate that there is potential to enhance regional recharge by 7-13%, increase crop consumptive use by 9-12%, and increase natural vegetation consumption by 20-30%, where larger relative increases occur for lower aquifer hydraulic conductivity and higher specific yield values. Annual increases in groundwater levels were 7 m, and sustained levels following several years of drought were greater than 2 m. Results demonstrate that Ag-MAR has great potential to enhance long-term sustainability of water resources in agricultural basins.

Patrick			Temporal variability in the importance of hydrologic, biotic, and climatic descriptors of dissolved oxygen dynamics in a shallow tidal-marsh creek	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Due to strong abiotic forcing, dissolved oxygen (DO) in shallow tidal creeks often disobeys the conventional explanation of general aquatic DO cycling as biologically regulated. In the present work, we seek to quantify the relative importance of abiotic (hydrologic and climatic), and biotic (primary productivity as represented by chlorophyll-a) descriptors of tidal creek DO. By fitting multiple linear regression models of DO to hourly chlorophyll-a, water quality, hydrology, and weather data collected in a tidal creek of a Chesapeake Bay marsh (Maryland, USA), temporal shifts (summer-early winter) in the relative importance of tidal creek DO descriptors were uncovered. Moreover, this analysis identified an alternative approach to evaluating tidal stage as a driver of DO by dividing stage into two DO-relevant variables: stage above and below bankfull depth. Within the hydrologic variable class, stage below bankfull depth dominated as an important descriptor, thus highlighting the role of pore water drainage and mixing as influential processes forcing tidal creek DO. Study findings suggest that tidal creek DO dynamics are explained by a balance of hydrologic, climatic, and biotic descriptors during warmer seasons due to many of these variables (i.e., chlorophyll-a, water temperature) acting as tracers of estuarine-marsh water mixing; conversely, in early winter months when estuarine and marsh waters differ less distinctly, hydrologic variables increase in relative importance as descriptors of tidal creek DO. These findings underline important distinctions in the underlying mechanisms dictating DO variability in shallow tidal marsh-creek environments relative to open water estuarine systems.

Predicting redox-sensitive contaminant concentrations in groundwater using random forest classification	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Machine learning techniques were applied to a large (n>10,000) compliance monitoring database to predict the occurrence of several redox-active constituents in groundwater across a large watershed. Specifically, random forest classification was used to determine the probabilities of detecting elevated concentrations of nitrate, iron, and arsenic in the Fox, Wolf, Peshtigo, and surrounding watersheds in northeastern Wisconsin. Random forest classification is well suited to describe the nonlinear relationships observed among several explanatory variables and the predicted probabilities of elevated concentrations of nitrate, iron, and arsenic. Maps of the probability of elevated nitrate, iron, and arsenic can be used to assess groundwater vulnerability and the vulnerability of streams to contaminants derived from groundwater. Processes responsible for elevated concentrations are elucidated using partial dependence plots. For example, an increase in the probability of elevated iron and arsenic occurred when well depths coincided with the glacial/bedrock interface, suggesting a bedrock source for these constituents. Furthermore, groundwater in contact with Ordovician bedrock has a higher likelihood of elevated iron concentrations, which supports the hypothesis that groundwater liberates iron from a sulfide-bearing secondary cement horizon of Ordovician age. Application of machine learning techniques to existing compliance monitoring data offers an opportunity to broadly assess aquifer and stream vulnerability at regional and national scales and to better understand geochemical processes responsible for observed conditions.

Combined effects of nutrient enrichment and inorganic sedimentation on benthic biota in an experimental stream system	WATER QUALITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF CANADA												Sedimentation and nutrient loading are among the most prevalent threats to fluvial ecosystem integrity. This study employed artificial streams (mesocosms) to simulate individual and combined impacts of nutrient enrichment and deposited fine sediment on benthic biota. Ninety-six circular mesocosms were used in a 21-day crossed experiment that measured the impact of three substrate compositions (0, 25, and 50% fines < 2 mm) and four nitrogen concentrations (17, 22, 43, and 94 mu g L-1 (soluble inorganic nitrogen)) on periphyton and benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) of macroinvertebrate assemblages indicated substantial shifts in structural composition, while univariate models for Lepidostomatidae and total Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera revealed that nutrient and sediment subsidies related to single factors were suppressed by an additional stressor. Stressor mechanism overlap was evident at higher treatment levels, as moderate nutrient enrichment increased nutritional resources but high nitrogen concentrations lead to substrate smothering by periphyton, contributing to habitat degradation originating from inorganic sedimentation. Our study is consistent with research showing that nutrient loading and sedimentation interact to deteriorate lotic systems beyond levels attributable to either individual stressor. Management practices and pollution standards need to incorporate relationships between stressors tightly co-vary in natural settings.																	1201-3080					AUG	2017	52	3					151	165		10.2166/wqrj.2017.038								WOS:000411094100001

In particular, the formulation of the reaction-dominated limit (RDL) reaction scheme is here extended to improve the model performance under non-homogeneous conditions (NHRDL scheme). The validation of the stochastic model is obtained by comparison with the available measurements of reactive pollutant concentrations in a grid-generated turbulent flow. This test case describes the dispersion of two atmospheric reactant species (NO and O-3) and their reaction product (NO2) in an unbounded turbulent flow. Model inter-comparisons are also assessed, by considering the results of state-of-the-art models for pollutant dispersion. The present validation shows that RDL reaction scheme provides a systematic overestimation (relative error of ca. 85% around the centreline) in computing the local reactant consumption/production rate, whereas the NHRDL scheme drastically reduces this gap (relative error lower than 5% around the centreline). In terms of NO2 production (or reactant consumption), neglecting concentration fluctuations determines overestimations of the product mean of around 100% and a NO2 local production of one order of magnitude higher than the reference simulation. In terms of standard deviations, the concentration fluctuations of both the passive and reactive scalars are generally of the same order of magnitude or up to 1 or 2 orders of magnitudes higher than the corresponding ensemble mean values, except for the background reactant close to the plume edges. The study highlights the importance of modelling pollutant reactions depending on the instantaneous instead of the mean concentrations of the reactants, thus quantifying the role of the turbulent fluctuations of concentration, in terms of scalar statistics (mean, standard deviation, intensity of fluctuations, skewness and kurtosis of concentration, segregation coefficient, simulated reaction rate). This stochastic particle method represents an efficient numerical technique to solve the convection-diffusion equation for reactive scalars and involves several application fields: micro-scale air quality (urban and street-canyon scales), accidental releases, impact of odours, water quality and fluid flow industrial processes (e.g. combustion).

A Greener UV and Peroxide-Based Chemical Oxygen Demand Test	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Water quality assessment typically includes the determination of chemical oxygen demand (COD) by oxidation of organic matter with Cr(VI) in an acidic medium followed by digestion. Unfortunately, the required reagents are harmful and the reaction times are rather long. We investigated earlier the use of H2O2 as a more environmentally friendly oxidizing agent to replace the hazardous chromates. In the present study, we have furthered this possibility by incorporating the use of H2O2 in the presence of UV light. A protocol has been devised and tested with standards and real samples that replaces toxic Cr(VI), halves the amount of silver sulfate required, and greatly reduces the necessary reaction time, thus yielding a faster and more environmentally sound method.

Application to Fuente de Piedra Ramsar, Mediterranean Salt Lake (South of Spain)	WATER												This work concerns the case study of a Mediterranean Ramsar salt lake (Fuente de Piedra, southern Spain) that receives the treated wastewater of the local village treatment plant. The wastewater goes through a system of canals, water dams, and three semi-natural ponds that were built in 2005. This work aims to investigate the capacity of the system to assimilate the impact of wastewater effluents on Lake Fuente de Piedra. For this, four points were sampled on 27-29 April 2016, at the inlet and the outlet points of the first and the third semi-natural ponds, with three replicates each. Temperature, pH, and conductivity at the inlet were 19.62 degrees C, 7.99, and 3262.67 mu S/cm, respectively, and increased through the pond system by 7.59%, 8.04%, and 37.34%, respectively. Phytoplankton concentration indicators decreased from the inlet point to the outlet point (chlorophyll a from > 500 to < 20mg/L), as did the biovolume (from > 5 x 10(10) to 4.3 x 10(9) mu m(3)/mL). Zooplankton biovolume, in contrast, increased three orders of magnitude from the inlet (3.5 x 10(7) mu m(3)/mL) to the outlet point (1.6 x 10(9) mu m(3)/mL). Heterotrophic bacteria (1.29 x 10(5) cfu/mL) and faecal enterococci (1033 +/- 351 cfu/100 mL) were high at the inlet point, but decreased at the outlet point by almost three orders of magnitude. Total phosphorous and total nitrogen decreased 40.3% and 23.1% through the pond system. The results showed an improvement in water quality in its passage through the built system. Additionally, as permanent wetlands with acceptable water quality, the water system attracts wild fauna during the dry summer, leading to the conclusion that these semi-natural or artificial wetlands should be extrapolated to other aquatic ecosystems (Mediterranean wetlands) that receive contributions of residual waters. Better functioning of the treatment plant is desirable to improve the conservation of the Ramsar and adjacent wetlands systems.

Christian			Diel and Seasonal Patterns in Continuously Monitored Water Quality at Fixed Sites in Two Adjacent Embayments of the Tidal Freshwater Potomac River	WATER												Water quality patterns in two adjacent embayments of the tidal freshwater Potomac River were compared using continuously monitored data. The two embayments, the tidal Occoquan and Gunston Cove, are shallow embayments fed by tributaries which vary in their watershed attributes. The tidal Occoquan has a larger watershed and a dam just upstream from the head of tide whereas Gunston Cove has a large wastewater treatment plant just upstream of the embayment. Water temperature, specific conductance, dissolved oxygen (DO), and pH were collected at 15 min intervals at representative locations in the two embayments from April through November of 2012. Mean daily values of water quality variables exhibited similar seasonal patterns at both sites which were related to seasonal patterns of forcing functions such as temperature, light and freshwater inflows. Three two-week intervals were examined in great detail. During a mid-summer period of stable conditions and low flow, both embayments exhibited strong and consistent diel (light cycle-based) periodicity in temperature, DO, and pH. Specific conductance exhibited semi-diel (tidal cycle-based) periodicity. The two other two-week intervals were punctuated by substantial flow events which resulted in major changes in daily mean values and disruptions to the typical diel or semi-diel cycles. The large rainfall event related to Hurricane Sandy caused a major disruption in diel and semi-diel cycles. Some cycles were quickly re-established and others took a week or more. The two embayments exhibited similar behavior in most aspects. Site-specific factors such as differences in the frequency and magnitude of tributary flow pulses and the presence of treated sewage discharge at Gunston Cove helped explain some of the differences observed between the two embayments.

J	Hampson, DI; Ferrini, S; Rigby, D; Bateman, IJ				Hampson, Danyel I.; Ferrini, Silvia; Rigby, Dan; Bateman, Ian J.			River Water Quality: Who Cares, How Much and Why?	WATER												An important motivation for the implementation of the Water Framework Directive is the creation of non-market environmental benefits, such as improved ecological quality, or greater opportunities for open-access river recreation via microbial pollution remediation. Pollution sources impacting on ecological or recreational water quality may be uncorrelated, but non-market benefits arising from riverine improvements are typically conflated within benefit valuation studies. Using stated preference choice experiments embedded within a survey that also collected respondents' socio-economic characteristics, we aimed to disaggregate these sources of value for different river users, thereby allowing decision makers to understand the consequences of adopting alternative investment strategies. Our results suggested that anglers derived greater value from improvements to the ecological quality of river water, in contrast to swimmers and rowers, for whom greater value is gained from improvements to recreational quality. More generally, we found three distinct groups of respondents: a majority preferring ecological over recreational improvements, a substantial minority holding opposing preference orderings, and a yet smaller proportion expressing relatively low values for either form of river quality enhancement. As such, this research demonstrates that the non-market benefits that may accrue from different types of water quality improvements are nuanced in terms of their potential beneficiaries and, by inference, their overall value and policy implications.

Spatial and Seasonal Surface Water Quality Assessment in a Tropical Urban Catchment: Burio River, Costa Rica	WATER												Water quality assessments are essential for providing information regarding integrated water resource management processes. This study presents the results of a spatial and seasonal surface water quality assessment of the Burio river sub-catchment in Costa Rica. Fourteen sample campaigns were conducted at eight sample sites between 2005 and 2010. Seasonal variations were evaluated using linear mixed-effects models where dissolved oxygen, total solids, and nitrate showed significant differences between dry and wet seasons (p < 0.05). Cluster analysis identified three clusters at the top, middle, and bottom of the catchment that were consistent with land use patterns, and principal component analysis identified the main parameters that were affecting 84% of the total variance in water quality (biochemical oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen, total phosphate, and nitrate). The National Sanitation Foundation Water Quality Index (NSF-WQI) results indicated the majority of the river consisted of mainly "medium" water quality, although "bad" and "good" water quality results were identified depending on sample site and season. This methodological approach provides a useful monitoring technique for local governments that can be used for further remediation strategies.																	2073-4441					AUG	2017	9	8							558	10.3390/w9080558								WOS:000408729200005						
J	Meng, C; Wang, XL; Li, Y				Meng, Chong; Wang, Xiaolei; Li, Yu			An Optimization Model for Waste Load Allocation under Water Carrying Capacity Improvement Management, A Case Study of the Yitong River, Northeast China	WATER												In this study, a two-stage stochastic programming (TSP) model was developed for supporting regional waste load(chemical oxygen demand (COD) and NH3-N) allocation in four main pollution departments (industry, municipal, livestock breeding, and agriculture), constrained by the water carrying capacity, which can be improved by ecological restoration engineering, in the nine function zones of the Yitong River. A number of scenarios corresponding to different stream flow levels were examined. The results revealed that the carrying capacity of COD and NH3-N has a similar tendency with a positive correlation to stream flow levels. The allocation amount of each pollutant for the four departments was obtained differently in each zone, and ecological restoration engineering solutions were obtained for different zones to improve the carrying capacity of the pollutants in order to meet the permitted emission allocation and water qualities. The results are helpful in establishing a rational discharge permit system of each pollution unit under water quality targets, and provide a basis for production plans of these pollution units.																	2073-4441					AUG	2017	9	8							573	10.3390/w9080573								WOS:000408729200020

This phenomenon is due to the effect of the degradation of water environment. Turbidity is one of the most important water quality parameters directly related to underwater light penetration which affects the primary productivity. This study aims to investigate spatiotemporal variation of turbidity in the waters with major factors affecting its patterns using remote sensing data. An algorithm for turbidity retrieval was developed based on the correlation between in situ measurements and a red band of Landsat 8 OLI with R-2 = 0.84 (p < 0.05). Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN) model was used to compute bed shear stress, a major factor affecting turbidity in shallow waters. In addition, the relationships between turbidity and rainfall, and bed shear stress induced by wind were analyzed. It was found that: (1) In the dry season, turbidity was low at the middle of the bay while it was high in shallow waters nearby coastlines. Resuspension of bed sediment was a major factor controlling turbidity during time with no rainfall. (2) In the rainy season or for a short time after rainfall in the dry season, turbidity was high due to a large amount of runoff entering into the study area.																	2073-4441					AUG	2017	9	8							570	10.3390/w9080570								WOS:000408729200017						
J	Novo, P				Novo, Paula			Accounting for the Assimilative Capacity of Water Systems in Scotland	WATER												A key methodological challenge in understanding the relationship between the economy and the underlying ecosystem base resides in how to account for the ecosystem's degradation and the decline of associated ecosystem services. In this study, we use information on nutrients and metals concentrations from the Environmental Change Network (ECN) database and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) for the period 2000-2010 in order to assess the assimilation capacity of water systems. The research covers five upstream sites and 17 downstream sites in northeast Scotland. Our results highlight the relevance of considering a number of pollutants, and suggest that elements such as arsenic, lead and mercury can pose a threat to ecosystems' sustainability and health. However, little research has been done in terms of their assimilation capacity and their impact on grey water footprint assessments. In addition, the results indicate that background conditions might be relevant when performing sustainability analysis at different spatial scales. The study also poses relevant questions in relation to land management approaches versus traditional 'end-of-pipe' water treatment approaches, and the definition of maximum and background concentrations. In this regard, further studies will be required to understand the trade-offs between different ecosystem services depending on how these concentrations are defined.																	2073-4441					AUG	2017	9	8							559	10.3390/w9080559								WOS:000408729200006

As a result, P removal structures were developed to filter dissolved P from drainage water before reaching a water body. While many P removal structures with different P sorption materials (PSMs) have been constructed over the past two decades, there remains a need to evaluate their performances and compare on a normalized basis. The purpose of this review was to compile performance data of pilot and field-scale P removal structures and present techniques for normalization and comparison. Over 40 studies were normalized by expressing cumulative P removal as a function of cumulative P loading to the contained PSM. Results were further analyzed as a function of retention time (RT), inflow P concentration, and type of PSM. Structures treating wastewater were generally more efficient than non-point drainage water due to higher RT and inflow P concentrations. For Ca-rich PSMs, including slag, increased RT allowed for greater P removal. Among structures with low RT and inflow P concentrations common to non-point drainage, Fe-based materials had an overall higher cumulative removal efficiency compared to non-slag and slag materials.

Design, Construction, and Application of an Inexpensive, High-Resolution Water Sampler	WATER												The cost of high-resolution water sampling devices for ecological studies and water quality analyses can be prohibitive. Moreover, the potential for operator error in the use of complicated sampling equipment can lead to inaccuracies. Here we describe the construction and operation of an inexpensive and easy-to-use water sampler that achieves a water column sampling resolution of approximately 1 cm. The device is driven by a peristaltic pump and is constructed entirely of non-corrosive and non-reactive materials. The sampler has no moving parts and was completely reliable in fieldwork on temperate and Antarctic lakes. The device is especially suited for the collection of water samples from calm or stagnant surface waters, such as lakes, ponds, reservoirs, and deep swamps or other wetlands. In addition, because its components are unaffected by corrosive salts and sulfides, the device is suitable for sampling calm inlet waters, including shallow bays and estuaries. Because of its low cost, simple construction, compact design, and precision performance, this water sampler is an excellent option for studying and monitoring shallow to moderately deep (<50 m) natural waters.																	2073-4441					AUG	2017	9	8							578	10.3390/w9080578								WOS:000408729200025						
J	Sommerlot, AR; Easton, ZM				Sommerlot, Andrew R.; Easton, Zachary M.			A Web Based Interface for Distributed Short-Term Soil Moisture Forecasts	WATER												Agricultural non-point source (NPS) pollution is a source of water quality impairment, and demonstrates widely varying spatial and temporal pollution potential. Many efforts to protect water quality are based on seasonal and annual estimates of pollutant loss potential (NRCS 590 nutrient management standard, P-Index) that inadequately address the hydrologic processes driving NPS pollution. One barrier to adopting practices that address NPS pollution is a lack of tools capable of transferring information at sufficient spatial and temporal resolution so that end-users can make informed decisions. We introduce a web-based system displaying distributed hydrologic forecasts using free and open source software. The system consists of three primary components: (1) a hydrology model that provides short-term distributed forecasts; (2) a data structure capable of re-structuring large, high resolution rasters; (3) an interface employing adaptive map-viewing technology that allows end-users to interact with the data to avoid high-risk areas when planning agricultural practices.																	2073-4441					AUG	2017	9	8							604	10.3390/w9080604								WOS:000408729200050

Many lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River basin (MLYB) have followed this pattern. For effective lake management, it is essential to understand the pattern and drivers of SRs in these lakes. Fourteen typical lakes in the MLYB were chosen to examine the spatiotemporal patterns of SRs and identify the drivers over different time periods. Since 1900, SRs increased from <0.2 to 0.3-0.6 g.cm(-2).year(-1), particularly notable during 1930-1990. Combined with climatic factors, SR correlated negatively with lake (catchment) size and abundance of aquatic vegetation, whereas other lake features including nutrient status did not contribute significantly to the variation in SRs, due to the fast decomposition processes of organic matter in shallow lakes. Detrimental land use practices especially reclamation for croplands and rapid urbanization was revealed to elevate SRs pronouncedly. We propose various management strategies aiming to maintain SR reference condition at -0.16 +/- 0.08 g.cm(-2).year(-1), which is analogous to the SR value between 1850 and 1900.

J	Yang, YH; Liu, Y; Cao, SL; Cheng, YF				Yang, Yuheng; Liu, Yang; Cao, Shengle; Cheng, Yufei			A Method of Evaluating Water Resource Assets and Liabilities: A Case Study of Jinan City, Shandong Province	WATER												The traditional concepts of water resource development and utilization have caused serious hydrological and environmental issues in some regions. In addition, policy issues in China have led to a severe water crisis. The quantitative accounting of water resources is a theoretical approach to solving these problems. In this paper, 13 indicators were selected from four classes, including resources, the environment, society, and efficiency, and a case study of Jinan, Shandong Province, was performed using a set pair analysis model to calculate the water resource assets from 2011-2015. In previous methods of water resource accounting, the water quality was not considered; therefore, the loss coefficient of water resource assets was proposed to improve the reliability of accounting. According to the relationships among the unit price of water, water quantity, and water quality, physical and quantitative accounting methods were used to create water balance sheets from 2011-2015. The calculation results showed that the physical change in water resource assets in Jinan City was 30 million m(3), and water resource assets initially increased and then decreased. In 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015, water resource assets totalled 36.5 million USD, 45.9 million USD, 66.7 million USD, 35.5 million USD, and 37.5 million USD, respectively (at 6.4588, 6.3125, 6.1932, 6.2166, 6.2284 USRMB, respectively). This initial accounting provides quantitative and physical support for the improved management of water resources.																	2073-4441					AUG	2017	9	8							575	10.3390/w9080575								WOS:000408729200022						
J	Yuan, JF; Xu, F; Deng, GS; Tang, YQ; Li, PY				Yuan, Jianfei; Xu, Fen; Deng, Guoshi; Tang, Yeqi; Li, Pengyue			Hydrogeochemistry of Shallow Groundwater in a Karst Aquifer System of Bijie City, Guizhou Province	WATER												In this study, the major chemical compositions of 159 shallow groundwater samples incorporated saturation index (SI) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were employed to evaluate the mainly geochemical processes that control the hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater in a typical karst area, Bijie city, Guizhou Province. The groundwater samples in this study area were dominated of HCO3-Ca, HCO3-Ca-Mg, and HCO3-SO4-Ca types. The PCA suggested that four principal components could explain 88.85% of the total variance of 10 parameters, indicating that the hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater was mainly controlled by the dissolution/precipitation of carbonates, gypsum, and halite minerals, cation exchange, and anthropogenic activities. To be specific, the enrichment of Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO3- and SO42- in groundwater were primarily affected by the dissolution of dolomite and gypsum minerals, and the role of calcite dissolution was relatively weaker because most groundwater samples were saturated with respect to calcite. Besides, cation exchange was another factor that may affect the concentration of Ca2+ and Mg2+ in groundwater, and the concentration of SO42- can also be influenced by coal mining activity. In addition, the concentrations of Na+ and Cl- in groundwater were likely influenced by the dissolution of halite, cation exchange, and human activities.																	2073-4441					AUG	2017	9	8							625	10.3390/w9080625								WOS:000408729200069

Srinivasa			Correlation between corrosion indices and corrosiveness of groundwater: a study with reference to selected areas of Krishna District, Andhra Pradesh, India	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The aim of the present study was to determine the aggressiveness of groundwater samples towards corrosion of various commercially important metals and to study the correlation between theoretical and experimental values of corrosiveness. For this purpose, 20 groundwater samples were collected in different mandals of Krishna District, Andhra Pradesh, India, and the metals selected were carbon steel, aluminium, copper and cupronickel alloy. The corrosiveness was determined by using gravimetric measurements. Further, corrosion and scaling indices, namely Langelier index (LI), aggressive index (AI), Ryznar index (RI), Puckorius index (PI) and Larson-Skold index (LS), were calculated with the help of various water quality parameters of all the samples to estimate their corrosivity. The experimental values of corrosion rates were attempted to correlate with various indices calculated and quality parameters determined in case of all the samples. It is observed that there is a significant lack of correlation between the indices and corrosion rates. Among the five indices taken into account, LI, AI and RI indicate scaling tendency of water samples, as inferred by their mean values, 0.657, 12.576 and 6.612, respectively, while the other two indices, PI and LS with the mean values of 8.141 and 1.188, respectively, suggest the corrosive behaviour. Further, the mean values of correlation coefficients, 0.18 and 0.27 for PI and LS, respectively, are higher compared with those for LI, AI and RI. The mean values of correlation coefficients of dissolved oxygen, chlorides and electrolytic conductivity are 0.33, 0.25 and 0.25, respectively, which are relatively higher compared with those of other quality parameters. The probable reasons for low correlation coefficients are explored based on the statistical data. Also, it was concluded that one of the significant factors, namely dissolved oxygen which has strong influence on corrosion of metals, was considered in none of the indices, leading to very low correlation between the theoretical and experimental values of corrosiveness.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				AUG	2017	76	16							568	10.1007/s12665-017-6908-y								WOS:000408499100022

Key topics include hydrology and hydromorphology; water quality; aquatic and riparian ecosystems; water in agriculture and forestry; and water management and supply.

In order to assess this, groundwater, river water and mine water samples were collected from Korba Coalfield and analysed for potentially toxic trace elements (PTEs) along with in situ parameters. Thereby, an integrated approach of pollution evaluation indices [heavy metal pollution index (HPI), heavy metal evaluation index (HEI) and contamination index (Cd)] and statistical techniques are applied to the results. Paired-sample t tests reveal that the PTE concentrations of the pre-monsoon samples are higher than those of the post-monsoon samples. At a few locations, the concentration of Fe (56%), As (56%), Al (26%), Mn (19%) in pre-monsoon and Mn (46%), Ni (15%), Ba (15%), Pb (8%) in post-monsoon seasons exceeds the acceptable limit of Indian drinking standards. However, HPI values are below the critical pollution index value of 100 in both seasons in spite of an excess of these elements. The pollution indices evaluated by the multiple of the mean values approach reveal that 100, 94, 87% of the pre-monsoon and 92, 92, 85% of the post-monsoon samples belong to the "low-to-medium'' category with respect to the HPI, HEI and Cd indices. The thematic map depicting the spatial distribution of the contamination index (Cd) testifies the role of a `` dilution effect'' that results in lower pollution loads in the post-monsoon samples than the pre-monsoon ones. The results of cluster analysis confirm that the quality of the water is mainly controlled by geogenic processes and anthropogenic inputs, besides dilution effects.

Major ions and water isotopes were measured. Results show that hydrological processes and hydrogeochemical evolution of shallow groundwater were greatly disturbed by human activities. Excessive pumping resulted in significant declines of groundwater levels over the study area. This also induced infiltration of surface water into groundwater. A groundwater depression cone was the conflux center of groundwater surrounded by recharge zones including alluvial fans and surface water in alluvial plain. Pumping almost was the only way to discharge groundwater. Emission of SOx and NOx contributed at least 11% of rock weathering by dissolving into infiltrating precipitation. Surface waters containing sewage replenished ambient groundwater with an average mixing ratio of 74 +/- 17% due to groundwater level drawdown. As a result, groundwater had elevated concentrations of Na+ and SO42- with Na+ exchanged into aquifer sediments. About 29 +/- 16% of Na+ was exchanged from groundwater into soil matrix. Agriculture nitrate was high only in the recharge zones. The most important result is that the transformation of the study area from a place rich in water resource into an area lack of water just took several decades with the joint action of the heavily human activities. Our study also indicates that shallow groundwater could sensitively respond to and record environmental changes.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				AUG	2017	76	16							571	10.1007/s12665-017-6918-9								WOS:000408499100025

Groundwater appraisal of Dhekiajuli, Assam, India: an insight of agricultural suitability and arsenic enrichment	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The present work is an effort to develop an appraisal of the hydrogeochemical regime for the aquifers of Dhekiajuli, Sonitpur district, Assam, which is imperative considering: (i) excessive use of groundwater for irrigation; (ii) reported high arsenic (As) contamination; (iii) application of fertilizer is an inevitable process undergoing in this region to achieve higher yield owing to deteriorating water quality; and (iv) study area being the location of many tea estates of Assam, that export tea in many foreign countries. The highest As concentration of 44.39 mu g/L was detected in this study (Bachasimalu and Sitalmari region), implying high As-contaminated aquifers being used for drinking and irrigation purposes in the area. The relative abundance pattern of major cations and anions was in the order of Na+ > Mg2+ > Ca2+ > K+ and HCO3- > Cl- > SO42-, respectively. Majority of the samples belong to Na+-K+-Cl--HCO3- and mixed water type. Closer inspection of Piper plot reveals that a higher As value ( > 40 mu g/L) was prevalent in HCO3- water type. Results of hydrogeochemical plots suggest silicate and carbonate weathering, ion exchange and anthropogenic activities to be the dominant processes governing groundwater contamination, including As which is further supported from PCA loadings. The Singri area to the east of the affected areas and adjacent to the Brahmaputra River has oxic aquifers owing to the absence of mass deposition of younger sediments, while reducing conditions prevails in the Bachasimalu and Sitalmari region. High positive correlation between As and Fe (r = 0.83**) and a negative correlation between ORP and Fe (r = -0.68**) further add that Fe (hydr)oxides are the direct source of As release in the affected region, the mechanism being reductive hydrolysis of such (hydr) oxides. The study implies that although groundwater is suitable for irrigation use, there is a high probability of As getting into the food chain through tea and other edible plants irrigated with As-contaminated water; thus, the area has a maximum probability of facing health hazards caused by As-contaminated groundwater.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				AUG	2017	76	15							530	10.1007/s12665-017-6841-0								WOS:000407545200023

The model was calibrated and validated for hydrology, sediment and water quality for the period 2003-2012. The model was run under two climate changes, two land use changes and four combined change scenarios for near-future period (2020-2049). The results revealed that projected climate change impacts include an increase in streamflow (maximum increases of 52% under RCP 2.6 in December and 170% under RCP 8.5). Projected sediment concentrations under climate change scenarios showed a monthly average decrease of 10%. For land use change scenarios, agricultural development scenario indicated an opposite direction of changes in orthophosphate (increases in all months with an average increase of 6% under agricultural development scenario), leading to the conclusion that land use change is the dominant factor in nutrient concentration changes. Combined impacts results indicated that streamflows in late fall and winter months increased while in summer and early fall decreased. Suspended sediment and orthophosphate concentrations were decreased in all months except for increases in suspended sediment concentrations in September and October and orthophosphate concentrations in late winter and early spring due to the impact of land use change scenarios.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				AUG	2017	76	15							543	10.1007/s12665-017-6880-6								WOS:000407545200036

As part of the waterway for the South-to-North Water Diversion Project of China, the water quality and trophic status of Lake Dongping are crucial for the successful operation of this project. In order to better understand the controlling factors of water quality and trophic status of Lake Dongping and to provide data for studying ecological baseline of lake restoration, the distribution and the controlling factors of subfossil chironomids were studied here. Our results show that a total of 41 taxa of subfossil chironomids are present in Lake Dongping. The dominant taxa consist of Stempellinella-Zavrelia (30.88%), Propsilocerus akamusi-type (26.79%), Paratanytarsus (13.15%), Cricotopus sylvestris-type (9.12%), and Hydrobaenus conformis-type (6.67%). Among them, the nutrient-tolerant taxa of Stempellinella-Zavrelia and eutrophic taxa of Propsilocerus akamusi-type are widely present in the lake, indicating that Lake Dongping is in a transition from mesotrophication to eutrophication. Redundancy analysis reveals that total phosphorus, water depth, and sulfate (SO42-) concentrations are dominant factors controlling the spatial distribution of subfossil chironomids, which explain 12, 9, and 8.5% of the variance, respectively. Therefore, in order to secure the water quality for the South-to-North Water Diversion Project, it is crucial to regulate the input of nutrient and sulfate to Lake Dongping.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				AUG	2017	76	15							524	10.1007/s12665-017-6858-4								WOS:000407545200017

Multicriteria Analysis to Select an Optimal Operating Option for a Water Grid	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT												Water supply systems are diversifying and expanding in response to climate pressures and population growth. However, these water grids present challenges for the water supply manager in identifying optimal operating options for the short term. This study demonstrates the final step in a framework to address these challenges, multicriteria analysis, using a case study based on the South East Queensland water grid. A shortlist of nine water grid operating options have been identified, which are optimal in terms of minimizing total operational cost, maximizing water security, and minimizing spills from reservoirs, over a 5-year period. This study assesses the performance of each of these nine operating options against a wider set of 18 criteria reflecting cost, supply reliability, environmental flow, water quality, reservoir spill, and water security concerns. The weighted summation multicriteria analysis technique is used to combine and rank performance of the nine operating options against the 18 criteria. An operating option is selected that performs best on average across the 18 criteria and four scenarios of preference weights. This operating option comprises a set of operating rules that can form the basis of a short-term optimal annual operating plan.

Water-economy models (WEMs), which integrate the complex interrelationships between hydrologic and economic systems, are effective tools for analyzing these issues and for providing appropriate solutions across varied spatial and temporal scales. These models can be powerful tools for examining potential future changes in water resources systems, including the effects of climate change, socioeconomic changes, and infrastructural and policy responses to water resource management challenges. In this paper, the WEM models used to answer water economy questions are classified into two general categories on the basis of their structure: network-based (simulation or optimization) hydroeconomic models, and economywide (input-output or computable general equilibrium) models. This paper highlights the primary differences in the applications and interpretations obtained using these approaches, analyzes the distribution of questions that different WEMs have been used to answer, and discusses previous work and efforts to integrate across model types. Findings suggest that additional efforts are needed to more realistically account for the range and complexity of linking water systems and society, particularly regarding ecology and water quality, and the food and energy sectors. Additionally, the broader economic impacts of water-related processes, for example those related to interregional trade dynamics, the distribution of income, and migration, should be investigated further. In effect, because of the inherent complexity in the economic dynamics underlying many water systems, such tools can challenge intuition and provide critical insights that are relevant to more effective management of transboundary water resources and related sectors.

J	Housh, M; Ohar, Z				Housh, Mashor; Ohar, Ziv			Multiobjective Calibration of Event-Detection Systems	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT												CANARY, developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), is a freeware designed for contamination events detection in water distribution systems. CANARY has several imbedded statistical methods for analyzing water quality data to detect contamination events. The imbedded methods require calibration of their parameters to achieve good performance. However, the multiobjective nature of the problem creates a conflict between high sensitivity which results in good detection but with many false alerts, and low sensitivity which results in a small number of false alarms but with poor detection. In this work, a MOGA-CANARY add-in for CANARY autocalibration is introduced. This tool could be used by CANARY users to find the optimal parameter configuration that fits their system. MOGA-CANARY gives the users the whole set of Pareto optimal system configurations based on their defined objectives. The results of MOGA-CANARY are compared with existing manual calibration methods proposed in CANARY documentation.

Grouping Water-Demand Nodes by Similarity among Flow Paths in Water-Distribution Systems	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT												The identification of monitoring or sensor locations, or demand estimation, within drinking water distribution systems can be challenging given the size of realistic network models. Approaches such as skeletonization or aggregation can effectively reduce a network model and are generally appropriate for satisfying hydraulic objectives. However, a reduced hydraulic network model might not be appropriate for water quality objectives because of altered transport characteristics. This study proposes a clustering approach that groups nodes with similar water quality characteristics within the context of maintaining the original network structure. The proposed approach uses an input-output relationship to assess the hydraulic path between any two nodes. Using the hydraulic path information, a k-means clustering algorithm identified nodes with similar hydraulic paths. For two different case studies, as the number of clusters increased, the nodes within each cluster were shown to become more similar. The differences in water quality characteristics between the individual clusters also increased, demonstrating the ability to generate more distinct clusters of nodes. By identifying nodes with similar water quality characteristics, the resulting clusters can provide future opportunities, for example, to reduce the problem size for monitoring or sensor selection by assuming the nodes within a given cluster behave similarly.

The objectives were to: reveal changes in the flow regime, assess anomalies in summer river flows, estimate the natural and wastewater effluent contribution and provide an ecological context for the in-stream conditions. The mean annual flow rate in the period 1996-2015 increased by 0.61 m(3)/s as compared to 1951-1970. The mean annual wastewater inflow rate to the river in 2015 was approximately 0.770 m(3)/s, constituting 39% of the observed flow. Almost the entire period of August this contribution approached 100%. The optimum river water temperature threshold for warm-water fish species was exceeded. Streamflow modifications are attributed to an increase of wastewater discharge, urban impact through an increase in imperviousness, and the variability of climatic driving forces.																	1747-6585	1747-6593				AUG	2017	31	3					345	352		10.1111/wej.12249								WOS:000408947500006

Timing of organic carbon release from mountain pine beetle impacted ponderosa pine forests in South Dakota	WATER AND ENVIRONMENT JOURNAL												The decay of mountain pine beetle (MPB) (Dendroctonus ponderosae) affected ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests has increased organic carbon (OC) loading within the Rapid Creek watershed in the Black Hills of South Dakota, with total OC (TOC) concentrations up to 6.2 mgL(-1) observed in 2015. The impacts of large-scale tree mortality on water quality were delayed. OC concentrations in the watershed correlated with recent MPB impact stage progression. Regional ponderosa pine forests that were 3 and 6 years after MPB infection (grey and snagfall phases) exhibited increased OC loading within the Rapid Creek watershed. A better understanding of regional watershed response patterns for MPB tree mortality may assist with mitigating ancillary water quality impacts.																	1747-6585	1747-6593				AUG	2017	31	3					375	379		10.1111/wej.12253								WOS:000408947500010

This study investigated the responses of streamflow and NPS pollutant loads to climate change in the 3S River Basin, a trans-boundary basin of the Mekong River, using Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Firstly, the SWAT model in simulations of streamflow and NPS pollutant loads was calibrated and validated against observed data to prove the reliability of the simulation results. Then, the calibrated SWAT model was used to simulate changes in streamflow and NPS pollutants under the impact of climate change. The simulation results indicated that the streamflow and NPS pollutant loads are predicted to increase in the future. Moreover, water shortage in the dry season and soil degradation in the wet season are emphasized to occur in the future.

Twenty-four extensive green roofs representing all combinations of the following four design factors were used: native meadow species versus Sedum; mineral-based versus biologically derived planting medium; 10-cm versus 15-cm depth; and irrigation provided daily, sensor controlled, or not at all. From events covering the period May-October in 2013 and 2014, mean values were determined for the seasonal volumetric runoff coefficient (C-vol = 0.4), peak runoff coefficient (C-peak = 0.12), and U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) curve number (CN = 94). Irrigation had the largest overall impact: daily irrigation increased C-vol to 0.5 compared to 0.3 for systems with sensor-controlled or no irrigation. The biologically derived planting medium, composed of a high proportion of aged wood compost, made a significant improvement, maintaining C-vol of 0.3 compared to 0.4 for the mineral-based product in the modules without irrigation. A similar pattern was found in the NRCS curve numbers. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Small, off-channel dams are generally ignored in impact assessments owing to limited information and spatial resolution issues. Previous research on South African rivers showed correlative links between high density of small dams and associated reductions in low flows, poorer water quality, and impoverished aquatic macroinvertebrate communities that were dominated by opportunistic taxa instead of specialist groups. 2 .Since small dams are usually associated with catchment transformation (for example, vineyards, stock farming and exotic timber plantations), they are convenient surrogates of the impacts of catchment transformation on river functionality. Here, an index of cumulative small dams for South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland is presented and evaluated. 3.Fifty-two per cent of the water management catchments in the study region exceeded the threshold for the cumulative small dams density (SDD) index above which river functionality is compromised. This estimate of potentially affected catchments is considered to be conservative for reasons discussed. 4.The index results are compared with a recent systematic biodiversity planning exercise for setting biodiversity targets for freshwater areas of South Africa. Although the systematic planning included in-stream small dams within 50m of a river, analysis showed that 36% of all quaternaries that have high SDD score overlap with river reaches classified as natural' or largely natural'. 5.Disregarding dams outside the 50m buffer area equates to ignoring the majority of small dams (94%) in South Africa, and it is recommended that aquatic conservation assessments include the SDD index as a cost layer for prioritizing rivers for rehabilitation and conservation.

Water Quality Impacts of Green Roofs Compared with Other Vegetated Sites	JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE WATER IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT												Green roofs are a convenient stormwater management strategy in highly developed, urbanized areas. Research has demonstrated that green roofs are effective at mitigating stormwater runoff volume, in addition to providing a range of other environmental benefits. Previous studies on the overflow from extensive green roofs have indicated that the overflow from these roofs, particularly those maintained with fertilizer, may contribute nutrients to nearby streams, storm sewers, and adjacent waterways. Whereas many studies have compared green roof nutrient concentrations with that of conventional roofs and urban streams, few studies have compared green roof effluent with other vegetated systems' effluent. In this study, located in Villanova, Pennsylvania, green roof effluent was evaluated and compared with vegetated land uses (e.g., woods and grass) and other stormwater control measures (e.g., bioinfiltration rain garden and constructed stormwater wetland) typically found in urban watersheds. Effluent samples from all sites were tested and analyzed for concentration and mass loading of nitrogen (nitrate, nitrite, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, and total nitrogen) and phosphorus (orthophosphate and phosphorus). Overall, the green roof effluent concentrations for nitrogen and phosphorus species were statistically different than the other land uses, and often with higher concentrations. The green roof effluent was most statistically similar to the wooded land use. From a mass loading perspective, in terms of unit area of the contributing watershed, the green roof had a higher loading than the other land uses. However, the fertilized green roof exported less than 15 percent of the total input mass of nitrogen and phosphorus, demonstrating that volume reduction aids in managing the effluent.

This study evaluates the hydrologic and water quality performance of a three year old, zero exfiltration pervious concrete parking lot in an urban area of St. Catharines, Ontario. Pervious concrete pavement exhibited a more naturalized hydrologic response compared with conventional asphalt, with volume reductions, and lag times to peak for every event observed, despite the zero exfiltration design preventing any infiltration into native soils. Residual concentrations in the pervious concrete effluent were below Provincial Water Quality Objectives and Canadian Water Quality Objectives for the majority of pollutants; however, high pH and elevated levels of aluminum and chromium were detected in the discharge. The site is well suited for further research, and long-term monitoring would help to evaluate the effectiveness of zero exfiltration systems in cold climates.

Understanding how to maintain a healthy state of the water cycle has become an important proposition for sustainable development of human society. In this paper, natural-social attributes of the water cycle are synthesized and 19 evaluation indices are selected from four dimensions, i.e., water-based ecosystem integrity, water quality, water resource abundance and water resource use. A hierarchical water-cycle health evaluation system is established. An analytic hierarchy process is used to set the weight of the criteria layer and index layer, and the health threshold for each index is defined. Finally, a water-cycle health composite-index assessment model and fuzzy recognition model are constructed based on the comprehensive index method and fuzzy mathematics theory. The model is used to evaluate the state of health of the water cycle in Beijing during 2010-2014 and in the planning year (late 2014), considering the transfer of 1 billion m(3) of water by the South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP). The results show health scores for Beijing of 2.87, 3.10, 3.38, 3.11 and 3.02 during 2010-2014. The results of fuzzy recognition show that the sub healthy grade accounted for 54%, 49%, 61% and 49% of the total score, and all years had a sub -healthy state. Results of the criteria layer analysis show that water ecosystem function, water quality and water use were all at the sub -healthy level and that water abundance was at the lowest, or sick, level. With the water transfer from the SNWDP, the health score of the water cycle in Beijing reached 4.04. The healthy grade accounted for 60% of the total score, and the water cycle system was generally in a healthy state. Beijing's water cycle health level is expected to further improve with increasing water diversion from the SNWDP and industrial restructuring. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Coupling habitat suitability and ecosystem health with AEHRA to estimate E-flows under intensive human activities	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Sustaining adequate environmental flows (e-flows) is a key principle for maintaining river biodiversity and ecosystem health, and for supporting sustainable water resource management in basins under intensive human activities. But few methods could correctly relate river health to e-flows assessment at the catchment scale when they are applied to rivers highly impacted by human activities. An effective method is presented in this study to closely link river health to e-flows assessment for rivers at the catchment scale. Key fish species, as indicators of ecosystem health, were selected by using the foodweb model. A multi-species-based habitat suitability model (MHSI) was improved, and coupled with dominance of the key fish species as well as the Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) to enhance its accuracy in determining the fish-preferred key hydrologic habitat variables related to ecosystem health. Taking 5964 fish samples and concurrent hydrological habitat variables as the basis, the combination of key variables of flow-velocity and water-depth were determined and used to drive the Adapted Ecological Hydraulic Radius Approach (AEHRA) to study e-flows in a Chinese urban river impacted by intensive human activities. Results showed that upstream urbanization resulted in abnormal river-course geomorphology and consequently abnormal e-flows under intensive human activities. Selection of key species based on the foodweb and trophic levels of aquatic ecosystems can reflect a comprehensive requirement on e-flows of the whole aquatic ecosystem, which greatly increases its potential to be used as a guidance tool for rehabilitation of degraded ecosystems at large spatial scales. These findings have significant ramifications for catchment e-flows assessment under intensive human activities and for river ecohealth restoration in such rivers globally. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, its natural water chemistry (major elements) received little attention though it is crucial for water quality and aquatic ecology. Major ions during 2004-2014 were determined using stoichiometry to explore their shifts and the driving factors in the Danjiangkou Reservoir. Results show significant differences in monthly, spatial and annual concentrations of major ions. Waters are controlled by carbonate weathering with the dominant ions of Ca2+ and HCO3- total contributing 74% to the solutes, which are consistent with regional geography. Carbonate dissolution was produced by sulfuric acid and carbonic acid in particular. The relative abundance of Ca2+ gradually decreases, Na+ + K+ abundance, however, has doubled in the recent 11 years. Population and human activities were the major drivers for several major ions, i.e., and Na+ concentrations were explained by population and GDP, and SO42- by GDP, industrial sewage and energy consumption. Estimation indicated that domestic salts and atmospheric deposition contributed 56% and 22% to Cl-, respectively. We conclude waters in the Reservoir are naturally controlled by rock weathering whilst some key elements largely contributed by anthropogenic activities. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This study presents a new fuzzy-based multi-objective compromise methodology to determine the socio-optimal and sustainable policies for hydro-environmental management of groundwater resources, which simultaneously considers the conflicts and negotiation of involved stakeholders, uncertainties in decision makers' preferences, existing uncertainties in the groundwater parameters and groundwater quality and quantity issues. The fuzzy multi-objective simulation-optimization model is developed based on qualitative and quantitative groundwater simulation model (MODFLOW and MT3D), multi-objective optimization model (NSGA-II), Monte Carlo analysis and Fuzzy Transformation Method (FTM). Best compromise solutions (best management policies) on trade-off curves are determined using four different Fuzzy Social Choice (FSC) methods. Finally, a unanimity fallback bargaining method is utilized to suggest the most preferred FSC method. Kavar-Maharloo aquifer system in Fars, Iran, as a typical multi-stakeholder multi-objective real-world problem is considered to verify the proposed methodology.

Overexploitation of groundwater in this plain has led to water level decline and caused serious problems such as land subsidence, aquifer destruction and water quality degradation. The increasing population and agricultural development along with drought and climate change, have further increased the pressure on water resources in this region over the last years. In order to overcome such crisis, introduction of surface water into an aquifer at particular locations can be a suitable solution. A wide variety of methods have been developed to recharge groundwater, one of which is aquifer storage and recovery (ASR). One of the fundamental principles of making such systems is delineation of suitable areas based on scientific and natural facts in order to achieve relevant objectives. To that end, the Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) in conjunction with the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) was applied in this study. More specifically, nine main parameters including depth of runoff as the considered source of water, morphology of the earth surface features such as geology, geomorphology, land use and land cover, drainage and aquifer characteristics along with quality of water in the aquifer were considered as the main layers in GIS. The runoff water available for artificial recharge in the basin was estimated through Soil Conservation Service (SCS) curve number method. The weighted curve number for each watershed was derived through spatial intersection of land use and hydrological soil group layers. Other thematic layers were extracted from satellite images, topographical map, and other collateral data sources, then weighed according to their influence in locating process. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method was then used to calculate weights of individual parameters. The normalized weighted layers were then overlaid to build up the recharge potential map. The results revealed that 34% of the total area is suitable and very suitable for groundwater recharge. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Seawater-flooding events and impact on freshwater lenses of low-lying islands: Controlling factors, basic management and mitigation	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												An unprecedented set of hydrologic observations was collected after the Dec 2008 seawater-flooding event on Roi-Namur, Kwajalein Atoll, Republic of the Marshall Islands. By two days after the seawater flooding that occurred at the beginning of dry season, the observed salinity of water withdrawn by the island's main skimming well increased to 100% seawater concentration, but by ten days later already decreased to only 10-20% of seawater fraction. However, the damaging impact on the potability of the groundwater supply (when pumped water had concentrations above 1% seawater fraction) lasted 22 months longer. The data collected make possible analyses of the hydrologic factors that control recovery and management of the groundwater-supply quality on Roi-Namur and on similar low-lying islands. With the observed data as a guide, three-dimensional numerical-model simulation analyses reveal how recovery is controlled by the island's hydrology. These also allow evaluation of the efficacy of basic water quality management/mitigation alternatives and elucidate how groundwater withdrawal and timing of the seawater-flooding event affect the length of recovery. Simulations show that, as might be expected, by adding surplus captured rainwater as artificial recharge, the freshwater-lens recovery period (after which potable groundwater may again be produced) can be shortened, with groundwater salinity remaining lower even during the dry season, a period during which no artificial recharge is applied. Simulations also show that the recovery period is not lengthened appreciably by groundwater withdrawals during recovery. Simulations further show that had the flooding event occurred at the start of the wet season, the recovery period would have been about 25% (5.5 months) shorter than actually occurred during the monitored flood that occurred at the dry-season start. Finally, analyses show that artificial recharge improves freshwater-lens water quality, making possible longer use of groundwater as a water supply throughout each year, even when no seawater flooding has occurred.

These data resulted in electrical resistivity images to depths of approximately 280 m.b.s.l., which were used to understand the distribution of freshwater and saltwater in the subsurface, and factors controlling this distribution. The resulting resistivity sections were interpreted in conjunction with existing data sets, including well logs, seismic reflection data, geologic reports, hydrologic reports, and land use maps from the region. Interpretation of these data shows a complex pattern of saltwater intrusion resulting from geology, pumping, and recharge. The resistivity profiles were used to identify geological flow conduits and barriers such as palaeo-channels and faults, localized saltwater intrusion from individual pumping wells, infiltration zones of surface fresh and brackish water, and regions showing improvements in water quality due to management actions. The use of ERT data for characterizing the subsurface in this region has led to an understanding of the spatial distribution of freshwater and saltwater at a level of detail unattainable with the previously deployed traditional well based salinity mapping and monitoring techniques alone. Significant spatial variability in the extent and geometry of intrusion observed in the acquired data highlights the importance of adopting continuous subsurface characterization methods such as this one.

Improvements in Standardized Testing for Evaluating Sediment Barrier Performance: Design of a Full-Scale Testing Apparatus	JOURNAL OF IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE ENGINEERING												Perimeter controls [i.e., sediment barriers (SBs) or sediment retention devices] are typically used on construction sites to retain sediment and prevent polluted stormwater runoff from adversely affecting aquatic habitats and clogging storm sewers. Often, parameters based on rule-of-thumb are applied to the design of SBs without knowing their expected performance capabilities. This issue is further complicated by the difficulty in devising a scientifically sound, repeatable testing methodology, replicating field conditions to assess performance. To resolve this issue, a test apparatus was designed and constructed at the Auburn University-Erosion and Sediment Control Test Facility to replicate in-field rainfall runoff rates for purposes of conducting full-scale experiments on various SBs. This apparatus allows for performance testing and direct comparisons between various SB products, practices, and installations. The overall intent of conducting full-scale testing is to improve design criteria and enhance the in-field performance of SB practices. Initial test results for a woven polypropylene silt fence reinforced with a polypropylene grid and supported by wooden posts performed well structurally with an average sediment retention rate of 90.5% by volume.

Long-Term Simulations of the Hydrology for Sugarcane Fields in the Humid Tropics: Case Study on Guyana's Coastland	JOURNAL OF IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE ENGINEERING												A 4.2-ha sugarcane field in Guyana was instrumented to measure hydrometeorological variables and water table depths in order to calibrate DRAINMOD. The model performs favorably, with a Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (NSE) of 0.72, index of agreement (IoA) of 0.92, mean absolute error (MAE) of 16.5 cm and percentage bias (PBIAS) of 1.0%. DRAINMOD is then used for long-term simulations of the field hydrology using historical climate data. The simulated field discharges are used to compute average drainage rates (DR) for five durations (1-day; 2-day, ..., 5-day). The annual maximum drainage rates for each of the five durations are then fitted to the Gumbel distribution (EV1) for frequency analysis. The return period for an average 3-day (DR3) duration drainage event is estimated, and it is shown that the historical design drainage coefficients (35-50 mm day(-1)) used for surface drainage systems in sugarcane fields along Guyana's coastland have return periods ranging from 1 in 2 years to 1 in 5 years. These return periods are within recommended values commonly used for agricultural drainage systems.

Informed use of clay rock formations to achieve low carbon or carbon-free energy goals requires the ability to predict the rates of diffusive transport processes for chemically diverse dissolved and gaseous species over periods up to thousands of years. We survey the composition, properties and uses of clay rock and summarize fundamental science challenges in developing confident conceptual and quantitative gas and solute transport models.

An optical method for characterizing carbon content in ceramic pot filters	JOURNAL OF WATER AND HEALTH												Ceramic pot filter (CPF) technology is a relatively common means of household water treatment in developing areas, and performance characteristics of CPFs have been characterized using production CPFs, experimental CPFs fabricated in research laboratories, and ceramic disks intended to be CPF surrogates. There is evidence that CPF manufacturers do not always fire their products according to best practices and the result is incomplete combustion of the pore forming material and the creation of a carbon core in the final CPFs. Researchers seldom acknowledge the existence of potential existence of carbon cores, and at least one CPF producer has postulated that the carbon may be beneficial in terms of final water quality because of the presence of activated carbon in consumer filters marketed in the Western world. An initial step in characterizing the presence and impact of carbon cores is the characterization of those cores. An optical method which may be more viable to producers relative to off-site laboratory analysis of carbon content has been developed and verified. The use of the optical method is demonstrated via preliminary disinfection and flowrate studies, and the results of these studies indicate that the method may be of use in studying production kiln operation.																	1477-8920					AUG	2017	15	4					536	544		10.2166/wh.2017.049								WOS:000407037100007	28771151

Modeling effect of cover condition and soil type on rotavirus transport in surface flow	JOURNAL OF WATER AND HEALTH												Runoff from animal production facilities contains various microbial pathogens which pose a health hazard to both humans and animals. Rotavirus is a frequently detected pathogen in agricultural runoff and the leading cause of death among children around the world. Diarrheal infection caused by rotavirus causes more than two million hospitalizations and death of more than 500,000 children every year. Very little information is available on the environmental factors governing rotavirus transport in surface runoff. The objective of this study is to model rotavirus transport in overland flow and to compare the model results with experimental observations. A physically based model, which incorporates the transport of infective rotavirus particles in both liquid (suspension or free-floating) and solid phase (adsorbed to soil particles), has been used in this study. Comparison of the model results with experimental results showed that the model could reproduce the recovery kinetics satisfactorily but under-predicted the virus recovery in a few cases when multiple peaks were observed during experiments. Similarly, the calibrated model had a good agreement between observed and modeled total virus recovery. The model may prove to be a promising tool for developing effective management practices for controlling microbial pathogens in surface runoff.																	1477-8920					AUG	2017	15	4					545	554		10.2166/wh.2017.240								WOS:000407037100008	28771152

Modelling spatio-temporal heterogeneities in groundwater quality in Ghana: a multivariate chemometric approach	JOURNAL OF WATER AND HEALTH												Chemometric techniques were applied to evaluate the spatial and temporal heterogeneities in groundwater quality data for approximately 740 goldmining and agriculture-intensive locations in Ghana. The strongest linear and monotonic relationships occurred between Mn and Fe. Sixty-nine per cent of total variance in the dataset was explained by four variance factors: physicochemical properties, bacteriological quality, natural geologic attributes and anthropogenic factors (artisanal goldmining). There was evidence of significant differences in means of all trace metals and physicochemical parameters (p < 0.001) between goldmining and non-goldmining locations. Arsenic and turbidity produced very high value F's demonstrating that 'physical properties and chalcophilic elements' was the function that most discriminated between non-goldmining and goldmining locations. Variations in Escherichia coli and total coliforms were observed between the dry and wet seasons. The overall predictive accuracy of the discriminant function showed that non-goldmining locations were classified with slightly better accuracy (89%) than goldmining areas (69.6%). There were significant differences between the underlying distributions of Cd, Mn and Pb in the wet and dry seasons. This study emphasizes the practicality of chemometrics in the assessment and elucidation of complex water quality datasets to promote effective management of groundwater resources for sustaining human health.																	1477-8920					AUG	2017	15	4					658	672		10.2166/wh.2017.244								WOS:000407037100018	28771162

The annual (1977-2015) mean river flow of 26.32 billion (109) cubic metres (BCM) with a range of 13.77 to 42.2 BCM and standard deviation of 6.026 BCM revealed no significant trend in annual inflow data of the Kabul River. Afghanistan planned developments in the basin were analysed in the light of reduction in the transboundary flow. Faecal coliforms, pH (7.90 to 8.06), Escherichia coli and other water quality parameters were found to be within permissible limits, however, dissolved oxygen was just above the permissible limits to sustain aquatic life. Water was found unsuitable for drinking while suitable for agriculture and aquatic life. Remote sensing data used for temporal change detection showed an increase in built-up-areas and cultivated areas along Kabul River inside Pakistan by 50 and 47%, respectively. Significant changes were observed at two locations in the river course. Insights of emerging Kabul River issues and a way forward have been discussed which could serve as the basis for formulation of adaption strategies leading to a 'Kabul River Water Treaty'.																	1366-7017					AUG	2017	19	4					650	672		10.2166/wp.2017.119								WOS:000407448400005

Channel routing is a typical example of the mathematical conceptualization of watershed landscape and processes in hydrologic modeling. We investigated the sensitivity of accuracy, equifinality, and uncertainty of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) modeling to channel dimensions to demonstrate how a conceptual representation of a watershed system affects streamflow and sediment modeling. Results showed the amount of uncertainty and equifinality strongly responded to channel dimensions. On the other hand, the model performance did not significantly vary with the changes in the channel representation due to the degree of freedom allowed by the conceptual nature of hydrologic modeling in the parameter calibration. Such findings demonstrated good modeling performance statistics do not necessarily mean small output uncertainty, and partial improvements in the watershed representation may neither increase modeling accuracy nor reduce uncertainty. We also showed the equifinality and uncertainty of hydrologic modeling are case-dependent rather than specific to models or regions, suggesting great caution should be used when attempting to transfer uncertainty analysis results to other modeling studies, especially for ungauged watersheds.

J	Shabani, A; Zhang, XD; Ell, M				Shabani, Afshin; Zhang, Xiaodong; Ell, Mike			Modeling Water Quantity and Sulfate Concentrations in the Devils Lake Watershed Using Coupled SWAT and CE-QUAL-W2	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Devils Lake is an endorheic lake in the Red River of the North basin in northeastern North Dakota. During the last two decades, the lake water level has risen by nearly 10m, causing floods that have cost more than 1 billion USD in mitigation measures. Another increase of approximately 1.5m in the lake water level would cause spillage into the Sheyenne River. To alleviate this potentially catastrophic spillage, two artificial outlets were constructed. However, the artificial drainage of water into the Sheyenne River raises water quality concerns because the Devils Lake water contains significantly higher concentrations of dissolved solids, particularly sulfate. In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was coupled with the CE-QUAL-W2 model to simulate both water balance and sulfate concentrations in the lake. The SWAT model performed well in simulating daily flow in tributaries with E-NS>0.5 and |PBIAS|<25%, and reproduced the lake water level with a root mean square error of 0.35m for the study period from 1995 to 2014. The water temperature and sulfate concentrations simulated by CE-QUAL-W2 for the lake are in general agreement with the field observations. The model results show that the operation of the two outlets since August 2005 has lowered the lake level by 0.70m. Furthermore, the models show pumping water from the two outlets raises sulfate concentrations in the Sheyenne River from similar to 100 to >500mg/L.

Agricultural drainage ditches function to remove water quickly from farmed landscapes. Conventional ditch designs lack the form and function of natural stream systems and tend to be unstable and provide inadequate habitat. In October of 2009, 1.89km of a conventional drainage ditch in Mower County, Minnesota, was converted to an alternative system with a two-stage channel to investigate the improvements in water quality, stability, and habitat. Longitudinal surveys show a 12-fold increase in the pool-riffle formation. Cross-sectional surveys show an average increase in bankfull width of approximately 10% and may be associated to an increased frequency in large storm events. The average increase in bankfull depth was estimated as 18% but is largely influenced by pool formation. Rosgen Stability Analyses show the channel to be highly stable and the banks at a low risk of erosion. The average bankfull recurrence interval was estimated to be approximately 0.30years. Overall, the two-stage ditch design demonstrates an increase in fluvial stability, creating a more consistent sediment budget, and increasing the frequency of important instream habitat features, making this best management practice a viable option for addressing issues of erosion, sediment imbalance, and poor habitat in agricultural drainage systems.																	1093-474X	1752-1688				AUG	2017	53	4					886	902		10.1111/1752-1688.12541								WOS:000407043700011

Improving Predictive Models of In-Stream Phosphorus Concentration Based on Nationally-Available Spatial Data Coverages	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Spatial data are playing an increasingly important role in watershed science and management. Large investments have been made by government agencies to provide nationally-available spatial databases; however, their relevance and suitability for local watershed applications is largely unscrutinized. We investigated how goodness of fit and predictive accuracy of total phosphorus (TP) concentration models developed from nationally-available spatial data could be improved by including local watershed-specific data in the East Fork of the Little Miami River, Ohio, a 1,290km(2) watershed. We also determined whether a spatial stream network (SSN) modeling approach improved on multiple linear regression (nonspatial) models. Goodness of fit and predictive accuracy were highest for the SSN model that included local covariates, and lowest for the nonspatial model developed from national data. Septic systems and point source TP loads were significant covariates in the local models. These local data not only improved the models but enabled a more explicit interpretation of the processes affecting TP concentrations than more generic national covariates. The results suggest SSN modeling greatly improves prediction and should be applied when using national covariates. Including local covariates further increases the accuracy of TP predictions throughout the studied watershed; such variables should be included in future national databases, particularly the locations of septic systems.

In the present study, LNA and HNA bacterial growth characteristics and effect of water physicochemical properties on these two subgroups were analyzed at the branch ends of a DWDS. The results showed that LNA bacteria were in the majority in tap water (67.2% +/- 16.6%) and the specific growth rate (0.469 +/- 0.022/d) was lower than that of HNA bacteria (1.116 +/- 0.195/d). LNA and HNA bacteria showed different responses to water physicochemical properties. The LNA bacteria dominated the microbial community under relatively high conductivity conditions, and the HNA bacteria were predominant in high turbidity or alkalescence environments. The LNA bacteria growth rate was positively correlated to the assimilable organic carbon concentration. In addition, multivariate ordination illustrated that there were clear variances in water quality among outlets, which could result from different pipeline distances and hydraulic conditions.																	0003-7214	1365-2087				AUG	2017	66	5					300	307		10.2166/aqua.2017.108								WOS:000406745900002

The applied database consisted of measurements from seven different sampling sites in the protected area over the study period 2007-2008. The cover percentage of the exotic fern was modelled based on various wetland characteristics. The predictive performances of the both data-driven methods were assessed based on the percentage of Correctly Classified Instances and Cohen's kappa statistics. The results of the Paired Student's t-test (p < 0.01) showed that SVMs outperformed the CTs and thus yielded more reliable prediction than the CTs.

Evaluation of bank filtration as a pretreatment method for the provision of hygienically safe drinking water in Norway: results from monitoring at two full-scale sites	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Two case studies were carried out in central Norway in order to assess the performance of bank filtration systems in cold-climate fluvial aquifers relying on recharge from humic-rich surface waters with moderate microbial contamination. Three municipal wells and two surface-water sources at operative bank filtration systems were monitored for naturally occurring bacteriophages, fecal indicators, natural organic matter (NOM) and physico-chemical water quality parameters during a 4-month period. Aquifer passage effectively reduced the microorganism and NOM concentrations at both study sites. Bacteriophages were detected in 13 of 16 (81%) surface-water samples and in 4 of 24 (17%) well-water samples, and underwent 3 +/- 0.3 log(10) reduction after 50-80-m filtration and 20-30 days of subsurface passage. NOM reductions (color: 74-97%; dissolved organic carbon: 54-80%; very hydrophobic acids: 70%) were similar to those achieved by conventional water-treatment processes and no further treatment was needed. Both groundwater dilution and sediment filtration contributed to the hygienic water quality improvements, but sediment filtration appeared to be the most important process with regard to microbial and NOM reductions. A strengths-weaknesses-opportunities-threats analysis showed that bank filtration technology has a high potential as a pretreatment method for the provision of hygienically safe drinking water in Norway.																	1431-2174	1435-0157				AUG	2017	25	5					1257	1269		10.1007/s10040-017-1576-2								WOS:000406286200005

Interpreting temporal variations in river response functions: an example from the Arkansas River, Kansas, USA	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Groundwater/surface-water interactions can play an important role in management of water quality and quantity, but the temporal and spatial variability of these interactions makes them difficult to incorporate into conceptual models. There are simple methods for identifying the presence of groundwater/surface-water interactions; however, identifying flow mechanisms and pathways can be challenging. More complex methods are available to better identify these mechanisms and pathways but are often too time consuming or costly. In this work, a simple method for interpreting and identifying flow mechanisms and sources using temporal variations of river response functions is presented. This approach is demonstrated using observations from two sites along the Arkansas River in Kansas, USA. A change in flow mechanisms between the rising and falling limbs of river hydrographs was identified, along with a second surface-water source to the aquifer, a finding that was validated with stable isotope analyses.																	1431-2174	1435-0157				AUG	2017	25	5					1271	1282		10.1007/s10040-017-1545-9								WOS:000406286200006

The SBR method is validated against synthetic data competitively with other conventional robust and non-robust methods. From the results, it is verified that the estimation accuracies of the SBR method are consistent and superior to those of other methods, and the uncertainties are reasonably estimated; the others have no uncertainty analysis option. To validate further, actual groundwater data are employed and analyzed comparatively with Gaussian process regression (GPR). For all cases, the trend and the associated uncertainties are reasonably estimated by both SBR and GPR regardless of Gaussian or non-Gaussian skewed data. However, it is expected that GPR has a limitation in applications to severely corrupted data by outliers owing to its non-robustness. From the implementations, it is determined that the SBR method has the potential to be further developed as an effective tool of anomaly detection or outlier identification in groundwater state data such as the groundwater level and contaminant concentration.																	1431-2174	1435-0157				AUG	2017	25	5					1491	1500		10.1007/s10040-017-1561-9								WOS:000406286200019

These external nutrient load reductions interact with retention and removal processes (ecosystem services) in coastal and marine waters. Beside sedimentation, denitrification is the most important regulation ecosystem service provided by the sea, because it removes nitrogen (N) to the atmosphere and controls eutrophication. Denitrification is a spatially and temporally highly variable process and largely depends on temperature and N concentrations in the water. Climate change will have strong effects on denitrification. Increasing temperatures favour denitrification and changes in precipitation and discharge will alter the availability of N, with strong differences between river basins. We combine a 3D-ecosystem model of the Baltic Sea with economic marginal cost functions for three major Baltic river basins: Odra, Vistula and Neva. Objective is to calculate the monetary consequences of climate change (scenario A1B) for the implementation of water quality objectives, taking into account both, spatial changes in N loads and denitrification. In all regions over 90% of the entering N loads are subject to denitrification mainly in coastal waters. For the climate change scenario (A1B), our approach suggests reduced riverine N-loads of 7690 t/a (Odra), 6410 t/a (Vistula) and increased loads of 3200 t/a for the Neva. At the same time our model results suggest an increased denitrification of N-loads by 9.1% (Odra) and 9.9% (Neva) and minor changes with respect to the Vistula loads. In combination, in all three regions climate change helps to reach policy targets (lower N concentrations in the sea) at lower costs. The monetary benefit of load reduction measures that do not have to be implemented because of climate change are 11,270 million (sic)/a (Odra), 2000 million (sic)/a (Vistula) and 92 million (sic)/a (Neva). The valuations strongly depend on the assumed climate change scenario and the economic approach, but indicate that climate change effects differ much between river basins and should be taken into account in nutrient load reduction management plans.

In this study, fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) were used to estimate five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (COD), suspended sediment (SS), total nitrogen (TN), pH, total phosphorus (TP), ammonia nitrogen (NH3+-N), turbidity (NTU), and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in inland freshwater streams. The study area was located in Ebinur Lake Watershed, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China. Our results showed that the four fluorescence components were successfully extrapolated by the PARAFAC factor analysis modeling from the fluorescence EEM data including microbial humic-like (C1), terrestrial humic-like organic substances (C2, C4), and protein-like organic substances (C3). The four PARAFAC components were selected as the water quality monitoring index of river water samples. Three-dimensional fluorescence index analysis showed that terrigenous organic pollution was the main organic pollution type in the watershed. This indicates that the watershed is subject to human disturbance, given the large variation of organic pollution in the water body. There was a significant correlation between the three-dimensional fluorescence index, the fluorescence components, and surface water quality index. In addition, the application of three-dimensional fluorescence index and fluorescence component to establish water quality index produced a model fitting coefficient greater than 0.5, which demonstrated that the accuracy of the model was in line with monitoring requirements in practice. This implies that the use of three-dimensional fluorescence index and three-dimensional fluorescence component to monitor Ebinur Lake Watershed water quality has a great potential.

Arsenic concentrations (mu g/L) were ranged from 12 to 448.5 and which exceeded the WHO recommended limit (10 mu g/L) in all cases. The calculated average daily dose (3.3 x 10(-0.4) to 1.2 x 10(-0.2) mg/kg day) and hazard quotient (1.1-40) reflected the potential health risk to local population due to tube well water consumption as drinking purpose. Sodium percent (Na%), sodium absorption ratio, residual sodium carbonate, Kelly's index and magnesium absorption ratio were also determined to assess the suitability of tube well water for irrigation purpose. The resulting piper plot revealed the Na-Ca-HCO3 type water chemistry of the area and generally alkaline environment. The spatial distribution of arsenic in the tube well waters pinpoints the significant contribution of anthropogenic activities to arsenic pollution. Nevertheless, different statistical tools, including principal component analysis, hierarchical cluster analysis and correlation matrices, revealed the contribution of both natural and anthropogenic activities and alkaline type of aquifers toward the high level of arsenic contamination.

J	Boulos, PF				Boulos, Paul F.			Smart Water Network Modeling for Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Urbanization can significantly increase the load on aging, inefficient and already strained sewer infrastructure, resulting in catastrophic pipe failure, unwanted spillage, property damage, and serious threat to public health. Urbanization can also dramatically alter the natural water cycle, resulting in diminished water quality, increased frequency and severity of flooding, channel erosion and destruction of aquatic habitat. Recent advances in smart water network (SWN) modeling technology have played a crucial and growing role in addressing these challenges. SWN technology has equipped practicing engineers with a comprehensive set of analytical decision making tools designed to help them preserve structural integrity, manage and reduce the risks of sewer overflow and urban runoff, improve resiliency and keep their urban drainage networks operating well into the future. These advances propel routine conveyance system analysis from basic planning and design to two-dimensional surface/ subsurface flow modeling, real-time operation and control, analytical risk-based asset integrity and condition assessment, and optimal selection and placement of green infrastructure based on cost and effectiveness. SWN is providing critically needed support to federal, state, and local agencies and watershed practitioners - not only in optimizing their integrated water management and adaptation strategies, but in ensuring sustainable drainage, addressing environmental quality restoration and protection needs in urban and developing areas, and improving communities' resiliency. It is also within the grasp of utilities of all sizes, but they need to seize the opportunity.																	0920-4741	1573-1650				AUG	2017	31	10					3177	3188		10.1007/s11269-017-1699-1								WOS:000403791300018						
J	Tayfur, G				Tayfur, Gokmen			Modern Optimization Methods in Water Resources Planning, Engineering and Management	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Mathematical (analytical, numerical and optimization) models are employed in many disciplines including the water resources planning, engineering and management. These models can vary from a simple black-box model to a sophisticated distributed physics-based model. Recently, development and employment of modern optimization methods (MOMs) have become popular in the area of mathematical modeling. This paper overviews the MOMs based on the evolutionary search which were developed over mostly the last 30 years. These methods have wide application in practice from finance to engineering and this paper focuses mostly on the applications in the area of water resources planning, engineering and management. Although there are numerous optimization algorithms, the paper outlines the ones that have been widely employed especially in the last three decades; such as the Genetic Algorithm (GA), Ant Colony (AC), Differential Evolution (DE), Particle Swarm (PS), Harmony Search (HS), Genetic Programming (GP), and Gene Expression Programming (GEP). The paper briefly introduces theoretical background of each algorithm and its applications and discusses the merits and, if any, shortcomings. The wide spectrum of applications include, but not limited to, flood control and mitigation, reservoir operation, irrigation, flood routing, river training, flow velocity, rainfall-runoff processes, sediment transport, groundwater management, water quality, hydropower, dispersion, and aquifers.																	0920-4741	1573-1650				AUG	2017	31	10					3205	3233		10.1007/s11269-017-1694-6								WOS:000403791300020

In particular, inadequate sanitation resulting in high contamination of surface water with pathogens of fecal origin is a serious issue in developing countries such as Lao P.D.R. Despite the health implications of the consumption of contaminated surface water, the environmental fate and transport of pathogens of fecal origin and their indicators (Fecal Indicator Bacteria or FIB) are still poorly known in tropical areas. In this study, we used measurements of flow rates, suspended sediments and of the FIB Escherichia coli (E. coli) in a 60-ha catchment in Northern Laos to explore the ability of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to simulate watershed-scale FIB fate and transport. We assessed the influences of 3 in-stream processes, namely bacteria deposition and resuspension, bacterial regrowth, and hyporheic exchange (i.e. transient storage) on predicted FIB numbers. We showed that the SWAT model in its original version does not correctly simulate small E. coli numbers during the dry season. We showed that model's performance could be improved when considering the release of E. coli together with sediment resuspension. We demonstrated that the hyporheic exchange of bacteria across the Sediment-Water Interface (SWI) should be considered when simulating FIB concentration not only during wet weather, but also during the dry season, or baseflow period. In contrast, the implementation of the regrowth process did not improve the model during the dry season without inducing an overestimation during the wet season. This work thus underlines the importance of taking into account in-stream processes, such as deposition and resuspension, regrowth and hyporheic exchange, when using SWAT to simulate FIB dynamics in surface waters.

Currently used methods within EU allow at least a 2.2 day period for obtaining the analytical results, making outdated the information forwarded to the public. Obtained results and beach assessment are influenced by the temporal and spatial characteristics of sample collection, and numerous environmental parameters, as well as by differences of official water standards. This paper examines the temporal variation of microbiological parameters during the day, as well as the influence of the sampling hour, on decision processes in the management of the beach. Apart from the fecal indicators stipulated by the EU Bathing Water Directive (E. coli and enterococci), additional fecal (C. perfringens) and non-fecal (S. aureus and P. aeriginosa) parameters were analyzed. Moreover, the effects of applying different evaluation criteria (national, EU and U.S. EPA) to beach ranking were studied, and the most common reasons for exceeding water-quality standards were investigated. In order to upgrade routine monitoring, a predictive statistical model was developed. The highest concentrations of fecal indicators were recorded early in the morning (6 AM) due to the lack of solar radiation during the night period. When compared to enterococci, E. coli criteria appears to be more stringent for the detection of fecal pollution. In comparison to EU and U.S. EPA criteria, Croatian national evaluation criteria provide stricter public health standards. Solar radiation and precipitation were the predominant environmental parameters affecting beach water quality, and these parameters were included in the predictive model setup. Predictive models revealed great potential for the monitoring of recreational water bodies, and with further development can become a useful tool for the improvement of public health protection.

A novel concept in ground water quality management: Towards function specific screening values	WATER RESEARCH												This paper is meant to initiate and feed the discussion on a more sophisticated procedure for the derivation and use of groundwater screening values (GSVs). To this purpose, the possibilities and tools for the derivation of function specific GSVs, i.e., GSVs that depend on the actual contact of humans and ecosystems with groundwater and groundwater-related mediums, are elaborated in this study. Application of GSVs geared to the specific use and function of specific groundwater volumes could result in a more effective and cost-efficient groundwater quality management, without compromising the protection of human health and the ecosystem. Therefore, a procedure to derive function specific GSVs was developed. For illustrative purposes, risk limits have been derived for human health and ecological protection targets, for arsenic, benzene, methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and vinylchloride. Agriculture and Nature reserves (combined), Residential and Industrial land uses have been considered and two different groundwater management purposes, i.e., curative and sustainable groundwater management. For each of the four contaminants, this results in a series of risks limits for each function and land use combination. It is shown that for all four contaminants higher groundwater screening values are considered appropriate for less sensitive combinations of function and land use. In the process towards (policy) implementation of these function specific GSV, it is recommended to evaluate the selection of protection targets; the scientific basis of the risk assessment procedures applied and the methodology to assess the time factor for groundwater quality assessment, given the fact that groundwater is a dynamic medium. Moreover, protection levels must be harmonized with national or regional groundwater quality standards and correspond with the requirements of the Groundwater Daughter Directive of the European Union Water Framework Directive. Groundwater plumes that are judged as 'no need for remediation' are not compatible with the Water Framework Directive requirement to take actions to prevent or limit inputs of contaminants, even when no receptor is present. However, the European Commission formulated a series of exemptions, to avoid that the "prevent" requirement would imply an onerous and sometimes unfeasible task. The function specific GSVs derived in this study could be used to identify the groundwater volumes that do not result in an unacceptable risk. 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Spatial identification of critical nutrient loads of large shallow lakes: Implications for Lake Taihu (China)	WATER RESEARCH												Ongoing eutrophication frequently causes toxic phytoplankton blooms. This induces huge worldwide challenges for drinking water quality, food security and public health. Of crucial importance in avoiding and reducing blooms is to determine the maximum nutrient load ecosystems can absorb, while remaining in a good ecological state. These so called critical nutrient loads for lakes depend on the shape of the load-response curve. Due to spatial variation within lakes, load-response curves and therefore critical nutrient loads could vary throughout the lake. In this study we determine spatial patterns in critical nutrient loads for Lake Taihu (China) with a novel modelling approach called Spatial Ecosystem Bifurcation Analysis (SEBA). SEBA evaluates the impact of the lake's total external nutrient load on the local lake dynamics, resulting in a map of critical nutrient loads for different locations throughout the lake. Our analysis shows that the largest part of Lake Taihu follows a nonlinear load-response curve without hysteresis. The corresponding critical nutrient loads vary within the lake and depend on management goals, i.e. the maximum allowable chlorophyll concentration. According to our model, total nutrient loads need to be more than halved to reach chlorophyll-a concentrations of 30-40 mu g L-1 in most sections of the lake. To prevent phytoplankton blooms with 20 mu g L-1 chlorophyll-a throughout Lake Taihu, both phosphorus and nitrogen loads need a nearly 90% reduction. We conclude that our approach is of great value to determine critical nutrient loads of lake ecosystems such as Taihu and likely of spatially heterogeneous ecosystems in general.

The methodology stems from recent trends in hydrologic transport that acknowledge the dynamic nature of streamflow age and explores the use of water age fractions as an alternative to the mean age. The approach uses a travel time-based transport model to compute the fractions of streamflow that are younger than some thresholds (e.g., younger than a few weeks) and compares them to observed solute concentration patterns. The method is here validated with data from the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest during spring 2008, where we show that the presence of water younger than roughly 2 weeks, tracked using a hydrologic transport model and deuterium measurements, mimics the variation in dissolved silicon concentrations. Our approach suggests that an age-discharge relationship can be coupled to classic concentration-discharge relationship, to identify the links between transport timescales and solute concentration. Our results highlight that the younger streamflow components can be crucial for determining water quality variations and for characterizing the dominant hydrologic transport dynamics.

Release of phosphorus from crop residue and cover crops over the non-growing season in a cool temperate region	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												In northern climates, crop residue and cover crops are potential sources of dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) to runoff; yet, there are few field studies to quantify this. The objectives of this study were (1) to quantify changes in water extractable phosphorus (WEP) concentrations in the residues of Triticum aestivum L. (winter wheat), Trifolium pretense L (red clover) and Avena sativa L. (oat) cover crops and surface soil in two agricultural fields (ILD and LON) over the non-growing season (NGS); and (2) to determine if changes in WEP in vegetation residue or soil were reflected in loads of DRP or total P (TP) in surface runoff and/or tile drain effluent. Concentrations of WEP in cover crops were larger than those in wheat residue and soil. Water extractable P concentrations in vegetation increased with plant decomposition and decreased following runoff events indicating that the plant WEP was mobilized in runoff. Differences in WEP concentrations were not observed with topography, with the exception of the period following snowmelt when low-lying areas prone to surface inundation were depleted relative to upland locations. Although WEP appeared to have been mobilized from vegetation and soil pools, loads of DRP (0.165-0.245 kg ha(-1)) and TP (0.295 kg ha(-1)-0.360 kg ha(-1)) leaving the fields were small in comparison to P pools in cover crops (7.70 kg ha(-1) oat, 1.70 kg ha(-1) red clover), wheat residues (0.03-0.06 kg ha(-1)) and soils (1.39-5.87 kg ha(-1)), suggesting that much of the P released from vegetation was retained within the field. This study provides insight into the timing and magnitude of P release from vegetation throughout the non-growing season in regions with cool temperate climates, and provides an improved understanding of the contribution of cover crops to winter P losses.

J	Mallants, D; Simunek, J; Torkzaban, S				Mallants, Dirk; Simunek, Jirka; Torkzaban, Saeed			Determining water quality requirements of coal seam gas produced water for sustainable irrigation	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Coal seam gas production in Australia generates large volumes of produced water that is generally high in total dissolved solids and has a high sodium absorption ratio (SAR) which may affect soil structure, hydraulic conductivity, and crop production if used untreated for irrigation. By coupling major ion soil chemistry and unsaturated flow and plant water uptake, this study incorporates effects of salt concentrations on soil hydraulic properties and on root water uptake for soils irrigated with produced water featuring different water qualities. Simulations provided detailed results regarding chemical indicators of soil and plant health, i.e. SAR, EC and sodium concentrations. Results from a base scenario indicated that the use of untreated produced water for irrigation would cause SAR and EC values to significantly exceed the soil quality guide values in Australia and New Zealand (ANZECC). The simulations provided further useful insights in the type of coupled processes that might occur, and what the potential impacts could be on soil hydrology and crop growth. Calculations showed that the use of untreated produced water resulted in a decrease in soil hydraulic conductivity due to clay swelling causing water stagnation, additional plant-water stress and a reduction in plant transpiration. In case the produced water was mixed with surface water in a 1:3 ratio prior to irrigation, the calculated soil SAR values were much lower and generally acceptable for sandy to sandy-loam soil. The use of reverse osmosis treated produced water" yielded an acceptable salinity profile not exceeding guide values for SAR and EC; the plant water stress was limited as there was no additional salinity stress associated with the low level of salts. Results further illustrated that accounting for coupled geochemical, hydrological and plant water uptake processes resulted in more accurate water balance calculations compared to an approach where such interactions were not implemented. Coupling unsaturated flow modelling with major ion chemistry solute transport using HYDRUS provides quantitative evidence to determine suitable water quality requirements for sustainable irrigation using coal seam gas produced water.

Confounded by forgotten legacies: Effectively managing watersheds in the contemporary age of unknown unknowns	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Contemporary watershed management practices can reflect oversimplifications of relationships between anthropogenic pressures and resource degradation. Remediation and restoration efforts often focus on recent land use practices as the primary driver of hydrologic regime changes. We present a case study that serves as an example to the scientific and watershed management communities of the lasting influences of historic land use practices and natural physical processes on a stream in the central United States listed as impaired by the federal government. Abnormal spatiotemporal streamflow relationships, determined by means of an experimental watershed study, alerted the authors to possible sink/source behavior in the upper-watershed. Subsequent research uncovered archival evidence of coal mining, which may provide at least partial explanation. Additional investigation identified hydrologic processes associated with natural landscape evolution, noted by early-20th-century researchers, which are considered in the context of the current water quality and flow regime. Despite best-intended management practices, regulatory agencies, scientists, and local decision makers have not accounted for such practices and processes, instead relying on recent development as the proximate cause of designated impairment. We present argumentation that historic land use (coal mining) and landscape processes comprise cumulative yet unconsidered legacy effects that contribute systemically to the observed hydrologic regime of the watershed. Results hold important implications for contemporary watershed management, and support rethinking the case-by-case appropriateness of federal and state water impairment listings, and the achievability of restoration efforts in many developing watersheds.																	0885-6087	1099-1085				JUL 15	2017	31	15					2802	2808		10.1002/hyp.11223								WOS:000405522600011

Lake Karla was one of the most important wetlands of Greece with many benefits not only to biodiversity preservation, to water balance of the watershed, but also to local economy in terms of fisheries. Its drainage, in 1962, created a lot of environmental problems and led to the local economy shrinking. After its refilling, the newly reestablished water body is considered a vital aquatic ecosystem since it is listed in the network of Natura 2000. The monitoring results, the pressures and their causes that affected the restoration effort are presented. The assessment of the water quality is achieved by evaluating the results of the monitoring and fieldwork programs that Management Body of Eco-development Area of Lake Karla has performed during the last four years funded by the European Union. The results indicate strong eutrophication along with threats to biodiversity. The delay of implementation of Lake Karla reconstruction project, the decline from the proposed Environmental Terms and the lack of environmental policy are the most important causes of pressures.

However, variables related to it are not routinely surveyed in most of the water quality monitoring programs. Our approach included studying the diversity of these organisms, in a large tropical reservoir in a Brazilian Amazonian reserve. The research was carried out in the rainy and dry season when measurements were performed every three hours and at five different depths. A total of 40 water samples were collected to analyze temporal variations of abiotic and biotic factors. Physico-chemical parameters were analyzed to characterize the ecosystem and relationships between these variables and phytoplankton functional groups were statistically tested. The data were examined using analysis of variance and canonical correspondence analysis. We identified 9 functional groups in both seasons. The functional group M, which represents organisms with developed adaptations to high insolation and stable environments, had a higher relative percentage of contribution to the total biomass in the rainy season. Group P, which tends to be present in the more eutrophic lakes and is tolerant to carbon deficiency, had a higher relative percentage of contribution to the total biomass in the dry season. This study indicated that the fluctuations of the water level reflected in seasonal changes of phytoplankton biomass and environmental variables. Additionally, this experiment permitted to advise on sampling strategies for monitoring phytoplankton in lakes and reservoirs.

This study compiled DBP and related water quality parameter data for 395 public drinking water systems serving populations greater than 100,000 across 44 US states from 1980 to early 2015. Assessing DBP occurrence data from two years before (2010-2012) and after (2012-2014) Stage 2 DBPR implementation shows improved capture of higher DBP exposure locations within water distribution systems due to the initial distribution system evaluation. After Stage 2 DBPR implementation, TTHM and HAA5 concentrations have mean values of 30.5 mu g/L and 19.6 mu g/L and 95th percentile values of 71.2 mu g/L and 46.5 mu g/L, respectively. Comparing this data set with the 1997-1998 Information Collection Rule data set suggests a 20 mu g/L reduction in average TTHM occurrence for the highest 5% of systems nationally from 1997-1998 to 2010-2014.																	2164-4535					JUL	2017	109	7					17	30		10.5942/jawwa.2017.109.0082								WOS:000422939400011

We argue that piped water and bottled water cannot be easily compared in the Indonesian context. Drinking from tap water has never been accepted as the norm as piped water has no guarantee of purity and safety. The substantial marketing efforts of the bottled water industry highlight the appeal of bottled water in regard to, not only good water quality and physical health, but also taste, convenience, mental health, and social and environmental values. Despite many negative social and environmental issues associated with bottled water, this enigmatic commodity is becoming 'the' drinking water in Indonesia and is inseparable from modern life.

Geostatistical cokriging and multivariate statistical methods to evaluate groundwater salinization in Faisalabad, Pakistan	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												In the present study, multivariate techniques and geostatistical cokriging were used to look into the groundwater salinization of district Faisalabad. The groundwater condition of district Faisalabad has become miserable because of the rapid increase in population, industrial wastes, and agrochemical application. As a result, majority of the people do not have access to pure drinking water and, consequently, polluted water is causing many deaths per year. A number of 220 water samples based on instructions of World Health Organization (WHO) were taken from four main sources such as hand pump, injector pump, tube well, and water supply. All samples were tested for 12 water quality parameters and summary statistics were calculated to compare the water quality parameters with WHO permissible limits. Initially, correlation matrix was constructed to evaluate the most significant parameters and later on used principal component analysis (PCA) to select those parameters causing maximum variation. Dendrogram based on cluster analysis conveyed same sort of information as delivered by PCA. First, factor of PCA contributed 41.6% of total variation. Six water quality parameters such as sulfate, calcium, total dissolved solids, sodium, chloride, and magnesium were found to be most alarming because all of these have factor loadings greater than 75%. Cross-variogram based on cokriging showed spatial dependence as well as positive pairwise spatial correlation among all parameters. The prediction maps highlighted the most dangerous and health hazard areas; therefore, may be very helpful for water management agencies to target those high-risk areas. It was found that the area with east latitude 31.0 degrees-31.4 degrees and north longitude 72.8 degrees-73.2 degrees is most alarming zone.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				JUL	2017	84						93	101		10.5004/dwt.2017.20911								WOS:000412880600010						
J	Tang, VT; Singh, RP; Fu, DF				Van Tai Tang; Singh, Rajendra Prasad; Fu, Dafang			Transformation impact of vertical revetment on the river water quality and its mechanism	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												The vertical hard revetment can cause the disturbance in river flow with the results of destroyed features, degraded biodiversity, decreasing self-purification ability and deteriorated water quality. The current work is focused on the application of prefabricated porous concrete template covered on widespread vertical hard revetment for improving water purification, increasing biodiversity and decreased negative impact of hard concrete revetment to river quality. Six kinds of porous concrete with different void ratio, aggregate size and water cement ratio were prepared to investigate the compressive strength and water purification properties. A river simulator device was used to determine the water purification capacity of the porous concrete in flowing condition. Water quality purification mechanism of porous concrete was discussed thoroughly by the analysis of microbial community diversity. Results show that the compressive strength and water purification ability of porous concrete were higher when the void ratio, size of the aggregate material and water cement ratio were 30%, 10-20 mm and 0.3, respectively. Under the flow velocity of V = 0.03 m/s and hydraulic retention time of 6 d, the removal rates of M-2 biofilm for chemical oxygen demand (CODMn), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) were 59.21%, 74.07%, 54.25%, 55.47% and 62.90%, respectively. Findings reveal that prefabricated porous concrete was efficient for river water purification. Porous concrete templates can be attached to a large number of microorganisms.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				JUL	2017	84						111	122		10.5004/dwt.2017.21094								WOS:000412880600012

Sewage flow control using an inflow controller with an electrical conductivity sensor in the outfall	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of an inflow controller equipped with an electrical conductivity (EC) sensor on sewage flow during rainfall events. To investigate the relationship between the water quality characteristics and EC of sewage in the field, the EC sensor was used for real-time monitoring. The correlation coefficient (R-2) of CODmn vs. EC was more than 0.97. A reliable hourly maximum flow was calculated using the real-time monitoring data and a water level sensor. The capacity of regulating devices was evaluated during rainfall events by comparing the predicted flow with flow measured by field survey. When the gate was closed at an EC of less than 300 mu s/cm, the flow control rate of overflow for the total discharge was about 44% and 75% during the short-term rainfall (once a day) and long-term rainfall events (over 3 d), respectively, and the COD load control rate was about 16% and 61%, respectively. The flow control rate changed according to the EC control setting: the higher the EC control setting, the more the flow control rate increased. The flow control rate was about 40% an EC of 250 mu s/cm. However, it showed that there was some difference below the EC. The results indicated that controlling sewage inflow based on EC increased the removal efficiency of sewage treatment plants during rainfall events by reducing hydraulic load.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				JUL	2017	84						135	141		10.5004/dwt.2017.21228								WOS:000412880600014						
J	Shafique, M; Kim, R				Shafique, Muhammad; Kim, Reeho			Green stormwater infrastructure with low impact development concept: a review of current research	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												Green storm water infrastructure (GSI) or low impact development (LID) is an alternative land development approach for managing storm water close to the source that has been recommended instead of the traditional storm water design. The main purpose of LID is to reduce the impact of development on water-related problems through the use of GSI practices such as bioretention, green roofs, grass swales, and permeable pavements that infiltrate, evaporate, or harvest and use stormwater on the site where it falls. In recent years, more research has been carried out on GSI practices and the use of these practices has shown magnificent benefits in stormwater management. LID techniques have been successfully used to manage stormwater runoff, improve water quality, and protect environmental and hydrological aspects of the developed areas. Bioretention cells have been effectively used in retaining large volumes of runoff and capturing pollutants on site. Pervious pavements have been extremely effective and efficient at infiltrating stormwater on site and storing large quantities of rainwater. Sand ditches are a new water harvesting technique that is being used to significantly reduce runoff, soil loss and sediment loss and to increase infiltration. This paper highlights evidence in the literature regarding the beneficial uses of LID practices and encourages adopting these practices for environmental friendly construction and sustainable development in the world. In the end, some of recommendations for the implementation of LID practices to achieve multiple benefits are given.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				JUL	2017	83						16	29		10.5004/dwt.2017.20981								WOS:000412878800003

Hydrogeochemical analysis and evaluation of surface water quality of Pratapgarh district, Uttar Pradesh, India	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The hydrogeochemical study of surface water in Pratapgarh district has been carried out to assess the major ion chemistry and water quality for drinking and domestic purposes. For this purpose, twenty-five surface water samples were collected from river, ponds and canals and analysed for pH, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids (TDS), turbidity, hardness, major cations (Ca2+, Mg (2+), Na+ and K+), major anions (HCO3-, F-, Cl-, NO3-, SO42-) and dissolved silica concentration. The analytical results show mildly acidic to alkaline nature of surface water resources of Pratapgarh district. HCO3- and Cl- are the dominant anions, while cation chemistry is dominated by Na+ and Ca2+. The statistical analysis and data plotted on the Piper diagram reveals that the surface water chemistry is mainly controlled by rock weathering with secondary contributions from agriculture and anthropogenic sources. Ca2+-Mg2+-HCO3-, Ca2+-Mg (2+)-Cl and Na+-HCO3--Cl -are the dominant hydrogeochemical facies in the surface water of the area. For quality assessment, values of analysed parameters were compared with Indian and WHO water quality standards, which shows that the concentrations of TDS, F -, NO3-, Na+, Mg2+ and total hardness are exceeding the desirable limits in some water samples. Water Quality Index (WQI) is one of the most effective tools to communicate information on the quality of any water body. The computed WQI values of Pratapgarh district surface water range from 28 to 198 with an average value of 82, and more than half of the study area is under excellent to good category.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				JUL	2017	7	4					1609	1623		10.1007/s13201-015-0313-z								WOS:000411095500004

Microbiological assessment of drinking water emphasizes estimation of the hygienic quality of the water sold with reference to community health significance. This study was conducted to evaluate the quality of drinking water sold by roadside vendors in east, west, north and south zones of capital of India. A total number of 36 samples (nine from each zone) were collected as per national guidelines and studied for microbiological assessment. All the drinking water samples were collected in gamma-sterilized bottles and were kept in an ice pack to prevent any significant change in the microbial flora of the samples during the transportation. The water samples were transported to the laboratory in vertical position maintaining the temperature 1-4 degrees C with ice pack enveloped conditions. Samples were analyzed for total MPN coliform per 100 ml and for the presence and absence of common human pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All the samples were found to be contaminated with coliform organisms in the range of 14 to[ 1600 per 100 ml of sample. Out of 36 water samples, the occurrence of E. coli was 61 %, Salmonella 25 % S. aureus 14 % and P. aeruginosa 53 % as 22, 9, 5 and 19 samples were found contaminated, respectively. The numbers of coliform bacteria and presence of some common pathogenic bacteria suggested that the quality of drinking water sold by roadside vendors is not within the Indian standard and WHO guidelines laid down for drinking water quality. Hence, there is a vital need to study the root cause in terms of hygiene, sanitation of vendors and source of contamination to prevent waterborne diseases.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				JUL	2017	7	4					1635	1644		10.1007/s13201-015-0315-x								WOS:000411095500006

The analytical results exhibited abundance of major cations and anions in Na+ > Ca2+ >Mg2+> K+ and Cl- > HCO3- >SO42- sequence. Stiff diagram showed dug well sample have high Na-Cl and moderate Mg-SO4 content as compared to tube well samples. Majority of dug well samples appeared as Na-Cl type on Piper diagram while tube well samples are mixed type. Gibbs diagram reflected evaporation as a dominant phenomenon in dug well; however, tube well samples are declined toward rock dominance. Process of ion exchange was witnessed from Na+ versus Cl -and Ca2+ Mg2+ versus HCO3- + SO42- plots. Principal component analysis also discriminates dug well and tube well water by means of positive and negative loading based on physical and chemical composition of the groundwater. Studied and computed parameters like pH, EC, TDS, TH, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, SO42-, HCO3-, sodium adsorption ratio, magnesium adsorption ratio, potential salinity, residual sodium carbonate, Na%, Kelly's ratio, and permeability index were compared with WHO to evaluate studied water for drinking and agricultural purposes. Except Na+ and K+, all chemical constrains are within the allowed limits, set by WHO for drinking water. Similarly, most of the groundwater is moderately suitable for irrigation uses, with few exceptions.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				JUL	2017	7	4					1645	1655		10.1007/s13201-015-0316-9								WOS:000411095500007

The results are compared using multiple linear regression (MLR). Recorded data are available at a gauging site in Antakya, Turkey, for the period from 1984 to 2008. Comparing the modeled values by ANNs with the experimental data indicates that neural network model with seven neurons in hidden layer provides accurate results (R-2 = 0.968, RMSE = 46.927 mu S/cm, MAE = 32.462 mu S/cm and MRSE = 0.0029 for the training data and R-2 = 0.965, RMSE = 50.810 mu S/cm, MAE = 37.495 mu S/cm and MRSE = 0.0024 for the testing data). The Garson method of the connection weights of the network was used to study the relative % contribution of each of the input variables. It was found that the sum of calcium and magnesium concentration and temperature had the most effect on the predicted EC. The results indicate that two proposed models were able to approximate the EC parameter reasonably well; however, the ANN was found to perform better than the MLR model.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				JUL	2017	7	4					1761	1772		10.1007/s13201-015-0349-0								WOS:000411095500016

Water quality parameters, such as temperature, water transparency, water depth, dissolved oxygen, pH, total dissolved solids, phosphate, nitrate, and silicate were measured in situ from two sites (littoral and open water zone) of the reservoir. Phytoplankton compositions and abundances were analyzed in Tana fisheries and other aquatic organisms' research center. ANOVA result of the physicochemical parameters included chlorophyll-a showed the presence of significance difference among seasons and between sites (P < 0.05). A total of seven families, 36 genera from three groups (Diatom, Blue green algae and Green algae) of phytoplankton were identified during the study period. From all groups, diatoms were the most abundant at both sites and Blue green algae were the least abundant. ANOVA of all phytoplankton showed highly significant difference among seasons and between sites (P < 0.05). ANOVA of all phytoplankton showed highly significant difference among seasons and between sites (P < 0.05). Based on the stepwise regression, a total number of phytoplanktons had positive correlation with some of the physicochemical parameters (R2 = 0.99, P < 0.001, N = 16). The study concluded that some of physicochemical parameters (NO3-N and PO4-P) indicated the presence of reservoir water pollution. This is supported by the presence of pollution-resistant phytoplankton species such as Melosira and Microcystis. The reservoir water was eutrophic (productive) throughout the year. To avoid such pollution, basin and reservoir management are recommended.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				JUL	2017	7	4					1791	1798		10.1007/s13201-015-0352-5								WOS:000411095500019						
J	Zhang, SP; Xin, XK				Zhang, Shou-ping; Xin, Xiao-kang			Pollutant source identification model for water pollution incidents in small straight rivers based on genetic algorithm	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Identification of pollutant sources for river pollution incidents is an important and difficult task in the emergency rescue, and an intelligent optimization method can effectively compensate for the weakness of traditional methods. An intelligent model for pollutant source identification has been established using the basic genetic algorithm (BGA) as an optimization search tool and applying an analytic solution formula of one-dimensional unsteady water quality equation to construct the objective function. Experimental tests show that the identification model is effective and efficient: the model can accurately figure out the pollutant amounts or positions no matter single pollution source or multiple sources. Especially when the population size of BGA is set as 10, the computing results are sound agree with analytic results for a single source amount and position identification, the relative errors are no more than 5 %. For cases of multi-point sources and multi-variable, there are some errors in computing results for the reasons that there exist many possible combinations of the pollution sources. But, with the help of previous experience to narrow the search scope, the relative errors of the identification results are less than 5 %, which proves the established source identification model can be used to direct emergency responses.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				JUL	2017	7	4					1955	1963		10.1007/s13201-015-0374-z								WOS:000411095500034

Then evaluate the impact of these changes in the concentration of enteroviruses (EVs) in waters. The sewage samples were collected at nine sampling points along the channel, which flows, into a tropical lagoon in Yopougon. Physical-chemical parameters (5-day Biochemical Oxygen Demand, Chemical Oxygen Demand, Suspended Particulate Matter, Total Phosphorus, Orthophosphate, Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen and Nitrate) as well as the concentration of EV in these waters were determined. The average numbers of EV isolated from the outlet of the channel were 9.06 x 10(4) PFU 100 ml(-1). Consequently, EV was present in 55.55 and 33.33 % of the samples in the 2 brackish lagoon collection sites. The effect of rainfall on viral load at the both sewage and brackish lagoon environments is significant correlate (two-way ANOVA, P < 0.05). Furthermore, in lagoon environment, nutrients (Orthophosphate, Total Phosphorus), 5-day Biochemical Oxygen Demand, Chemical Oxygen Demand and Suspended Particulate Matter were significant correlated with EVs loads (P < 0.05 by Pearson test). The overall results highlight the problem of sewage discharge into the lagoon and correlation between viral loads and water quality parameters in sewage and lagoon.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				JUL	2017	7	4					2075	2087		10.1007/s13201-061-0388-1								WOS:000411095500045						
J	De, P; Majumder, M				De, Paulami; Majumder, Mrinmoy			Monitoring water input quality: early screening and system support through the application of an adapted multiple criteria decision making method	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												The WHO estimates that, on average, dehydration caused by water borne illnesses claims up to 1.5 million lives a year, with a disproportionate number of casualties located in developing nations. In order to mitigate risks to public health, previous studies have helped to gain extensive insights and create management techniques to ensure that water quality standards are maintained. The present study will investigate a relatively neglected field, which is the need for the prioritization of monitoring the quality of a water treatment plant's inflow, which may vary significantly in quantity and quality throughout the day. The technique proposed for this investigation is a novel application of the multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) method, adapted particularly for the purposes of decision making for optimal scenarios, called the multi variable temporal decision making method for the selection of optimal solutions (MVTDMSOS). By cascading self-selecting neural network algorithms, which are implicit in such systems, this method is designed to eliminate human bias and aims to identify the priority parameters based on optimal, rather than normal, scenarios. The introduction of polynomial neural networks ensures adaptability and alacrity of the modeling framework. Test results encourage further application of the proposed technique.

Measuring Flow Rate in Crystalline Bedrock Wells Using the Dissolved Oxygen Alteration Method	GROUNDWATER												Determination of vertical flow rates in a fractured bedrock well can aid in planning and implementing hydraulic tests, water quality sampling, and improving interpretations of water quality data. Although flowmeters are highly accurate in flow rate measurement, the high cost and logistics may be limiting. In this study the dissolved oxygen alteration method (DOAM) is expanded upon as a low-cost alternative to determine vertical flow rates in crystalline bedrock wells. The method entails altering the dissolved oxygen content in the wellbore through bubbler aeration, and monitoring the vertical advective movement of the dissolved oxygen over time. Measurements were taken for upward and downward flows, and under ambient and pumping conditions. Vertical flow rates from 0.06 to 2.30 Lpm were measured. To validate the method, flow rates determined with the DOAM were compared to pump discharge rates and found to be in agreement within 2.5%.																	0017-467X	1745-6584				JUL-AUG	2017	55	4					588	592		10.1111/gwat.12512								WOS:000408992800014	28329412

A hierarchical approach is developed to present the monitoring locations within a format that satisfies the objectives of social stakeholders for making final decisions. First, a CE-QUAL-W2 model is applied to simulate water quality variables in the reservoir for a long time using a set of historic data. Second, transinformation entropy theory is used to quantify mutual information among a set of monitoring stations for each water quality variable. Then, a non-dominating sorting genetic algorithm-based model is developed for multi-objective optimization of the water quality monitoring network. Finally, a social choice method is applied to the identified non-dominated solutions to achieve a strategy that is compromised among stakeholders. The variations of the water quality variables at different depths and different seasons are investigated. The proposed approach is illustrated for Karkheh Reservoir in Iran. The number of optimized monitoring stations is the same for all seasons (three out of 22 potential stations) using different social choice methods. The results show the appropriate performance of the proposed methodology for optimization of reservoir water quality monitoring stations.																	1606-9749					JUL	2017	17	4					966	974		10.2166/ws.2016.196								WOS:000408713700007

Land cover models to predict non-point nutrient inputs for selected biomes in South Africa	WATER SA												WQSAM is a practical water quality model for use in guiding southern African water quality management. However, the estimation of non-point nutrient inputs within WQSAM is uncertain, as it is achieved through a combination of calibration and expert knowledge. Non-point source loads can be correlated to particular land cover types. Although observed water quality data through which non-point source loads can be estimated are scarce, land cover databases exist covering the entire area of South Africa. To reduce the uncertainty associated with estimating non-point source loads, this study describes a formal model to link the nutrient signatures of incremental flow to land cover. Study catchments incorporating the fynbos, grassland, savanna and thicket biomes were identified. Instream nutrients of 25 sites were modelled using WQSAM and calibrated against observed data. Multiple regression was used to investigate the relationships between the calibrated nutrient signatures of incremental flow from WQSAM and land cover within study sites. The regression models reflected greater non-point loads from cultivation- and urban-related land cover categories. The nutrient signatures of incremental flow obtained through the multiple regressions were consistent with those obtained through calibration of the WQSAM model at higher signature values, whereas discrepancies were evident at lower values. It is argued that this formal modelling approach for linking land cover to nutrient signatures of incremental flow can be implemented for situations where it is known that there are strong non-point inputs of nutrients into a river reach. The statistical model presented in the current study could potentially be applied as an alternative to the water quality model as a relatively simple method to estimate non-point source loads of nutrients from tributary catchments in South Africa.																	0378-4738	1816-7950				JUL	2017	43	3					499	508		10.4314/wsa.v43i3.15								WOS:000408430900015

The most probable number of E. coli in the water was quantified for supply site, effluent and at each stage of treatment (sedimentation and use of each type of aquatic macrophyte). We conclude that E. coli contamination in water supply and in fishpond can reach the environment through the effluent. The proposed treatment system was efficient in removing E. coli from the water, and when the system was stabilized the average removal efficiency of E. coli was 95%. The tank containing E. crassipes showed the highest removal average, even though it exhibited an efficiency reduction after 60 days of experiment. The average removal of the tanks containing C. demersum and T. domingensis was hampered due to the presence of E. coli in soil used as substrate. However, after the decrease of substrate contamination effect, these two plants were essential for the maintenance of water quality of the treated effluent, indicating the benefits of aquatic macrophytes diversity in treatment systems. The effluent quality was maintained even when some system steps presented a decrease of removal efficiency.

Reginaldo creek bay in Maceio, Alagoas, has great spatial variation in the patterns of basic sanitation providing and, thus, great variation in environmental health indicators which impact in the incidence of waterborne diseases. This study aims to correlate the occurrence and incidence of waterborne diseases with the Environmental Health Index (ISA). The ISA index used is based on the occurrence, magnitude and extent of flooding and on the quality and scope of the provision of water supply, sanitation services and solid waste collection. Results indicate a relationship between ISA and the incidence of specific diseases (related to a particular ISA component), but they also show that results are substantially affected by spatial resolution of data and the methodology for obtaining primary indicators. It was also observed that the method to obtain and classify spatial data is crucial to identify the relations between each sanitation component and the incidence of a specific disease, as well as their spatial extent. Within the area studied, most diagnosis are attributed to dengue, hepatitis and leptospirosis, especially dengue over the others. Results were mapped in the studied area by census tract.																	1413-4152	1809-4457				JUL-AUG	2017	22	4					699	709		10.1590/S1413-41522017146971								WOS:000408263500011

This region has the potential to contaminate water resources as a result of urbanization, deforestation and the application of fertilizers and pesticides in agricultural activities. The aim of this research was to investigate the impact of irrigation on surface water quality in the region, using secondary monitoring. Nine monitoring stations were selected in the region, which represent the diferente uses and occupation of land. The cluster analysis and the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by multiple comparisons, were used to comparatively evaluate the sampling stations and to identify which parameters showed different behavior among these stations. Although it was not possible to observe a pattern of contamination due to the location of the stations, it was found that the stations located along the Sao Francisco river showed no significant differences, although the use and occupation of land were different. The temporal trend of the constituents was verified by applying the test of the hypothesis of stationarity Spearmant, which found that most of the data analyzed were not stationary, with a tendency of increase or decrease over the analysis period. After the application of these statistical tests, it was concluded that, in general, the implementation of irrigated perimeters caused low impact in water quality in the region, in the period studied, considering the parameters analyzed in this study.																	1413-4152	1809-4457				JUL-AUG	2017	22	4					711	721		10.1590/S1413-41522017136784								WOS:000408263500013

Thirty six samples of surface water were collected from three oyster cultivation areas, totalizing 12 collections. The concentrations of total and thermotolerant coliforms were determined using the multiple tube test Most Probable Number (MPN.100 mL(-1)). The environmental variables assessed in the water samples were: pH, temperature, salinity, turbidity, rainfall and tidal. Total coliforms and thermotolerant coliforms MPN values ranged from <1.8 to 1,600 MPN.100 mL(-1) and from <1.8 to 350 MPN.100 mL(-1), respectively. The oyster cultivation areas presented good microbiological quality of surface water. The influence of environmental factors on microbial density was obtained as a positive correlation with rainfall and negative correlation with temperature and turbidity. Considering the data from this study, there was an increase of the population of coliforms in the rainy season and spring tide. Thus, it is necessary to carry out microbiological and environmental monitoring of water intended for aquaculture because it promotes safe and sustainable production of oyster, since the quality parameters can suffer weather influences and seasonal variations.																	1413-4152	1809-4457				JUL-AUG	2017	22	4					723	729		10.1590/S1413-41522016153707								WOS:000408263500012

This study aimed to assess the impact of the sewage treatment plant Piraja (STP-Piraja) effluent discharge on the quality of the Parnaiba river. Field sampling and laboratory analyzes were carried out for a period of 12 months in the treatment system for stabilization ponds and monitoring points upstream and downstream of effluent inputs. The efficiency of the sewage treatment showed typical values for system stabilization ponds, and met the quality requirements for effluent discharge. The dilution capacity of the Parnaiba river was compatible to the polluting loads of effluent from the STP-Piraja. The Water Quality Index (WQI) ranged from good to regular in the studied area; and diffuse pollution proved to be the main threat in the river water quality. Escherichia coli values exceeded the limits of the quality requirements in almost all the monitoring period, even upstream of the effluent discharge point.																	1413-4152	1809-4457				JUL-AUG	2017	22	4					761	772		10.1590/S1413-41522017148242								WOS:000408263500016

Assessing the Effects of Climate Change on Water Quantity and Quality in an Urban Watershed Using a Calibrated Stormwater Model	WATER												Assessing climate change (CC) impacts on urban watersheds is difficult due to differences in model spatial and temporal scales, making prediction of hydrologic restoration a challenge. A methodology was developed using an autocalibration tool to calibrate a previously developed Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) of Difficult Run in Fairfax, Virginia. Calibration was assisted by use of multi-objective optimization. Results showed a good agreement between simulated and observed data. Simulations of CC for the 2041-2068 period were developed using dynamically downscaled North American Regional CC Assessment Program models. Washoff loads were used to simulate water quality, and a method was developed to estimate treatment performed in stormwater control measures (SCMs) to assess water quality impacts from CC. CC simulations indicated that annual runoff volume would increase by 6.5%, while total suspended solids, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus would increase by 7.6%, 7.1%, and 8.1%, respectively. The simulations also indicated that within season variability would increase by a larger percentage. Treatment practices (e.g., bioswale) that were intended to mitigate the negative effects of urban development will need to deal with additional runoff volumes and nutrient loads from CC to achieve the required water quality goals.

Stress and Welfare of African Catfish (Clarias gariepinus Burchell, 1822) in a Coupled Aquaponic System	WATER												African catfish (Clarias gariepinus) were investigated for physiological stress parameters to assess the influence of different cultivation techniques on fish welfare. The fish were reared in two conceptually identical recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) constructed in a greenhouse. One system was combined with a floating raft hydroponic unit to culture cucumbers (Cucumis sativus) only using the process water. The second system remained without the plant cultivation unit and functioned as the control. Water quality was monitored regularly by measuring dissolved nutrients and physical water parameters. During 87 days, a total of 71 fish from each system (n = 142) were studied, with a final sampling of all fish (n = 107) at the end of the experiment. Blood from the caudal vein was analyzed for the stress hormone cortisol and the glucose concentration. In addition, fish were investigated for external injuries on their skin, fins and barbels. The results demonstrate that the system design had no influence on fish mortalities and growth rates. Furthermore, cortisol and blood glucose levels did not differ significantly between the two systems. However, the number of external injuries was significantly lower in the aquaponics, providing evidence that co-cultivation of fish and plants might offer benefits to the welfare of the fish.																	2073-4441					JUL	2017	9	7							504	10.3390/w9070504								WOS:000406681700055						
J	Beggel, S; Hinzmann, M; Machado, J; Geist, J				Beggel, Sebastian; Hinzmann, Mariana; Machado, Jorge; Geist, Juergen			Combined Impact of Acute Exposure to Ammonia and Temperature Stress on the Freshwater Mussel Unio pictorum	WATER												Nitrogen compounds, particularly ammonia, and temperature are suspected major stressors for aquatic organisms, but little is known about their impact on globally declining freshwater mussels (Unionoida). In this study, we tested the combined effects of ammonia and temperature stress on painter's mussel (Unio pictorum) survival, filtration behavior, hemocyte abundance, hemocyte mortality and glycogen energy status, at concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 9.0 mg.L-1 total ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N) in 96 h acute exposures at two temperatures, 17 degrees C and 25 degrees C and a pH of 8.8. The results indicate a low sensitivity of U. pictorum to elevated ammonia concentrations after short-term exposure, although effects on cell morphology were evident and delayed mortality occurred at the highest test concentration. Most pronounced effects were observed for sublethal physiological endpoints due to elevated temperature, but no synergistic effects with ammonia were evident. Temperature increase resulted in significant effects on tissue glycogen, hyalinocyte mortality and clearance rates. Hemocyte mortalities showed a linear dependency on initial mussel activity as measured by their clearance rate. Since the main stressors tested in this study, ammonia and temperature, are predicted to increase in most freshwater ecosystems, their impact on other freshwater mussel species including different life-stages should be comprehensively assessed.

Alan; Donald, Wesley; Zech, Wesley; Perez, Michael			Performance Evaluations of Three Silt Fence Practices Using a Full-Scale Testing Apparatus	WATER												Erosion and sediment controls on construction sites minimize environmental impacts from sediment-laden stormwater runoff. Silt fence, a widely specified perimeter control practice on construction projects used to retain sediment on-site, has limited performance-based testing data. Silt fence failures and resultant sediment losses are often the result of structural failure. To better understand silt fence performance, researchers at the Auburn University-Erosion and Sediment Control Testing Facility (AU-ESCTF) have evaluated three silt fence options to determine possible shortcomings using standardized full-scale testing methods. These methods subject silt fence practices to simulated, in-field conditions typically experienced on-site without the variability of field testing or the limited application of small-scale testing. Three different silt fence practices were tested to evaluate performance, which included: (1) Alabama Department of Transportation (ALDOT) Trenched Silt Fence, (2) ALDOT Sliced Silt Fence, and (3) Alabama Soil and Water Conservation Committee (AL-SWCC) Trenched Silt Fence. This study indicates that the structural performance of a silt fence perimeter control is the most important performance factor in retaining sediment. The sediment retention performance of these silt fence practices was 82.7%, 66.9% and 90.5%, respectively. When exposed to large impoundment conditions, both ALDOT Trench and Sliced Silt Fence practices failed structurally, while the AL-SWCC Trenched Silt Fence did not experience structural failure.																	2073-4441					JUL	2017	9	7							502	10.3390/w9070502								WOS:000406681700053

In this study, spatial variations in water chemistry were investigated in 57 samples collected from three subtropical peatlands (central China). Generally, water pH and major cation concentrations of these samples approached the characteristics of poor fens along the bog-rich fen gradient. Four distinct groups were identified by cluster analysis and principal component analysis. High concentrations of trace elements in Group I were probably linked to airborne dust pollutants from a nearby road under construction. Low pH values and low major cation concentrations in Group II may be attributed to the great cation exchange capacity of Sphagnum. In contrast, samples in Group III, mainly collected from sites suffering from Sphagnum harvest, showed high pH levels and major cation concentrations. Relatively low concentrations of trace elements (except boron) in Group IV can be regarded as reference conditions for restoration efforts in these peatlands. Taken together, spatial variations in the water chemistry of the three peatlands were closely linked to natural processes (e.g., cation exchange of Sphagnum) and anthropogenic pressures (e.g., Sphagnum harvest). Overall, the mean health risk values of the six trace elements were low, indicating good water quality in these peatlands. This study provided baseline water chemistry information for the sustainable management of these subtropical peatlands, as well as other similar ecosystems.

J	Chow, MF; Huang, JC; Shiah, FK				Chow, Ming Fai; Huang, Jr-Chuan; Shiah, Fuh-Kwo			Phosphorus Dynamics along River Continuum during Typhoon Storm Events	WATER												Information on riverine phosphorus (P) dynamics during typhoon storm events remains scarce in subtropical regions. Thus, this study investigates the spatial and temporal dynamics of riverine phosphorus in a headwater catchment during three typhoon events. Continuous sampling (3 h intervals) of stormwater samples and discharge data were conducted at five locations, which represent the upstream, transitional zone, and downstream areas of the main inflow river. The results revealed that the average event mean concentrations (EMCs) for total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) and particulate phosphorus (PP) in the upstream catchment of Fei-Tsui reservoir were 15.66 mu g/L and 11.94 mu g/L, respectively. There was at least a 1.3-fold increase in flow-weighted concentrations of TDP and PP from the upper to lower reaches of the main stream. PP and TDP were transported either in clockwise or anticlockwise directions, depending on storm intensity and source. The transport of TDP was primarily regulated by the subsurface flow during the storm event. Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) contributes more than 50% of the TDP load in moderate storms, while extreme storms supply a greater dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) load into the stream. TDP accounted for approximately 50% of TP load during typhoon storms. Mobilization of all P forms was observed from upstream to downstream of the river, except for DOP. A decrease of DOP load on passing downstream may reflect the change in phosphorus form along the river continuum. Peak discharge and antecedent dry days are correlated positively with P fluxes, indicating that river bank erosion and re-suspension of within-channel sediment are the dominant pathways of P during typhoon storm periods.

J	Ciosek, AL; Luk, GK				Ciosek, Amanda L.; Luk, Grace K.			Kinetic Modelling of the Removal of Multiple Heavy Metallic Ions from Mine Waste by Natural Zeolite Sorption	WATER												This study investigates the sorption of heavy metallic ions (HMIs), specifically lead (Pb2+), copper (Cu2+), iron (Fe3+), nickel (Ni2+) and zinc (Zn2+), by natural zeolite (clinoptilolite). These HMIs are combined in single-, dual-, triple-, and multi-component systems. The batch mode experiments consist of a total initial concentration of 10 meq/L normality for all systems, acidified to a pH of 2 by concentrated nitric (HNO3) acid. A zeolite dosage of 4 g per 100 mL of synthetic nitrate salt aqueous solution is applied, for a contact period of 5 to 180 min. Existing kinetic models on HMIs sorption are limited for multi-component system combinations. Therefore, this study conducts kinetic analysis by both reaction and diffusion models, to quantify the sorption process. The study concludes that the process correlates best with the pseudo-second-order (PSO) kinetic model. In the multi-component system combining all five HMIs, the initial sorption rate and theoretical equilibrium capacity are determined as 0.0033 meq/g.min and 0.1159 meq/g, respectively. This provides significant insight into the mechanisms associated with the sorption process, as well as contributing to the assessment of natural zeolite as a sorbent material in its application in industrial wastewater treatment.

Under the Clean Water Act (2006), thirty-six regional Conservation Authorities were mandated to develop watershed-based SWP plans under 19 Source Protection Regions. Most First Nations in Ontario are outside of these Source Protection Regions and reserve lands are under Federal jurisdiction. This paper explores how First Nations in Ontario are attempting to address SWP to improve drinking water quality in their communities even though these communities are not part of the Ontario SWP framework. The case studies highlight the gap between the regulatory requirements of the Federal and Provincial governments and the challenges for First Nations in Ontario from lack of funding to implement solutions to address the threats identified in SWP planning. This analysis of different approaches taken by Ontario First Nations shows that the Ontario framework for SWP planning is not an option for the majority of First Nations communities, and does not adequately address threats originating on reserve lands. First Nations attempting to address on-reserve threats to drinking water are using a variety of resources and approaches to develop community SWP plans. However, a common theme of all the cases surveyed is a lack of funding to support implementing solutions for the threats identified by the SWP planning process. Federal government initiatives to address the chronic problem of boil water advisories within Indigenous communities do not recognize SWP planning as a cost-effective tool for improving drinking water quality.																	2073-4441					JUL	2017	9	7							550	10.3390/w9070550								WOS:000406681700101

Therefore, the objective of this research is to propose an early warning and forecasting model and develop a visual system of water quality safety for drinking water source areas in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area under accident conditions. Based on an Instantaneous Point Source Two-dimensional Water Quality Model and the security requirements of water quality, an early warning and forecasting model was presented, and then the system was advanced by a MATLAB platform. In addition, a hypothetical case was also carried out for the Fenghuangshan drinking water source area. Within 0.040 h to 0.096 h after the accident, the water quality could meet the standard, and the warning level was primary and intermediate, sequentially. From 0.096 h to 11.960 h after the accident, the pollutant concentration exceeded the standard, under which conditions advanced warning started. Then the intermediate and primary warnings restarted in sequence until the pollutant concentration decreased to the background value. Therefore, the proposed model could accurately predict the spatial-temporal change trend of pollutant concentration, and the developed system could efficiently realize early warnings and the forecasting of water quality safety.																	2073-4441					JUL	2017	9	7							465	10.3390/w9070465								WOS:000406681700016

One urban river which suffers DO depression under low flow conditions and requires systematic research for effective mitigation strategies is the Nanfei River (Hefei, China). We investigated its longitudinal profiles of DO and other related water constituents with high spatial resolution monitoring at low flow. A mechanistic DO model for the reach was customized and calibrated with the data obtained. We found that the daily average DO levels within the 11 km study reach shifted from supersaturation(11.5 mg L-1) upstream of the Wangtang Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) to serious depletion (3.6 mg L-1) downstream. Process analysis indicated that DO production via strong algal photosynthesis overwhelmed the DO consumptions upstream from the WWTP. In contrast, DO sources could not compensate for DO consumptions, wherein carbonaceous deoxygenation was the largest consumer of the DO (approximately 70%) downstream the WWTP. Rather than directly contributing labile organics, the WWTP effluent affected the DO balance by shifting the metabolism from upstream autotrophy to downstream heterotrophy. Finally, mitigation strategies for DO depression in rivers in rapidly-urbanizing regions were suggested accordingly.

Viral diversity was detected using omics-based approaches. Log reduction values (LRV) of Adenoviruses (AdV) and Enteroviruses (EV) were enumerated using digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) and assessed for infectivity using fluorescence-based infection assays. MBR treatment was successful in reducing viral diversity. Plant viruses remained abundant in the treated effluent. Human enteric viruses were present in lower abundance than plant viruses, and were reduced by MBR at varying LRV. AdV copy numbers were reduced by 3.7-log. Infectious AdV was not detected in the effluent. EV copy numbers were reduced by 1.7-log post MBR and infectious EV decreased by an average of 2.0-log. Infectious EV was detected in the chlorinated effluent, occasionally in concentrations that approximate to its 50% infectious dose. Overall, results indicated that a MBR-based wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effectively reduces viral diversity, viral load, and infectious capacity by up to 4-logs. These findings suggest potential concerns associated with plant and human enteric viruses for reuse events in this country. Local guidelines for assessment of treated water quality should take into consideration both infectious viral concentration and LRV.																	2073-4441					JUL	2017	9	7							534	10.3390/w9070534								WOS:000406681700085

During this service life, external factors, such as changes in the effluent standards or the loading of the WWTP may change, requiring WWTP performance to be optimized. WWTP modelling is widely accepted as a means to assess and optimize WWTP performance. One of the challenges for WWTP modelling remains the prediction of water quality at the inlet of a WWTP. Recent applications of water quality sensors have resulted in long time series of WWTP influent quality, containing valuable information on the response of influent quality to e.g., storm events. This allows the development of empirical models to predict influent quality. This paper proposes a new approach for water quality modelling, which uses the measured hydraulic dynamics of the WWTP influent to derive the influent water quality. The model can also be based on simulated influent hydraulics as input.

Additionally, accurate statistics are not reported without regular water quality tests, so safety measures alone are insufficient to improve water quality. In this situation, the Korean government is responsible for verifying the quality of groundwater and identifying the cause of groundwater contamination in areas with no municipal water supply. The National Institute of Environmental Research (NIER) under the Ministry of Environment of Korea, conducted the 'Safe Groundwater Supply Project (SGSP)' between 2012 and 2016 to secure groundwater quality stability in areas without the benefit of municipal water. This survey identified groundwater quality using a detailed water quality survey and gave recommendations for supplying safe groundwater and providing future improvements and countermeasures in cases of groundwater pollution. This paper presents the SGSP and consists of water quality analysis, the exploration and exploitation of drinking water facilities, the selection of a pilot project area among high-pollution areas, and improvement measures for water quality in the pilot project area.																	2073-4441					JUL	2017	9	7							508	10.3390/w9070508								WOS:000406681700059

WATER												In South Korea, the Soyang Lake is an important source of drinking water to the metropolitan areas including Seoul. However, water quality problems in the Soyang Lake have still remained due to chemical contaminations attributed to conventional farming practices in the upstream areas. Based on a downstream consumer survey using a contingent valuation method, this study estimated the expected willingness to pays (WTPs) for water quality improvement through the conversion to environmentally friendly farming (EFF). The results showed that the estimated annual mean WTP is KRW 36,115 per household. The aggregated WTPs of downstream respondents in the Soyang Lake are sufficient to compensate for the income losses of upstream EFF farmers in highland farming areas. In addition, we found that the downstream citizens who recognize the label for EFF products and who intend to purchase EFF products in the future have a significant impact on WTPs for water quality improvement.

J	Li, X; Sha, J; Wang, ZL				Li, Xue; Sha, Jian; Wang, Zhong-Liang			Chlorophyll-A Prediction of Lakes with Different Water Quality Patterns in China Based on Hybrid Neural Networks	WATER												One of the most important water quality problems affecting lakes and reservoirs is eutrophication, which is caused by multiple physical and chemical factors. As a representative index of eutrophication, the concentration of chlorophyll-a has always been a key indicator monitored by environmental managers. The most influential factors on chlorophyll-a may be dependent on the different water quality patterns in lakes. In this study, data collected from 27 lakes in different provinces of China during 2009-2011 were analyzed. The self-organizing map (SOM) was first applied on the datasets and the lakes were classified into four clusters according to 24 water quality parameters. Comparison amongst the clusters revealed that Cluster I was the least polluted and at the lowest trophic level, while Cluster IV was the most polluted and at the highest trophic level. The genetic algorithm optimized back-propagation neural network (GA-BPNN) was applied to each lake cluster to select the most influential input variables for chlorophyll-a. The results of the four clusters showed that the performance of GA-BPNN was satisfied with nearly half of the input variables selected from the predictor pool. The selected factors varied for the lakes in different clusters, which indicates that the control for eutrophication should be separate for lakes in different provinces of one country.																	2073-4441					JUL	2017	9	7							524	10.3390/w9070524								WOS:000406681700075						
J	Logsdon, SD				Logsdon, Sally D.			Nutrient Leaching When Soil Is Part of Plant Growth Media	WATER												Soils can serve as sorbents for phosphorus (P), negating the need for artificial sorbents. The purpose of this study was to compare soils with different properties for their effect on nutrient levels in effluent. Four soils were mixed with sand and packed into columns 0.5 m long, with or without compost on the surface. Infiltration and effluent concentrations were measured before and after growing plants [Buffalograss (Buchloe dactyloides (Nutt.) Engelm.) and bluegrama grasses (Bouteloua gracilis H.B.K.) and red clover (Trifolium pratense L.)]. The growth media with compost at the surface had higher nutrient levels than the media without the compost, but the final effluent nitrate concentrations post-harvest were significantly lower for columns with the compost blanket (59 vs. 86 mg L-1). All of the nitrate concentrations were high (many >100 mg L-1) due to mineralization and nitrogen fixation. The final effluent P concentrations before planting were significantly higher in the soil with the most sand (0.71 mg L-1), and after harvest in the mixture that contained the high soil P levels (0.58 mg L-1). Some soils (high in aluminum or calcium) were adequate sorbents for P without additions of other sorbents, but soils often generated too much nitrate in effluent.																	2073-4441					JUL	2017	9	7							501	10.3390/w9070501								WOS:000406681700052

Membrane treatment of the OIZ wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents should be explored for new treatment options. In this study, three different UF membranes with variable molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) values (4, 10, and 250 kDa) were used to treat the effluent of an OIZ WWTP at laboratory scale. Six different nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) membranes were used for the effluent of UF membranes to evaluate the difference in the membrane filtration performance and the water quality. Effluent electrical conductivity (EC) values of NF membranes were 1.77 +/- 0.17, 3.73 +/- 0.27, and 4.20 +/- 0.23 ms/cm for NF (NF90, NF270, and TM610) membranes, respectively while they were 0.83 +/- 0.47, 1.17 +/- 0.47, and 1.13 +/- 0.57 ms/cm for RO (XLE, AD90, and BW30) membranes, respectively. Scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS), and confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) images showed severe biofouling in UF 4 kDa and UF 10 kDa membranes whereas UF 250 kDa membrane showed larger metal precipitates and little bacterial fouling. The results indicated that OIZ WWTP effluent could be reused as irrigation water according to Turkish regulations with UF 250 kDa and RO-XLE membranes, effectively.

We compared two approaches to simulate the effects of transient storage (TS) on the transport of conservative and reactive tracers. The first approach considered TS as composed of metabolically active and metabolically inactive compartments, while the second model approach accounted for the surface transient storage (STS) and hyporheic transient storage (HTS). Experimental data were collected at a perennial first-order creek in Maryland, MD, USA, by injecting the conservative tracer bromide (Br) and the reactive (Raz) tracer and sampling water at two weir stations. The STS-HTS approach led to a more accurate simulation of Br transport and tails of the Raz and its product Rezorufin (Rru) breakthrough curves. Sediments support large microbial communities, and the STS-HTS model in creeks provides additional parameters to characterize the habitats of microbial water-quality indicator organisms.																	2073-4441					JUL	2017	9	7							485	10.3390/w9070485								WOS:000406681700036

This issue may be addressed through the use of best management practices (BMPs) and target limits for pathogenic indicator species. Bioretention is a commonly used low impact development strategy that addresses this growing pollution problem at the source. Bioretention removal efficiencies have been well studied when considering nutrients and heavy metals, but field-scale treatment data are limited for microbial indicators. The primary objective of this study was to quantify microbial removal by installed bioretention cells with fly-ash amended soils. Three bioretention cells in Grove, Oklahoma were monitored over one and a half years and the removal microbial efficiency was quantified. Overall, removal rates for E. coli, enterococci, and coliphage were highly variable, with mean and standard deviations for removals for each site respectively: E. coli 87%, 35%, and 43%; enterococci 97%, 95%, and 80%; and coliphage 38%, 75%, and 32%. The site with negative removal efficiency appears to have some groundwater intrusion during storm events. Based on this relatively limited data set, these fly-ash amended bioretention cells performed 49% better than those with a sand-only filter media layer currently reported in the literature. Based on this initial field study, it appears that fly-ash amended bioretention cells may be a viable option for enhanced microbial removal from stormwater runoff.																	2073-4441					JUL	2017	9	7							526	10.3390/w9070526								WOS:000406681700077

Therefore, it is essential to understand the spatio-temporal variation and the controlling factors of water quality. Samples of Yongding River water were collected seasonally, and 24 water quality parameters were analyzed in 2015. All waters were alkaline, and nitrate-nitrogen was the main form of nitrogen, while phosphorus was mostly below detection level. The water quality parameters varied in time and space. Cluster analysis showed a distinct difference between winter and the other seasons and between the natural river section and the section with reclaimed water. Based on the analysis of Gibbs plots, principal component analysis, and ionic relationships, the water chemistry was controlled by dissolution of rocks in natural river section, the quality of replenished water, the effects of dilution, and the reaction of aqueous chemistry in the reclaimed water section. The positive oxidation environment in most of the river water was conducive to the formation of nitrate-nitrogen by nitrification, and not conducive to denitrification.																	2073-4441					JUL	2017	9	7							453	10.3390/w9070453								WOS:000406681700004

Despite significant uncertainty in most flow data, the flow series for these applications are often communicated and used without uncertainty information. In this commentary, we argue that proper analysis of uncertainty in river flow data can reduce costs and promote robust conclusions in water management applications. We substantiate our argument by providing case studies from Norway and New Zealand where streamflow uncertainty analysis has uncovered economic costs in the hydropower industry, improved public acceptance of a controversial water management policy, and tested the accuracy of water quality trends. We discuss the need for practical uncertainty assessment tools that generate multiple flow series realizations rather than simple error bounds. Although examples of such tools are in development, considerable barriers for uncertainty analysis and communication still exist for practitioners, and future research must aim to provide easier access and usability of uncertainty estimates. We conclude that flow uncertainty analysis is critical for good water management decisions. Plain Language Summary In this commentary, we show how analyzing uncertainty in river flow data can reduce costs and promote robust conclusions in water management applications. River flow data can contain large uncertainties but are often communicated and used without uncertainty information.

Therefore, monitoring of agricultural water use and hydrologic connections between crop lands and Bay tributaries has received increasing attention. Remote sensing retrievals of actual evapotranspiration (ET) can provide valuable information in support of these hydrologic modeling efforts, spatially and temporally describing consumptive water use by crops and natural vegetation and quantifying response to expansion of irrigated area occurring with Bay watershed. In this study, a multisensor satellite data fusion methodology, combined with a multiscale ET retrieval algorithm, was applied over the Choptank River watershed located within the Lower Chesapeake Bay region on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, USA to produce daily 30 m resolution ET maps. ET estimates directly retrieved on Landsat satellite overpass dates have high accuracy with relative error (RE) of 9%, as evaluated using flux tower measurements. The fused daily ET time series have reasonable errors of 18% at the daily time step - an improvement from 27% errors using standard Landsat-only interpolation techniques. Annual water consumption by different land cover types was assessed, showing reasonable distributions of water use with cover class. Seasonal patterns in modeled crop transpiration and soil evaporation for dominant crop types were analyzed, and agree well with crop phenology at field scale. Additionally, effects of irrigation occurring during a period of rainfall shortage were captured by the fusion program. These results suggest that the ET fusion system will have utility for water management at field and regional scales over the Eastern Shore. Further efforts are underway to integrate these detailed water use data sets into watershed-scale hydrologic models to improve assessments of water quality and inform best management practices to reduce nutrient and sediment loads to the Chesapeake Bay.

Are our dynamic water quality models too complex? A comparison of a new parsimonious phosphorus model, SimplyP, and INCA-P	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Catchment-scale water quality models are increasingly popular tools for exploring the potential effects of land management, land use change and climate change on water quality. However, the dynamic, catchment-scale nutrient models in common usage are complex, with many uncertain parameters requiring calibration, limiting their usability and robustness. A key question is whether this complexity is justified. To explore this, we developed a parsimonious phosphorus model, SimplyP, incorporating a rainfall-runoff model and a biogeochemical model able to simulate daily streamflow, suspended sediment, and particulate and dissolved phosphorus dynamics. The model's complexity was compared to one popular nutrient model, INCA-P, and the performance of the two models was compared in a small rural catchment in northeast Scotland. For three land use classes, less than six SimplyP parameters must be determined through calibration, the rest may be based on measurements, while INCA-P has around 40 unmeasurable parameters. Despite substantially simpler process-representation, SimplyP performed comparably to INCA-P in both calibration and validation and produced similar long-term projections in response to changes in land management. Results support the hypothesis that INCA-P is overly complex for the study catchment. We hope our findings will help prompt wider model comparison exercises, as well as debate among the water quality modeling community as to whether today's models are fit for purpose. Simpler models such as SimplyP have the potential to be useful management and research tools, building blocks for future model development (prototype code is freely available), or benchmarks against which more complex models could be evaluated. Plain Language Summary Catchment models may be useful tools for managing water quality, for example for exploring how water quality may change in the future under different land management, land use or climate. However, models are only useful if they capture the right processes, otherwise there is a risk of management decisions being based on unreliable information. There is now a growing awareness that many catchment water quality models used today are too complex. This makes it difficult, time-consuming and expensive to set models up, and reduces the reliability of their predictions. We have therefore developed a new, simple model to predict phosphorus concentrations in rivers, one of the biggest causes of troublesome algal blooms in fresh waters. The simple model was compared with one of the standard models in common use and was found to perform as well, despite being substantially simpler to set up and use. This supports the idea that current water quality models are too complex, and that modelers need to put more effort into assessing whether they are using appropriate tools.

Predicting organic matter, nitrogen, and phosphorus concentrations in runoff from peat extraction sites using partial least squares regression	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Organic matter and nutrient export from drained peatlands is affected by complex hydrological and biogeochemical interactions. Here partial least squares regression (PLSR) was used to relate various soil and catchment characteristics to variations in chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in runoff. Peat core samples and water quality data were collected from 15 peat extraction sites in Finland. PLSR models constructed by cross-validation and variable selection routines predicted 92, 88, and 95% of the variation in mean COD, TN, and TP concentration in runoff, respectively. The results showed that variations in COD were mainly related to net production (temperature and water-extractable dissolved organic carbon (DOC)), hydrology (topographical relief), and solubility of dissolved organic matter (peat sulfur (S) and calcium (Ca) concentrations). Negative correlations for peat S and runoff COD indicated that acidity from oxidation of organic S stored in peat may be an important mechanism suppressing organic matter leaching. Moreover, runoff COD was associated with peat aluminum (Al), P, and sodium (Na) concentrations. Hydrological controls on TN and COD were similar (i.e., related to topography), whereas degree of humification, bulk density, and water-extractable COD and Al provided additional explanations for TN concentration. Variations in runoff TP concentration were attributed to erosion of particulate P, as indicated by a positive correlation with suspended sediment concentration (SSC), and factors associated with metal-humic complexation and P adsorption (peat Al, water-extractable P, and water-extractable iron (Fe)).

Complex networks of functional connectivity in a wetland reconnected to its floodplain	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Disturbances such as fire or flood, in addition to changing the local magnitude of ecological, hydrological, or biogeochemical processes, can also change their functional connectivity-how those processes interact in space. Complex networks offer promise for quantifying functional connectivity in watersheds. The approach resolves connections between nodes in space based on statistical similarities in perturbation signals (derived from solute time series) and is sensitive to a wider range of timescales than traditional mass-balance modeling. We use this approach to test hypotheses about how fire and flood impact ecological and biogeochemical dynamics in a wetland (Everglades, FL, USA) that was reconnected to its floodplain. Reintroduction of flow pulses after decades of separation by levees fundamentally reconfigured functional connectivity networks. The most pronounced expansion was that of the calcium network, which reflects periphyton dynamics and may represent an indirect influence of elevated nutrients, despite the comparatively smaller observed expansion of phosphorus networks. With respect to several solutes, periphyton acted as a "biotic filter,'' shifting perturbations in water-quality signals to different timescales through slow but persistent transformations of the biotic community. The complex-networks approach also revealed portions of the landscape that operate in fundamentally different regimes with respect to dissolved oxygen, separated by a threshold in flow velocity of 1.2 cm/s, and suggested that complete removal of canals may be needed to restore connectivity with respect to biogeochemical processes. Fire reconfigured functional connectivity networks in a manner that reflected localized burn severity, but had a larger effect on the magnitude of solute concentrations. Plain Language Summary A big part of the plan to restore the Everglades involves the removal of levees and canals that are currently serving as barriers to flow. However, doing so at a large scale prompts some concerns and questions: (1) Will phosphorus, a limiting nutrient that has the capability to vastly change vegetation communities, be mobilized and transported to downstream ecosystems? And (2) Do the barriers to flow need to be completely removed (an expensive proposition), or will partial removal suffice? To address these uncertainties, a team of scientists and engineers conducted a multi-year experiment involving controlled flow releases into a 2 km x 2 km part of the wetland that was formerly isolated from flow. In this paper the authors use a new functional connectivity network approach to visualize how those flow releases change the way constituents in the flood waters move through the downstream ecosystem. They found that flow reconnection causes a shift in how calcium is processed by microorganisms near the flow inlet, which likely reflects a transition to species that thrive under slight phosphorus enrichment. They also found that only across portions of the landscape where barriers to flow have been completely removed does the landscape regain functional connectivity.

In order to improve existing networks management and control, network sectorization is gaining importance. It is based on network division into isolated zones, delimited by boundary valves, which are hydraulically monitored. Given the diversity of criteria for sectors' design, a methodology for sectorized networks assessment is proposed for selecting the most efficient sector's configuration in terms of every alternative's service vulnerability and involved costs. Vulnerability is assessed through a multi-objective function based on three of the main service related goals to achieve with a sectorization project: service continuity, water quality and appropriate pressure range. This way, performance indicators for quantifying these goals are proposed, normalized and weighted to be combined according to the reference of studied network. In order to assess sectors efficiency every alternative costs, including sector's establishment and instrumentation cost, energetic, operational and maintenance costs, are considered for solutions' comparison. Such process is carried out through a Pareto analysis. Vulnerability analysis allows the identification of sectors for prioritizing investments in existing networks while the efficiency analysis allows the selection of the best options from different alternatives, also for new sectors' design. The methodology has been applied to 494 sectors of Canal de Isabel II distribution network in Madrid (Spain).																	0187-8336	2007-2422				JUL-AUG	2017	8	4					57	77		10.24850/j-tyca-2017-04-04								WOS:000407063700004

The concentration contour maps of the nitrate nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen, total phosphorus and total nitrogen showed that the indicators of the four lakes in the east, the west, and the center of the lake did not have the same trend. From 2012 to 2015, each of the measured nutrients showed a rising trend year by year. The four lakes are polluted by both endogenous and exogenous pollution, and it is necessary to limit the exogenous pollution and protect the alpine lakes immediately.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				JUL	2017	76	2					396	412		10.2166/wst.2017.091								WOS:000406789800015	28726705					
J	Wang, YF; Jia, H; Zhang, HW; Wang, J; Liu, WJ				Wang, Yufei; Jia, Hui; Zhang, Hongwei; Wang, Jie; Liu, Wenjin			Performance of a novel recycling magnetic flocculation membrane filtration process for tetracycline-polluted surface water treatment	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												A recycling magnetic flocculation membrane filtration (RMFMF) process integrating circulating coagulation, magnetic enhanced flocculation and membrane filtration was investigated for the treatment of surface water micro-polluted by tetracycline, a typical pharmaceutical and personal care product. A bench-scale experiment was conducted and several water quality parameters including turbidity, ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (UV254), total organic carbon and tetracycline concentration were evaluated, taking coagulation membrane filtration and magnetic flocculation membrane filtration processes as reference treatments. The experimental results showed that at the optimum doses of 20 mg.L-1 ferric chloride (FeCl3), 4 mg.L-1 magnetite (Fe3O4) and 6 mg.L-1 reclaimed magnetic flocs in RMFMF processes, removal efficiencies of above evaluated parameters ranged from 55.8% to 92.9%, which performed best. Simultaneously, the largest average particle size of 484.71 mu m and the highest fractal dimension of 1.37 of flocs were achieved, which did not only present the best coagulation effect helpful in enhancing the performance of removing multiple contaminants, but also lead to the generation of loose and porous cake layers favouring reduced permeate flux decline and membrane fouling.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				JUL	2017	76	2					490	500		10.2166/wst.2017.218								WOS:000406789800024	28726714

Robustness of the models and compliance of their sensitivity with current quality limits are investigated. The following indicators are studied: total suspended solids (TSS), turbidity, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and nitrate. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) is used to find linear correlations between absorbances and indicators of interest. Artificial samples are made by simulating a sludge leak on the wastewater treatment plant and added to the original dataset, then divided into calibration and prediction datasets. The models are built on the calibration set, and then tested on the prediction set. The best models are developed with: PLSR for COD (R-pred(2) = 0.80), TSS (R-pred(2) = 0.86) and turbidity (R-pred(2) = 0.96), and with a simple linear regression from absorbance at 208 nm (R-pred(2) = 0.95) for nitrate concentration. The input of artificial data significantly enhances the robustness of the models. The sensitivity of the UV/Vis spectrometry monitoring system developed is compatible with quality requirements of reclaimed water production processes.

PPTA/PVDF/NWF blend membrane was prepared through the immersion precipitation phase inversion method and nonwoven coating technique. The membrane integrated technology including PPTA/PVDF/NWF blend membrane and reverse osmosis (RO) membrane was employed to treat the polyester/viscose spunlace nonwoven process wastewater. During the consecutive running of six months, the effects of membrane integrated technology on the COD, ammonia nitrogen, suspended substance and pH value of water were studied. The results showed that the removal rate of COD, ammonia nitrogen and suspended substance filtered by PPTA/PVDF blend membrane was kept above 90%. The pH value of the permeate water was about 7.1 and the relative water flux of blend membrane remained above 90%. After the deep treatment of RO membrane, the permeate water quality can meet the water circulation requirement of spunlace process.																	2005-8624	2092-7037				JUL	2017	8	4					311	321		10.12989/mwt.2017.8.4.311								WOS:000406176200001						
J	Babbar, R; Babbar, S				Babbar, Richa; Babbar, Sakshi			Predicting river water quality index using data mining techniques	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												This paper demonstrates the application of data mining techniques to predict river water quality index. The usefulness of these techniques lies in the automated extraction of novel knowledge from the data to improve decision-making. The popular classification techniques, namely k-nearest neighbor, decision trees, Naive Bayes, artificial neural networks, rule-based and support vector machines were used to develop the predictive environment to classify water quality into understandable terms based on the Overall Index of Pollution. Experimentation was conducted on two types of data sets: synthetic and real. A repeated k-fold cross-validation procedure was followed to design the learning and testing frameworks of the predictive environment. Based on the validation results, it was found that the error rate in defining the true water quality class was 20 and 28%, 11 and 24%, 1 and 38% and 10 and 20% for the k-nearest neighbor, Naive Bayes, artificial neural network and rule-based classifiers for synthetic and real data sets, respectively. The decision tree and support vector machines classifiers were found to be the best predictive models with 0% error rates during automated extraction of the water quality class. This study reveals that data mining techniques have the potential to quickly predict water quality class, provided data given are a true representation of the domain knowledge.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JUL	2017	76	14							504	10.1007/s12665-017-6845-9								WOS:000406241000037						
J	Disli, E				Disli, E.			Hydrochemical characteristics of surface and groundwater and suitability for drinking and agricultural use in the Upper Tigris River Basin, Diyarbakir-Batman, Turkey	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Investigations were undertaken into the quality of surface water and groundwater bodies within the Upper Tigris Basin in Turkey to determine their suitability for potable and agricultural use. In the study area, the majority of the groundwater and surface water samples belong to the calcium-magnesium-bicarbonate type (Ca-Mg-HCO3) or magnesium-calcium-bicarbonate type (Mg-Ca-HCO3). Chemical analysis of all water samples shows that the mean cation concentrations (in mg/L) were in the order Ca2+ > Mg2+ > Na+ > K+ and that of anions are in the order HCO3- > SO42- > Cl- > CO3- for all groundwater and surface water samples. The Mg (2+)/Ca2+ ratio ranges from 0.21 to 1.30 with most of the values greater than 0.5, indicating that weathering of dolomites is dominant in groundwater. The analysis reveals that all of the samples are neutral to slightly alkaline (pH 7.0-8.7). Groundwater and surface water suitability for drinking usage was evaluated according to the World Health Organization and Turkish Standards (TSE-266) and suggests that most of the samples are suitable for drinking. Various determinants such as sodium absorption ratio, percent sodium (Na %), residual sodium carbonate and soluble sodium percentage revealed that most of the samples are suitable for irrigation. According to MH values, all of the well water samples were suitable for irrigation purposes, but 80 and 81.82% of Zillek springs and surface water samples were unsuitable. As per the PI values, the water samples from the study area are classified as Class I and Class II and are considered to be suitable for irrigation.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JUL	2017	76	14							500	10.1007/s12665-017-6820-5								WOS:000406241000033

N.; Chaudhury, Shibani			Optimization of the quality of reverse osmosis-treated coal bed water in relation to its effect on soil health	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												During the time of extraction of coal bed methane (CBM) gas, vast quantity of imbedded water is also simultaneously released to the surface. Quality of this water is generally very poor owing to high salt content, and discharge of such water to the land surface frequently results in serious deterioration of the soil health through expansion of salinity and alkalinity problems. Use of reverse osmosis (RO) technology has appeared to be an effective proposition for bringing down the ionic concentrations of coal bed water (CBW) and facilitating their safe release. However, reclaiming the large volume of CBW through RO is expensive and is difficult to be afforded by many CBM producers from developing countries. In this study, we assessed the possibility of releasing an intermediate-quality RO-treated CBW which will not affect the health of the flooded soils and also will involve lesser cost of RO operation. The study showed that the quality of RO-treated CBW below 2 mmho/cm did not affect the incubated soil very adversely with regard to the major soil health attributes. However, exchangeable sodium percentage of the RO water-treated soil exhibited sharp increments when the EC value of the RO water increased to 2.0 mmho/cm resulting in development of high alkalinity. It is, therefore, suggested that while treating CBW with RO technology for discharging the resultant water to adjacent areas, it is not necessary to produce highly purified reclaimed water. Instead of going for high level of reclamation, discharge of a moderate-quality treated water may be an effective proposition for improving the economy of CBW reclamation without affecting the health of the CBW-influenced soils.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JUL	2017	76	14							474	10.1007/s12665-017-6809-0								WOS:000406241000007

D.; Chaturvedi, Aaditya			Hydrogeochemistry of coal mine water of North Karanpura coalfields, India: implication for solute acquisition processes, dissolved fluxes and water quality assessment	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Mine water samples collected from different mines of the North Karanpura coalfields were analysed for pH, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids (TDS), total hardness (TH), major anions, cations and trace metals to evaluate mine water geochemistry and assess solute acquisition processes, dissolved fluxes and its suitability for domestic, industrial and irrigation uses. Mine water samples are mildly acidic to alkaline in nature. The TDS ranged from 185 to 1343 mg L-1 with an average of 601 mg L-1. Ca2+ and Mg2+ are the dominant cations, while SO42- and HCO3- are the dominant anions. A high concentration of SO42- and a low HCO3(-)/(HCO3- + SO42-) ratio (< 0.50) in the majority of the water samples suggest that either sulphide oxidation or reactions involving both carbonic acid weathering and sulphide oxidation control solute acquisition processes. The mine water is undersaturated with respect to gypsum, halite, anhydrite, fluorite, aluminium hydroxide, alunite, amorphous silica and oversaturated with respect to goethite, ferrihydrite, quartz. About 40% of the mine water samples are oversaturated with respect to calcite, dolomite and jarosite. The water quality assessment shows that the coal mine water is not suitable for direct use for drinking and domestic purposes and needs treatment before such utilization. TDS, TH, F-, SO42-, Fe, Mn, Ni and Al are identified as the major objectionable parameters in these waters for drinking. The coal mine water is of good to suitable category for irrigation use. The mines of North Karanpura coalfield annually discharge 22.35 x 10(6) m(3) of water and 18.50 x 10(3) tonnes of solute loads into nearby waterways.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JUL	2017	76	14							489	10.1007/s12665-017-6813-4								WOS:000406241000022

Uncertainty assessment of the multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network model with implementation of the novel hybrid MLP-FFA method for prediction of biochemical oxygen demand and dissolved oxygen: a case study of Langat River	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Accurate prediction of the chemical constituents in major river systems is a necessary task for water quality management, aquatic life well-being and the overall healthcare planning of river systems. In this study, the capability of a newly proposed hybrid forecasting model based on the firefly algorithm (FFA) as a metaheuristic optimizer, integrated with the multilayer perceptron (MLP-FFA), is investigated for the prediction of monthly water quality in Langat River basin, Malaysia. The predictive ability of the MLP-FFA model is assessed against the MLP-based model. To validate the proposed MLP-FFA model, monthly water quality data over a 10-year duration (2001-2010) for two different hydrological stations (1L04 and 1L05) provided by the Irrigation and Drainage Ministry of Malaysia are used to predict the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and dissolved oxygen (DO). The input variables are the chemical oxygen demand (COD), total phosphate (PO4), total solids, potassium (K), sodium (Na), chloride (Cl), electrical conductivity (EC), pH and ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N). The proposed hybrid model is then evaluated in accordance with statistical metrics such as the correlation coefficient (r), root-mean-square error, % root-mean-square error and Willmott's index of agreement. Analysis of the results shows that MLP-FFA outperforms the equivalent MLP model. Also, in this research, the uncertainty of a MLP neural network model is analyzed in relation to the predictive ability of the MLP model. To assess the uncertainties within the MLP model, the percentage of observed data bracketed by 95 percent predicted uncertainties (95PPU) and the band width of 95 percent confidence intervals (d-factors) are selected. The effect of input variables on BOD and DO prediction is also investigated through sensitivity analysis. The obtained values bracketed by 95PPU show about 77.7%, 72.2% of data for BOD and 72.2%, 91.6% of data for DO related to the 1L04 and 1L05 stations, respectively. The d-factors have a value of 1.648, 2.269 for BOD and 1.892, 3.480 for DO related to the 1L04 and 1L05 stations, respectively. Based on the values in both stations for the 95PPU and d-factor, it is concluded that the neural network model has an acceptably low degree of uncertainty applied for BOD and DO simulations. The findings of this study can have important implications for error assessment in artificial intelligence-based predictive models applied for water resources management and the assessment of the overall health in major river systems.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JUL	2017	76	14							503	10.1007/s12665-017-6842-z								WOS:000406241000036

Inverse distance weighted algorithms and weighted overlays were used to categorise irrigation water quality into a number of zones. The IWQ zonation analysis revealed that about 10% (42.15 km(2)) of the total area had water quality unsuitable for irrigation thereby potentially exposing a population of 35744 people from 110 villages to health risks, whereas the remaining 91.31% (393 km(2)) of the study area is considered to have suitable irrigation water. The villages of Nawapara, Sehara and Deucha have been particularly affected by poor water quality, potentially exposing 294 (100%), 114 (97%) and 1556 (87.76%) of the total village population, respectively, to health effects. Combined efforts of government agencies and NGOs in educating the local communities regarding artificial groundwater recharge, rainwater harvesting, watershed management can play a crucial role in the long run in minimising the potential impacts of poor water quality in these areas.

Quantifying flow interval-pollutant loading relationships in a rapidly urbanizing mixed-land-use watershed of the Central USA	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Rapid urbanization and agricultural development have altered flow and pollutant loading regimes resulting in poorly understood pollutant transport regimes and inadequately conceived management practices. Four years of hydrologic and water quality data (i.e., stream flow, suspended sediment, nitrate, nitrite, total ammonium, total inorganic nitrogen, and total phosphorus) were collected using a five-site nested-scale study design in a representative mixed-land-use watershed. Cumulative nested sub-basin drainage areas ranged from 79 to 208 km(2). Daily flow and load duration analyses were used to quantify land use impacts to flow-mediated pollutant loading at multiple flow intervals including high flows (0-10%), moist conditions (10-40%), mid-range flows (40-60%), dry conditions (60-90%), and low flows (90-100%). Pollutant loads ranged across four orders of magnitude for suspended sediments, and three orders of magnitude for nutrient loads during the high flow interval when nearly all of the total pollutant loads were transported (e.g., 99% of suspended sediments, 92% of total inorganic nitrogen, and 95% of total phosphorus loads). Results from stepwise multiple linear regression analyses showed significant relationships between land use, flow, and pollutant load at high flows, moist conditions, and mid-range flow intervals (R-2 < 75.7; p < 0.035). No significant relationships (p < 0.05) were detected during dry conditions, or low flow intervals. Results highlight the need for consideration of combined flow and pollutant loading targets appropriate for watersheds modified by current and ongoing land use and point to a need for long-term and broad-scale efforts to develop achievable hydrologic and water quality recommendations especially in rapidly urbanizing mixed-land-use watersheds.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JUL	2017	76	14							484	10.1007/s12665-017-6819-y								WOS:000406241000017						
J	Zhang, Y; Li, L; Erler, DV; Santos, I; Lockington, D				Zhang, Ying; Li, Ling; Erler, Dirk V.; Santos, Isaac; Lockington, David			Effects of beach slope breaks on nearshore groundwater dynamics	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Interactions between fresh groundwater and seawater affect significantly the nearshore pore water flow, which in turn influences the fate of nutrients and contaminants in coastal aquifers prior to discharge to the marine environment. Field investigations and numerical simulations were carried out to examine the groundwater dynamics in the intertidal zone of a carbonate sandy aquifer on the tropical island of Rarotonga, Cook Islands. The study site was featured by distinct cross-shore slope breaks on the beach surface. Measured pore water salinities revealed different distributions under the influences of different beach profiles, inland heads, and tidal oscillations. Fresh groundwater was found to discharge around a beach slope break located in the middle area of the intertidal zone. The results indicate a strong interplay between the slope break beach morphology and tidal force in controlling the nearshore groundwater flow and solute transport. The fresh groundwater discharge location was largely determined by the beach morphology in combination with the tidal force. The nearshore groundwater flow can be very sensitive to beach slope breaks, which induce local circulation and flow instabilities. As slope breaks are a common feature of beaches around the world, these results have important, general implications for future studies of nutrients transport and transformations in nearshore aquifers and associated fluxes via submarine groundwater discharge.

In this study, hydrogeochemical and isotope methods were employed to determine regional and local hydrogeology and characteristics of the basin. Optical, thermal and radar remote sensing products were used to update geological and structural maps of the basin and determine sampling points using the judgment sampling method. A total of 363 samples from wells, springs, rivers, lakes, swamps and rain were collected for this study, and an additional 270 water quality data sets were added from previous studies. These data were analyzed for their hydrogeochemical characteristics and isotope signatures. Analysis of the oxygen, deuterium and tritium isotopes shows the groundwater of the basin is modern water. Among all basins in Ethiopia, the Baro-Akobo Basin shows the highest enrichment. This indicates the proximity of the rainfall sources, which presumably are the Sudd and other wetlands in South Sudan. The hydrochemical properties of the waters show evapotranspiration is the dominant hydrologic process in the basin and explains the large amount of water that is lost in the lowland plain. Analysis of radon-222 shows no significant groundwater flux over the wetlands, which are part of Machar Marshes. This shows evaporation to be dominant hydrologic process in this zone. Results from all analyses help explain the limited holding capacity of the aquifers in the recharge zone and their vulnerability to anthropogenic impacts and climate variability. There is a trend of decreasing surface flow and rainfall and increasing water soil erosion.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JUL	2017	76	13							466	10.1007/s12665-017-6773-8								WOS:000405283600021

In the present study, a study of the hydrogeochemical characteristics of groundwater was undertaken in the Sonipat district of Haryana in India together with the use of stable isotope (delta O-18 and delta D) measurements and GIS analysis. A total of 53 groundwater samples were collected from seven blocks of the district, and 14 water quality parameters and stable isotopes (delta O-18 and delta D) were analysed to infer hydrogeochemical processes taking place in the area. The integration of hydrochemistry with GIS is very helpful to understand the factors governing in the area. The majority of the samples showed Na-Cl type of hydrochemical facies. The trilinear plot for major cations and anions in groundwater indicates dominance of sodium, calcium, chloride and bicarbonate ions. Nitrate plumes in the groundwater appear to be migrating in groundwater from the central and south-western parts of the area towards the urbanized areas. A total of 64% of the samples exceed the maximum permissible limit of 1.5 mg/L given by WHO for fluoride. Besides natural sources such as silicate and carbonate weathering, ion exchange, and reverse ion exchange, the leaching of surficial salts and untreated industrial wastes along with unregulated abstraction are contributing to poor groundwater quality in the study area. An assessment of saturation indices has shown that groundwater in the area is unsaturated with respect to anhydrite, halite and gypsum suggesting significant contribution of Ca2+, Mg2+ and other ions in the groundwater. A scatter plot of delta O-18 versus Cl also suggests mixing of saline water with fresh groundwater.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JUL	2017	76	13							465	10.1007/s12665-017-6789-0								WOS:000405283600020

However, the quality of groundwater in this area is deteriorating due to intensive industrial and agricultural activities, and this has a great adverse impact on human health. In order to better understand the pollution status of groundwater and the health risks to local residents, comprehensive water quality index was applied to assess the quality of drinking water in Yulin City, Northwest China, and sodium adsorption ratio, sodium percentage, residual sodium carbonate and permeability index were used to evaluate the quality of irrigation water. Moreover, the health risks caused by ingestion of groundwater were evaluated using the model proposed by the Ministry of Environmental Protection of the PR China. The results show that all groundwater samples for irrigation will not induce soil salinization, but more than half of them are not suitable for drinking, and Fe, Mn, TH, Mg2+ and NO3-N are the common contaminants which are mainly from natural processes, industrial and agricultural activities. The health risk assessment indicates that children face greater non-carcinogenic risk than adults. The order of contribution of contaminants to non-carcinogenic risk is NO3- > As > F- > Fe > Mn > Ba2+ > Cr6+ > Zn > NO2-. The average carcinogenic risk of carcinogens (Cr6+ and As) is 1.17 x 10(-4) and 1.37 x 10(-4) for adults and children, respectively, which surpasses the permissible level (1 x 10(-6)) stipulated by the Ministry of Environmental Protection of the PR China. Hence, effective measures are highly demanded to manage groundwater pollution and reduce the risks to human health.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JUL	2017	76	13							467	10.1007/s12665-017-6781-8								WOS:000405283600022

Interrelationship between geochemical elements of sediment and groundwater at Samrak Park Delta of Nakdong River Basin in Korea: multivariate statistical analyses and artificial neural network approaches	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												This research was conducted at Samrak Park Delta of Nakdong River Basin in Busan Metropolitan City, Korea. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the interrelationship of geochemical elements in sediments and groundwater through multivariate statistical analyses and a multilayer perceptron artificial neural network model. The mean concentrations of chemical elements were Si (46%), Fe (16.9%), Al (15.7%), K (7.5%) and Ca (4.5%) in sediments, and Na (8650 mg/L), Mg (999 mg/L), Ca (432 mg/L), K (293 mg/L) and Cl (17,640 mg/L) in groundwater, respectively. The principal component analysis produced 3 kinds of factors with the variances of 63.37, 27.02 and 9.62%, respectively. It is suggested that the chemical components of sediments and groundwater were mainly originated from source rocks and seawater intrusion, with the minor impacts of irrigation and industry. Cluster analysis also showed that chemical elements were mainly controlled by the natural geogenic sources and seawater intrusion. Multilayer perceptron of artificial neural network (ANN) presented the good interrelationship between sediment and groundwater. The determination coefficients (R-2) between ANN predicted values and observed values in groundwater showed the high values of 0.61-0.97 except Mg, Mn and Sr. It is revealed that the chemical components of sediment and groundwater were derived from local geological origin and from the minor impact of anthropogenic sources.

However, human activities significantly decreased groundwater quality. In this study, the spatiotemporal variation of groundwater quality was evaluated in an arid area where long-term paper wastewater irrigation has been implemented. For this study, seven wells were regularly monitored for physicochemical parameters over a period of 1 year. Statistical and graphical approaches were applied to interpret the spatiotemporal variation of groundwater quality parameters in the wastewater irrigation zone. Correlation analysis was also carried out to reveal the sources of some major ions. The results indicate that the groundwater type in the study area is dominated by the Cl-Na, followed by the HCO3-Na, the HCO3-Ca center dot Mg, and the SO4 center dot Cl-Ca center dot Mg types. Groundwater in the area is significantly contaminated locally with fluoride, nitrite and ammonia, and the chemical oxygen demand levels were increased in some groundwater monitoring wells. Most contaminants showed an increasing trend from the Yellow River water irrigation zone toward the wastewater irrigation zone. Rock weathering, mineral dissolution, and cation exchange are important processes controlling groundwater quality, but human activities, such as wastewater irrigation, play an undeniable role in affecting groundwater quality in this area. The results of this study contribute to the understanding of the formation and circulation of groundwater under human activities and provide a scientific basis for regional water quality evaluation, water quality improvement, and protection.

Agricultural Phosphorus Balance Calculator: A tool for watershed planning	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Best management practices implemented to minimize agricultural phosphorus (P) water quality impacts typically focus on retaining nutrients rather than improving P use efficiencies. Although it is now well understood that long-term reduction of P loadings requires achieving a watershed level P balance, this concept is generally not incorporated in watershed planning. This paper develops a detailed P balance for the Albert Lea Lake watershed, a high production agricultural watershed in south-central Minnesota, United States. Watershed specific crop and livestock management data were acquired through personal interviews, surveys, feedlot permits, and site visits. These data, together with published resources, were used to develop an open-source Agricultural P Balance Calculator to compute P use efficiencies of livestock operations, crop production, and collectively, the watershed's agricultural system. In 2010, the P use efficiency was 1.7, indicating that more P was being exported from the watershed as agricultural products than imported, implying that crops were "mining" P from watershed soils. The Agricultural P Balance Calculator enables users to identify production areas where P use efficiency strategies could be incorporated into conservation implementation planning, thereby enhancing prospects for meeting P reduction goals.																	0022-4561	1941-3300				JUL-AUG	2017	72	4					395	404		10.2489/jswc.72.4.395								WOS:000405360300013

A Comparison of Main and Side Channel Physical and Water Quality Metrics and Habitat Complexity in the Middle Mississippi River	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Worldwide large rivers have been severely modified by human intervention. Many modifications result in disconnection of the river from floodplain and off-channel habitats generally characterized by lower velocities and Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. shallower depths relative to the main channel, conditions vital to many organisms. Extensive levees on the Middle Mississippi River (MMR) have cut off backwater systems and disconnected the river from 80% of its floodplain. However, the system is characterized by large side channels associated with islands. We examined a long term data set for differences in physical (e.g. depth and velocity) and water quality metrics (e.g. temperature, suspended solids, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll, % organic matter) between the main and side channels of a 128-km reach of the MMR. We compared variability between main and side channels using the coefficient of variation (COV). All metrics differed between habitats. Side channels were shallower with lower velocities and had greater mean and COV of % organic matter and more variable dissolved oxygen concentrations. Velocity, temperature, and suspended solids were similar in the spring. COVs were lowest in both habitats during the spring for all metrics except temperature and DO. Resource management in the MMR tends to focus on maintaining existing side channels because of the difficulty of working in the heavily used navigation channel. This study shows that these actions protect areas that function differently than the main channel for most of the year. However, our results also highlight the need for restoration activities aimed at restoring floodplain connectivity, especially during the spring.

Effects of Urban Sprawl on Riparian Vegetation: Is Compact or Dispersed Urbanization Better for Biodiversity?	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Compact urbanization is the main strategy for sustainable urban development. However, it is yet unclear whether compact urban forms are ecologically more favourable than dispersed ones. In this paper, we studied the effects of urban sprawl on the riparian vegetation condition in one of the most degraded watersheds in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area, Argentina. We conducted random sampling of the riparian vegetation at sites along streams in the basin and assessed urban indicators at the reach and sub-watershed scales for each of those sites in a geographic information system: urban area, impervious surface, population density and two landscape metrics of dispersion. The indicators assessed explained a high proportion of the variability of the vegetation response variables, thereby confirming the importance of urban sprawl pressure in shaping riparian communities in fluvial ecosystems. Dispersed urbanization had more positive than negative effects on the vegetation in the study area. Riverbanks associated with dispersed urbanization had more plant species, including exotics, when urban sprawl was assessed at the local scale. At the sub-watershed scale, dispersed urbanized areas were richer in native plants and most of the functional groups, and poorer in exotic species. The model of the compact city, including bio-corridors along watercourses, has been proposed for the Buenos Aires conurbation process for the next decades. Our results showed that the quality of existing river corridors across the compact matrix was not desirable and best practices for redesigning a more sustainable landscape structure are necessary, including the restoration of habitats for wetland species.

J	Pramanik, BK; Shu, L; Jegatheesan, V				Pramanik, Biplob Kumar; Shu, Li; Jegatheesan, Veeriah			A review of the management and treatment of brine solutions	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY												There has been a considerable expansion in the use of desalination plants for supplying potable water to many communities in the world. However, the production of brine, which is known to be a concentrated solution, is an integral part of the operation of the desalination plant, which faces critical environmental challenges because of its high salinity. Therefore, a cost-effective and environmentally benign brine management system is required prior to its proper disposal. Currently, several disposal options including surface water discharge, deep well injection, and evaporation ponds have been used. However, these processes are unsustainable and their use is limited by a high capital cost and limited applications. Various conventional treatments including physicochemical, oxidation and biological processes with varying extents of organics removal have been reported. Nowadays, membrane-based technologies appear to be cost-effective methods for managing brine concentrate as they can recover valuable resources and produce clean water with high recovery. This paper critically reviews current technologies for concentrate management, including disposal practices and treatment processes. The characteristics of the brine in terms of water quality and its impact on open water bodies are discussed. This paper examines emerging membrane processes such as forward osmosis, membrane distillation, and electrodialysis that show promise for minimizing brine volume, in recovering valuable resources and improvement of water recovery. This paper also discusses the fact that integrated membrane processes are better for brine management for resource recovery together with water purification in wastewater treatment facilities and can achieve a zero liquid discharge.																	2053-1400	2053-1419				JUL 1	2017	3	4					625	658		10.1039/c6ew00339g								WOS:000404718800004

Emerging investigators series: hydrogen sulfide production in municipal stormwater retention ponds under ice covered conditions: a study of water quality and SRB populations	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY												Stormwater retention ponds have become an integral component of stormwater management across the world. Under prolonged hypoxia, these ponds are capable of releasing large quantities of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas. In this study, water quality constituents and bacterial communities in sediment were analyzed in two stormwater retention ponds, RSP1 (reference pond) and RSP2 (problematic pond) over a period of two years, to identify the factors driving H2S production and understand the microbial community associated with H2S production in stormwater ponds. It was found that the background total sulfide concentrations were not statistically different between the two ponds during summer (RSP2: 0.012 +/- 0.001 mg L-S-1; RSP1: 0.010 +/- 0.001 mg L-S-1) and were statistically different during ice covered winter operation (RSP2: 6.375 +/- 1.135 mg L-S-1; RSP1: 0.016 +/- 0.009 mg L-S-1). The study showed a lack of correlation between total sulfide concentrations in RSP2 and soluble chemical oxygen demand, sulfate, soluble total phosphorus, total ammonia nitrogen, nitrate, nitrite and pH. However, DO concentrations demonstrated a strong negative correlation with total sulfides concentrations in RSP2 (p < 0.006, r = -0.58, n = 26), which confirmed DO as the critical water quality parameter linked to H2S production in stormwater ponds. Finally, it was found that seasonal change, ice covered versus non-ice covered operation and a comparison between a H2S emitting pond and non-emitting pond all did not promote a measurable proliferation of sulfatereducing bacteria nor a community shift in the sulfate-reducing bacterial population. Hence, the study demonstrates that sulfide production is a result of increased ubiquitous SRB activity in stormwater retention ponds and the emission of H2S gas is not indicative of SRB proliferation or a population shift towards specific SRB taxa.

Improved contaminant removal in vegetated stormwater biofilters amended with biochar	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY												The potential for carbonaceous sorbents to improve contaminant removal (particularly for trace organic contaminants, TOrCs) in stormwater biofilters was evaluated in intermittently dosed, vegetated columns simulating scaled-down treatment systems. Columns amended with biochar or granular activated carbon (GAC) were evaluated relative to performance benchmarks set by columns representing unamended treatment systems (i.e., sand filters and vegetated biofilters). Biochar amendment (6.7 wt%, 33 vol%) strongly improved TOrC removal, despite potential fouling due to the presence of an upper compost-amended layer. Biochar-amended biofilter columns maintained greater than 99% TOrC removal throughout five months of dosing with TOrC-spiked creek water (equivalent to approximately 1.3 years of runoff volume), relative to less than 50% removal of most TOrCs by unamended biofilter columns. GAC amendment (6.7 wt%, 12.5 vol%) also improved TOrC removal, though less effectively than biochar (>70% removal), because the bio-char's lower density (i.e., higher volume composition) and smaller particles improved performance. These results indicate that full-scale biochar-amended biofilters could potentially remove TOrCs effectively for several years, as treatment depths up to five times greater than the 10 cm experimental depth may be feasible for full-scale systems. Further, contaminant removal survey experiments conducted after 6 months of operation revealed that biochar amendment improved removal of total organic carbon, total nitrogen, nitrate, and total dissolved phosphorus in biofilters by greater than 60%. The findings of this study demonstrate the potential of biochar amendment to broadly improve contaminant removal in biofilters, motivating and informing the application of full-scale biochar-amended biofilters for improved water quality.																	2053-1400	2053-1419				JUL 1	2017	3	4					726	734		10.1039/c7ew00070g								WOS:000404718800011						
J	Dinka, MO				Dinka, Megersa Olumana			Lake Basaka Expansion: Challenges for the Sustainability of the Matahara Irrigation Scheme, Awash River Basin (Ethiopia)	IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE												The Matahara Sugar Estate (MSE), after nearly 60years of irrigation, is experiencing the effects of waterlogging and salinization in some fields. The problem is believed to be the result of the expansion of (saline and alkaline) Lake Basaka towards the plantation fields. The objective of this study was to determine the geometry of the lake (area and shape) in roughly the past half- century (1957-2015) from both Landsat images and local information and then assess its negative effects on MSE's soil and water quality. Monthly groundwater (GW) depth was monitored using piezometer tubes. Water and soil samples were collected from each of the piezometer locations and analysed for important physico-chemical parameters. The results indicate that the lake expanded approximately 47.3km(2) in the past half-century. The soil quality was found to be very poor in plantation sections with very shallow GW depth and severe salinity conditions. The lake, as revealed by the results, is intruding into the groundwater system of MSE on the Abadir side. Assuming continuation of the past trends, the lake is expected to inundate parts of MSE in the next few years and, hence, challenge the production and productivity of MSE significantly. The lake has the potential to join the Awash River, thereby impacting all downstream irrigation developments in the basin and the livelihood of the people depending on the water resources. As the area is situated in the uppermost part of Main Ethiopian Rift Valley, other factors are expected to exacerbate its expansion even in the future. Overall, the study results present the potential damage caused by the lake to MSE and provides valuable information for the reclamation measures to be taken for the sustainability of MSE.

Groundwater level (WD) and quality were monitored at 37 shallow wells scattered over a 25 000ha area at different times. Using prepared raster maps of pH, ESP, EC and WD by the best method, drainage problems were categorized into eight classes. Both SVM and ANFIS models significantly improved predicted data for pH, ESP, EC and WD compared with geostatistical models, while SVMs provided slightly better results which were used for further analysis. More than 60% of the area needs drainage to lower the groundwater table in pre-planting and post-harvest periods, while during the growing seasons, more than about 72% of the area requires drainage for salinity control. Based on the results, identifying drainage problems at basin scale is possible with cost-efficient machine learning models with minimum time and data requirements and investment for detailed field surveys.

Hydraulic conditions are primarily governed by transient events generated by valve modulation or pumping action. We investigate the impact of transient events on the rate of chlorine decay under various flow conditions. To comprehensively compare the performance of existing chlorine models, 14 candidate models for chlorine concentration were used under various transient conditions. Two-dimensional (2D) transient flow analysis was conducted to investigate the unknown processes of chlorine decay under transient conditions. General formulations for modeling chlorine decay were used to comprehensively study the decay under unsteady conditions and to effectively incorporate the impact of transients into generic model structures. The chlorine decay patterns in the constructed water distribution system were analyzed in the context of transient events. Linear relationships between the model parameters and the frequency of transient events were determined under unsteady conditions, and the impact of turbulence intensity was successfully incorporated into model parameter evaluations. The modeling results from 2D transient analysis exhibit similar predictability as those obtained from calibration using the genetic algorithm.																	1464-7141	1465-1734				JUL	2017	19	4					522	537		10.2166/hydro.2017.082								WOS:000404905000003

The 19 lakes were divided into two groups according to EC (threshold value = 800 mu S cm(-1)): fresh water (N = 13) and brackish water lakes (N = 6). The fluorescent characteristics of CDOM in the 19 lakes were investigated using excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy (EEM) coupled with parallel factor (PARAFAC) and multivariate analysis. Two humic-like components (C1 and C3), one tryptophan-like component (C2), and one tyrosine-like component (C4) were identified by PARAFAC. The component C4 was not included in subsequent analyses due to the strong scatter in some colloidal water samples from brackish water lakes. The correlations between F-max for the three EEM-PARAFAC extracted CDOM components C1-C3, the fluorescence indices (FI370 and FI310) and the water quality parameters (i.e., TN, TP, Chl-a, pH, EC, turbidity (Turb) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC)) were determined by redundancy analysis (RDA). The results of RDA analysis showed that spatial variation in land cover, pollution sources, and salinity/EC gradients in water quality affected F-max for the fluorescent components C1-C3 and the fluorescence indices (FI370 and FI310). Further examination indicated that the CDOM fluorescent components and the fluorescence indices (FI370 and F1310) did not significantly differ (t-test, p > 0.05) in fresh water (N = 13) and brackish water lakes (N = 6). There was a difference in the distribution of the average F-max for the CDOM fluorescent components between Cl to C3 from agricultural sources and urban wastewater sources in hypereutrophic brackish water lakes. The F-max for humic-like components Cl and C3 spatially varied with land cover among the 19 lakes. Our results indicated that the spatial distributions of F-max for CDOM fluorescent components and their correlations with water quality can be evaluated by EEM-PARAFAC and multivariate analysis among the 19 lakes across semiarid regions of Northeast China, which has potential implication for lakes with similar genesis.

Assessment of nutrient loadings of a large multipurpose prairie reservoir	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The relatively low water flow velocities in reservoirs cause them to have high capacities for retaining sed-iments and pollutants, which can lead to a reduction in downstream nutrient loading. Hence, nutrients can progressively accumulate in reservoirs, resulting in the deterioration of aquatic ecosystems and water quality. Lake Diefenbaker (LD) is a large multipurpose reservoir, located on the South Saskatchewan River (SSR), that serves as a major source of freshwater in Saskatchewan, Canada. Over the past several years, changes in land use (e.g. expansion of urban areas and industrial developments) in the reservoir's catchment have heightened concerns about future water quality in the catchment and in the reservoir. Intensification of agricultural activities has led to an increase in augmented the application of manure and fertilizer for crops and pasture. Although previous research has attempted to quantify nutrient retention in LD, there is a knowledge gap related to the identification of major nutrient sources and quantification of nutrient export from the catchment at different spatial scales. Using the SPAtially Referenced Regression On Watershed (SPARROW) model, this gap has been addressed by assessing water quality regionally, and identifying spatial patterns of factors and processes that affect water quality in the LD catchment. Model results indicate that LD retains about 70% of the inflowing total nitrogen (TN) and 90% of the inflowing total phosphorus (TP) loads, of which fertilizer and manure applied to agricultural fields contribute the greatest proportion. The SPARROW model will be useful as a tool to guide the optimal implementation of nutrient management plans to reduce nutrient inputs to LD. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Xian, CC; Qi, ZM; Tan, CS; Zhang, TQ				Xian, Changchi; Qi, Zhiming; Tan, Chin S.; Zhang, Tie-Quan			Modeling hourly subsurface drainage using steady-state and transient methods	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Computer models have been frequently used to simulate the hydrologic and environmental processes in subsurface-drained cropland. The widely-tested steady-state Hooghoudt (ssH) equation, implemented in the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM2, version 2.94.00), serves in simulating subsurface drainage. However, transient methods such as the integrated Hooghoudt (inH) and van Schilfgaarde (vanS) equations have seldom been implemented in models. In the present study, RZWQM2's hydrologic component was modified to initiate the soil water redistribution process when rainfall occurred. The three drainage equations (ssH, inH and vanS) were tested in each of two versions of RZWQM2 (original and modified). Field data from Iowa (2007-2008) and Ontario (2009-2010) were used to evaluate different model version x equation combinations' simulation accuracy at both daily and hourly scales, evaluated using the percent of bias (PBIAS), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE), and the Index of Agreement (IoA). On a daily scale and across equations, for the Iowa data the original model (PBIAS <= 14.96, NSE <= 0.40, >= 0.69) was outperformed by the modified model (PBIAS <= 6.48, NSE >= 0.70, IoA >= 0.76). Similarly, for the Ontario data, the original model (PBIAS <= 8.87,NSE >= 0.19, IoA >= 0.65) was outperformed by the modified model (PBIAS <= 3.59,NSE >= 0.31,IoA >= 0.67). However, based on a parity of PBIAS, NSE and IoA values, hourly scale tile drainage computed using the modified model equipped with transient equations did not improve model performance compared with the original ssH equation.

It varies spatio-temporally over large waterbodies and its well distributed measurement on field is tedious and time consuming. Generally, normalized difference turbidity index (NOT!), or band ratio, or regression analysis between turbidity concentration and band reflectance, approaches have been adapted to retrieve turbidity using multispectral remote sensing data. These techniques usually provide qualitative rather than quantitative estimates of turbidity. However, in the present study, spectral similarity analysis, between the spectral characteristics of spaceborne hyperspectral remote sensing data and spectral library generated on field, was carried out to quantify turbidity in the part of Chilika Lake, Odisha, India. Spatial spectral contextual image analysis, spectral angle mapper (SAM) technique was evaluated for the same. The SAM spectral matching technique has been widely used in geological application (mineral mapping), however, the application of this kind of techniques is limited in water quality studies due to non availability of reference spectral libraries. A spectral library was generated on field for the different concentrations of turbidity using well calibrated instruments like field spectro-radiometer, turbidity meter and hand held global positioning system. The field spectra were classified into 7 classes of turbidity concentration as <5, 5-10, 10-15, 15-25, 25-45, 45-100 and >100 NTU for analysis. Analysis reveal that at each location in the lake under consideration, the field spectra matched with the image spectra with SAM score of 0.8 and more. The observed turbidity at each location was also very much falling in the estimated turbidity class range. It was observed that the spectral similarity approach provides more quantitative estimate of turbidity as compared to NDTI. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Metal-fluxes characterization at a catchment scale: Study of mixing processes and end-member analysis in the Meca River watershed (SW Spain)	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Fluxes of acidity and contaminants from acid mine drainage (AMD) sources to the receiving surface water bodies were studied in a mining-impacted watershed (Meca River, SW Spain) using a novel methodology based on the joint application of EMMA and MIX codes. The application of EMMA and elemental ratios allowed delimiting the end-members responsible for water quality variations at a catchment scale. The further application of MIX quantified the significant impact of AMD on the river quality; less than 10% of AMD relative contribution is enough to maintain acidic conditions during most of the year. The mixing model also provided information about the element mobility, distinguishing those elements with a quasi conservative behavior (e.g., Cu, Zn, Al, Co or Ni) from those affected by mineral precipitation/dissolution (e.g., K, Si, Na, Sr, Ca, Fe, Pb, or As). Floods are the main driver of dissolved and, mainly particulate, contaminants in the catchment. Thus, the first rainfall events in November only accounted for 19% of the annual Meca flow but yielded between 26 and 43% of the net acidity and dissolved metal loads (mainly, Fe, As and Pb). Concerning particulate transport, around 332 tons of particulate Fe, 49 tons of Al, 0.79 tons of As and 0.37 tons of Pb were recorded during these first floods. The particulate As concentration can be up to 34 times higher than the dissolved one during floods and between 2 and 4 times higher for Fe, Pb and Cr.

J	Teegavarapu, RSV; Nayak, A				Teegavarapu, Ramesh S. V.; Nayak, Anurag			Evaluation of long-term trends in extreme precipitation: Implications of in-filled historical data use for analysis	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												This study focuses on the assessment of biases from infilling missing precipitation data on the detection of long-term change using parametric and non-parametric statistical techniques. Long-term historical precipitation data available for almost 100 years at 53 rain gages in south Florida, USA, with gages having varying lengths of missing data are used for the study. Precipitation data with gaps and time series with spatial interpolated data are analyzed. Chronologically complete datasets are often used in climate variability studies by analyzing data in multiple temporal windows. The temporal windows selected in this work coincide with Atlantic multi-decadal oscillation (AMO) cool and warm phases that strongly influence precipitation extremes and characteristics in the study region. Selection of these windows has helped in evaluating the extremes derived based on infilled and unfilled data. The frequency of occurrence of precipitation extremes over a pre-specified threshold is also analyzed. Results indicate that infilled precipitation data introduce large biases in the statistical trends and over and under-estimate low and high extremes respectively. Evaluation of three extreme precipitation indices (i.e. Rx1 day, R25mm and R50mm) indicates that bias increases with increase in amount of missing data. Nonparametric hypothesis tests indicate that statistical distributions of data of infilled and unfilled data are different when the data infilled is more than 5% of the entire data. Infilled data also introduced high variability in precipitation extremes in AMO cool and warm phases along with the changes in the frequency of occurrence of extreme events over a threshold.

A study of labyrinth emitter clogging was conducted to determine the effects of pulsating versus constant pressure on average emitter flow rate (), the Christiansen uniformity coefficient (Cu), and the location of clogged emitters. Under constant pressure, emitters in this study began to be clogged after the 8th irrigation, whereby 15 emitters eventually became clogged; the average emitter flow rate decreased to 75% of the original emitter flow rate () after the 15th irrigation, and Cu decreased rapidly by 68.2%. For pulsating pressure, emitters began to be clogged after the 14th irrigation, only 5 emitters became clogged, and only decreased to 85.3% of , and Cu declined by only 22.6%. These results demonstrate that the anti-clogging performance of emitters with pulsating pressure is better than with constant pressure. Emitter clogging at a constant pressure generally occurred at the inlet and front of labyrinth channels, mainly due to deposition of sediment particles. Emitter clogging with pulsating pressure is due to other impurities (e.g., debris of Teflon tape) besides sediment particles plugging the labyrinth channel. Pulsating pressure is recommended for use in drip irrigation to prevent emitter clogging.

Results of some water quality measurements are presented, showing that these lagoons have poor ecological status where they experience either a lack of flushing by the tide, or large amounts of anthropogenic inputs, or both. A vulnerability assessment is applied to the lagoons in question and this reveals a varying degree of threat from climate change to the operation and use of the lagoons. Our understanding of these systems suggests that a set of 10 hydrodynamic models, underpinned by an understanding of the local coastal sediment transport in each case, is appropriate, and could then be used to inform stakeholders and management in decision making. Integrated, broad ranging management strategies must adapt to the realities of climate change in order to allow the sustainable use of these lagoons in providing economic benefits, ecosystem services, and elements of coastline protection for the benefit of the local and regional population and its economy.

A case study of the Blackwater estuary in southern Ireland	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												The environmental status of many European estuaries has improved in recent years as a result of the implementation of a range of different legislative measures. Better municipal waste water treatment and a reduction in the application of inorganic and organic fertiliser to agricultural lands are the main reasons for these improvements. It is anticipated, however, that the ending of the EU milk quota in 2015, and the proposed enlargement of the European dairy sector will lead to a market-driven increase in milk production through an increase in animal numbers and higher productivity. This new production is likely to lead to an increase in pressures with the potential to impact on the quality of surface waters, including estuarine waters. In this paper we focus on the Blackwater estuary in southern Ireland which has seen a marked improvement in water quality due to a reduction in riverine nutrient inputs of phosphorus and nitrogen. A bio-physical model is used to test nutrient-input scenarios likely to represent the range of nutrient loadings that may arise as a result of increased agricultural production. The outputs from these different scenarios are used to assess if recent improvements in estuarine water quality will be undermined or even negated by the proposed expansion of the Irish dairy sector. Appropriate management options to address these potential impacts are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

As a result, in association with climate change impacts, the ecosystems of the GBR have degraded greatly in recent decades, and the decline in ecosystem health continues. Improved agricultural management practices are now being funded to reverse the decline. However the quantum of reduction in contaminant loads from individual rivers needed to reverse the decline is not known. To estimate load reductions that would reverse the decline we developed what we term Ecologically Relevant Targets (ERTs). These targets are the load reductions of sediment, nutrients and pesticides needed such that GBR lagoonal waters meet the relevant water quality guidelines for the region. The methodology proposed for setting the ERTs is described and examples of ERTs set for the Burdekin Region of the GBR are given. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Phosphate Removal from Agricultural Drainage Water Using an Iron Oxyhydroxide Filter Material	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Phosphate discharged in agricultural drainage causes water quality degradation on local, regional, and national scales. Iron oxyhydroxide filter materials can potentially remove the soluble phosphate present in drainage waters. Laboratory saturated column experiments and preliminary small-scale field tests were carried out to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of a synthetic goethite iron oxyhydroxide (alpha-FeOOH) filter material for phosphate treatment. Original iron oxyhydroxide filter material (SG-IOH-O) and the same filter material regenerated with sodium hydroxide (SGIOH- R) were assessed. Results of replicated laboratory experiments showed that columns packed with SGIOH- O or SG-IOH-R almost totally removed phosphate (>98%) from drainage waters spiked with an additional 1 or 10 ppm phosphate-P (PO4-P). The column experiments with SG-IOH-O or SG-IOH-R additionally indicated that contact times of only 10 to 15 s were sufficient for near complete removal of phosphate from drainage water spiked with 1 ppm PO4-P. In an initial small-scale filter treatment system field test with SG-IOH-O, percent phosphate removal averaged 89% in the first 200 days, which then decreased to an average 40% phosphate removal in the last 80 days. Following this initial field test, two field tests, one with SG-IOH-O and the other with SG-IOH-R, were conducted concurrently over a period of 193 days, with the SG-IOH-O system phosphate removal averaging 75%, while the SG-IOHR system phosphate removal averaged 34%. This study's findings support possible goethite iron oxyhydroxide filter material use for drainage water phosphate treatment; however, larger-scale field investigations are needed, particularly with modified regeneration procedures.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				JUL	2017	228	7							240	10.1007/s11270-017-3410-9								WOS:000403574400008

Erosion froma Cross-Country Natural Gas Pipeline Corridor: The Critical First Year	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Sediment losses as concentrations and yields were measured for a year from 12 segments of a newly constructed (buried) natural gas pipeline on the US Forest Service's Fernow Experimental Forest in West Virginia. Pipeline segments were separated by waterbars which served as drainage features. Six segments were northwest-facing, and six were southeast-facing. Three segments on each aspect were seeded with warm season native herbaceous species at rates used by the Forest Service (1x). All remaining segments received seeding at three times that rate (3x). Forest Service-established rates of fertilizer, lime, and straw mulch were applied to all segments. Sediment concentrations and yields generally were highest at the start of the study, respectively, averaging approximately 1660 mg L-1 and 340 kg ha(-1) during the first 3 months following completion of corridor reclamation, but they were less than from nearby less-steep forest road corridors. Concentrations and yields fell significantly after the first 3 months; declines were attributed to revegetation on the ROW. At the end of the first growing season, vegetative cover on all segments ranged from 55 to 79%, with no differences between seeding rates. Mean runoff was significantly higher on the northwest-facing segments than on the southeast-facing segments, but runoff volumes did not decrease on either aspect in concert with loadings or concentrations. Higher runoff on the northwest-facing segments may have been due to clay-skinned peds in subsurface soil that limited vertical drainage. Even with a heavy straw mulch cover on the right-of-way, the timing of the highest sediment losses immediately following pipeline construction suggests that implementation of additional surface-protection best management practices could be beneficial until vegetation is reestablished.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				JUL	2017	228	7							232	10.1007/s11270-017-3374-9								WOS:000403574400001

Influence of Sewered Versus Septic Systems on Watershed Exports of E-coli	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Elevated bacteria concentrations have led to the impairment (e.g., closures of shellfisheries and recreational beaches) of coastal waters. Although many previous studies have suggested that wastewater inputs can lead to elevated fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) concentrations in surface waters, few studies have quantified wastewater-associated FIB exports at the watershed scale. The goal of this study was to estimate bacterial exports at the watershed scale based on wastewater management approach (septic vs. sewer). Six watersheds (three exclusively on septic and three exclusively served by a sewer system) were selected for water quality assessment and comparison. Streams were monitored approximately monthly from August 2011 to June 2012 during baseflow conditions. Additionally, three storms were monitored. Samples were collected in sterile 100-mL bottles and analyzed for Escherichia coli concentrations. Discharge from streams was measured and bacterial exports were estimated by multiplying discharge by E. coli concentration. The results revealed that (1) during baseflow conditions, septic watersheds contained elevated stream discharge and E. coli concentrations and exports as compared to sewer watersheds; (2) warmer months had elevated E. coli watershed exports compared to colder months in both septic and sewer watersheds; and (3) storms significantly increased watershed E. coli exports in both septic and sewer watersheds. Storms significantly increased watershed E. coli exports in both septic and sewered watersheds, but E. coli counts in sewered watersheds were considerably greater likely due to greater impervious surface coverage and or leaky sewer infrastructure. These findings in conjunction with previous studies suggest that septic systems may play a pivotal role in the delivery of FIB to receiving waters, particularly during baseflow conditions.

However, implementing this empirical comparative approach at a greater spatial scale remains a challenge due to the diversity of biogeographical contexts encompassed by regional and national scales. We showed in previous studies that the use of standard organisms caged permits the use of a common biomonitor over a far greater geographical range, while limiting the influence of confounding factors on levels of bioavailable contamination. In this study, levels of Cd, Hg, Ni and Pb contamination assessed by active biomonitoring with caged Gammarus fossarum were compared to abundances of on-site gammarids, on 94 sites in France. Based on this national dataset of in situ bioassays, we first re-determined bioavailable background assessment concentrations (BBACs), i.e. concentrations measured in caged G. fossarum indicating a significant bioavailable contamination, which we had previously defined at a regional scale for these four metallic elements. On-site gammarid abundances were retrieved from monitoring programs implemented by French water agencies for the evaluation of ecological status for the European Water Framework Directive. These abundances were corrected for the influence of stream physico-chemical typology in order to permit a reliable comparison of gammarid densities between sites at the national scale. Clear trends of degradation of gammarid densities with increasing levels of bioaccumulated concentrations were identified for three of the four elements (Cd, Ni and Pb). Threshold concentrations in caged organisms above which the numbers of free-ranging gammarids were abnormally low namely bioavailable ecological assessment concentrations (BEACs) were determined. The reliability and validity of the BEACs, their comparison with BBACs and their usefulness in terms of prioritisation of contaminants, sites in freshwater management, are discussed.

M.; Zhu, Guangwei; Gao, Guang			Improving water quality in China: Environmental investment pays dividends	WATER RESEARCH												This study highlights how Chinese economic development detrimentally impacted water quality in recent decades and how this has been improved by enormous investment in environmental remediation funded by the Chinese government. To our knowledge, this study is the first to describe the variability of surface water quality in inland waters in China, the affecting drivers behind the changes, and how the government-financed conservation actions have impacted water quality. Water quality was found to be poorest in the North and the Northeast China Plain where there is greater coverage of developed land (cities + cropland), a higher gross domestic product (GDP), and higher population density. There are significant positive relationships between the concentration of the annual mean chemical oxygen demand (COD) and the percentage of developed land use (cities + cropland), GDP, and population density in the individual watersheds (p < 0.001). During the past decade, following Chinese government financed investments in environmental restoration and reforestation, the water quality of Chinese inland waters has improved markedly, which is particularly evident from the significant and exponentially decreasing GDP-normalized COD and ammonium (NH4+-N) concentrations. It is evident that the increasing GDP in China over the past decade did not occur at the continued expense of its inland water ecosystems. This offers hope for the future, also for other industrializing countries, that with appropriate environmental investments a high GDP can be reached and maintained, while simultaneously preserving inland aquatic ecosystems, particularly through management of sewage discharge.

Moreover, these systems are vulnerable to either accidental spills or intentional unauthorized discharges. To properly manage them, a limited number of sensors could be placed at different locations to monitor the water quality. In this paper, multiobjective and single-objective optimization procedures to optimally locate sensors in sewer systems are proposed, tested, and compared. The multiobjective procedures include objective functions related to information theory (IT procedure), detection time and reliability (DR procedure), and a combination of them (IT_DR procedure). The single-objective procedures include a greedy-based objective function (GR procedure) and a merged objective function (DR_IT_GR procedure). The procedures show a similar performance when applied on a small network, whereas in a real system, the results show that (1)the IT-based method can be effectively used as a filtering technique; (2)the DR_IT_GR procedure outperforms the other multiobjective ones; and (3)the GR procedure is very efficient in finding the Pareto extreme solutions.

Optimizing Locations for Chlorine Booster Stations in Small Water Distribution Networks	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT												In this paper, an index-based approach is proposed to locate chlorine booster stations in a water distribution network (DN). Chlorination is a common practice for secondary disinfection, essential for protection against microbiological regrowth and contaminant intrusion. However, higher levels of free residual chlorine (FRC) may lead to unwanted disinfectant by-products (DBPs) and taste and odor complaints. Booster chlorination can be used to maintain minimum levels of FRC. This requires proper selection of booster locations. The approach proposed here uses a generic hydraulic and water quality modeling software programmers' toolkit to predict FRC and total trihalomethanes (TTHMs) converted, thereafter, into a water quality index (WQI). A heuristic algorithm maximum covering location problem (MCLP) used in optimization maximizes WQI. TTHM is converted into trihalomethane (THM) species using quadratic optimization, then to cancer and noncancer risk potentials. Finally, the required number of booster stations is recommended based on a trade-off analysis of risk potentials, WQI, and the life cycle cost of booster chlorination. For proof of concept, case studies are conducted in a hypothetical and a municipal DN.

J	Chen, HJ; Zhang, XY; Demars, C; Zhang, MH				Chen, Huajin; Zhang, Xuyang; Demars, Christopher; Zhang, Minghua			Numerical simulation of agricultural sediment and pesticide runoff: RZWQM and PRZM comparison	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Agricultural sediment and pesticide runoff is a widespread ecological and human health concern. Numerical simulation models, such as Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) and Pesticide Root Zone Model (PRZM), have been increasingly used to quantify off-site agricultural pollutant movement. However, RZWQM has been criticized for its inability to simulate sedimentation processes. The recent incorporation of the sedimentation module of Groundwater Loading Effects of Agricultural Management Systems has enabled RZWQM to simulate sediment and sediment-associated pesticides. This study compares the sediment and pesticide transport simulation performance of the newly released RZWQM and PRZM using runoff data from 2 alfalfa fields in Davis, California. A composite metric (based on coefficient of determination, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, index of agreement, and percent bias) was developed and employed to ensure robust, comprehensive assessment of model performance. Results showed that surface water runoff was predicted reasonably well (absolute percent bias <31%) by RZWQM and PRZM after adjusting important hydrologic parameters. Even after calibration, underestimation bias (-89% <= PBIAS <= -36%) for sediment yield was observed in both models. This might be attributed to PRZM's incorrect distribution of input water and uncertainty in RZWQM's runoff erosivity coefficient. Moreover, the underestimation of sediment might be less if the origin of measured sediment was considered. Chlorpyrifos losses were simulated with reasonable accuracy especially for Field A (absolute PBIAS <= 22%), whereas diuron losses were underestimated to a great extent (-98% <= PBIAS <= -65%) in both models. This could be attributed to the underprediction of herbicide concentration in the top soil due to the limitations of the instantaneous equilibrium sorption model as well as the high runoff potential of herbicide formulated as water-dispersible granules. RZWQM and PRZM partitioned pesticides into the water and sediment phases similarly. According to model predictions, the majority of pesticide loads were carried via the water phase. On the basis of this study, both RZWQM and PRZM performed well in predicting runoff that carried highly adsorptive pesticides on an event basis, although the more physically based RZWQM is recommended when field-measured soil hydraulic properties are available.

Rainfall and streamflow sensor network design: a review of applications, classification, and a proposed framework	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Sensors and sensor networks play an important role in decision-making related to water quality, operational streamflow forecasting, flood early warning systems, and other areas. In this paper we review a number of existing applications and analyse a variety of evaluation and design procedures for sensor networks with respect to various criteria. Most of the existing approaches focus on maximising the observability and information content of a variable of interest. From the context of hydrological modelling only a few studies use the performance of the hydrological simulation in terms of output discharge as a design criterion. In addition to the review, we propose a framework for classifying the existing design methods, and a generalised procedure for an optimal network design in the context of rainfall-runoff hydrological modelling.

Predicting saturation-excess runoff distribution with a lumped hillslope model: SWAT-HS	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Saturation-excess runoff is the major runoff mechanism in humid well-vegetated areas where infiltration rates often exceed rainfall intensity. Although the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is one of the most widely used models, it predicts runoff based mainly on soil and land use characteristics, and is implicitly an infiltration-excess runoff type of model. Previous attempts to incorporate the saturation-excess runoff mechanism in SWAT fell short due to the inability to distribute water from one hydrological response unit to another. This paper introduces a modified version of SWAT, referred to as SWAT-Hillslope (SWAT-HS). This modification improves the simulation of saturation-excess runoff by redefining hydrological response units based on wetness classes and by introducing a surface aquifer with the ability to route interflow from drier to wetter wetness classes. Mathematically, the surface aquifer is a nonlinear reservoir that generates rapid subsurface stormflow as the water table in the surface aquifer rises. The SWAT-HS model was tested in the Town Brook watershed in the upper reaches of the West Branch Delaware River in the Catskill region of New York, USA. SWAT-HS predicted discharge well with a Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency of 0.68 and 0.87 for daily and monthly time steps. Compared to the original SWAT model, SWAT-HS predicted less surface runoff and groundwater flow and more lateral flow. The saturated areas predicted by SWAT-HS were concentrated in locations with a high topographic index and were in agreement with field observations. With the incorporation of topographic characteristics and the addition of the surface aquifer, SWAT-HS improved streamflow simulation and gave a good representation of saturated areas on the dates that measurements were available. SWAT-HS is expected to improve water quality model predictions where the location of the surface runoff matters.																	0885-6087	1099-1085				JUN 15	2017	31	12					2226	2243		10.1002/hyp.11179								WOS:000402884400007

Electrical resistivity imaging of hydrologic flow through surface coal mine valley fills with comparison to other landforms	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Surface coal mining has altered land cover, near-surface geologic structure, and hydrologic processes of large areas in central Appalachia, USA. These alterations are associated with changes in water quality such as elevated total-dissolved solids, which is usually measured via its surrogate, specific conductance (SC). The SC of valley fill effluent streams is a function of fill construction methods, materials, and age; yet hydrologic studies that relate these variables to water quality are sparse due to the difficulty of conducting traditional hydrologic studies in mined landscapes. We used electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) to visualize the subsurface geologic structure and hydrologic flow paths within a valley fill. ERI is a noninvasive geophysical technique that maps spatiotemporal changes in resistivity of the subsurface. We paired ERI with artificial rainfall experiments to track infiltrated water as it moved through the valley fill. Results indicate that ERI can be used to identify subsurface geologic structure and track advancing wetting fronts or preferential flow paths. Our results suggest that the upper portion of the fill contains significant fines, whereas the deeper profile is primarily large rocks and void spaces. Water tended to pond on the surface of compacted areas until it reached preferential flow paths, where it appeared to infiltrate quickly down to >15m depth in 75min. ERI applications can improve understanding of how fill construction techniques influence subsurface water movement, and in turn may aid in the development of valley fill construction methods to reduce water quality effects.

Effect of aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) on recovered stormwater quality variability	WATER RESEARCH												Aquifer Storage and Recovery (ASR) is increasingly being considered as a means of reusing urban stormwater to supplement available urban water resources. Storage of stormwater in an aquifer has been shown to affect water quality but it has also been claimed that storage will also decrease the stormwater quality variability making for improved predictability and management. This study is the first to document the changes in stormwater quality variability as a result of subsurface storage at four full scale ASR sites using advanced statistical techniques. New methods to examine water quality are required as data is often highly left censored and so traditional measures of variability such as the coefficient of variation are inappropriate. It was observed that for some water quality parameters (most notably E. coli) there was a marked improvement of water quality and a significant decrease in variability at all sites. This means that aquifer storage prior to engineered treatment systems may be advantageous in terms of system design to avoid over engineering. For other parameters such as metal(loids)s and nutrients the trend was less clear due to the numerous processes occurring during storage leading to an increase in variability, especially for geogenic metals and metalloids such as iron and arsenic. Depending upon the specific water quality parameters and end use, use of ASR may not have a dampening effect on stormwater quality variability. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Wu, BL; Wang, XCC; Dzakpasu, M				Wu, Baolei; Wang, Xiaochang C.; Dzakpasu, Mawuli			Genetic characterization of fecal impacts of seagull migration on an urban scenery lake	WATER RESEARCH												A microbial source tracking scheme was devised to differentiate fecal impacts of seagulls from that of human activities on an urban scenery lake in southern China, which is a major wintering ground for the black-headed seagull. Fecal contamination of seagulls was characterized by quantifying a novel genetic marker targeting Catellicoccus marimamalium. Quantification of this marker was combined with those of Escherichia coli, human-associated Bacteroidales, thermophilic Campylobacter and Helicobacter. Findings of a year-round study indicate that C marimamalium levels correlated strongly, both spatially and temporally, with seagull migration. A steady increase in C marimammalium concentrations was recorded between October 2014 and March 2015, which peaked at about 5-log copies/100 mL in January. However, a background level of about 2.1-log copies/100 mL was noticeable from April through September when seagulls were absent, probably due to other host sources or secondary habitats for C marimammalium. Seagull migration also caused an apparent elevation of E. coli concentrations (86% and 60%, respectively for qPCR and culture method; p < 0.001) as well as Campylobacter and Helicobacter (66% and 68%, respectively; p < 0.001). Nonetheless, in contrast to the declining levels of E. coli, Campylobacter and Helicobacter, the human-specific Bacteroidales marginally increased in the seagull-absent season, indicating a limited influence of human activities, compared with seagull migration, on the seasonal variations in microbial water quality of the lake. The elevated levels of FIB, Campylobacter and Helicobacter along with C marimammalium may imply human health risk of the lake water due to seasonal seagull migration, which requires further investigation for risk assessment.

In relation to this, socio-economic development can only be considered sustainable when the ecosystem is under normal carrying capacity. However, accurately evaluating the environmental carrying capacity and efficiently remediating related problems are difficult to carry out in the absence of systematic methods to identify the influencing factors. Hence, this study established an integrated identification method, including the selection and horizontal independence test of potential factors as well as the identification of control factors and water quality effects. We identified the control factors and proposed a series of remediation measures based on the survey and statistical data from 1982 to 2015 in Qingdao and its coastal area. Results indicated 21 control factors, five of which were high-level control factors in Qingdao offshore, namely, wastewater discharge, livestock production, ammonia nitrogen emission, river runoff, sewage treatment. In addition, reclamation area was identified as significant pollution contributors in the Jiaozhou Bay. These control factors showed that the carrying capacity for land-based pollutant emissions and shoreline destruction in the Qingdao offshore is generally overloaded, especially in Jiaozhou Bay. The reduction of land-based pollutants and watershed restoration projects, such as the removal of artificial dikes and the rehabilitation of its natural shoreline, are thus needed to resolve this problem in Jiaozhou Bay. Meanwhile, only differential reduction approaches on land-based pollutants are needed for other coastal waters in Qingdao, such as adjusting the industrial structure, enhancing investments in sewage treatment facilities.

J	Cramer, M; Kloth, S; Tranckner, J				Cramer, Michael; Kloth, Stephan; Traenckner, Jens			Optimization and fouling mechanism of a thermophile submerged MBR (TSMBR) pilot plant for wastewater treatment in a paper mill	JOURNAL OF WATER PROCESS ENGINEERING												The state-of-art is a mesophilic treatment of wastewater in paper mills without reuse due to the high water quality requirements. Thermophilic biological treatment could save a large amount of thermal energy, but the major obstacle of a reuse are the poor sludge settling properties under thermophile conditions, leading to insufficient water quality if conventional gravimetric phase separation is applied. MBR technology is a promising alternative which allows a recirculation of treated water for improving the water and energy footprint. So far, there is only limited experience with thermophilic MBR at the time. In this study, a thermophilic MBR with a submerged membrane (TSMBR) was operated to treat wastewater from a paper mill with a COD concentration of 25-30 g L-1. The TSMBR was integrated into the operational process of the paper mill. Research questions were the influence of suspended solids, food to microorganism ratio (F/M ratio), cross-flow-aeration and filtration flux to the fouling of the membrane. Applying the critical flux concept, optimal operating conditions and costs for a future economic full-scale implementation could be derived. Key results are inter alia a sub-critical flux of below 10 L m(-2) h(-1) is recommended for long-time durability of the membrane for minimizing the irreversible fouling and the permeability decrease. A chemical cleaning does not change the critical flux, but improves the permeability of the membrane significantly. of suspended solids of above 14 g L-1. A stable process and cleaning could only be ensured by a F/M ratio of below 0.4 g(COD) g(MLSS)(-1) d(-1). Higher values result in an increased cake layer formation and intensive foaming.

Therefore, it is important to develop an environmentally friendly and economic method to treat palm oil mill effluent (POME). The main aim of this study was to investigate the potential of Lemna minor (L. minor) and Chlamydomonas incerta (C. incerta) with catalog number (KR349061) for the bioremediation of POME in order to achieve higher water quality standard and further produce organic fertilizer. In this study, three different experiments were conducted by using L. minor, followed by addition of C. incerta, and further combination of L. minor and C. incerta. The concentration of nitrate (NO3-), ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3-N), phosphate (PO4-P), Electrical Conductivity (EC) and salinity in produced fertilizer were measured, and then they were compared with two current commercial fertilizers. Growth factors such as growth rates, average number of leaf and height of root of L. minor of plants were also determined. The results showed that the microalgae and macrophytes were capable of removing only 4.4% of chemical organic demand (COD) whereas the respective maximum removal rates for NO3-, NH3-N, and PO4-P were 12.5%, 11.3%, and 70.47%. Also, the average differences of NO3-, NH3-N, and PO4-P concentrations in produced fertilizer in comparison with two current commercial fertilizers were 95, 39.5, and 62.5 mg/g, respectively. The results of this study revealed that only L. minor was converted into fertilizer. This study elaborated that both L. minor and C. incerta are able to remove a part of organic pollutants and nutrients from POME.

Impacts of Heronries on Water Quality as Evaluated through Escherichia coli and Fecal Sterol Analyses	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												The authors used fecal sterol analysis to determine the potential contribution of E. coli from heronries to waterbodies in east-central Texas. They analyzed E. coli and fecal sterol concentrations in samples from four heronries during the breeding seasons in 2011-2013. The highest E. coli concentrations were in water samples from the two largest heronries established directly over water. The main sterols in fecal samples were cholesterol and stigmasterol, and in water, cholesterol, coprostanol, and cholestanol. Total sterols ranged 979 to 5838 ng/g dry weight in fecal samples, and 13 to 600 ng/L in water samples. There was a positive correlation between E. coli and the sum of bird sterols in water exposed directly to fecal deposition, but not in water surrounding the heronries. The authors found a strong association between E. coli and stigmasterol, suggesting that the presence of stigmasterol in water could be used for predicting E. coli sources from heronries nesting close to waterbodies.

The physicochemical characterization of water samples using different parameters was conducted for water quality monitoring. Heavy metal analysis was performed to quantify the toxic components present in water samples. It was observed that although the water samples of all the sites demonstrated mutagenic as well as genotoxic activity, the effect was quite significant with the water samples from sites containing water from river Satluj, i.e., site 1 (upstream Satluj river), site 2 (Satluj river) and site 3 (reservoir Satluj). The high level of pollution due to industrial effluents and agricultural run-off at these sites may engender the genotoxicity and mutagenicity of water samples.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				JUN	2017	7	3					1107	1115		10.1007/s13201-015-0347-2								WOS:000411085600006

Hydrochemical data from 19 groundwater and 7 rock samples have been used to evaluate water quality, water types, and sources of various ions as well as origin of the groundwater. The study results show that the quality of groundwater from the area is generally not good due to their fluoride (F-), bicarbonate (HCO3-) and electrical conductivity (EC) concentrations. The F- contents of the groundwater have values as high as 1.97 mg/ L, with 53 % of the groundwater having concentrations of F- exceeding the WHO recommended allowable limits. These high F- values have the potential of causing serious health problems such as kidney failure, dental and skeletal fluorosis, reproductive problem and reduction in intelligent quotient of consumers. A plot of Gibbs diagram reveals that rock weathering and precipitation are the major hydrogeochemical processes regulating the water chemistry of the study area. Petrographic thin-section analyses of rock samples identify minerals present to be muscovite, plagioclase feldspars, quartz, sericite and iron oxide. Stable isotope (O-18 and H-2) composition of the waters reveals that most of the groundwater is likely to be recharged from local precipitation, indicating their meteoric origin. Some samples, however, showed considerable evaporation.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				JUN	2017	7	3					1117	1129		10.1007/s13201-015-0348-1								WOS:000411085600007

Application of multivariate statistical technique for hydrogeochemical assessment of groundwater within the Lower Pra Basin, Ghana	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Multivariate statistical technique and hydrogeo-chemical approach were employed for groundwater assessment within the Lower Pra Basin. The main objective was to delineate the main processes that are responsible for the water chemistry and pollution of groundwater within the basin. Fifty-four (54) (No) boreholes were sampled in January 2012 for quality assessment. PCA using Varimax with Kaiser Normalization method of extraction for both rotated space and component matrix have been applied to the data. Results show that Spearman's correlation matrix of major ions revealed expected process-based relationships derived mainly from the geochemical processes, such as ion-exchange and silicate/aluminosilicate weathering within the aquifer. Three main principal components influence the water chemistry and pollution of groundwater within the basin. The three principal components have accounted for approximately 79% of the total variance in the hydrochemical data. Component 1 delineates the main natural processes (water-soil-rock interactions) through which groundwater within the basin acquires its chemical characteristics, Component 2 delineates the incongruent dissolution of silicate/aluminosilicates, while Component 3 delineates the prevalence of pollution principally from agricultural input as well as trace metal mobilization in groundwater within the basin. The loadings and score plots of the first two PCs show grouping pattern which indicates the strength of the mutual relation among the hydrochemical variables. In terms of proper management and development of groundwater within the basin, communities, where intense agriculture is taking place, should be monitored and protected from agricultural activities. especially where inorganic fertilizers are used by creating buffer zones. Monitoring of the water quality especially the water pH is recommended to ensure the acid neutralizing potential of groundwater within the basin thereby, curtailing further trace metal mobilization processes in groundwater within the basin.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				JUN	2017	7	3					1131	1150		10.1007/s13201-017-0540-6								WOS:000411085600008

Produced water re-injection in a non-fresh water aquifer with geochemical reaction, hydrodynamic molecular dispersion and adsorption kinetics controlling: model development and numerical simulation	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												An improved produced water reinjection (PWRI) model that incorporates filtration, geochemical reaction, molecular transport, and mass adsorption kinetics was developed to predict cake deposition and injectivity performance in hydrocarbon aquifers in Nigeria oil fields. Thus, the improved PWRI model considered contributions of geochemical reaction, adsorption kinetics, and hydrodynamic molecular dispersion mechanism to alter the injectivity and deposition of suspended solids on aquifer wall resulting in cake formation in pores during PWRI and transport of active constituents in hydrocarbon reservoirs. The injectivity decline and cake deposition for specific case studies of hydrocarbon aquifers in Nigeria oil fields were characterized with respect to its well geometry, lithology, and calibrations data and simulated in COMSOL multiphysics software environment. The PWRI model was validated by comparisons to assessments of previous field studies based on data and results supplied by operator and regulator. The results of simulation showed that PWRI performance was altered because of temporal variations and declinations of permeability, injectivity, and cake precipitation, which were observed to be dependent on active adsorption and geochemical reaction kinetics coupled with filtration scheme and molecular dispersion. From the observed results and findings, transition time tr to cake nucleation and growth were dependent on aquifer constituents, well capacity, filtration coefficients, particle-to-grain size ratio, water quality, and more importantly, particle-to-grain adsorption kinetics. Thus, the results showed that injectivity decline and permeability damage were direct contributions of geochemical reaction, hydrodynamic molecular diffusion, and adsorption kinetics to the internal filtration mechanism, which are largely dependent on the initial conditions of concentration of active constituents of produced water and aquifer capacity.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				JUN	2017	7	3					1169	1189		10.1007/s13201-016-0490-4								WOS:000411085600011

The advection dispersion equation (ADE) is the government equation on pollutant transmission in the river. Modeling the pollution transmission includes numerical solution of the ADE and estimating the longitudinal dispersion coefficient (LDC). In this paper, a novel approach is proposed for numerical modeling of the pollution transmission in rivers. It is related to use both finite volume method as numerical method and artificial neural network (ANN) as soft computing technique together in simulation. In this approach, the result of the ANN for predicting the LDC was considered as input parameter for the numerical solution of the ADE. To validate the model performance in real engineering problems, the pollutant transmission in Severn River has been simulated. Comparison of the final model results with measured data of the Severn River showed that the model has good performance. Predicting the LDC by ANN model significantly improved the accuracy of computer simulation of the pollution transmission in river.

For stochastic FDCs, 7-day FDCs for 10, 20-, 50- and 100-year return periods were derived for extraction of discharge values at every 5% probability of exceedance. FDCs derived using the first approach show high probability of exceedance (5-75%) for the same discharge values. Furthermore, discharge values of 60-day mean are higher than those derived using daily, 7-, and 30-day mean values. The discharge values of 95% probability of exceedance (Q95) derived from 7Q10 (ranges from 2.04 to 5.56 cumec) and 7Q100 (ranges from 3.4 to 31.48 cumec) FDCs using the second approach are found more appropriate as EFs during drought/low flow and normal precipitation years.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				JUN	2017	7	3					1283	1293		10.1007/s13201-016-0486-0								WOS:000411085600021

Point sources like septic systems and broken sewage systems also contribute to water pollution. Pollution of groundwater by nitrate from 19 shallow wells was studied in a typical agricultural region, middle Podravina, in northwest Croatia. The concentration of nitrate ranged from <0.1 to 367 mg/l in water from wells, and 29.8 % of 253 total samples were above maximum acceptable value of 50 mg/l (MAV). Among regions R1-R6, there was no statistically significant difference in nitrate concentrations (F = 1.98; p = 0.15) during the years 2002-2007. Average concentrations of nitrate in all 19 wells for all the analyzed years were between recommended limit value of 25 mg/l (RLV) and MAV except in 2002 (concentration was under RLV). The results of the repeated measures ANOVA showed statistically significant differences between the wells at the point source distance (proximity) of <10 m, compared to the wells at the point source distance of [20 m (F = 10.6; p < 0.001). Average annual concentrations of nitrate during the years studied are not statistically different, but interaction between proximity and years is statistically significant (F = 2.07; p = 0.04). Results of k-means clustering confirmed division into four clusters according to the pollution. Principal component analysis showed that there is only one significant factor, proximity, which explains 91.6 % of the total variability of nitrate. Differences in water quality were found as a result of different environmental factors. These results will contribute to the implementation of the Nitrate Directive in Croatia and the EU.

Evaluation of water quality index for River Sabarmati, Gujarat, India	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												An attempt has been made to develop water quality index (WQI), using six water quality parameters pH, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, electrical conductivity, nitrate nitrogen and total coliform measured at three different stations along the Sabarmati river basin from the year 2005 to 2008. Rating scale is developed based on the tolerance limits of inland waters and health point of view. Weighted arithmetic water quality index method was used to find WQI along the stretch of the river basin. It was observed from this study that the impact of human activity and sewage disposal in the river was severe on most of the parameters. The station located in highly urban area showed the worst water quality followed by the station located in moderately urban area and lastly station located in a moderately rural area. It was observed that the main cause of deterioration in water quality was due to the high anthropogenic activities, illegal discharge of sewage and industrial effluent, lack of proper sanitation, unprotected river sites and urban runoff.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				JUN	2017	7	3					1349	1358		10.1007/s13201-015-0318-7								WOS:000411085600026

Usually, CBM operators need to pump [10 m(3) of water per day from one well, which depends on the aquifer characteristics, drainage and recharge pattern. In India, 32 CBM blocks have been awarded for exploration and production, out of which six blocks are commercially producing methane gas at 0.5 million metric standard cubic feet per day. Large amount of water is being produced from CBM producing blocks, but no specific information or data are available for geochemical properties of CBM-produced water and its suitable disposal or utilization options for better management. CBM operators are in infancy and searching for the suitable solutions for optimal management of produced water. CBM- and mine-produced water needs to be handled considering its physical and geochemical assessment, because it may have environmental as well as long-term impact on aquifer. Investigations were carried out to evaluate geochemical and hydrogeo-logical conditions of CBM blocks in Raniganj Basin. Totally, 15 water samples from CBM well head and nine water samples from mine disposal head were collected from Raniganj Basin. The chemical signature of produced water reveals high sodium and bicarbonate concentrations with low calcium and magnesium, and very low sulphate in CBM water. It is comprehend that CBM water is mainly of Na-HCO3 type and coal mine water is of Ca-Mg-SO4 and HCO3-Cl-SO4 type. The comparative studies are also carried out for CBM-and mine-produced water considering the geochemical properties, aquifer type, depth of occurrence and lithological formations. Suitable options like impounding, reverse osmosis, irrigation and industrial use after prerequisite treatments are suggested. However, use of this huge volume of CBM- and mine-produced water for irrigation or other beneficial purposes may require careful management based on water pH, EC, TDS, alkalinity, bicarbonate, sodium, fluoride, metals content and SAR values.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				JUN	2017	7	3					1359	1367		10.1007/s13201-015-0326-7								WOS:000411085600027

The use of Moringa oleifera seed as a natural coagulant for wastewater treatment and heavy metals removal	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Moringa oleifera (MO) is a multipurpose tree with considerable potential and its cultivation is currently being actively promoted in many developing countries. Seeds of this tropical tree contain water-soluble, positively charged proteins that act as an effective coagulant for water and wastewater treatment. Based on this, water quality of "Sungai baluk'' river was examined before and after the treatment using MO seed. MO seed exhibited high efficiency in the reduction and prevention of the bacterial growth in both wastewater and "Sungai baluk'' river samples. The turbidity was removed up to 85-94% and dissolved oxygen (DO) was improved from 2.58 +/- 0.01 to 4.00 +/- 0.00 mg/L. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biological oxygen demand ( BOD) were increased after the treatment from 99.5 +/- 0.71 to 164.0 +/- 2.83 mg/L for COD and from 48.00 +/- 0.42 to 76.65 +/- 2.33 mg/L for BOD, respectively. Nevertheless, there was no significant alteration of pH, conductivity, salinity and total dissolved solid after the treatment. Heavy metals such as Fe were fully eliminated, whereas Cu and Cd were successfully removed by up to 98%. The reduction of Pb was also achieved by up to 78.1%. Overall, 1% of MO seed cake was enough to remove heavy metals from the water samples. This preliminary laboratory result confirms the great potential of MO seed in wastewater treatment applications.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				JUN	2017	7	3					1369	1376		10.1007/s13201-016-0499-8								WOS:000411085600028

Hydrochemical characteristics and quality assessment of groundwater along the Manavalakurichi coast, Tamil Nadu, India	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The present study was carried out to find the groundwater quality of coastal aquifer along Manavalakurichi coast. For this study, a total of 30 groundwater samples were collected randomly from open wells and borewells. The concentration of major ions and other geochemical parameters in the groundwater were analyzed in the laboratory by adopting standard procedures suggested by the American Public Health Association. The order of the dominant cations in the study area was found to be Na+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > K+, whereas the sequence of dominant anions was Cl- > HCO3- > SO42-. The hydrogeochemical facies of the groundwater samples were studied by constructing piper trilinear diagram which revealed the evidence of saltwater intrusion into the study area. The obtained geochemical parameters were compared with the standard permissible limits suggested by the World Health Organization and Indian Standard Institution to determine the drinking water quality in the study area. The analysis suggests that the groundwater from the wells W25 and W26 is unsuitable for drinking. The suitability of groundwater for irrigation was studied by calculating percent sodium, sodium absorption ratio and residual sodium carbonate values. The Wilcox and USSL plots were also prepared. It was found that the groundwater from the stations W1, W25 and W26 is unfit for irrigation. The Gibbs plots were also sketched to study the mechanisms controlling the geochemical composition of groundwater in the study area.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				JUN	2017	7	3					1429	1438		10.1007/s13201-015-0325-8								WOS:000411085600033

To get the extent of the heavy metals contamination, groundwater samples were collected from 45 different locations in and around Goa mining area during the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. The concentration of heavy metals, such as lead, copper, manganese, zinc, cadmium, iron, and chromium, were determined using atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Most of the samples were found within limit except for Fe content during the monsoon season at two sampling locations which is above desirable limit, i.e., 300 mu g/L as per Indian drinking water standard. The data generated were used to calculate the heavy metal pollution index (HPI) for groundwater. The mean values of HPI were 1.5 in the monsoon season and 2.1 in the post-monsoon season, and these values are well below the critical index limit of 100.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				JUN	2017	7	3					1479	1485		10.1007/s13201-016-0430-3								WOS:000411085600038

Water samples were collected from the chosen sampling stations of the two reservoirs for every 4 months and analyzed as per APHA standard methods. The results obtained were compared with IS 10500 standards and found to be well within the prescribed values. Though the obtained values were well within the prescribed standard values, it was found that the water quality index, concentration of certain parameters such as calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium of the waters of Andra reservoir are higher than that of the Denkada anicut, and the concentration of nitrite was found to be higher in the water sample analyzed from Denkada anicut. Except silicon, all the other metals were found to be below the detection limits in the two reservoir waters. The reasons for the same were probed by the authors in the presented study. From the analysis reports, it was found that the water analyzed from the two reservoirs was fit for irrigation, agriculture, industrial and domestic purposes.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				JUN	2017	7	3					1497	1504		10.1007/s13201-015-0331-x								WOS:000411085600040

A combination of collection of monitored data, mathematical modeling, sensitivity, and uncertainty analysis has been done using the QUAL2Kw, a river quality model. The model was applied to simulate DO, BOD, total coliform, and total nitrogen at four monitoring stations, namely Palla, Old Delhi Railway Bridge, Nizamuddin, and Okhla for 10 years (October 1999-June 2009) excluding the monsoon seasons (July-September). The study period was divided into two parts: monthly average data from October 1999-June 2004 (45 months) were used to calibrate the model and monthly average data from October 2005-June 2009 (45 months) were used to validate the model. The R 2 for CBODf and TN lies within the range of 0.53-0.75 and 0.68-0.83, respectively. This shows that the model has given satisfactory results in terms of R 2 for CBODf, TN, and TC. Sensitivity analysis showed that DO, CBODf, TN, and TC predictions are highly sensitive toward headwater flow and point source flow and quality. Uncertainty analysis using Monte Carlo showed that the input data have been simulated in accordance with the prevalent river conditions.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				JUN	2017	7	3					1535	1559		10.1007/s13201-015-0311-1								WOS:000411085600043

Due to significant research, the NSZD conceptual model has evolved dramatically in recent years, and methanogenesis is now accepted as a dominant attenuation process (e.g., Lundegard and Johnson ; Ng et al. ). Most of the methane is generated within the pore space adjacent to LNAPL (Ng et al. ) from where it migrates through the unsaturated zone (e.g., Amos and Mayer ), where it is oxidized. While great progress has been made, there are still some important gaps in our understanding of NSZD. NSZD measurements provide little insight on which constituents are actually degrading; it is unclear which rate-limiting factors that can be manipulated to increase NSZD rates; and how longevity of the bulk LNAPL and its key constituents can be predicted. Various threads of literature were pursued to shed light on some of the questions listed above. Several processes that may influence NSZD or its measurement were identified: temperature, inhibition from acetate buildup, protozoa predation, presence of electron acceptors, inhibition from volatile hydrocarbons, alkalinity/pH, and the availability of nutrients can all affect methanogenesis rates, while factors such as moisture content and soil type can influence its measurement. The methanogenic process appears to have a sequenced utilization of the constituents or chemical classes present in the LNAPL due to varying thermodynamic feasibility, biodegradability, and effects of inhibition, but the bulk NSZD rate appears to remain quasi-zero order. A simplified version of the reactive transport model presented by Ng et al. has the potential to be a useful tool for predicting the longevity of key LNAPL constituents or chemical fractions, and of bulk LNAPL, but more work is needed to obtain key input parameters such as chemical classes and their biodegradation rates and any potential inhibitions.																	1069-3629	1745-6592				SUM	2017	37	3					62	81		10.1111/gwmr.12219								WOS:000411766700014

Decanter system as mechanical treatment for enhancing seawater feed quality at Sabiya power generation and water desalination plant	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												Long-term performance of power generation and water desalination equipment depends on proper seawater quality. At Sabiya power generation and water desalination plant (SPDP), the seawater quality is very high in turbidity because of high content of silt and sand. Currently, the quality of seawater at SPDP is causing some inconvenience to the operation and maintenance of the station's equipment. This paper is aimed at assessing the viability of enhancing seawater quality for thermal and membrane desalination processes at SPDP using the pilot-scale decanter centrifuge unit as mechanical treatment. This unit has the potential to substantially lower the silt and sand concentration to an acceptable level, allowing the use of seawater safely as feed for membrane and thermal desalination units, as well as for power generation equipment. The experimental results indicated that the decanter centrifuge system is a viable mechanical process for improving the quality of the SPDP seawater feed. The system was able to treat 100% of seawater feed, with a 99.6% availability. The separated silt and sand by the decanter centrifuge unit is coming out as a fine dry powder from the solid side compartment, which can be collected and transferred out of the SPDP station. In addition, the results showed that as flow increases, the power consumption decreases, which give an indication that the power consumption for treating seawater utilizing decanter centrifuge with a bigger capacity will be in an acceptable range.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				JUN	2017	80						53	60		10.5004/dwt.2017.20928								WOS:000410672300006

Impact of decreasing COD/N ratio on nitrogen removal and fouling in a membrane bioreactor for urban wastewater treatment	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												This research focused on the identification of the minimum COD/N ratio needed for the complete two-step denitrification process. Thus, to quantify the role of low COD/N ratios on nitrification and denitrification rates and on biological suspension filterability, experiments were carried out on a laboratory-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) with a nitrogen loading rate of 0.16 kg N m(-3) d(-1). The investigation was comprised of two COD/N ratios, 3.5 and 5, and two sludge retention times (SRTs), 40 and 60 d. The best nitrogen removal performances were obtained when working with a COD/N ratio of 5 and a SRT of 60 d; nitrification and denitrification were achieved with total nitrogen removal reaching 82%. Experimental results appeared in good agreement with activated sludge model no. 1 (ASM1) predictions. Nevertheless, the minimum COD/N according to ASM1 was found close to 6.3, underlining that the hydrolysis phenomenon was underestimated when working at high sludge retention. The MBR performances confirm that operation at low organic loading rates is a promising strategy for decreasing energy requirements, without hampering water quality (nitrogen removal). More specifically, it allowed a significant reduction of oxygen requirements for carbon biodegradation and lower suspended solids in the bioreactor even at high SRT, allowing easier control of membrane fouling.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				JUN	2017	80						121	132		10.5004/dwt.2017.21009								WOS:000410672300014

The current work focused mainly on the enhancement of disinfection efficiency of turbid wastewaters by the application of solar-based advanced oxidation processes. Inactivation of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis spores were evaluated in domestic wastewater at different turbidity levels. In total, 50 and 30 mg/L of hydrogen peroxide concentrations were used for solar/H2O2 and solar photo-Fenton processes, respectively. Results showed that E. coli removal by solar light process decreased significantly from a maximum of 4.24-log to a minimum of 1.38-log with increasing turbidity levels of 0.2, 30 and 150 nephelometric turbidity unit. However, with the application of solar/H2O2 and solar photo-Fenton processes, disinfection efficiencies increased and substantially higher E. coli removals were obtained. The synergistic effect of solar light and hydroxyl radicals overcame the adverse effect of turbidity. Inactivation levels of B. subtilis spores did not change significantly by the application of solar-based advanced oxidation processes. The best E. coli inactivation level in turbid wastewaters was achieved with solar photo-Fenton process.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				JUN	2017	80						149	155		10.5004/dwt.2017.21003								WOS:000410672300017

Recent developments in aqueous phase bromate (BrO3-) species treatment using adsorption, reduction, and ion-exchange processes	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												Recently, bromate (BrO3-) presence in the drinking water sources and its health-related concerns (e.g., carcinogenic) has initiated a lot of attention both within the regulatory bodies across the globe (such as WHO, US EPA, EU, etc.) and also within the scholarly community that look for efficient bromate removal techniques to meet the desired bromate water quality standards. Bromate species is typically formed during disinfection-ozonation of bromide containing water. Considering its carcinogenic and mutagenic threat toward human health, several recent research studies have investigated different processes for efficient bromate removal from the aqueous phase under a varying set of conditions and also report the optimum process variables. In this review paper, we have presented and summarized findings from the respective recent work on bromate removal techniques and have also discussed the effect of various process variables on bromate removal efficiency. The adsorption process is noted to be the most common and widely studied technique. Some of the adsorbent materials used included activated carbon, both unmodified and modified. The respective adsorbent samples are noted to have varying specific surface area, pore size, and surface morphology. In most studies, the effect of pH, initial bromate concentration, contact time, temperature, adsorbent dose, mixing speed, and coexisting ions was investigated to get optimum bromate removal. The adsorption equilibria and kinetics were mainly predicted by Langmuir/Freundlich isotherms and pseudo-second-order models, respectively. Also, the Donnan dialysis and electrodialysis ion-exchange processes removed bromate ions to acceptable concentrations. Bromate reduction can also be achieved using advanced reduction processes where ultraviolet light has been used as an activating agent and mainly sulfite as the reducing agent. Furthermore, chemical reduction, electrochemical reduction, and bio-reduction-based bromate removal processes are also discussed. The reduction-based processes indicated the formation of different reduced species including bromine. The ferrous-based reduction processes are noted to be very effective and several variations of ferrous-based technologies including adsorption and reduction processes are presented and discussed. In summary, this review work indicates a very positive development in the respective area of study, that is, bromate removal from the concerned aqueous streams, and hopefully will also serve as a focal point for further scientific innovations and endeavour for a better human health.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				JUN	2017	80						255	267		10.5004/dwt.2017.20893								WOS:000410672300028

Slow sand filtration possesses a good capacity for cyanobacteria removal and is a simple alternative to more expensive treatments. However, high cyanobacteria concentrations can correspond to an operational problem for slow sand filters by reducing the filter running time, and therefore rough filtration is necessary. In this study, two similar upflow slow sand filters were used to evaluate C. raciborskii removal. Water with 9.1 x 10(5) cells/mL was used and an average of 99% of cells were removed. Nevertheless, average concentrations of 1.4 x 10(4) and 2.1 x 10(4) cells/mL were observed after filtration, and this could continue to act as a problem for water treatment. The system also indicated good results in terms of removing total coliforms, colour and turbidity. The average turbidity was below 1.0 NTU, which is the maximum value permitted by Brazilian regulations and WHO recommendations. The major advantage of the upflow slow sand filter involved the high removal of C. raciborskii without compromising the running time of the filter with the filters operating for almost 80 days without the use of rough filters. However, it is necessary to use a complementary treatment process to achieve better water quality results.				de Souza, Fernando/C-9840-2016	de Souza, Fernando/0000-0002-4542-7695												1944-3994	1944-3986				JUN	2017	79						1	8		10.5004/dwt.2017.20817								WOS:000408477000001

Here, the two-dimensional (2D) finite volume hydrodynamic models for the prediction of nutrients are developed. The model is based on the mass balance equation including advection and diffusion transport and chemical and biological transformation considering the impact of inflowing river and climate change. The model is formulated to simulate nutrients such as Amonia-Nitrogen (NH3-N), Nitrate (NO3-N) or overall Total Nitrogen (TN), Phosphorus (PO43-) or TP, Dissolved Oxygen (DO) and Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) and prediction of spatial and temporal distributions of concentration of each parameter in the Peer-bazar estuaries leading to the Anzali International Wetland. Ten points of the Peer-bazar River were studied during an 18-month period from June 2014 to December 2015. The simulation and numerical analysis of water quality parameters were conducted in a 2-dimensional approach using the geometric and topographic data and imposing boundary conditions. This research used the software developed by the author, FLOW-3D mathematical model, and HEC-RAS for simulation and qualitative evaluation of the river. Results revealed that the mean concentration of phosphorous, nitrogen and TDS exceeded the permissible limits reported by the European Directive 80/778/EEC and OECD and USEPA standards. Therefore, water of the region is subject to the advanced eutrophic conditions. Simulation predictions showed that the variation in TDS and nutrients contents will increase in the next coming years and the region will reach to the stable conditions. Using regression, a relationship between EC and TDS was obtained in the next step.

A theoretically consistent stochastic cascade for temporal disaggregation of intermittent rainfall	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Generating fine-scale time series of intermittent rainfall that are fully consistent with any given coarse-scale totals is a key and open issue in many hydrological problems. We propose a stationary disaggregation method that simulates rainfall time series with given dependence structure, wet/dry probability, and marginal distribution at a target finer (lower-level) time scale, preserving full consistency with variables at a parent coarser (higher-level) time scale. We account for the intermittent character of rainfall at fine time scales by merging a discrete stochastic representation of intermittency and a continuous one of rainfall depths. This approach yields a unique and parsimonious mathematical framework providing general analytical formulations of mean, variance, and autocorrelation function (ACF) for a mixed-type stochastic process in terms of mean, variance, and ACFs of both continuous and discrete components, respectively. To achieve the full consistency between variables at finer and coarser time scales in terms of marginal distribution and coarse-scale totals, the generated lower-level series are adjusted according to a procedure that does not affect the stochastic structure implied by the original model. To assess model performance, we study rainfall process as intermittent with both independent and dependent occurrences, where dependence is quantified by the probability that two consecutive time intervals are dry. In either case, we provide analytical formulations of main statistics of our mixed-type disaggregation model and show their clear accordance with Monte Carlo simulations. An application to rainfall time series from real world is shown as a proof of concept. Plain Language Summary Rainfall is the main input to most hydrological systems. A wide range of studies concerning floods, water resources and water quality require characterization of rainfall inputs at fine time scales. This may be possible using empirical observations, but there is often a need to extend available data in terms of temporal resolution satisfying some additive property (i.e. that the sum of the values of consecutive variables within a period be equal to the corresponding coarse-scale amount). Hence, rainfall disaggregation models are required. Although there is substantial experience in stochastic disaggregation of rainfall to fine time scales, most modeling schemes existing in the literature are ad hoc techniques rather than consistent generalized methods. This is mainly due to the skewed distributions and the intermittent nature of the rainfall process at fine time scales, which are severe obstacles for the application of a theoretically consistent scheme to rainfall disaggregation. We propose a consistent disaggregation model that first generates lognormal time series of rainfall depths based on a random cascade structure. Then, such time series are multiplied by binary sequences (i.e., rainfall occurrences) to obtain intermittent rainfall time series with known summary statistics.

Usually, they cope with instability problems by adopting computationally expensive small time steps. However, some simulators use fixed computation time steps and hence do not have the flexibility to do so. This paper presents a novel quasi-analytical solution for CSTR-based water quality simulators of an unsteady system. The robustness of the new method is compared with the commonly used fourth-order Runge-Kutta methods, the Euler method and three versions of the SWAT model (SWAT2012, SWAT-TCEQ, and ESWAT). The performance of each method is tested for different hypothetical experiments. Besides the hypothetical data, a real case study is used for comparison. The growth factors we derived as stability measures for the different methods and the R-factor-considered as a consistency measure-turned out to be very useful for determining the most robust method. The new method outperformed all the numerical methods used in the hypothetical comparisons. The application for the Zenne River (Belgium) shows that the new method provides stable and consistent BOD simulations whereas the SWAT2012 model is shown to be unstable for the standard daily computation time step. The new method unconditionally simulates robust solutions. Therefore, it is a reliable scheme for CSTR-based water quality simulators that use first-order reaction formulations.

J	Ahn, KH; Yellen, B; Steinschneider, S				Ahn, Kuk-Hyun; Yellen, Brian; Steinschneider, Scott			Dynamic linear models to explore time-varying suspended sediment-discharge rating curves	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												This study presents a new method to examine long-term dynamics in sediment yield using time-varying sediment-discharge rating curves. Dynamic linear models (DLMs) are introduced as a time series filter that can assess how the relationship between streamflow and sediment concentration or load changes over time in response to a wide variety of natural and anthropogenic watershed disturbances or long-term changes. The filter operates by updating parameter values using a recursive Bayesian design that responds to 1 day-ahead forecast errors while also accounting for observational noise. The estimated time series of rating curve parameters can then be used to diagnose multiscale (daily-decadal) variability in sediment yield after accounting for fluctuations in streamflow. The technique is applied in a case study examining changes in turbidity load, a proxy for sediment load, in the Esopus Creek watershed, part of the New York City drinking water supply system. The results show that turbidity load exhibits a complex array of variability across time scales. The DLM highlights flood event-driven positive hysteresis, where turbidity load remained elevated for months after large flood events, as a major component of dynamic behavior in the rating curve relationship. The DLM also produces more accurate 1 day-ahead loading forecasts compared to other static and time-varying rating curve methods. The results suggest that DLMs provide a useful tool for diagnosing changes in sediment-discharge relationships over time and may help identify variability in sediment concentrations and loads that can be used to inform dynamic water quality management.

Increased sediment oxygen flux in lakes and reservoirs: The impact of hypolimnetic oxygenation	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Hypolimnetic oxygenation is an increasingly common lake management strategy for mitigating hypoxia/anoxia and associated deleterious effects on water quality. A common effect of oxygenation is increased oxygen consumption in the hypolimnion and predicting the magnitude of this increase is the crux of effective oxygenation system design. Simultaneous measurements of sediment oxygen flux (J(O2)) and turbulence in the bottom boundary layer of two oxygenated lakes were used to investigate the impact of oxygenation on J(O2). Oxygenation increased J(O2) in both lakes by increasing the bulk oxygen concentration, which in turn steepens the diffusive gradient across the diffusive boundary layer. At high flow rates, the diffusive boundary layer thickness decreased as well. A transect along one of the lakes showed J(O2) to be spatially quite variable, with near-field and far-field J(O2) differing by a factor of 4. Using these in situ measurements, physical models of interfacial flux were compared to microprofile-derived J(O2) to determine which models adequately predict J(O2) in oxygenated lakes. Models based on friction velocity, turbulence dissipation rate, and the integral scale of turbulence agreed with microprofile-derived J(O2) in both lakes. These models could potentially be used to predict oxygenation-induced oxygen flux and improve oxygenation system design methods for a broad range of reservoir systems.

Determination of hyporheic travel time distributions and other parameters from concurrent conservative and reactive tracer tests by local-in-global optimization	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The complexity of hyporheic flow paths requires reach-scale models of solute transport in streams that are flexible in their representation of the hyporheic passage. We use a model that couples advective-dispersive in-stream transport to hyporheic exchange with a shape-free distribution of hyporheic travel times. The model also accounts for two-site sorption and transformation of reactive solutes. The coefficients of the model are determined by fitting concurrent stream-tracer tests of conservative (fluorescein) and reactive (resazurin/resorufin) compounds. The flexibility of the shape-free models give rise to multiple local minima of the objective function in parameter estimation, thus requiring global-search algorithms, which is hindered by the large number of parameter values to be estimated. We present a local-in-global optimization approach, in which we use a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo method as global-search method to estimate a set of in-stream and hyporheic parameters. Nested therein, we infer the shape-free distribution of hyporheic travel times by a local Gauss-Newton method. The overall approach is independent of the initial guess and provides the joint posterior distribution of all parameters. We apply the described local-in-global optimization method to recorded tracer breakthrough curves of three consecutive stream sections, and infer section-wise hydraulic parameter distributions to analyze how hyporheic exchange processes differ between the stream sections. Plain Language Summary Compounds, dissolved in river water, are transported along the river, but also to some extent into the sediments and back into the river. While being in the sediments, they may react. In reactive stream-tracer tests, we add easy-to-detect reactive compounds into a stream and measure time-series of concentration in the river further downstream. We present an approach of analyzing such tracer tests in a flexible, yet reliable manner, which also provides the uncertainty of our interpretation. This can be useful in the assessment of river-water quality				Cirpka, Olaf/C-7178-2008	Cirpka, Olaf/0000-0003-3509-4118; Knapp, Julia L.A./0000-0003-0885-7829												0043-1397	1944-7973				JUN	2017	53	6					4984	5001		10.1002/2017WR020734								WOS:000405997000029

Biogeochemical hotspots: Role of small water bodies in landscape nutrient processing	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Increased loading of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from agricultural and urban intensification has led to severe degradation of inland and coastal waters. Lakes, reservoirs, and wetlands (lentic systems) retain these nutrients, thus regulating their delivery to downstream waters. While the processes controlling N and P retention are relatively well-known, there is a lack of quantitative understanding of how these processes manifest across spatial scales. We synthesized data from 600 lentic systems around the world to gain insight into the relationship between hydrologic and biogeochemical controls on nutrient retention. Our results indicate that the first-order reaction rate constant, k [T-1], is inversely proportional to the hydraulic residence time, tau [T], across 6 orders of magnitude in residence time for total N, total P, nitrate, and phosphate. We hypothesized that the consistency of the relationship points to a strong hydrologic control on biogeochemical processing, and validated our hypothesis using a sediment-water model that links major nutrient removal processes with system size. Finally, the k-tau relationships were upscaled to the landscape scale using a wetland size-frequency distribution. Results suggest that small wetlands play a disproportionately large role in landscape-scale nutrient processing-50% of nitrogen removal occurs in wetlands smaller than 10(2.5) m(2) in our example. Thus, given the same loss in wetland area, the nutrient retention potential lost is greater when smaller wetlands are preferentially lost from the landscape. Our study highlights the need for a stronger focus on small lentic systems as major nutrient sinks in the landscape. Plain Language Summary Excess nutrient pollution from intensive fertilizer use and farming operations poses an increasing threat to water quality worldwide. Lakes, streams, and wetlands restrict the movement of nutrients, and thus protect downstream waters. We have a limited understanding, however, of how removal processes are affected by the size and type of the water body. Based on a synthesis of data from lakes, reservoirs, and wetlands worldwide, we found that smaller water bodies tend to have higher nutrient removal rates. We applied our findings to the landscape scale and found that for the same wetland area lost, the loss of small wetlands corresponds to a greater loss in wetland nutrient removal potential. Such findings are significant to wetland protection and restoration efforts, which have historically focused on maximizing total wetland area rather than on preserving a distribution of different wetlands sizes within a landscape.

Hydrogeochemical characteristics and groundwater contamination in the rapid urban development areas of Coimbatore, India	WATER RESOURCES AND INDUSTRY												The Singanallur Sub-basin is one of the major waterways and it supplies water to the Coimbatore city. Currently, it is vulnerable to pollution due to an increase of unplanned urban developments, industrial, and agricultural activities that compromise both the quality and quantity. In the present study three major hydrochemical facies were identified (mixed Ca-Mg-Cl, Ca-Cl, and Ca-HCO3). Irrigation suitability indexes are specifies that the groundwater in the areas has very high salinity hazard and low to medium alkali hazard. The mechanism controlling groundwater chemistry originally regulated by the evaporation process is dominated by reason of arid condition and anthropogenic activities existing throughout the region. The multivariate statistical analysis (Correlation analysis (CA), principal component analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA)) indicates, most of the variations are elucidated by the anthropogenic pollutant predominantly due to population growth, industrial effluents, and irrigation water return flow. This study demonstrates enhanced information of evolution of groundwater quality by integrating hydrochemical data and multivariate statistical methods are used to understand the factors influencing contamination due to natural and anthropogenic impacts.																	2212-3717					JUN	2017	17						26	33		10.1016/j.wri.2017.02.002								WOS:000405583700005

Channels are mostly in direct connection with the surrounding arable agricultural land and are exposed to different run-off, leaching and/or wind erosion processes. Close to urban areas, some channel sections serve as recipients of unrefined sewage and industrial waste waters. Water flows and velocities, as well as the transportable capacity of fluvial materials (sediments) are relatively low. This, in combination with other natural and anthropogenic impacts, contributes to sediment generation in the drainage channel network. Based on around 100 sediment samples from 46 channels, concentrations of primary nutrients (N, P and K) were elaborated in this study. Detected concentrations of macronutrients in the channel sediments (e.g. N 1-1.2%, P 100-265 and K 100-380 mg 100 g(-1)) exceeded their content in surrounding arable land by a few fold. Also, significantly higher nutrient concentrations (in average by 50%) were detected in downstream (vs. upstream) channel sections. An excessive presence of observed elements in channel sediments, due to interactive processes between water and sediment material, can adversely influence the water quality and life conditions for channel biota and caused other negative environmental impacts such as eutrophication. These results clearly confirm that the processes of nutrient accumulation in channel sediments are greater than those in the surrounding, mostly intensively arable land areas. The erosion of unprotected agricultural areas and sediment transport as the most important pollution pathways from the drainage basin to channel network may be essential factors responsible for detected condition of nutrient accumulation.

The model was based on hydraulic retention time, temperature, and monochloramine residual. The genetic algorithm and quasi-Newton optimization with a Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno Hessian updating method were combined into a hybrid parameter optimization scheme for robust calibration of NDMA model parameters. In order to test the applicability and the accuracy of the proposed model, NDMA concentration and water quality characteristics for 220 post-disinfection water samples collected between 2006 and 2016 were used. Good agreement between measured and estimated NDMA concentrations was observed by performing statistical analysis on an independent set of water sample data (R-2 = 0.93). This modeling approach has the potential to be used as a decision support tool in order to manage and improve the chloramine disinfection process.

Intensive, long-term studies on hydrological and hydrochemical parameters were monitored at 4 permanent dripping sites (VP1-VP4) in the Velika Pasica Cave (Slovenian) over a period from 2006 to 2013 concurrently with aquatic fauna sampling. Multivariate methods were applied to elucidate the relationship between the environmental conditions and the resident aquatic ecosystem. Seven major aquatic taxa were collected from the drips, with Copepoda being the dominant taxa; however, the spatial distribution and composition of these species varied distinctively at the 4 study sites; the drip water from different sites had distinct hydrological and hydrochemical characteristics. The most significant parameters influencing community composition were drip water discharge volume and NO3-ion content. The results indicate that hydrology and hydrochemistry significantly influence the microdistribution of aquatic fauna within the epikarstic aquifer.																	1936-0584	1936-0592				JUN	2017	10	4							UNSP e1835	10.1002/eco.1835								WOS:000403068700013

The effects of catchment and riparian forest quality on stream environmental conditions across a tropical rainforest and oil palm landscape in Malaysian Borneo	ECOHYDROLOGY												Freshwaters provide valuable habitat and important ecosystem services but are threatened worldwide by habitat loss and degradation. In Southeast Asia, rainforest streams are particularly threatened by logging and conversion to oil palm, but we lack information on the impacts of this on freshwater environmental conditions, and the relative importance of catchment versus riparian-scale disturbance. We studied 16 streams in Sabah, Borneo, including old-growth forest, logged forest, and oil palm sites. We assessed forest quality in riparian zones and across the whole catchment and compared it with stream environmental conditions including water quality, structural complexity, and organic inputs. We found that streams with the highest riparian forest quality were nearly 4 degrees C cooler, over 20 cm deeper, had over 40% less sand, greater canopy cover, more stored leaf litter, and wider channels than oil palm streams with the lowest riparian forest quality. Other variables were significantly related to catchment-scale forest quality, with streams in the highest quality forest catchments having 40% more bedrock and 20 times more dead wood, along with higher phosphorus, and lower nitrate-N levels compared to streams with the lowest catchment-scale forest quality. Although riparian buffer strips went some way to protecting waterways, they did not maintain fully forest-like stream conditions. In addition, logged forest streams still showed signs of disturbance 10-15 years after selective logging. Our results suggest that maintenance and restoration of buffer strips can help to protect healthy freshwater ecosystems but logging practices and catchment-scale forest management also need to be considered.

Sixteen multifunctional weirs were recently constructed in four river systems as part of the Four Rivers Restoration Project. In this study, three multifunctional weirs in the Geum River Basin were investigated to analyze the environmental effects of multifunctional weir operation on downstream flow. To determine seasonal vulnerability to drought, the basin was evaluated using the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). Furthermore, the downstream flow regime and the effect on water quality improvement of a coordinated dam-multifunctional weir operation controlled by: (a) a rainfall-runoff model; (b) a reservoir optimization model; and (c) a water quality model, were examined. A runoff estimate at each major location in the Geum River Basin was performed using the water quality model, and examined variation in downstream water quality depending on the operational scenario of each irrigation facility such as dams and weirs. Although the water quality was improved by the coordinated operation of the dams and weirs, when the discharged water quality is poor, the downstream water quality is not improved. Therefore, it is necessary to first improve the discharged water quality on the lower Geum River. Improvement of the water quality of main stream in the Geum River is important, but water quality from tributaries should also be improved. By applying the estimated runoff data to the reservoir optimization model, these scenarios will be utilized as basic parameters for assessing the optimal operation of the river.																	2073-4441					JUN	2017	9	6							423	10.3390/w9060423								WOS:000404559900061

In particular, significant hydropeaking operations by hydropower plants affect not only the downstream ecosystem but also the reservoir water temperature. This paper contributes to understanding that link. For this, we coupled a hydrodynamic model (Estuary, Lake and Coastal Ocean Model, ELCOM) to a grid-wide power system scheduling model. In a case study (Rapel, Chile), we observe the behavior of variables related to the flow regime and water quality (including sub-daily hydrologic alteration, seasonal and sub-daily thermal pollution of the downstream river, and vertical mixing in the reservoir). Additionally, we evaluate how environmental constraints (ECs) can improve the conditions for a wet, normal and dry water-type year. We found that the unconstrained operation produces a strong sub-daily hydrologic alteration as well as an intense thermal pollution of the outflow. We show that these effects can clearly be avoided when implementing ECs. The current (unconstrained) vertical mixing makes the reservoir susceptible to algae blooms. Implementing ECs may intensify the stratification in the reservoir near the dam in some scenarios. The grid-wide economic cost of Rapel's ECs is a modest 0.3%.

However, some industrial discharges contain a large amount of non-biodegradable organic matter, which cannot be treated properly in a conventional biological WWTP. This study aimed to investigate the characteristics and biodegradability of the wastewater organic matter contained in the industrial discharges and to examine the fate of the industrial discharges in a biological WWTP. In contrast to most previous studies targeting a specific group of organic compounds or traditional water quality indices, such as biological oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD), this study was purposed to quantify and characterize the biodegradable and nonbiodegradable fractions of the wastewater organic matter. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) fractionation tests and fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that the industrial discharge from dyeing or pulp mill factories contained more non-biodegradable soluble organic matter than did the domestic wastewater. Statistical analysis on the WWTPs' monitoring data indicated that the industrial discharge containing non-biodegradable soluble organic matter was not treated effectively in a biological WWTP, but was escaping from the system. Thus, industrial discharge that contained non-biodegradable soluble organic matter was a major factor in the decrease in biodegradability of the discharge, affecting the ultimate fate of wastewater organic matter in a biological WWTP. Further application of COD fractionation and fluorescence spectroscopy to wastewaters, with various industrial discharges, will help scientists and engineers to better design and operate a biological WWTP, by understanding the fate of wastewater organic matter.																	2073-4441					JUN	2017	9	6							409	10.3390/w9060409								WOS:000404559900047

Christian			Successes of Restoration and Its Effect on the Fish Community in a Freshwater Tidal Embayment of the Potomac River, USA	WATER												After a local wastewater treatment plant significantly reduced phosphorus loading into a phytoplankton-dominated tributary of the Potomac River in the early 1980s, water quality and biological communities were monitored bi-weekly from April to September. After a 10-year time-lag, submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), once abundant in this freshwater tidal embayment, returned to the area in 1993. After additional reductions in nitrogen load starting in 2000, the system switched to an SAV-dominated state in 2005. Fish abundance did not change during these distinct phase changes, but the fish community structure did. Increases in SAV provided refuge and additional spawning substrate for species with adhesive eggs such as Banded Killifish (Fundulus diaphanus), which is now the most abundant species in the embayment. Other changes observed were a decrease in the relative contribution of open water dwelling species such as White Perch (Morone americana), and an increase of visual predators such as Largemouth Bass (Micropterus salmoides). The 30-year record of data from this Potomac River tributary has revealed important long-term trends that validate the effectiveness of initiatives to reduce excess nutrient inputs, and will aid in the continued management of the watershed and point-source inputs.																	2073-4441					JUN	2017	9	6							421	10.3390/w9060421								WOS:000404559900059

Future climate scenarios imply widespread permafrost degradation caused by an increase in air temperature, and the expected effect on permafrost hydrology is immense. This study aims at analyzing, and quantifying the daily water transfer in the largest Arctic river system, the Yenisei River in central Siberia, Russia, partially underlain by permafrost. The semi-distributed SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) hydrological model has been calibrated and validated at a daily time step in historical discharge simulations for the 2003-2014 period. The model parameters have been adjusted to embrace the hydrological features of permafrost. SWAT is shown capable to estimate water fluxes at a daily time step, especially during unfrozen periods, once are considered specific climatic and soils conditions adapted to a permafrost watershed. The model simulates average annual contribution to runoff of 263 millimeters per year (mm yr(-1)) distributed as 152 mm yr(-1) (58%) of surface runoff, 103 mm yr(-1) (39%) of lateral flow and 8 mm yr(-1) (3%) of return flow from the aquifer. These results are integrated on a reduced basin area downstream from large dams and are closer to observations than previous modeling exercises.				sauvage, sabine/P-1742-2015	sauvage, sabine/0000-0002-6360-1036; Tananaev, Nikita/0000-0003-2997-0169; Teisserenc, Roman/0000-0002-2440-040X												2073-4441					JUN	2017	9	6							418	10.3390/w9060418								WOS:000404559900056

Advancing Water Footprint Assessment Research: Challenges in Monitoring Progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 6	WATER												This special issue is a collection of recent papers in the field of Water Footprint Assessment (WFA), an emerging area of research focused on the analysis of freshwater use, scarcity, and pollution in relation to consumption, production, and trade. As increasing freshwater scarcity forms a major risk to the global economy, sustainable management of water resources is a prerequisite to development. We introduce the papers in this special issue by relating them to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) number 6 of the United Nations, the goal on water. We will particularly articulate how each paper drives the understanding needed to achieve target 6.3 on water quality and pollution and target 6.4 on water-use efficiency and water scarcity. Regarding SDG 6, we conclude that it lacks any target on using green water more efficiently, and while addressing efficiency and sustainability of water use, it lacks a target on equitable sharing of water. The latter issue is receiving limited attention in research as well. By primarily focusing on water-use efficiency in farming and industries at the local level, to a lesser extent to using water sustainably at the level of total water systems (like drainage basins, aquifers), and largely ignoring issues around equitable water use, understanding of our water problems and proposed solutions will likely remain unbalanced.

Owing to the highly complex and uncertain physical system, a data-driven and fuzzy number based approach is preferred over traditional approaches. The inputs to the model are abiotic factors, namely water temperature and flow rate. An approach to select the optimum architecture of the neural network is proposed. The total uncertainty of the system is captured in the fuzzy numbers weights and biases of the neural network.

This case study strives to assess the water quality and quantity status for both the present and the near future in the Ciliwung River basin inside the Jakarta Province under different scenarios using population growth with planned additional wastewater management infrastructure by 2030 as mentioned in the local master plan, and comparing the above conditions with the addition of the effects of climate change. Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and nitrate (NO3), the three important indicators of aquatic ecosystem health, were simulated to assess river pollution. Simulation results suggest that water quality in year 2030 will further deteriorate compared to the base year 2000 due to population growth and climate change, even considering the planned wastewater management infrastructure. The magnitude of impact from population growth is far greater than that from climate change. Simulated values of NO3, BOD and COD ranged from 6.07 to 13.34 mg/L, 7.65 to 11.41 mg/L, and 20.16 to 51.01 mg/L, respectively. Almost all of the water quality parameters exceeded the safe limit suitable for a healthy aquatic system, especially for the year 2030. The situation of water quality is worse for the downstream sampling location because of the cumulative effect of transport of untreated pollutants coming from upstream, as well as local dumping. This result will be useful for local policy makers and stakeholders involved in the water sector to formulate strategic and adaptive policies and plan for the future. One of the potential policy interventions is to implement a national integrated sewerage and septage management program on a priority basis, considering various factors like population density and growth, and global changes for both short- and long-term measures.

In total, 25 water quality variables were monitored. Multivariate analysis revealed that the combination LMB-treated and dredged enclosures deviated most from the pond (reference) and the controls, and showed the strongest eutrophication reduction. Overall, dredging significantly increased transparency, lowered turbidity, and improved the oxygen conditions in the enclosures compared to non-dredged ones. Nonetheless, one dredged enclosure deviated dramatically from the others, which might reflect methodological issues with dredging. The LMB treatment appeared to be less effective at mitigating eutrophication than dredging, and phosphate concentrations even increased during the experiment in the LMB-treated enclosures. Chemical equilibrium modeling suggested that humic substances could have formed complexes with lanthanum (La) from the LMB, rendering it unavailable for intercepting P over the course of the enclosure experiment. Residual lanthanum concentrations in combination dredging and LMB treatments exceeded the Dutch standard 10-fold. Total zooplankton abundance, and particularly Cladocera, increased in all enclosures over the course of the experiment. The limited effect of LMB in the enclosure experiment and the violation of the Dutch La standard when combined with dredging disqualify LMB as an intervention agent in the restoration of the pond.																	2073-4441					JUN	2017	9	6							380	10.3390/w9060380								WOS:000404559900018

All improved water sources in the area were checked for operability, accessibility, and water quality, while wireless coverage was tested by means of smartphones, phone calls, and instant messaging applications. Theoretical water coverage exceeded 82% of the total village surface area, thus beating the national and sub-Saharan African averages, but dropped to just 39% when considering only serviceable and contamination-free sources. In contrast, wireless coverage exceeded 90%. These outcomes highlight a triple paradox: (1) water from theoretically safe (i.e., improved) water sources is often unsafe to drink; (2) wireless access is better than water access even though water is essential for human survival and telecommunications are not; and (3) excellent Internet coverage does not help a large number of people, who lack the skills, devices, or need to access it. While telecommunications seem to be making inroads towards universal access faster than the water sector, a survey of water committees uncovered a hidden nexus between both resources, revealing that increased wireless access is actually contributing to underpin water coverage in a variety of ways.					martinez-santos, pedro/0000-0003-2014-4063												2073-4441					JUN	2017	9	6							375	10.3390/w9060375								WOS:000404559900013

Nutrients and Phytoplankton in a Shallow, Hypereutrophic Urban Lake: Prospects for Restoration	WATER												University Lake, a shallow, artificial, urban lake adjacent to the campus of Louisiana State University, has a long history of water quality problems, including algal blooms, fish kills, and high concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria. Periodic dredging of the lake is necessary to prevent its return to swampland. This study was undertaken to elucidate the roles of allochthonous versus autochthonous nutrients as causes of water quality problems in the lake, with the expectation that this information would help identify strategies for lake restoration. Photosynthetic rates and concentrations of inorganic nutrients and phytoplankton pigments were measured over a period of one year. More than 90% of the chlorophyll a (chl a) in the lake was accounted for by Chlorophyceae, Cyanophyceae, and Bacillariophyceae. Concentrations of chl a, which averaged 75 g L-1, fluctuated weekly during dry weather by as much as a factor of four. Phytoplankton growth rates were about 30% higher 1-2 days after rain events than after periods of dry weather, the implication being that allochthonous nutrient loading has a significant effect on the dynamics of the phytoplankton community in the lake. Therefore, dredging of sediments will likely produce no long-term improvement in water quality. More than 100 storm drains currently discharge into the lake, and diversion of those drains may be the most cost-effective strategy for effecting a long-term improvement in water quality.																	2073-4441					JUN	2017	9	6							431	10.3390/w9060431								WOS:000404559900069						
J	Sambito, M; Freni, G				Sambito, Mariacrocetta; Freni, Gabriele			LCA Methodology for the Quantification of the Carbon Footprint of the Integrated Urban Water System	WATER												In integrated urban water systems, energy consumption, and consequently the amount of produced CO2, depends on many environmental, infrastructural, and management factors such as supply water quality, on which treatment complexity depends, urban area orography, water systems efficiency, and maintenance levels. An important factor is related to the presence of significant water losses, which result in an increase in the supply volume and therefore a higher energy consumption for treatment and pumping, without effectively supplying users. The current European environmental strategy is committed to sustainable development by generating action plans to improve the environmental performance of products and services. The analysis of carbon footprints is considered one such improvement, allowing for the evaluation of the environmental impact of single production phases. Using this framework, the aim of the study is to apply a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology to quantify the carbon footprint of an overall integrated urban water system referring to ISO/TS 14067 (2013). This methodology uses an approach known as cradle to grave and presumes to conduct an objective assessment of product units, balancing energy, and matter flows along the production process. The methodology was applied to a real case study, i.e., the integrated urban water system of the Palermo metropolitan area in Sicily (Italy). Each process in the system was characterized and globally evaluated from the point of view of water loss, energy consumption, and CO2 production, and some mitigation strategies are proposed and evaluated to reduce the energy consumption and, consequently, the environmental impact of the system.

These models require large amounts of spatial and tabular data to simulate the natural world. Accurate and seamless daily climatic data are critical for accurate depiction of the hydrologic cycle, yet these data are among the most difficult to obtain and process. In this paper we describe the development of a national (US) database of preprocessed climate data derived from monitoring stations applicable to USGS 12-digit watersheds. Various sources and processing methods are explored and discussed. A relatively simple method was employed to choose representative stations for each of the 83,000 12-digit watersheds in the continental US. Fully processed climate data resulting from this research were published online to facilitate other SWAT and APEX modeling efforts in the US.																	2073-4441					JUN	2017	9	6							437	10.3390/w9060437								WOS:000404559900075

The formation of carbonaceous disinfection by-products (C-DBPs), including trihalomethanes, haloacetic acids, chloral hydrate (CH), and haloketones, as well as nitrogenous DBPs, including trichloronitromethane (TCNM), and haloacetonitriles, was investigated with respect to co-existing Microcystis aeruginosa and Cyclops metabolites under different conditions. The reaction conditions (monochloramine dosage and reaction time) and water quality conditions (pH, temperature, Cl/N, and Microcystis aeruginosa density) were evaluated. The formation of 1,1,1-trichloro-2-propanone (1,1,1-TCP) and TCNM followed an increasing and then decreasing pattern with increased monochloramine dosage and prolonged reaction time. The formation of C-DBPs (e.g., TCM, CH, DCAA, and TCAA) increased with increasing monochloramine dosage and reaction time. The formation of CH, dichloroacetonitrile, 1,1-DCP, and 1,1,1-TCP increased first and then decreased. The formation of TCM increased with increasing pH value and temperature. Additionally, the Cl/N mass ratio affected the formation of DBPs, and as a whole, a lower Cl/N ratio led to a decrease in the concentrations of the five most common DBPs. When the density of Microcystis aeruginosa was 109 count/L, the formation of the tested DBPs reached a minimum.																	0003-7214	1365-2087				JUN	2017	66	4					229	238		10.2166/aqua.2017.097								WOS:000404474300002

But factors influencing their growth are still poorly understood. In the present study the effect of micronutrients, N:P ratio and silica concentration on benthic diatom Synedra sp. grown in fish pond waste water was studied along with nutrient removal efficiency. We have studied nine different treatments, of which addition of micronutrient mixture Nualgi along with adjusted N: P to 6:1 resulted in highest cell density, followed by silicate enrichment, whereas only N:P adjustment and Nualgi addition had no significant effect on diatom growth. At the end of the growth experiment, the N removal efficiencies of treatment groups (50.23%-65.44%) were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of the control group (43.56%), whereas phosphate removal efficiency was significantly higher (P < 0.05) with Nualgi and N:P adjustment (53.37%-68.98%). The silicate consumption was significantly higher in the control group, at 63.87%, than in other experimental groups. These results will give us a new insight into important factors influencing beneficial algae growth and simultaneous nutrient removal from aquaculture waste water.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				JUN	2017	75	12					2777	2783		10.2166/wst.2017.156								WOS:000404557300006	28659517

Advanced phosphorus removal via coagulation, flocculation and microsieve filtration in tertiary treatment	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The applicability of microsieve technology together with coagulation and flocculation for advanced phosphorus removal was investigated. A pilot unit including a microsieve with 10 mu m mesh size was operated continuously with secondary effluent from Ruhleben wastewater treatment plant in Berlin. By applying a pretreatment of 0.07-0.09 mmol/L (as metal) coagulant and 1.5-2 mg/L cationic polymer, total phosphorus values below 80 mu g/L were achieved. Coagulation with polyaluminum chloride (PACl) produced a better effluent quality compared to FeCl3, as less suspended solids and less residual coagulant were found in the microsieve effluent. In addition, the transmittance of UV radiation through the water was improved by using PACl. The produced amount of backwash water was always below 3% (on average 1.6%). Under optimized mixing conditions, polymer doses of 0.6 mg/L were possible without losses in water quality and filtration performance. Microsieving with chemical pretreatment is a viable option for high quality effluent polishing.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				JUN	2017	75	12					2875	2882		10.2166/wst.2017.166								WOS:000404557300016	28659527					
J	Wei, YN; Fan, W; Wang, W; Deng, LS				Wei, Ya-ni; Fan, Wen; Wang, Wei; Deng, Longsheng			Identification of nitrate pollution sources of groundwater and analysis of potential pollution paths in loess regions: a case study in Tongchuan region, China	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Groundwater is the essential and predominant source of drinking and irrigation water supplies in most arid and semiarid regions, particularly in Loess Plateau of China. The threat to groundwater quality by nitrate pollution has always been of considerable concern in loess regions. In this paper, correspondence analysis, stoichiometric analysis, ratios of major ions and some qualitative analysis are employed to discuss the spatial variability of nitrate (NO3-), identification of NO3- pollution sources and its potential pollution paths based on 112 water samples in Tongchuan region on the middle edge of Loess Plateau of China. Results indicate that the NO3- concentrations ranged from 0.25 to 173 mg/L, 20.54% of water samples exceeded the Standards for Drinking Water Quality from China (<= 44 mg/L), and 15.18% of samples exceeded the Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality from World Health Organization (<= 50 mg/L); the water samples with high NO3- concentrations primarily concentrated in river valleys, and the types were mainly pore waters and individual surface waters. Sewage or manure from livestock effluent was the primary sources of NO3- in some surface waters, pore water samples with high NO3- were closely related to agricultural input or a mixing process. Groundwater recharges from surface water and vertical infiltration in river valleys with shallow groundwater depth were considered as the potential pollution paths for NO3- ions in the study area based on nitrate nitrogen distribution in soil profile. Driven by concentration difference and local seepage system, these NO3- ions diffused around and groundwater buried in great depth was consequently polluted. Therefore, river valleys should be listed as the prior protection areas in loess regions; in addition, the time lag between land use changes and groundwater quality response should also be paid attention to in nitrate pollution prevention, particularly in the thick unsaturated zones.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JUN	2017	76	12							423	10.1007/s12665-017-6756-9								WOS:000404390900016

Classification of aquifer vulnerability using K-means cluster analysis	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Groundwater is one of the main sources of drinking and agricultural water in arid and semi-arid regions but is becoming increasingly threatened by contamination. Vulnerability mapping has been used for many years as an effective tool for assessing the potential for aquifer pollution and the most common method of intrinsic vulnerability assessment is DRASTIC (Depth to water table, net Recharge, Aquifer media, Soil media, Topography, Impact of vadose zone and hydraulic Conductivity). An underlying problem with the DRASTIC approach relates to the subjectivity involved in selecting relative weightings for each of the DRASTIC factors and assigning rating values to ranges or media types within each factor. In this study, a clustering technique is introduced that removes some of the subjectivity associated with the indexing method. It creates a vulnerability map that does not rely on fixed weights and ratings and, thereby provides a more objective representation of the system's physical characteristics. This methodology was applied to an aquifer in Iran and compared with the standard DRASTIC approach using the water quality parameters nitrate, chloride and total dissolved solids (TDS) as surrogate indicators of aquifer vulnerability. The proposed method required only four of DRASTIC's seven factors - depth to groundwater, hydraulic conductivity, recharge value and the nature of the vadose zone, to produce a superior result. For nitrate, chloride, and TDS, respectively, the clustering approach delivered Pearson correlation coefficients that were 15, 22 and 5 percentage points higher than those obtained for the DRASTIC method.

Sediment carbon fate in phreatic karst (Part 1): Conceptual model development	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Recent research has paid increased attention to quantifying the fate of carbon pools within fluvial networks, but few, if any, studies consider the fate of sediment organic carbon in fluviokarst systems despite that karst landscapes cover 12% of the earth's land surface. The authors develop a conceptual model of sediment carbon fate in karst terrain with specific emphasis upon phreatic karst conduits, i.e., those located below the groundwater table that have the potential to trap surface-derived sediment and turnover carbon. To assist with their conceptual model development, the authors study a phreatic system and apply a mixture of methods traditional and novel to karst studies, including electrical resistivity imaging, well drilling, instantaneous velocimetry, dye tracing, stage recording, discrete and continuous sediment and water quality sampling, and elemental and stable carbon isotope fingerprinting. Results show that the sediment transport carrying capacity of the phreatic karst water is orders of magnitude less than surface streams during storm-activated periods promoting deposition of fine sediments in the phreatic karst. However, the sediment transport carrying capacity is sustained long after the hydrologic event has ended leading to sediment resuspension and prolonged transport. The surficial fine grained laminae occurs in the subsurface karst system; but unlike surface streams, the light-limited conditions of the subsurface karst promotes constant heterotrophy leading to carbon turnover. The coupling of the hydrological processes leads to a conceptual model that frames phreatic karst as a biologically active conveyor of sediment carbon that recharges degraded organic carbon back to surface streams. For example, fluvial sediment is estimated to lose 30% of its organic carbon by mass during a one year temporary residence within the phreatic karst. It is recommended that scientists consider karst pathways when attempting to estimate organic matter stocks and carbon transformation in fluvial networks. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Sediment carbon fate in phreatic karst (Part 2): Numerical model development and application	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The authors develop a numerical model to elucidate time-distributed processes controlling sediment carbon fate in phreatic karst. Sediment carbon processes simulated in the new numerical model include in conduit erosion and deposition, sediment carbon transport, surficial fine grained laminae evolution, carbon pool mixing, microbial oxidation, and the understudied process of sediment carbon exchange during equilibrium transport. The authors perform a model evaluation procedure that includes generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation to quantify uncertainty of the model results. Modeling results suggest that phreatic karst conduits sustain sediment transport activity long after surface storm events cease. The sustained sediment transport has the potential to shift the baseflow sediment yield of the phreatic karst to be on par with stormflow sediment yield. The sustained activity is suggested to promote the exchange of sediment carbon between the water column and subsurface karst deposits during equilibrium sediment transport conditions. In turn, the sediment carbon exchange impacts the mixing of new and old carbon pools and the flux of carbon from phreatic karst. Integrated numerical model results from this study support the concept that phreatic karst act as a biologically active conveyor of sediment carbon that temporarily stores sediment, turns over carbon at higher rates than surface streams, and recharges degraded carbon back to the fluvial system. The numerical modeling method adopted in this paper shows the efficacy of coupling carbon isotope fingerprinting with water quality modeling to study sediment carbon in phreatic karst.

Scaling effects of riparian peatlands on stable isotopes in runoff and DOC mobilisation	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												We combined 13 months of daily isotope measurements in stream water with daily DOC and 15 min FDOM (fluorescent component of dissolved organic matter) data at three nested scales to identify how riparian peatlands generate runoff and influence DOC dynamics in streams. We investigated how runoff generation processes in a small, riparian peatland-dominated headwater catchment (0.65 km(2)) propagate to larger scales (3.2 km(2) and 31 km(2)) with decreasing percentage of riparian peatland coverage. Isotope damping was most pronounced in the 0.65 km(2) headwater catchment due to high water storage in the organic soils encouraging tracer mixing. At the largest scale, stream flow and water isotope dynamics showed a more flashy response. The isotopic difference between the sites was most pronounced in the summer months when stream water signatures were enriched. During the winter months, the inter site difference reduced. The isotopes also revealed evaporative fractionation in the peatland dominated catchment, in particular during summer low flows, which implied high hydrological connectivity in the form of constant seepage from the peatlands sustaining high baseflows at the headwater scale. This connectivity resulted in high DOC concentrations at the peatland site during baseflow (similar to 5 mg l(-1)). In contrast, at the larger scales, DOC was minimal during low flows (similar to 2 mgl(-1)) due to increased ground-water influence and the disconnection between DOC sources and the stream. High frequency data also revealed diel variability during low flows. Insights into event dynamics through the analysis of hysteresis loops showed slight dilution on the rising limb, the strong influence of dry antecedent conditions and a quick recovery between events at the riparian peatland site. Again, these dynamics are driven by the tight coupling and high connectivity of the landscape to the stream. At larger scales, the disconnection between the landscape units increases and the variable connectivity controls runoff generation and DOC dynamics. The results presented here suggest that the processes occurring in riparian peatlands in headwater catchments are less evident at larger scales which may have implications for the larger scale impact of peatland restoration projects.

This model unifies VEMALA-ICECREAM, VEMALA-N and VEMALA 1.1 as it uses their independent terrestrial loading and implements a simplification of the biogeochemical model RIVE and phytoplankton model AQUAPHY in the river network. VEMALA v.3 simulates the transport and transformations of nitrate, ammonium, organic nitrogen, phosphate, particulate inorganic phosphorus, organic phosphorus, phytoplankton, suspended sediments and total organic carbon during their travel to the sea. The model's results were satisfactory in the Aurajoki river basin (South-Western Finland) in simulating nutrients daily loads, with all Nash and Sutcliffe coefficients (NSE) ranging from 0.51 to 0.89 against observations, and monthly loads (NSE = 0.4-0.97 against estimations). Simulations of total nitrogen and total phosphorus loads were comparable to estimated annual loads with the exception of a few exceptional years. The quantification of the nutrient cycling river processes were consistent with the Aurajoki river ecosystem with maximum summer rates for mineralisation 0.1 mgC L-1 d(-1) and denitrification 55 mgN m(-2) d(-1) resulting in a loss of 4% of the annual nitrogen load entering the river. VEMALA v3 unites the previous versions of VEMALA to better predict the co-impact of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphate on algal growth and therefore eutrophication. Simulation of bioavailable nutrients rather than total nutrients will allow the distinction in the quality of the various loading sources, farming actions and loading reduction actions. In the Aurajoki simulation, nitrate and ammonium represented on average 74% and 3% respectively of the total nitrogen load to the Baltic Sea, while phosphate constituted 38% of the total phosphorus load to the sea. Thus, the biological impact in the river and the sea will be better assessed to help water managers implement the Water Framework Directive in Finland. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Jones, CS; Wang, B; Schilling, KE; Chan, KS				Jones, Christopher S.; Wang, Bo; Schilling, Keith E.; Chan, Kung-sik			Nitrate transport and supply limitations quantified using high-frequency stream monitoring and turning point analysis	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Agricultural landscapes often leak inorganic nitrogen to the stream network, usually in the form of nitrate-nitrite (NOx-N), degrading downstream water quality on both the local and regional scales. While the spatial distribution of nitrate sources has been delineated in many watersheds, less is known about the complicated temporal dynamics that drive stream NOx-N because traditional methods of stream grab sampling are often conducted at a low frequency. Deployment of accurate real-time, continuous measurement devices that have been developed in recent years enables high-frequency sampling that provides detailed information on the concentration-discharge relation and the timing of NOx-N delivery to streams. We aggregated 15-min interval NOx-N and discharge data over a nine-year period into daily averages and then used robust statistical methods to identify how the discharge regime within an artificially-drained agricultural watershed reflected catchment hydrology and NOx-N delivery pathways. We then quantified how transport and supply limitations varied from year-to-year and how dependence of these limitations varied with climate, especially drought. Our results show NOx-N concentrations increased linearly with discharge up to an average "turning point" of 1.42 mm of area-normalized discharge, after which concentrations decline with increasing discharge. We estimate transport and supply limitations to govern 57 and 43 percent, respectively, of the NOx-N flux over the nine-year period. Drought effects on the NOx-N flux linger for multiple years and this is reflected in a greater tendency toward supply limitations in the.three years following drought. How the turning point varies with climate may aid in prediction of NOx-N loading in future climate regimes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Following the historical inundation by paleo-seawater during coastal progradation, the aquifer has been undergone progressive freshening and land reclamation to enable settlements and farming. The hydrochemical data of water samples showed a broad hydrochemical change, from Na-Cl through Na-HCO3 to Ca-HCO3 types, suggesting that groundwater was overall evolved through the freshening process accompanying cation exchange. The principal component analysis (PCA) of the hydrochemical data indicates the occurrence of three major hydrogeochemical processes occurring in an aquifer, namely: 1) progressive freshening of remaining paleo-seawater, 2) water-rock interaction (i.e., dissolution of silicates), and 3) redox process including sulfate reduction, as indicated by heavy sulfur and oxygen isotope compositions of sulfate. To quantitatively assess the hydrogeochemical processes, the end-member mixing analysis (EMMA) and the forward mixing modeling using PHREEQC code were conducted. The EMMA results show that the hydrochemical model with the two-dimensional mixing space composed of PC 1 and PC 2 best explains the mixing in the study area; therefore, we consider that the groundwater chemistry mainly evolved by mixing among three end-members (i.e., paleo-seawater, infiltrating rain, and the K-rich groundwater). The distinct depletion of sulfate in groundwater, likely due to bacterial sulfate reduction, can also be explained by EMMA. The evaluation of mass balances using geochemical modeling supports the explanation that the freshening process accompanying direct cation exchange occurs through mixing among three end-members involving the K-rich groundwater. This study shows that the multiple end-members mixing model is useful to more successfully assess complex hydrogeochemical processes occurring in a salinized aquifer under freshening, as compared to the conventional interpretation using the theoretical mixing line based on only two end-members (i.e., seawater and rainwater).

J	Plagnes, V; Schmid, B; Mitchell, B; Judd-Henrey, I				Plagnes, Valerie; Schmid, Brad; Mitchell, Brett; Judd-Henrey, Ian			Water balance modelling of a uranium mill effluent management system	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												A water balance model was developed to forecast the management strategy of a uranium mill effluent system, located in northern Saskatchewan, Canada. Mining and milling operations, such as pit dewatering or treated effluent release, can potentially influence the hydrology and the water quality downstream of the operations. This study presents the methodology used to predict water volumes and water quality discharging downstream in surface water bodies. A compartment model representing the three subsequent lakes included in the management system was set up using the software GoldSim. The water balance allows predicting lake volumes at the daily time step. A mass balance model developed for conservative elements was also developed and allows validating the proportions of inputs and outputs issued from the water balance model. This model was then used as predictive tool to evaluate the impact of different scenarios of effluents management on volumes and chemistry of surface water for short and longer time periods. An additional significant benefit of this model is that it can be used as an input for geochemical modelling to predict the concentrations of all constituents of concern in the receiving surface water.

J	Bassi, N; Kumar, MD				Bassi, Nitin; Kumar, M. Dinesh			Water quality index as a tool for wetland restoration	WATER POLICY												Worldwide, wetlands are subjected to increasing anthropogenic pressures resulting in loss of their hydrological and ecological functions. Such impacts are more pronounced in the case of wetlands in urban areas which are exposed to land use changes and increased economic activities. In many Indian cities, natural water bodies such as lakes are heavily polluted due to runoff from farmlands in urban and peri-urban areas and discharge of untreated domestic and industrial wastewater. The major constraint for restoring such water bodies is difficulty in devising a concrete action plan for analysing different sets of water quality parameters. Hence, a water quality index (WQI), which is a tool to analyse large amounts of data on different water quality parameters, is computed for one of the biggest natural lakes in the metropolitan city of Delhi. The mean WQI of the lake was estimated to be 46.27, which indicates a high level of water pollution. The paper discusses how these findings can be used for informing policies on management of wetlands. The paper also suggests establishment of a community based water quality monitoring and surveillance system, backed by infrastructural support from the State, in order to restore the wetlands in urban areas.																	1366-7017					JUN	2017	19	3					390	403		10.2166/wp.2017.099								WOS:000404045000002

How to introduce new technologies to reduce nutrient losses: a case of Danish agricultural constructed wetlands	WATER POLICY												The Water Framework Directive (WFD) focuses on reduction of nutrients in individual water bodies. Innovative drainage filter technologies currently being tested in Denmark could facilitate nutrient reductions at the sub-river basins and catchment levels. The implementation strategy for these technologies, however, remains a challenge. Using both primary and secondary data, this paper presents an in-depth analysis of the role of these technologies in implementation of the WFD in Denmark. Concepts of impact assessment are used to identify the most suitable approach for incorporating these technologies into environmental measures based on a three-faceted policy instrument typology. A voluntary approach supported by investment subsidies, or incentives that could replace existing requirements, is deemed more appropriate.

J	Wicaksono, A; Jeong, G; Kang, D				Wicaksono, Albert; Jeong, Gimoon; Kang, Doosun			Water, energy, and food nexus: review of global implementation and simulation model development	WATER POLICY												Water, energy, and food (WEF) have complex interconnections. Water is required to produce energy, while energy is needed for water extraction, treatment, and distribution. The food sector requires water and energy to produce food products, while fertilizer and pesticide from farmland have a negative impact on water quality; however, biomass is a potential alternative energy source. Understanding these interconnections will help determine the developmental framework that connects all of the elements. Some global regions have implemented a variety of sustainable management concepts to manage the natural resources, however, mainly for an individual resource. Furthermore, various computer models have been developed to estimate the interdependency of each resource and to quantify future requirements of WEF; the limitations of current models have opened opportunities for development through the addition of components and features such as feedback analysis, optimization, and visualization. We reviewed the literature to determine the present state of the WEF nexus, especially its global implementation and simulation model. We concluded that the involvement of stakeholders, integration of policies, and development of a nexus simulation model are required for successful implementation of the WEF nexus, which is an emerging issue for a sustainable resources' management.																	1366-7017					JUN	2017	19	3					440	462		10.2166/wp.2017.214								WOS:000404045000005

The Bahr El-Baqar drain in Sharqia, Egypt, is one of the main drains in the Nile Delta that receives various types of wastewater. Monitoring and assessing the drain's water quality were achieved by collecting georeferenced water samples along the drain during the 2015 summer and winter cropping seasons. Chemical, microbial, and parasitic analyses were performed. Additionally, surface soil samples irrigated with the drain water were gathered from the adjacent area to quantify the main physicochemical properties. Water analysis results revealed that the concentrations of most trace elements were within international standards and the Egyptian allowable levels forTWWreuse in agriculture. Oxygen depletion was observed for all samples collected. The microbial analysis indicated that there was fecal coliform contamination (> 1000 per 100 mL) in the summer and winter samples. Concentrations of PO4 and SO4 were within the permissible level for irrigation use, whereas NH4, NO3, and MoO4 concentrations were higher than the recommended values for reusing Bahr El-Baqar water in irrigation. Based on the soil analysis results, Cd contamination was observed, whereas the Pb concentration in soils was slightly higher than its normal range. Mixing Bahr El-Baqar water with freshwater and implementing appropriate on-farm treatment before the reuse are recommended as a prerequisite for reusing Bahr El-Baqar water for irrigation. Bio-diesel fuel and energy oil crops are recommended for the studied region.

Upstream the mine, groundwaters were more acid and some elements and compounds, such as iron, aluminum, and sulfate, were in higher concentration, possibly because of acid mine drainage (AMD) generation in tailing pit. U-238 and U-234 activity concentrations exceeded the standards proposed by the World Health Organization in two sampling periods in effluent samples and in some groundwater samples, indicating that waters from this aquifer system were unhealthy for human consumption. Uranium isotopes were more elevated in groundwaters in the rainy month probably because of a higher leaching and transport rate of this element from rocks/tailings pit to waters. The average radon activity concentration in groundwater was higher than in surface waters and effluents in both periods studied, possibly due to the enhanced presence of uranium and radium in the aquifer rocks that would favor the radon accumulation and entrapment. The effects of the mining activities on the groundwater quality were displayed in terms of activity ratios (U-234/U-238, Ra-226/U-238), which showed different behaviors upstream the mine area relatively to areas downstream the mine.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				JUN	2017	228	6							207	10.1007/s11270-017-3381-x								WOS:000403574100011

All of these sources emit pathogens and fecal indicator bacteria into the surface water, which the EU Bathing Water Directive addresses by giving threshold values for the indicators Escherichia coli and intestinal enterococci. This study presents a comparison between 21 scenarios of costs for processes that reduce the load of Escherichia coli and intestinal enterococci into the Ruhr River during and shortly after rain events. The methods examined include UV irradiation for WWTPs, integrated sewer management and treatment of CSOs with vertical flow constructed wetlands or performic acid. For pollution by diffuse overland flow, we evaluated organizational measures. The treatment of only diffuse pollution shows merely a slight effect on intestinal enterococci, but none on Escherichia coli and hence, was not considered further. Combining all three CSO reduction methods with the irradiation of WWTP effluent provides the best simulation results in terms of reducing both indicator bacteria.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				JUN	2017	75	11					2659	2668		10.2166/wst.2017.141								WOS:000403486600019	28617286

Compared with the control pond, the experiment pond had better water quality as indicated by 64.2% reduction in chlorophyll a, and 81.1% reduction in algal cells. The chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus concentration were reduced by 55.1%, 57.5%, and 50.8%, respectively. The treatment efficiency is mainly due to the growth control of Microcystis (i.e. cell reduction of 96.4%). The gas vesicles collapsing because of the water pressure was suggested to be the mechanism for Microcystis suppression by the deep well circulation treatment. The Microcystis lost its buoyancy after gas vesicles collapsed and it settled to the bottom of the aquaculture pond. As a result, the algae reproduction was suppressed because algae could only grow in the area with enough sunlight (i.e. water depth less than 1 m).																	0273-1223	1996-9732				JUN	2017	75	11					2692	2701		10.2166/wst.2017.159								WOS:000403486600022	28617289

Micro-zooplankton grazing as a means of fecal bacteria removal in stormwater BMPs	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												A priority for environmental managers is control of stormwater runoff pollution, especially fecal microbial pollution. This research was designed to determine if fecal bacterial grazing by micro-zooplankton is a significant control on fecal bacteria in aquatic best management practices (BMPs); if grazing differs between a wet detention pond and a constructed wetland; and if environmental factors enhance grazing. Both 3-day grazing tests and 24-h dilution assays were used to determine grazing differences between the two types of BMP. Micro-zooplankton grazing was a stronger bacteria removal mechanism in stormwater wetlands rich in aquatic vegetation compared to a standard wet detention pond, although grazing was important in detention ponds as well. Our experiments indicated that the majority of grazers that fed on fecal bacteria were <20 mu m in size. Grazing rates were positively correlated with fecal coliform abundance and increased water temperatures. Enumeration of grazers demonstrated that protozoans were significantly more abundant among wetland vegetation than in open water, and open wetland waters contained more flagellates and dinoflagellates than open wet detention pond waters. Grazing on fecal bacteria in BMPs is enhanced by aquatic vegetation, and grazing in aquatic BMPs in warmer climates should be greater than in cooler climates.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				JUN	2017	75	11					2702	2715		10.2166/wst.2017.170								WOS:000403486600023	28617290

Systematic risk management approach of household drinking water from the source to point of use	JOURNAL OF WATER SANITATION AND HYGIENE FOR DEVELOPMENT												The water safety plan (WSP) approach is being widely adopted as a systematic approach to improving the safety of drinking water. However, to date, the approach has not been widely used for improving the safety of drinking water in those settings where people have to collect water away from their home. Most rural areas in South Africa still consume unsafe water despite WSP implementation and improved water sources provided by municipalities. This study used hazard analysis critical control point to assess drinking water used in households to determine systematic procedures, which could be used to control risks. The process includes assessment of risks associated with household water service level (availability, accessibility and potability) and risks of water contamination from the collection to point of consumption. Observations and questionnaires were used to collect data in households to systematically determine and identify risks of drinking water consumption. The results show intermittent water supply, access to unsafe water, while poor hygiene practices contribute to household water contamination. This approach could assist in identifying hazards as well as critical control points to reduce risks and improve management of drinking water safety in households.

A literature search was conducted in order to review: (1) methods used for investigating the effects of public drinking water on GI; (2) evidence of possible dose-response relationship between sporadic GI and drinking water consumption; and (3) association between sporadic GI and factors affecting drinking water quality. Seventy-four articles were selected, key findings and information gaps were identified. In-home intervention studies have only been conducted in areas using surface water sources and intervention studies in communities supplied by ground water are therefore needed. Community-wide intervention studies may constitute a cost-effective alternative to in-home intervention studies. Proxy data that correlate with GI in the community can be used for detecting changes in the incidence of GI. Proxy data can, however, not be used for measuring the prevalence of illness. Local conditions affecting water safety may vary greatly, making direct comparisons between studies difficult unless sufficient knowledge about these conditions is acquired. Drinking water in high-income countries contributes to endemic levels of GI and there are public health benefits for further improvements of drinking water safety.

Comparison of MI, Chromocult (R) coliform, and Compass CC chromogenic culture-based methods to detect Escherichia coli and total coliforms in water using 16S rRNA sequencing for colony identification	JOURNAL OF WATER AND HEALTH												The MI, Chromocult (R) coliform, and Compass CC chromogenic culture-based methods used to assess water quality by the detection of Escherichia coli and total coliforms were compared in terms of their specificity and sensitivity, using 16S rRNA sequencing for colony identification. A sewage water sample was divided in 2-mu L subsamples for testing by all three culture-based methods. All growing colonies were harvested and subjected to 16S rRNA sequencing. Test results showed that all E. coli colonies were correctly identified by all three methods, for a specificity and a sensitivity of 100%. However, for the total coliform detection, the MI agar, Chromocult (R) coliform agar, and Compass CC agar were specific for only 69.2% (9/13), 47.2% (25/53), and 40.5% (17/42), whereas sensitive for 97.8% (45/46), 97.5% (39/40), and 85.7% (24/28), respectively. Thus, given the low level of specificity of these methods for the detection of total coliforms, confirming the identity of total coliform colonies could help to take public health decisions, in particular for cities connected to a public drinking water distribution system since the growth of few putative total coliform colonies on chromogenic agar is problematic and can lead to unnecessary and costly boiling notices from public health authorities.																	1477-8920					JUN	2017	15	3					353	359		10.2166/wh.2017.174								WOS:000403110200003	28598339

In order to assess the potential risk for legionellosis, we analyzed Legionella contamination of water distribution systems in 36 recreational facilities equipped with swimming pools. One hundred and sixty water samples were analyzed from shower heads or taps located in locker rooms or in bathrooms. By culture method and polymerase chain reaction, 41/160 samples were positive for Legionella from 12/36 recreational centers. Hotels (57.1%) and sports centers (41.2%) were the most contaminated. L. pneumophila serotypes 2-14 (25/41) were more frequently found than serotype 1 (10/41). Samples at temperature >= 30 degrees C were more frequently positive than samples at temperature <30 degrees C (n = 39 vs n = 2, p < 0.00001). The presence of L. pneumophila was investigated by comparison with heterotrophic plate count (HPC), an indicator of water quality. The presence of L. pneumophila was associated more frequently with high and intermediate HPC load at 37 degrees C, therefore should be considered a potential source when HPC at 37 degrees C is >10 CFU/mL. Maintenance, good hygiene practices, interventions on the hydraulic system and regular controls must be implemented to minimize exposure to L. pneumophila infection risk.																	1477-8920					JUN	2017	15	3					402	409		10.2166/wh.2017.296								WOS:000403110200008	28598344

Predicting water filter and bottled water use in Appalachia: a community-scale case study	JOURNAL OF WATER AND HEALTH												A questionnaire survey was conducted in order to assess residents' perceptions of water quality for drinking and recreational purposes in a mid-sized city in northcentral West Virginia. Two logistic regression analyses were conducted in order to investigate the factors that influence bottle use and filter use. Results show that 37% of respondents primarily use bottled water and that 58% use a household filter when drinking from the tap. Respondents with lower levels of environmental concern, education levels, and lower organoleptic perceptions were most likely to perceive health risks from tap water consumption, and were most likely to use bottled water. Income, age, and organoleptic perceptions were predictors of water filter use among respondents. Clean water for recreational purposes was not found to be significant with either of these models. Our results demonstrate that bottle use and filter use are explained differently. We argue that more education and better communication about local tap water quality would decrease the use of bottled water. We demonstrate that household filters could be used as an alternative to bottled water.																	1477-8920					JUN	2017	15	3					451	461		10.2166/wh.2017.219								WOS:000403110200013	28598349

BIOACCUMULATION OF INORGANIC ELEMENTS IN DREISSENA POLYMORPHA FROM THE EBRO RIVER, SPAIN: COULD ZEBRA MUSSELS BE USED AS A BIOINDICATOR OF THE IMPACT OF HUMAN ACTIVITIES?	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Dreissena polymorpha is among the top 100 most harmful invasive species in aquatic habitats. European Directive 2013/39/UE establishes Environmental Quality Standards for biota because it has been demonstrated that pollutants bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms. This study evaluated bioaccumulation of inorganic elements in the soft tissues of D. polymorpha in order to assess the usefulness of zebra mussels as a bioindicator of contaminant presence in superficial waters. Concentrations of 66 elements were measured in order to evaluate their relationship with nearby anthropogenic activity and to the values recommended by Environmental Quality Standards for biota. Bivalves were collected from four sample points along the Ebro River Basin (Spain), where diverse human activities are carried out. Zebra mussels accumulate toxins in soft tissue during their life cycle, including Al, Cr, Fe, Hg, Pb, Th, Cd and U. The highest levels of accumulation corresponded to elements associated with human activity in the area, showing the impact of anthropogenic actions on biota. D. polymorpha not only supplies information about current water quality but also acts as a witness of past water quality by bioconcentrating toxic elements present in the environment and providing relevant results about historical water contamination. In conclusion, D. polymorpha is a harmful and dangerous invasive species, but its pervasiveness means that it can be used as a bioindicator to assess current and past presence of elements in water.

The concept has found some success with point source water pollution, but very few trades have occurred in over 50 programs in the United States (U.S.) that have focused on nonpoint sources (NPSs). To understand why success has been slow, we identified three environments needed for programs to succeed: physical, economic, and institutional. We estimate that only 5% of watersheds in the U.S. currently listed as nutrient impaired provide a viable physical environment for trading nitrogen; 13% are suitable for phosphorus. Economic and institutional challenges would shrink that domain even further. Therefore, we find places with the ideal physical, economic, and institutional environments necessary for feasible WQT programs are virtual policy utopias - rare places with ideal environments. Fortunately, a growing literature provides the tools necessary to identify where these policy utopias are and to expand that domain through a better understanding about how to manage WQT programs more effectively.																	1093-474X	1752-1688				JUN	2017	53	3					514	520		10.1111/1752-1688.12532								WOS:000402846200002

USE OF SWAT TO ESTIMATE SPATIAL SCALING OF PHOSPHORUS EXPORT COEFFICIENTS AND LOAD REDUCTIONS DUE TO AGRICULTURAL BMPS	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Phosphorus export coefficients (kg/ha/yr) from selected land covers, also called phosphorus yields, tend to get smaller as contributing areas get larger because some of the phosphorus mobilized on local fields gets trapped during transport to regional watershed outlets. Phosphorus traps include floodplains, wetlands, and lakes, which can then become impaired by eutrophication. The Sunrise River watershed in east central Minnesota, United States, has numerous lakes impaired by excess phosphorus. The Sunrise is tributary to the St. Croix River, whose much larger watershed is terminated by Lake St. Croix, also impaired by excess phosphorus. To support management of these impairments at both local and regional scales, a Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model of the Sunrise watershed was constructed to estimate load reductions due to selected best management practices (BMPs) and to determine how phosphorus export coefficients scaled with contributing area. In this study, agricultural BMPs, including vegetated filter strips, grassed waterways, and reduction of soil-phosphorus concentrations reduced phosphorus loads by 4-20%, with similar percentage reductions at field and watershed spatial scales. Phosphorus export coefficients from cropland in rotation with corn, soybeans, and alfalfa decreased as a negative power function of contributing area, from an average of 2.12 kg/ha/yr at the upland field scale (similar to 0.6 km(2)) to 0.63 kg/ha/yr at the major river basin scale (20,000 km(2)).																	1093-474X	1752-1688				JUN	2017	53	3					547	561		10.1111/1752-1688.12523								WOS:000402846200005

URBAN STREAMFLOW RESPONSE TO IMPORTED WATER AND WATER CONSERVATION POLICIES IN LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Los Angeles has a long history of importing water; however, drought, climate change, and environmental mitigation have forced the City to focus on developing more local water sources (target of 50% local supply by 2035). This study aims to improve understanding of water cycling in Los Angeles, including the impacts of imported water and water conservation policies. We evaluate the influence of local water restrictions on discharge records for 12 years in the Ballona Creek (urban) and Topanga Creek (natural) watersheds. Results show imported water has significantly altered the timing and volume of streamflow in the urban Ballona watershed, resulting in runoff ratios above one (more streamflow than precipitation). Further analysis comparing pre- vs. during-mandatory water conservation periods shows there is a significant decrease in dry season streamflow during-conservation in Ballona, indicating that prior to conservation efforts, heavy irrigation and other outdoor water use practices were contributing to streamflow. The difference between summer streamflow pre- vs. during-conservation is enough to serve 160,000 customers in Los Angeles. If Los Angeles returns to more watering days, educating the public on proper irrigation rates is critical for ensuring efficient irrigation and conserving water; however, if water restrictions remain in place, the City must take the new flow volumes into account for complying with water quality standards in the region.																	1093-474X	1752-1688				JUN	2017	53	3					626	640		10.1111/1752-1688.12515								WOS:000402846200010

We employ a macro modeling system to determine the aggregate economic and water quality impacts of CNMP implementation on AFOs in the entire basin. Results of the study indicate that implementing CNMPs on AFOs will help reduce sediment and organic nutrient losses from their current levels at moderate cost. The flexibility inherent in CNMP designs means farmers may be able to achieve water quality and other conservation goals at less cost with CNMPs than with other less flexible policy options.

In the present study, metal contents and toxicity of soils, aqueous extracts from soils and mine drainage waters from an abandoned F-Ba-Pb-Zn mining area in Osor (Girona, NE Spain) were evaluated through chemical extractions and ecotoxicity bioassays. Toxicity assessment in the terrestrial compartment included lethal and sublethal endpoints on earthworms Eisenia fetida, arthropods Folsomia candida and several plant species, whereas aquatic tests involved bacteria Vibrio fischeri, microalgae Raphidocelis subcapitata and crustaceans Daphnia magna. Total concentrations of Ba (250-5110 mg kg(-1)), Pb (940 to > 5000 mg kg(-1)) and Zn (2370-11,300 mg kg(-1)) in soils exceeded intervention values to protect human health. Risks for the aquatic compartment were identified in the release of drainage waters and in the potential leaching and runoff of metals from contaminated soils, with Cd (1.98-9.15 A mu g L-1), Pb (2.11-326 A mu g L-1) and Zn (280-2900 A mu g L-1) concentrations in filtered water samples surpassing US EPA Water Quality Criteria (2016a, b). Terrestrial ecotoxicity tests were in accordance with metal quantifications and identified the most polluted soil as the most toxic. Avoidance and reproduction tests with earthworms showed the highest sensitivity to metal contamination. Aquatic bioassays performed in aqueous extracts from soils confirmed the results from terrestrial tests and also detected toxic effects caused by the mine drainage waters. Algal growth inhibition was the most sensitive aquatic endpoint. In view of the results, the application of a containment or remediative procedure in the area is encouraged.																	0269-4042	1573-2983				JUN	2017	39	3					665	679		10.1007/s10653-016-9840-2								WOS:000402049700014	27260479

Ferreira			The Fate of Base Metals in the Environment and Water Quality in the Mellegue Watershed, Northwest Tunisia	MINE WATER AND THE ENVIRONMENT												The 130 Mm(3)-capacity MellSgue reservoir has a broad catchment area. Contaminants include sewage from cities, farm fertilizers, and metals released from mine tailings, all of which threaten Tunisia's water supply. Forty surface water samples were collected from watercourses and 18 from the reservoir during the wet and dry seasons. To evaluate groundwater contamination, the Sarrat basin was considered as a case study, and well water was analysed. The total amounts of base metals and nutrients in the watercourses did not exceed international standards. Evaporites in broad Triassic outcrops and in tailings dissolve, and may fix lead as sulphates; however, sulphate and chloride can complex and increase the solubility of some metals. The nutrient and salt content were highest in the Rmel River, which receives sewage from el Kef. An opposing gradient of metals was observed in the reservoir water column: elements such as Zn, Pb, and Al were enriched upwards, while Mn, Fe, and Cr increased towards the sediment-water interface. The same behaviour was observed for NO3 (-) and O-2, due to metal release under reducing conditions in bottom waters, and dissolution of Fe and Mn colloids. Fertilizers and sewage may be responsible for the potentially hazardous level of nutrients in the groundwater.

Quantifying Iron Concentration in Local and Synthetic Acid Mine Drainage: A New Technique Using Handheld Field Spectrometers	MINE WATER AND THE ENVIRONMENT												Pit lakes present a concern for public safety and environmental quality. With continuing advancement of imaging satellites, remote sensing spectroscopy may provide a useful tool for monitoring pit water quality across vast mining districts. Visible to shortwave infrared remote sensing has been widely used to monitor acid mine drainage (AMD) mineralogy at mine sites. However, few studies have examined the spectral signatures of mine-affected waters and open pit water bodies from a remote platform. The motivation for this study was to identify the spectral characteristics of AMD in a controlled laboratory setting in order to better interpret mine water bodies in remote sensing imagery. The spectral response of synthetic and local AMD were measured using a field spectrometer. Solutions with increasing Fe3+ and Fe2+ concentrations were mixed to mimic the chemical properties of local AMD. Synthetic solutions with known Fe concentrations were compared with local AMD for quantitative assessment. The spectral signatures of Fe3+ dominated waters possessed distinct characteristics that may be used for diagnostic identification. Specifically, the region between 0.35 and 0.625 A mu m was used to approximately quantify Fe3+ concentrations. Subtle changes in Fe concentrations in local AMD were identified using a field spectrometer alone. These findings suggest that subtle changes in open pit water quality may also be qualitatively and quantitatively measured by remote sensing spectroscopy.																	1025-9112	1616-1068				JUN	2017	36	2					299	309		10.1007/s10230-016-0399-z								WOS:000402398400015

Stochastic multicomponent reactive transport analysis of low quality drainage release from waste rock piles: Controls of the spatial distribution of acid generating and neutralizing minerals	JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY												In mining environmental applications, it is important to assess water quality from waste rock piles (WRPs) and estimate the likelihood of acid rock drainage (ARD) over time. The mineralogical heterogeneity of WRPs is a source of uncertainty in this assessment, undermining the reliability of traditional bulk indicators used in the industry. We focused in this work on the bulk neutralizing potential ratio (NPR), which is defined as the ratio of the content of non-acid-generating minerals (typically reactive carbonates such as calcite) to the content of potentially acid-generating minerals (typically sulfides such as pyrite). We used a streamtube-based Monte-Carlo method to show why and to what extent bulk NPR can be a poor indicator of ARD occurrence. We simulated ensembles of WRPs identical in their geometry and bulk NPR, which only differed in their initial distribution of the acid generating and acid neutralizing minerals that control NPR. All models simulated the same principal acid-producing, acid-neutralizing and secondary mineral forming processes. We show that small differences in the distribution of local NPR values or the number of flow paths that generate acidity strongly influence drainage pH. The results indicate that the likelihood of ARD (epitomized by the probability of occurrence of pH < 4 in a mixing boundary) within the first 100 years can be as high as 75% for a NPR = 2 and 40% for NPR = 4. The latter is traditionally considered as a "universally safe" threshold to ensure non-acidic waters in practical applications. Our results suggest that new methods that explicitly account for mineralogical heterogeneity must be sought when computing effective (upscaled) NPR values at the scale of the piles.					Mayer, K.

Pathogen transport in groundwater systems: contrasts with traditional solute transport	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Water quality affects many aspects of water availability, from precluding use to societal perceptions of fit-for-purpose. Pathogen source and transport processes are drivers of water quality because they have been responsible for numerous outbreaks resulting in large economic losses due to illness and, in some cases, loss of life. Outbreaks result from very small exposure (e.g., less than 20 viruses) from very strong sources (e.g., trillions of viruses shed by a single infected individual). Thus, unlike solute contaminants, an acute exposure to a very small amount of contaminated water can cause immediate adverse health effects. Similarly, pathogens are larger than solutes. Thus, interactions with surfaces and settling become important even as processes important for solutes such as diffusion become less important. These differences are articulated in "Colloid Filtration Theory", a separate branch of pore-scale transport. Consequently, understanding pathogen processes requires changes in how groundwater systems are typically characterized, where the focus is on the leading edges of plumes and preferential flow paths, even if such features move only a very small fraction of the aquifer flow. Moreover, the relatively short survival times of pathogens in the subsurface require greater attention to very fast (< 10 year) flow paths. By better understanding the differences between pathogen and solute transport mechanisms discussed here, a more encompassing view of water quality and source water protection is attained. With this more holistic view and theoretical understanding, better evaluations can be made regarding drinking water vulnerability and the relation between groundwater and human health.																	1431-2174	1435-0157				JUN	2017	25	4			SI		921	930		10.1007/s10040-016-1502-z								WOS:000401787800003						
J	Worthington, SRH; Smart, CC				Worthington, Stephen R. H.; Smart, C. Christopher			Transient bacterial contamination of the dual-porosity aquifer at Walkerton, Ontario, Canada	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Contamination of the Paleozoic carbonate aquifer at Walkerton (Ontario, Canada) by pathogenic bacteria following heavy rain in May 2000 resulted in 2,300 illnesses and seven deaths. Subsequent tracer testing showed that there was rapid groundwater flow in the aquifer, and also rapid exchange between the aquifer and the ground surface. Electrical conductivity (EC) profiling during a 3-day pumping test showed that most flow was through bedding-plane fractures spaced about 10 m apart, that there were substantial contrasts in EC in the major fracture flows, and that there were rapid changes over time. Total coliform sampling revealed transient groundwater contamination, particularly after heavy rain and lasting up to a few days. These characteristics can be understood in terms of the dual-porosity nature of the aquifer. Most of the storage is in the matrix, but this can be considered to be static in the short term. Almost all transport is through the fracture network, which has rapid groundwater flow (similar to 100 m/day) and rapid transmission of pressure pulses due to the high hydraulic diffusivity. Rapid recharge can occur through thin and/or fractured overburden and at spring sites where flow is reversed by pumping during episodes of surface flooding. These characteristics facilitated the ingress of surface-derived bacteria into the aquifer, and their rapid transport within the aquifer to pumping wells. Bacterial presence is common in carbonate aquifers, and this can be explained by the well-connected, large-aperture fracture networks in these dual-porosity aquifers, even though many, such as at Walkerton, lack karst landforms.																	1431-2174	1435-0157				JUN	2017	25	4			SI		1003	1016		10.1007/s10040-016-1514-8								WOS:000401787800010

Disparities among the Nordic countries in the approach to providing safe drinking water from groundwater are discussed, and recommendations are given for the future. Groundwater recharge is typically high in autumn or winter months or after snowmelt in the coldest regions. Most inland aquifers are unconfined and therefore vulnerable to pollution, but they are often without much anthropogenic influence and the water quality is good. In coastal zones, previously emplaced marine sediments may confine and protect aquifers to some extent. However, the water quality in these aquifers is highly variable, as the coastal regions are also most influenced by agriculture, sea-water intrusion and urban settlements resulting in challenging conditions for water abstraction and supply. Groundwater is typically extracted from Quaternary deposits for small and medium municipalities, from bedrock for single households, and from surface water for the largest cities, except for Iceland, which relies almost entirely on groundwater for public supply. Managed aquifer recharge, with or without prior water treatment, is widely used in Finland to extend present groundwater resources. Especially at small utilities, groundwater is often supplied without treatment. Despite generally good water quality, microbial contamination has occurred, principally by norovirus and Campylobacter, with larger outbreaks resulting from sewage contamination, cross-connections into drinking water supplies, heavy rainfall events, and ingress of polluted surface water to groundwater.

It focused on microbial water pollution in low-income regions. Risk factors for faecal contamination of groundwater-fed drinking-water sources were evaluated in a case study in Juba, South Sudan. The study was based on counts of thermotolerant coliforms in water samples from 129 sources, collected by the humanitarian aid organisation M,decins Sans FrontiSres in 2010. The factors included hydrogeological settings, land use and socio-economic characteristics. The results showed that the residuals of a conventional probit regression model had a significant positive spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I = 3.05, I-stat = 9.28); therefore, a spatial model was developed that had better goodness-of-fit to the observations. The most significant factor in this model (p-value 0.005) was the distance from a water source to the nearest Tukul area, an area with informal settlements that lack sanitation services. It is thus recommended that future remediation and monitoring efforts in the city be concentrated in such low-income regions. The spatial model differed from the conventional approach: in contrast with the latter case, lowland topography was not significant at the 5% level, as the p-value was 0.074 in the spatial model and 0.040 in the traditional model. This study showed that statistical risk-factor assessments of groundwater contamination need to consider spatial interactions when the water sources are located close to each other. Future studies might further investigate the cut-off distance that reflects spatial autocorrelation. Particularly, these results advise research on urban groundwater quality.

Urban groundwater quality in sub-Saharan Africa: current status and implications for water security and public health	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Groundwater resources are important sources of drinking water in Africa, and they are hugely important in sustaining urban livelihoods and supporting a diverse range of commercial and agricultural activities. Groundwater has an important role in improving health in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). An estimated 250 million people (40% of the total) live in urban centres across SSA. SSA has experienced a rapid expansion in urban populations since the 1950s, with increased population densities as well as expanding geographical coverage. Estimates suggest that the urban population in SSA will double between 2000 and 2030. The quality status of shallow urban groundwater resources is often very poor due to inadequate waste management and source protection, and poses a significant health risk to users, while deeper borehole sources often provide an important source of good quality drinking water. Given the growth in future demand from this finite resource, as well as potential changes in future climate in this region, a detailed understanding of both water quantity and quality is required to use this resource sustainably. This paper provides a comprehensive assessment of the water quality status, both microbial and chemical, of urban groundwater in SSA across a range of hydrogeological terrains and different groundwater point types. Lower storage basement terrains, which underlie a significant proportion of urban centres in SSA, are particularly vulnerable to contamination. The relationship between mean nitrate concentration and intrinsic aquifer pollution risk is assessed for urban centres across SSA. Current knowledge gaps are identified and future research needs highlighted.

Hot spring drainage flows into a river and then flows into coastal areas in this area, a region in Japan with many hot springs. Study focus: The effects of that drainage on river and coastal area ecosystems remain unclear. We evaluated the impact of the hot spring drainage on fish communities near the estuary. New hydrological insights: Factor analysis results obtained using water quality data show that the scale of the hot spring drainage influence on rivers differs among rivers. The inflow of hot spring drainage into the rivers affects phytoplankton more than the inflow of domestic drainage, which increases the amount of phytoplankton. Furthermore, hot spring drainage creates a better habitat for Nile tilapia, a foreign species, by increasing food availability and water temperature. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Sources and spatial variability of groundwater-delivered nutrients in Maunalua Bay, O'ahu, Hawaii	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: Maunalua Bay, Oahu, Hawai'i. Study focus: We examined submarine groundwater discharge (SGD), terrestrial groundwater, and nearshore marine water quality in two adjacent aquifers (Waialae East and Waialae West) with differing land-use and hydrogeologic characteristics to better understand the sources and spatial variability of SGD-conveyed nutrients. Nutrient concentrations and NO3- stable isotope ratios were measured and integrated with SGD flux, land-use, and recharge data to examine SGD nutrient loads and potential sources in each aquifer. New hydrological insights for the region: Regionally elevated NO3- concentrations (166171 mu M) and delta N-15-NO3- values (10.4-10.9%.) were apparent in SGD in the Waialae West Aquifer, an area with high on-site disposal system density (e.g., cesspools). Coastal sites sampled in the neighboring Waialae East Aquifer exhibited significantly lower values for these parameters, with delta N-15-NO3- values ranging from 5.7-5.9%. and NO3- concentrations from 43-69 mu M. The isotopic composition of NO3- in SGD originating from the Waialae West Aquifer was consistent with wastewater. Modeled recharge data corroborated the NO3- stable isotope source designation. SGD emanating from Waialae West Aquifer was primarily influenced by two-component mixing of a wastewater source with low nutrient groundwater as wastewater effluent accounted for more than 4% of total recharge and 54-95% of total N and P loads in the aquifer.

Study focus: Water security is central to decision-making within a water-energy nexus. In areas where energy resources, such as shale gas, are undergoing rapid development, water security and the associated risks to water quality and quantity are of paramount concern. However, in many regions there is a lack of understanding and data on the hydrologic system, particularly its vulnerability to hazards. The data and knowledge gap poses challenges for effective regulation of the shale gas activities and management of water resources. This paper describes initiatives that are addressing concerns surrounding water security in Northeast British Columbia. New hydrological insights for the region: Initiatives and tools enhancing water security in the region include strategic partnerships and stakeholder collaborations, policy and regulation development, and data collection and distribution efforts. The contributions and limitations of each of these are discussed. A vulnerability mapping framework is presented which addresses data gaps and provides a tool for decision-making surrounding risk to water quality from various hazards. An example vulnerability assessment was conducted for wastewater transport along pipeline and trucking corridors. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Evaluation of DRAINMOD-DSSAT simulated effects of controlled drainage on crop yield, water balance, and water quality for a corn-soybean cropping system in central Iowa	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Controlled drainage (CD) has been identified as a sustainable management practice whereby more soil water can be conserved and less nutrients are leached; alongside its potential benefit of alleviating drought stress and increasing yield. More than 12 million hectare of cropland in the US Midwest are suitable for implementing CD; however, the effectiveness of the practice can vary across the region with the variation in environmental conditions and management practices. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of the integrated agro-ecosystem model; DRAINMOD-DSSAT, for simulating the effects of CD on drainage flow, nitrogen losses via drainage water and crop yield. Herein, we utilized a 4-yr dataset (2006-2009) that was collected from a corn-soybean cropping system near Story City, Iowa. This site was artificially drained under free drainage (FD) and CD treatments. The model was calibrated using the data collected from the FD plots, and validated for the CD plots. DRAINMOD-DSSAT predictions of drainage flow and nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) losses were in good agreement with measured values under FD and CD, with the former treatment showed slightly better performance. The modeling efficiencies (NSE's) for simulating monthly drainage flows were 0.81 and 0.60 for FD and CD, respectively. Monthly NO3-N mass losses were simulated with NSE's of 0.76 and 0.66 for FD and CD, respectively. DRAINMOD-DSSAT well simulated CD-induced percent reductions in annual drainage flow (measured = 24.6%, simulated = 27.1%), and NO3-N losses (measured = 34.8%, simulated = 33.5%). Low percent error (PE) values were associated with the model predictions of corn yields (-1.3 <= PE <= 1.3) and soybean yields (-6.0 <= PE <= 12.6). Overall, results obtained from this relatively short-term modeling study demonstrated the potential use of DRAINMOD-DSSAT as a management design tool. Yet, further model testing CD effectiveness under different conditions is critically needed to establish a higher credibility in model predictions and to allow for further model improvement and expansion.

Seasonal water quality changes in on-farm water storage systems in a south-central US agricultural watershed	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												The objective of this study was to investigate the ability of on-farm water storage (OFWS) systems to mitigate off-site nutrient movement in a south-central U.S. agricultural watershed. We examined the seasonal water quality changes in an OFWS system by measuring several physical and chemical constituents at multiple sampling points throughout the system. Water quality sampling occurred every three weeks during the growing season and every six weeks during the dormant season from February 2012 to December 2014. The collected data were grouped into four seasons and then analyzed using boxplots along with the Wilcoxon and Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum tests for detecting changes in nutrient concentrations. Significant water quality changes were observed in the OFWS system by season and nutrient species, indicating a variation in downstream nutrient reduction with season. The in-ditch median removal efficiency, from the center of the tailwater recovery ditch to the outlet, was 54% during winter and 50% during spring for NO3-N; 60% during spring for NH3-N; 26% during autumn and 65% during winter for ortho-P; and 31% during winter and 10% during spring for TP. The in-pond median concentration removal efficiency was similar to 77% during summer for NO3-N, while the concentration remained stable during winter, spring and autumn; 53% from winter to spring and 58% from spring to summer for NH3-N; 70% from winter to spring for ortho-P, while remaining stable during the other seasons; and 28% from winter to spring and 55% from spring to summer for TP. Our results support the hypothesis that OFWS systems could mitigate downstream nutrient-enrichment pollution, especially during spring. The results obtained from this study offer a better insight into the behavior of OFWS systems and help enhance the management of agroecosystems from an ecological and hydrological perspective for water quality pollution control and water resource conservation.

The Celone, a temporary river case study	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												In a catchmnent, nitrogen (N) export from terrestrial ecosystems to rivers is controlled by the hydrological processes and N balance. In the present paper, the soil system N budget and riverine export were quantified in a Mediterranean watershed, the Celone (South-East, Italy).

Major N inputs derived from fertilizers and animal manure, corresponding for the whole watershed area to 68 and 12 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. N input from point sources was 1% of total input and atmospheric depositions measured in a gauging station near the study area was quantified in similar to 6 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). Crop N uptake was the main N output from agricultural land; it was estimated in similar to 37 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) by using data on crop yields provided by local farmers. Total flux of N in surface water was quantified for a year at the outlet of the study area by using continuous measures of flow and discrete measures of N concentrations carried out with a different frequency during the normal and low flow and when floods occurred. The hydrological regime of the stream, which is a temporary river, plays an important role in N transport. Water quality was found to vary considerably through the year in terms of both nutrient concentrations and loads. Riverine N export was quantified in 41% of total N input, and it was mainly transported during flood events, similar to 60% of the annual load was delivered during floods occurred in 38 days. Organic nitrogen and nitrate were the main N forms in surface water, and the contribution per hectare was about 24 and 14kg N, respectively. On a yearly basis, the difference between N inputs and outputs including riverine export was estimated in about 4 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) for the whole watershed area. This amount partly accumulates in soils in different N forms and the remaining part, mainly in form of nitrate, percolates through unsaturated soil towards groundwater. This study reports an important analysis of N pollution in a Mediterranean watershed with a temporary river system and limited data availability. Data acquisition and handling have proved to be an important challenge to overcome in N balance quantification. The results and the methodology of the present work can be useful for understanding nitrogen loss dynamics and for functional water management and land use planning. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Geochemical Characteristics and Groundwater Quality in the Vientiane Plain, Laos	EXPOSURE AND HEALTH												Groundwater from the shallow aquifers of the Vientiane Plain, Laos is used for domestic needs including to some extent for drinking and for household gardening. The objective of this study is to assess the groundwater quality for drinking and irrigation activities and to determine the processes that lead to the presence of major ions in groundwater. Twenty groundwater samples were collected from a village on the Plain in December 2014, January 2015, and May 2015, and analysed for major ions and selected suite of minor ions and heavy metals. Groundwater is largely acidic, fresh and soft in nature. Geochemistry showed dominant Ca-Mg-HCO3 and mixed Ca-Na-HCO3 groundwater. Sodium impacts the suitability of water for irrigation to some extent. Hydrogeochemical processes identified and verified through factor analysis indicate weathering, carbonate dissolution, ion exchange, and anthropogenic sources including salinisation, due to irrigation and use of fertilizers as sources for the occurrence of major ions at such concentrations in this area. Only concentrations of lead and iron were above the permissible limits with arsenic, copper, zinc, mercury, and uranium found to be within safe limits. Background sample (groundwater) collected 5 km from the study area and the bottled water sample were all within suitable limits for drinking. This study is the first to provide a local-level assessment of geochemical processes in groundwater of this area indicating that the groundwater does not pose any threat to human health if used for drinking based on major ions, minor ions and a suite heavy metals except for iron and lead.

Here we report nutrients, chlorophyll concentrations and stable carbon isotope ratios from the respective ponds to access differences in their potential impact on estuary water quality. Total phosphate and chlorophyll-a concentrations of pond water under the organic and intensive management method were different (i.e., 3.39 +/- 0.63 mu M and 17.87 +/- 7.89 mu M for total phosphate and 11.88 +/- 9.91 mu g/L and 64.46 mu g/L for chlorophyll-a, respectively). With the exception of pCO(2), parameters related to carbonate system also showed greater values in the organic pond compared to the intensive pond. Sediment total phosphorus concentrations were: 1.48 +/- 0.13 mg/g for the organic pond and 5.99 +/- 1.30 mg/g for the intensive pond. The mean stable carbon isotopic composition of the shrimp muscle tissues from the organic pond (delta C-13 =-17.1 +/- 0.0 parts per thousand and intensive pond (delta C-13 =-18.2 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand) were very similar, despite the fact that, compared to the delta C-13 value shrimp tissue, the feed in the intensive pond had very different carbon isotope ratios (delta C-13 =-25.3 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand). Pond water and sediments from the intensive shrimp farm, by having a higher phosphorus concentration, have a greater potential for causing estuary eutrophication compared to the organic shrimp farm. The small range in carbon isotope ratio between the shrimps from the two types of management indicates that the commercial shrimp feed had little contribution to the biomass of the cultured shrimp in the intensive shrimp pond.

Multiple lines of evidence to identify sewage as the cause of water quality impairment in an urbanized tropical watershed	WATER RESEARCH												Indicator bacteria, which are conventionally used to evaluate recreational water quality, can originate from various non-human enteric and extra-enteric sources, hence they may not be indicative of human health risk nor do they provide information on the sources of contamination. In this study we utilized traditional (enterococci and Escherichia coli) and alternative (Clostridium perfringens) indicator bacteria, F-specific coliphage, molecular markers for microorganisms associated with human sewage (human associated Bacteroides and polyomaviruses), and microbial community analysis tools (16S rRNA gene fragment amplicon sequencing), to identify and evaluate human sewage-related impact in the Manoa watershed in Honolulu, Hawaii. Elevated concentrations of enterococci (geometric mean ranging from 1604 to 2575 CFU 100 mL(-1)) and C perfringens (45-77 CFU 100 mL(-1)) indicated impairment of the urbanized section of the stream, while indicator bacteria concentrations decreased downstream in the tidally influenced Ala Wai Canal. The threshold values triggering water quality violation notifications in Hawaii were exceeded in 33.3-75.0% of samples collected at sites in the urbanized section of Manoa Stream, but were not exceeded in any of the samples collected at an upstream site located in a forested area. Correlation between indicator bacteria concentrations and rainfall amounts was weak to moderate but significant (E. coli R = 0.251, P = 0.009; enterococci R = 0.369, P < 0.001; C. perfringens R = 0.343, P < 0.001), while concentrations of human fecal-associated molecular markers were not significantly correlated with rainfall (human-associated Bacteroides, R = 0.131, P = 0.256; human-associated polyomaviruses, R = 0.213, P = 0.464). Presence of human sewage was confirmed by detection of human associated Bacteroides and human polyomavirus in the urbanized section of Manoa Stream (83.3 -100% and 41.7-66.7% positive samples respectively). It was further confirmed by microbial community analyses which suggested that an average 2.4-3.4% of the total bacterial population in this section was associated with sewage. Microbial community profiles were significantly influenced by rainfall (R-2 = 0.4390, P < 0.001), pH (R-2 = 0.3077, P = 0.006), salinity (R-2 = 0.2614, P = 0.038), and conductivity (R-2 = 0.2676, P = 0.031). Although microbial diversity fluctuated throughout the watershed, it was lower in the impaired section. Leaking sewer systems and illegal cross-connections are implicated in the impairment of the watershed, hence both the sewer and the storm water lines should be routinely inspected. Collectively, our data suggest that information derived from the analysis of microbial communities complements current marker-based microbial source tracking techniques and environmental monitoring programs.

However, even though these elements lead to improved water quality, the water quality may be impacted during its distribution through piped networks due to the processes such as pipe material release, biofilm formation and detachment, accumulation and resuspension of loose deposits. Irregular changes in supply-water quality may cause physiochemical and microbiological de-stabilization of pipe material, biofilms and loose deposits in the distribution system that have been established over decades and may harbor components that cause health or esthetical issues (brown water). Even though it is clearly relevant to customers' health (e.g., recent Flint water crisis), until now, switching of supply-water quality is done without any systematic evaluation. This article reviews the contaminants that develop in the water distribution system and their characteristics, as well as the possible transition effects during the switching of treated water quality by destabilization and the release of pipe material and contaminants into the water and the subsequent risks. At the end of this article, a framework is proposed for the evaluation of potential transition effects. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Uncertainty analysis for effluent trading planning using a Bayesian estimation-based simulation-optimization modeling approach	WATER RESEARCH												In this study, a Bayesian estimation-based simulation-optimization modeling approach (BESMA) is developed for identifying effluent trading strategies. BESMA incorporates nutrient fate modeling with soil and water assessment tool (SWAT), Bayesian estimation, and probabilistic possibilistic interval programming with fuzzy random coefficients (PPI-FRC) within a general framework. Based on the water quality protocols provided by SWAT, posterior distributions of parameters can be analyzed through Bayesian estimation; stochastic characteristic of nutrient loading can be investigated which provides the inputs for the decision making. PPI-FRC can address multiple uncertainties in the form of intervals with fuzzy random boundaries and the associated system risk through incorporating the concept of possibility and necessity measures. The possibility and necessity measures are suitable for optimistic and pessimistic decision making, respectively. BESMA is applied to a real case of effluent trading planning in the Xiangxihe watershed, China. A number of decision alternatives can be obtained under different trading ratios and treatment rates. The results can not only facilitate identification of optimal effluent-trading schemes, but also gain insight into the effects of trading ratio and treatment rate on decision making. The results also reveal that decision maker's preference towards risk would affect decision alternatives on trading scheme as well as system benefit. Compared with the conventional optimization methods, it is proved that BESMA is advantageous in (i) dealing with multiple uncertainties associated with randomness and fuzziness in effluent-trading planning within a multi source, multi-reach and multi-period context; (ii) reflecting uncertainties existing in nutrient transport behaviors to improve the accuracy in water quality prediction; and (iii) supporting pessimistic and optimistic decision making for effluent trading as well as promoting diversity of decision alternatives.

To explore this, we combined iron-reducing or substrate-limited anaerobic conditions and aerobic pilot-scale reactors directly at a wastewater treatment plant. To investigate the detoxification by these processes, we applied two in vitro bioassays for baseline toxicity (Microtox) and reactive toxicity (AREc32) as well as in vivo bioassays with aquatic model species in two laboratory experiments (Desmodesmus subspicatus, Daphnia magna) and two on-site, flow-through experiments (Potamopyrgus antipodarum, Lumbriculus variegatus). Moreover, we analyzed 31 commonly occurring micropollutants and 10 metabolites. The baseline toxicity of raw wastewater was effectively removed in full-scale and reactor scale activated sludge treatment (>85%), while the oxidative stress response was only partially removed (>61%). A combination of an anaerobic pre-treatment under iron reducing conditions and an aerobic nitrification significantly further reduced the residual in vitro toxicities by 46-60% and outperformed the second combination consisting of an aerobic pre-treatment and an anaerobic post-treatment under substrate limiting conditions (27-43%). Exposure to effluents of the activated sludge treatment did not induce adverse in vivo effects in aquatic invertebrates. Accordingly, no further improvement in water quality could be observed. Compared to that, the removal of persistent micropollutants was increased. However, this observation was restricted to a limited number of compounds and the removal of the sum concentration of all target micropollutants was relative low (14-17%). In conclusion, combinations of strictly anaerobic and aerobic processes significantly enhanced the removal of specific and non-specific in vitro toxicities. Thus, an optimization of biological wastewater treatment can lead to a substantially improved detoxification. These otherwise hidden capacities of a treatment technology can only be uncovered by a complementary biological analysis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Minnes, S; Vodden, K				Minnes, Sarah; Vodden, Kelly			The capacity gap: Understanding impediments to sustainable drinking water systems in rural Newfoundland and Labrador	CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL												This article outlines the results of a two-year research project that examined drinking water challenges in rural and small-town Newfoundland and Labrador. A mixed-methods approach was used, including literature review, media scans, a driver-pressure-state-impact-response analysis, policy workshops, community surveys and consultations, case studies and key informant interviews. This interdisciplinary study examined four interrelated components of drinking water systems: source water quality and quantity; water infrastructure and operations; public perception, awareness and demand; and policy and governance. Issues identified include: aging, degrading and inappropriate infrastructure; high disinfectant by-products; use and misuse of chlorine; long-term boil water advisories; use of untreated water sources; and minimal source water protection. As other studies have found elsewhere in Canada, local actors in Newfoundland and Labrador communities of 1000 or fewer often exhibit inadequate technical/human, social, institutional and financial capacity to address their drinking water challenges. New water policies and governance arrangements are needed that emphasize strategic and efficient investments, including the utilization of regional approaches, long-term planning and asset management activities. Furthermore, greater focus is needed on capacity development and the engagement and education of decision makers, staff, the public, and other groups that can help local governments address their drinking water challenges.																	0701-1784	1918-1817				JUN	2017	42	2					163	178		10.1080/07011784.2016.1256232								WOS:000399666600005						
J	Arya, FK; Zhang, L				Arya, Farid Khalil; Zhang, Lan			Copula-Based Markov Process for Forecasting and Analyzing Risk of Water Quality Time Series	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING												This study applies the copula-based Markov process to model water quality time series. The bivariate copula is applied to investigate the first-order Markov processes. The D-Vine copula is applied to investigate the more complicated higher-order (k >= 2) Markov processes. The Value-at-Risk (VaR), computed using the best-fitted copula-based Markov process, is applied for the risk analysis. Using water quality time series at the Snohomish River watershed (Washington) and the Chattahoochee River watershed (Georgia), the results show that the copula-based Markov processes (1) are able to properly model the temporal dependence for dissolved oxygen (DO) series [i.e., forecast root-mean-square error (RMSE) <1 mg/L at both watersheds] and temperature (T) series (i.e., forecast RMSE = 1.5 degrees C at the Chattahoochee watershed); and (2) can only predict the overall trend for nitrate and conductivity series, due to the fact that these two series also depend heavily on other factors (e.g., runoff). Overall, the study indicates that the copula-based Markov process may be an efficient tool in the assessment of water quality and the associated risks with the following advantages: (1) constructing the transitional probability explicitly and properly; (2) studying the temporal dependence independently from the marginal distributions; (3) avoiding the strict assumptions of the classic time series modeling approach (e.g., the time series belonging to the Gaussian process); and (4) providing a reasonable risk measure through the VaR.

Resuspension of Escherichia coli and MS2 Bacteriophage from Bed Sediment in Irrigation Canals	JOURNAL OF IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE ENGINEERING												Sediments are known to be potential reservoirs of pathogenic microorganisms that can influence the microbial quality of the overlaying water. A set of laboratory experiments was conducted to investigate the resuspension of Escherichia coli and the MS2 virus from bed sediment to the overlaying water in irrigation canals. Consequently, their concentration in moving water is dependent on flow properties (e.g., velocity, shear stress) and the size of bed sediment. When bed material is sandy loam, their quantity in water increases with the shear stress on bed surface. However, for a sandy bed, their presence in water has no apparent correlation with flow properties. The amount of MS2 virus in water was greater at low flow velocity and shear stress than Escherichia coli because the size of the MS2 virus is much smaller. Finally, an empirical relation was formulated for calculating the maximum allowable Escherichia coli concentration in sandy loamy bed sediment.

Setting water quality criteria for agricultural water reuse purposes	JOURNAL OF WATER REUSE AND DESALINATION												The use of reclaimed water for agricultural irrigation is practiced worldwide and will increase in the future. The definition of water quality limits is a useful instrument for the assessment of water quality regarding its suitability for irrigation purposes and the performance of wastewater treatment steps. This study elaborates water quality objectives for a water reuse project in a setting where national guidelines do not exist. Internationally established guidelines are therefore applied to the local context. Additional limits for turbidity, total suspended solids, biochemical and chemical oxygen demand, total phosphorus and potassium are suggested to meet the requirements of water reuse projects. Emphasis is put on water quality requirements prior to UV disinfection and nutrient requirements of cultivated crops. The presented values can be of assistance when monitoring reclaimed water quality. To facilitate the realization of water reuse projects, comprehensive and more detailed information, in particular on water quality requirements prior to disinfection steps, should be provided as well as regarding the protection of the irrigation infrastructure.																	2220-1319					JUN	2017	7	2					121	135		10.2166/wrd.2016.194								WOS:000400139700002

CBZ concentration increased by a factor of two (from 37 to ca. 70 ng/L) regardless of the treatment conditions, and its metabolites, 10,11-dihydro-10hydroxycarbamazepine (approximately 500 ng/L after SAT) and CBZ-10,11-epoxide (12-42 ng/L after SAT) were not effectively removed after SAT. Our results indicated that some metabolites of pharmaceuticals are present at much higher concentration than the original forms in the SAT effluent, and that some metabolites are more persistent during SAT with a relatively short retention time (i.e., 30 days). The study indicated that more attention should be paid to the formation and fate of metabolites in the water quality management of SAT effluent.																	2220-1319					JUN	2017	7	2					142	151		10.2166/wrd.2016.208								WOS:000400139700004

This new concept, addressed as water-reuse risk assessment program (WRAP), has been further developed from hazard analysis of critical control points (HACCP) to illustrate the potential hazards which are the roots of hindering intra-facility water reuse strategies. For industrial sectors applying water reclamation and reuse schemes, it is paramount that the reclaimed water quality stays within the desired quality. The objective of WRAP is to establish a new methodology and knowledge, which will contribute to the sustainable development of industrial water management, and demonstrate its capabilities in identifying and addressing any potential hazards in the selected schemes adoption by the industries. A 'what-if' scenario was simulated using a refinery as a case study to show strategies on how to benefit reclaimed or reuse water based on reliable, applied and scientific research within the process integration area. In conclusion, the WRAP model will facilitate operators, consultants and decision makers to reuse water on a fit-for-use basis whilst avoiding contaminant accumulation in the overall system and production of sub-quality products from inadequate processes after several reuses.																	2220-1319					JUN	2017	7	2					162	174		10.2166/wrd.2016.175								WOS:000400139700006

The results show that there is an appreciable difference between indices values for the same water sample. The results also show that water quality categorization for sampling stations in the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment WQI (CCMEWQI) and British Columbia WQI (BCWQI) was found to be 'marginal' for all sampling stations, except Hammam Boughrara reservoir and Mouillah wadi where it was found to be 'poor'. For the Aquatic Toxicity Index, it was found to be 'totally unsuitable for normal fish life' for all stations and 'suitable only for hardy fish species' for Mouillah wadi and Boughrara reservoir. The results show that this transboundary catchment always needs strategies for more effective pollution control management. Future use of WQIs in this way should prove a valuable tool for environmental planning decision-makers in tracking water quality change.

Multiobjective Optimization of Distributed Stormwater Harvesting Systems	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT												Stormwater harvesting (SWH) is an important water-sensitive urban design (WSUD) approach that provides an alternate water supply source and improves runoff quality through integrated systems of stormwater best management practice (BMP) technologies. In SWH system design, practitioners must account for trade-offs between cost, supply volume, and water quality improvement performance, which depend on design decisions for the type, size, and spatial distribution of BMPs. As such, the design of SWH systems with distributed BMPs is a complex, multiobjective optimization problem with a large decision space. This paper presents a multiobjective optimization framework to assess trade-offs in spatially distributed SWH system designs. The framework was applied to a case study for a housing development in Adelaide, South Australia. The results illustrated the potential benefits of distributing BMPs in an integrated SWH system where space at the catchment outlet is limited. Trade-offs between volumetric reliability and total suspended solids (TSS) reduction indicate that large gains in TSS reduction be achieved with limited reduction in volumetric reliability. Concept designs in low-cost/moderately reliable and low-cost/high TSS reduction trade-off regions contained biofilters in locations receiving large inflows.can (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

GISMOWA is a new GIS and risk-based analysis tool to identify and prioritize pipe segments for water quality monitoring and to comply with existing monitoring and sampling guidelines. The tool was designed to integrate multiple parameters categorized as (1) hydraulic and structural weaknesses in the system, e.g., residence time; (2) external threats, e.g., contaminated sites; and (3) sensitive consumers, e.g., hospitals, in a GIS environment. The tool used a multicriteria decision analysis to evaluate multiple monitoring site parameters and map zones particularly suitable for water quality monitoring.

S.			Bedload as an indicator of heavy metal contamination in a Brazilian anthropized watershed	CATENA												Heavy metal contamination has long been a water quality concern worldwide. Most studies have focused on heavy metal concentration in water through suspended sediment and bottom sediment; however, the concentration transported by river-bottom sediment, known as bedload, has not been taken into account. In order to fill this gap, this study aimed to determine the concentration of Hg, Pb, Cd, Ni, Cu, Cr, Zn, As, Fe and Mn in bedload of Ipojuca River which is an environmentally impacted river in Brazil. The use of bedload in heavy metal contamination studies raises the following question: Is the bedload an adequate indicator of heavy metal contamination? To answer this question, sediment contamination assessment was performed using sediment contamination indices, principal component analysis, and comparison with background values and sediment quality guidelines (SQGs). Comparing with sediment quality guidelines, the Probable Effect Level (PEL) and Threshold Effect Level (TEL) seem to underestimate the harmful effect on sediment-dwelling organisms, being essential either to calibrate the SQGs for site specific conditions or develop site specific guidelines. The pollution load index (PLI) indicated that the upstream and downstream sites were not polluted and polluted, respectively. Principal component analysis explained roughly 91% and 81% of the total variance in heavy metal contamination upstream and downstream, respectively, and distinguished natural and anthropogenic contributions in Ipojuca River. Multiple lines of evidence suggested that heavy metal concentrations in bedload were an adequate and feasible indicator of anthropogenic impacts. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study aims to spatially analyse the land degradation sensitivity in south-western Romania, a region currently known for this type of environmental deterioration. The analysis is based on mapping and assessing land susceptibility to degradation by means of a multifactorial approach using GIS techniques, such as the well-established MEDALUS (Mediterranean Desertification and Land Use) method. Widely used in the Mediterranean region and other areas worldwide due to advantageous features such as simplicity, flexibility and rapid implementation, the method was used in this study for the analysis of the main indicators identified to be driving forces of land degradation, i.e. Climate Quality Index, Soil Quality Index, Vegetation Quality Index and Management Quality Index The paper aims to adjust the method in relation to local conditions by considering certain additional variables (sub-indicators) for computing the main indicators, as well as by integrating a new regionally relevant indicator for this environmental issue Water Quality Index. The final results, assessed with the proposed Land Degradation Sensitivity Index (based on 21 sub-indicators, of which 15 are included in the original MEDALUS method, and 6 are additional), showed that approximately 70% of the total study area is critically sensitive to degradation, mainly due to high agricultural pressures and very low vegetation cover. Surprisingly, in terms of administration, it was found that >80% of the region's territorial administrative units include sectors which are critically exposed to degradation that exceed half their area. The results can constitute a basic support for regional-level decision makers who can implement the appropriate measures in order to attenuate the restrictive environmental conditions.

Quantifying the effects of conservation practice implementation on predicted runoff and chemical losses under climate change	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												The Soil and Water Assessment Tool with downscaled weather data generated using the MarkSim weather file generator was used to evaluate the impact of long-term conservation practice implementation on runoff, sediment, atrazine, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) losses in an agricultural watershed located in northeastern Indiana. As part of the Conservation Effects Assessment Project, evaluation of these conservation practices is required to provide insight on how their implementation is benefiting the environment. The results indicate that individual conservation practices were effective in reducing a particular pollutant load, but combined practices were more effective in reducing multiple pollutant loads simultaneously. Of the individual best management practices (BMPs) assessed, no-till was the most effective in reducing multiple pollutant loads (reduced surface runoff by an average of 25%, sediment by 46%, atrazine by 46%, total N by 9%, soluble P by 16%, and total P by 29%). When BMPs were combined, pollutant load reductions were increased significantly (at alpha = 0.05) for all pollutants, both under baseline and future climate scenarios. The reductions in runoff and pollutant loads for each decade of future climate ranged from 15 to 25% for surface runoff, 32-68% for sediment loss, 37-60% for atrazine loss, 5-13% for soluble N loss, 12-35% for total N loss, 9-41% for soluble P loss, and 33-60% for total P loss.

Snow disappearance timing is dominated by forest effects on snow accumulation in warm winter climates of the Pacific Northwest, United States	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Forests modify snow processes and affect snow water storage as well as snow disappearance timing. However, forest influences on snow accumulation and ablation vary with climate and topography and are therefore subject to temporal and spatial variability. We utilize multiple years of snow observations from across the Pacific Northwest, United States, to assess forest-snow interactions in the relatively warm winter conditions characteristic of maritime and transitional maritime-continental climates. We (a) quantify the difference in snow magnitude and disappearance timing between forests and open areas and (b) assess how forest modifications of snow accumulation and ablation combine to determine whether snow disappears later in the forest or in the open. We find that snow disappearance timing at 12 (out of 14) sites ranges from synchronous in the forest and open to snow persisting up to 13weeks longer in the open relative to a forested area. By analyzing accumulation and ablation rates up to the day when snow first disappears from the forest, we find that the difference between accumulation rates in the open and forest is larger than the difference between ablation rates. Thus, canopy snow interception and subsequent loss, rather than ablation, set up longer snow duration in the open. However, at two relatively windy sites (hourly average wind speeds up to 8 and 17m/s), differential snow disappearance timing is reversed: Snow persists 2-5weeks longer in the forest. At the windiest sites, accumulation rates in the forest and open are similar. Ablation rates are higher in the open, but the difference between ablation rates in the forest and open at these sites is approximately equivalent to the difference at less windy sites. Thus, longer snow retention in the forest at the windiest sites is controlled by depositional differences rather than by reduced ablation rates. These findings suggest that improved quantification of forest effects on snow accumulation processes is needed to accurately predict the effect of forest management or natural disturbance on snow water resources.

Annual runoff assessment in arid and semiarid Mediterranean watersheds under the Budyko's framework	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The solution of many practical water problems is strictly connected to the availability of reliable and widespread information about runoff. The estimation of mean annual runoff and its interannual variability for any basin over a wide region, even if ungauged, would be fundamental for both water resources assessment and planning and for water quality analysis. Starting from these premises, the main aim of this work is to show a new approach, based on the Budyko's framework, for mapping the mean annual surface runoff and deriving the probability distribution of the annual runoff in arid and semiarid watersheds. As a case study, the entire island of Sicily, Italy, is here proposed. First, time series data of annual rainfall, runoff, and reconstructed series of potential evapotranspiration have been combined within the Budyko's curve framework to obtain regional rules for rainfall partitioning between evapotranspiration and runoff. Then this knowledge has been used to infer long-term annual runoff at the point scale by means of interpolated rainfall and potential evapotranspiration. The long-term annual runoff raster layer has been obtained at each pixel of the drainage network, averaging the upstream runoff using advanced spatial analysis techniques within a GIS environment. Furthermore, 2 alternative methods are here proposed to derive the distribution of annual runoff, under the assumption of negligible interannual variations of basin water storage. The first method uses Monte Carlo simulations, combining rainfall and potential evapotranspiration randomly extracted from independent distributions. The second method is based on a simplification of the Budyko's curve and analytically provides the annual runoff distribution as the derived distribution of annual rainfall and potential evapotranspiration. Results are very encouraging: long-term annual runoff and its distribution have been derived and compared with historical records at several gauged stations, obtaining satisfactory matching.

Water and nitrogen movement through a semiarid dryland agricultural catchment: Seasonal and decadal trends	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Water and nutrient budgets in dryland agroecosystems are difficult to manage for efficiency and water quality. This is particularly true where complex terrain and soilscapes interact with pronounced hydrologic seasonality. The purpose of this research was to understand water and hydrologic nitrogen (N) export from a hillslope dryland agroecosystem in a semiarid region where most precipitation occurs outside the growing season. We studied 13years (2001-2013) of records of water and N inputs and outputs from a 12ha no-till artificially drained catchment in the semiarid Palouse Basin of eastern Washington State, USA. Fall- and winter-dominated annual precipitation averaged 462mm. About 350mm went to evapotranspiration; crops used similar to 160mm from stored soil water during the summer dry-down season. Soil water replenishment after crop senescence, during the fall wet-up season, delayed the threshold onset of the high-discharge season until December. Winter-dominated drainage fluxes averaged 111mm or 24% of annual precipitation. Nitrate export in drainage averaged 15kgNha(-1)year(-1), which was about 10 times the average rate of dissolved organic N export and 15% of the average rate of N application in chemical fertilizer. Fertilizer applications to the catchment were reduced, due to cropping changes, by 1/3 during the last 5years of the study; however, no corresponding reduction was observed in the nitrate export flux. This lack of change could not be attributed to mineralization of the soil-organic N legacy of fertilization nor to hydrologic lag of the catchment. Likeliest explanations are (a) despite the reduction, N application continued to exceed crop uptake and accumulation in organic matter; (b) seasonal and interannual variability of catchment connectivity resulted in year-to-year field-scale nitrate storage and carryover. Water and N use efficiencies observed here may be near maximum obtainable for existing crops in this climate. Substantial improvements that would also address multiple environmental issues associated with the N cascade may involve shifts to perennial systems and/or rotations in which N is fixed biologically.					/0000-0002-0446-2806												0885-6087	1099-1085				MAY 15	2017	31	10					1889	1899		10.1002/hyp.11152								WOS:000400854700005

Although still little is known about the ecological consequences of altered hydromorphology, understanding the factors at play can contribute to sustainable environmental management. In this study we aimed to identify the hydromorphological features controlling a key ecosystem function and the spatial scales where such linkages operate. As hydromorphological and chemical pressures often occur in parallel, we examined the relative importance of hydromorphological and chemical factors as determinants of leaf breakdown. Leaf breakdown assays were investigated at 82 sites of rivers throughout the French territory. Leaf breakdown data were then crossed with data on water quality and with a multi-scale hydro morphological assessment (i.e. upstream catchment, river segment, reach and habitat) when quantitative data were available. Microbial and total leaf breakdown rates exhibited differential responses to both hydromorphological and chemical alterations. Relationships between the chemical quality of the water and leaf breakdown were weak, while hydromorphological integrity explained independently up to 84.2% of leaf breakdown. Hydrological and morphological parameters were the main predictors of microbial leaf breakdown, whereas hydrological parameters had a major effect on total leaf breakdown, particularly at large scales, while morphological parameters were important at smaller scales. Microbial leaf breakdown were best predicted by hydromorphological features defined at the upstream catchment level whereas total leaf breakdown were best predicted by reach and habitat level geomorphic variables. This study demonstrates the use of leaf breakdown in a biomonitoring context and the importance of hydromorphological integrity for the functioning of running water. It provides new insights for environmental decision-makers to identify the management and restoration actions that have to be undertaken including the hydromorphogical features that should be kept in minimal maintenance to support leaf breakdown.

J	Su, Y; Gao, B; Mao, L				Su, Yu; Gao, Bin; Mao, Liang			Concurrent agglomeration and straining govern the transport of C-14-labeled few-layer graphene in saturated porous media	WATER RESEARCH												Deposition of graphene on environmental surfaces will dictate its transport and risks. In this work, the deposition, mobilization, and transport of C-14-labeled few-layer graphene (FLG) in saturated quartz sand were systematically examined. Increasing solution ionic strength (IS) (1-100 mmol/L NaCl) resulted in greater retention of FLG (33-89%) in the sand and more hyper-exponential distribution of FLG along the sand column. Only a small fraction (<= 7.4%) of the retained FLG was remobilized due to perturbation of IS by deionized water. These results indicate that trapping in pore spaces (i.e., physical straining) plays a dominant role in FLG deposition rather than attachment onto the surfaces of the sand. When IS, FLG input concentration, and flow velocity favor particle-particle interaction over particle-collector interaction, concurrent agglomeration within the pores promotes straining. In addition, electrostatic and steric repulsion that derived from the adsorbed organic macromolecules on FLG effectively reduced agglomeration and thereby enhanced transport and release of FLG. Moreover, the recovery of FLG (that deposited at 100 mmol/L NaCl) in the effluent reached 33% after speeding up the deionized water flushing rate. These findings highlight the need for FLG management in view of variations in transport behavior when assessing water quality and associated risks. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Krueger, T				Krueger, Tobias			Bayesian inference of uncertainty in freshwater quality caused by low-resolution monitoring	WATER RESEARCH												Regulatory, low temporal resolution monitoring of freshwater quality does not fully capture the frequency distributions of the requisite parameters, particularly those that are highly skewed and heavy tailed. Hence the summary statistics ultimately compared to environmental standards are uncertain. Quantifying this uncertainty is crucial for robust water quality assessment and possible remediation, but requires strong assumptions. This paper compares three ways to model the missing data needed to fully characterise a frequency distribution in a Bayesian framework using multi-year/multi-location orthophosphate (arithmetic mean standard), dissolved oxygen (DO; 10th percentile standard) and ammonia (90th percentile standard) data from the Tamar catchment in Southwest England. First, fitting an assumed parametric model of the frequency distribution (lognormal or Weibull), there is appreciable uncertainty around the "best" model fit. Second, Bayesian Model Averaging is more general in accommodating cases where the data are ambiguous with regard to the best model, but does not take into account possibly missing data. Third, a quasi-nonparametric multinomial model of the monitoring process that places some weight on those missing data yields wider and heavier-tailed frequency distributions. One-at-a-time sensitivity analysis suggests that the multinomial model for mean orthophosphate is sensitive to the choice of support range and the prior weights given to the missing data. Sensitivity is lower for 10th percentile DO and 90th percentile ammonia. The resultant probability densities of ecological status under the EU Water Framework Directive span several status classes, meaning ecological status is more uncertain than previously acknowledged. For orthophosphate, the regulatory, empirical determination of ecological status is not only overly precise but also biased. (C) 2017 The Author.

J	Wan, YS; Wan, L; Li, YC; Doering, P				Wan, Yongshan; Wan, Lei; Li, Yuncong; Doering, Peter			Decadal and seasonal trends of nutrient concentration and export from highly managed coastal catchments	WATER RESEARCH												Understanding anthropogenic and hydro-climatic influences on nutrient concentrations and export from highly managed catchments often necessitates trend detection using long-term monitoring data. This study analyzed the temporal trend (1979-2014) of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations and export from four adjacent coastal basins in south Florida where land and water resources are highly managed through an intricate canal network. The method of integrated seasonal-trend decomposition using LOESS (LOcally weighted regrESSion) was employed for trend detection. The results indicated that long-term trends in TN and TP concentrations (increasing/decreasing) varied with basins and nutrient species, reflecting the influence of basin specific land and water management practices. These long-term trends were intervened by short-term highs driven by high rainfall and discharges and lows associated with regional droughts. Seasonal variations in TP were more apparent than for TN. Nutrient export exhibited a chemostatic behavior for TN from all the basins, largely due to the biogenic nature of organic N associated with the ubiquity of organic materials in the managed canal network. Varying degrees of chemodynamic export was present for TP, reflecting complex biogeochemical responses to the legacy of long-term fertilization, low soil P holding capacity, and intensive stormwater management. The anthropogenic and hydro-climatic influences on nutrient concentration and export behavior had great implications in nutrient loading abatement strategies for aquatic ecosystem restoration of the downstream receiving waterbody.

With a global focus, the pertinent practical, theoretical and social aspects of RWH are reviewed in order to ascertain the state of the art. Avenues for future research are also identified. A major finding is that the degree of RWH systems implementation and the technology selection are strongly influenced by economic constraints and local regulations. Moreover, despite design protocols having been set up in many countries, recommendations are still often organized only with the objective of conserving water without considering other potential benefits associated with the multiple-purpose nature of RWH. It is suggested that future work on RWH addresses three priority challenges. Firstly, more empirical data on system operation is needed to allow improved modelling by taking into account multiple objectives of RWH systems. Secondly, maintenance aspects and how they may impact the quality of collected rainwater should be explored in the future as a way to increase confidence on rainwater use. Finally, research should be devoted to the understanding of how institutional and socio-political support can be best targeted to improve system efficacy and community acceptance.

Natural organic matter (NOM) removal by EC was enhanced due to (i) greater degree of NOM protonation by maintaining a slightly acidic pH during electrolysis, compared with that of minimum aluminum solubility (pH of 5.5 compared to 6.2), (ii) providing sufficient contact time during electrolysis and flocculation by utilizing intermediate current density (10 mA/cm(2)), and (iii) combination of charge neutralization and sweep coagulation by increasing aluminum dosage. Direct evidence for removal of the hydrophobic fraction of NOM along with a portion of the hydrophilic moieties by EC-MF compared to MF-only was provided by attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. NF flux profiles with EC-MF pretreatment of natural saline water were nearly identical to that of a model solution with similar ionic composition with no added NOM suggesting insignificant role of organic fouling. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed trace amounts of CaCO3 precipitates after EC-MF pretreatment, confirmed by electron microscopy, that caused only minor flux decline. Finally, NF achieves excellent strontium removal as well as other divalent ions and. NOM. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

It integrates numerical simulation, meta-modeling analysis, and fuzzy programming within a general framework. A set of models between remediation strategies and remediation performance can well guarantee the mitigation in computational efforts in the simulation and optimization process. In order to prevent the occurrence of over-optimistic and pessimistic optimization strategies, a high satisfaction level resulting from the implementation of a flexible standard can indicate the degree to which the environmental standard is satisfied. The proposed approach is applied to a naphthalene-contaminated site in China. Results show that a longer remediation period corresponds to a lower total pumping rate and a stringent risk standard implies a high total pumping rate. The wells located near or in the down-gradient direction to the contaminant sources have the most significant efficiency among all of remediation schemes.																	1061-4303	1554-7531				MAY 1	2017	89	5					456	465		10.2175/106143017X14839994523541								WOS:000411925000008	28442006

Physical and isotopic characteristics in peri-urban landscapes: a case study at the lower Volta River Basin, Ghana	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The study presents the application of selected multivariate techniques: display methods (principal component analysis) and unsupervised pattern recognition (cluster analysis) in an attempt to discriminate sources of variation of water quality. PCA has allowed the identification of a reduced number of latent factors with a hydrochemical meaning: natural and anthropogenic (domestic and agricultural activities) factors, which also agrees with the R-mode hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). Q-mode HCA also corroborates the results of the correlation analysis in relation to sampling sites established on hydrochemical parameters, indicating that there are no spatial and temporal characteristics among the sampling sites in the study area. The suitability of river water for irrigation use was assessed in the study area. A plot of the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) and salinity data on a semilog axis suggests that river water provides good irrigation quality in the area. According to the SAR values plotted in the USSL Staff diagram, 100 % of the river water samples fall in C1S1 (low salinity-low sodium type) group, which provides good irrigation quality to river water from this area. Also, all the data points showed permeability index values in Class II category which is suitable for irrigation purposes. Recorded magnesium ratio and Kelly's ratio showed that <50 % of the river water samples were suitable for irrigation purposes. Stable isotope data of water (delta O-18 and delta H-2) obtained revealed that stream waters joining the Volta River were depleted and possibly recharged by rain and waters from the Akwapim Mountains (located at the western part of the Volta River) than the isotopically heavy evaporated waters found within the Lower Volta River. These results would therefore be useful for water balance studies in the study area.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				MAY	2017	7	2					729	744		10.1007/s13201-015-0286-y								WOS:000411081600017

The ionic relations (Ca2+ + Mg2+:HCO3-, Ca2+ + Mg2+:SO42- + HCO3-, Na+ + K+:TC, Na+ + K+:Cl- + SO42-, HCO3-: TC, HCO3-: Ca2+ + Mg2+, Na+:Cl- and Na+:Ca2+) indicate that the rock weathering, mineral dissolution, evaporation and ion exchange are the processes to control the aquifer chemistry. Anthropogenic and marine sources are also the supplementary factors for brackish water quality. These observations are further supported by Gibbs mechanisms that control the water chemistry. Thus, the study suggests that the initial quality of groundwater of geogenic origin has been subsequently modified by the influences of anthropogenic and marine sources.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				MAY	2017	7	2					813	822		10.1007/s13201-015-0294-y								WOS:000411081600024

Application of multivariate statistical analysis concepts for assessment of hydrogeochemistry of groundwater-a study in Suri I and II blocks of Birbhum District, West Bengal, India	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Multivariate statistical techniques, cluster and principal component analysis were applied to the data on groundwater quality of Suri I and II Blocks of Birbhum District, West Bengal, India, to extract principal factors corresponding to the different sources of variation in the hydrochemistry as well as the main controls on the hydrochemistry. For this, bore well water samples have been collected in two phases, during Post-monsoon (November 2012) and Pre-monsoon (April 2013) from 26 sampling locations spread homogeneously over the two blocks. Excess fluoride in groundwater has been reported at two locations both in post-and in pre-monsoon sessions, with a rise observed in pre-monsoon. Localized presence of excess iron has also been observed during both sessions. The water is found to be mildly alkaline in post-monsoon but slightly acidic at some locations during pre-monsoon. Correlation and cluster analysis studies demonstrate that fluoride shares a moderately positive correlation with pH in post-monsoon and a very strong one with carbonate in pre-monsoon indicating dominance of rock water interaction and ion exchange activity in the study area. Certain locations in the study area have been reported with less than 0.6 mg/l fluoride in groundwater, leading to possibility of occurrence of severe dental caries especially in children. Low values of sulfate and phosphate in water indicate a meager chance of contamination of groundwater due to anthropogenic factors.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				MAY	2017	7	2					873	888		10.1007/s13201-015-0299-6								WOS:000411081600029

Assessment of heavy metal and bacterial pollution in coastal aquifers from SIPCOT industrial zones, Gulf of Mannar, South Coast of Tamil Nadu, India	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Heavy metals and microbiological contamination were investigated in groundwater in the industrial and coastal city of Thoothukudi. The main sources of drinking water in this area are water bores which are dug up to the depth of 10-50 m in almost every house. A number of chemical and pharmaceutical industries have been established since past three decades. Effluents from these industries are reportedly being directly discharged onto surrounding land, irrigation fields and surface water bodies forming point and non-point sources of contamination for groundwater in the study area. The study consists of the determination of physico-chemical properties, trace metals, heavy metals and microbiological quality of drinking water. Heavy metals were analysed using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry and compared with the (WHO in Guidelines for drinking water quality, 2004) standards. The organic contamination was detected in terms of most probable number (MPN) test in order to find out faecal coliforms that were identified through biochemical tests. A comparison of the results of groundwater samples with WHO guidelines reveals that most of the groundwater samples are heavily contaminated with heavy metals like arsenic, selenium, lead, boron, aluminium, iron and vanadium. The selenium level was higher than 0.01 mg/l in 82 % of the study area and the arsenic concentration exceeded 0.01 mg/l in 42 % of the area. The results reveal that heavy metal contamination in the area is mainly due to the discharge of effluents from copper industries, alkali chemical industry, fertiliser industry, thermal power plant and sea food industries. The results showed that there are pollutions for the groundwater, and the total Coliform means values ranged from 0.6-145 MPN ml(-1), faecal Coliform ranged from 2.2-143 MPN ml(-1), Escherichia coli ranged from 0.9 to 40 MPN ml(-1) and faecal streptococci ranged from 10-9.20 x 10(2) CFU ml(-1). The coastal regions are highly contaminated with total coliform bacteria, faecal coliform bacteria and E. coli. This might be due to the mixing of sewage from Thoothukudi town through the Buckle channel and fishing activity.

Temporal water quality response in an urban river: a case study in peninsular Malaysia	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Ambient water quality is a prerequisite for the health and self-purification capacity of riverine ecosystems. To understand the general water quality situation, the time series data of selected water quality parameters were analyzed in an urban river in Peninsular Malaysia. In this regard, the stations were selected from the main stem of the river as well as from the side channel. The stations located at the main stem of the river are less polluted than that in the side channel. Water Quality Index scores indicated that the side channel station is the most polluted, breaching the Class IV water quality criteria threshold during the monitoring period, followed by stations at the river mouth and the main channel. The effect of immediate anthropogenic waste input is also evident at the side channel station. The Organic Pollution Index of side channel station is (14.99) similar to 3 times higher than at stations at river mouth (4.11) and similar to 6 times higher than at the main channel (2.57). The two-way ANOVA showed significant difference among different stations. Further, the factor analysis on water quality parameters yielded two significant factors. They discriminated the stations into two groups. The land- use land cover classification of the study area shows that the region near the sampling sites is dominated by urban settlements (33.23 %) and this can contribute significantly to the deterioration of ambient river water quality. The present study estimated the water quality condition and response in the river and the study can be an immediate yardstick for base lining river water quality, and a basis for future water quality modeling studies in the region.

Surface water characteristics and trace metals level of the Bonny/New Calabar River Estuary, Niger Delta, Nigeria	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Surface water samples from three stations in the Bonny/New Calabar River Estuary were analyzed for the physicochemical characteristics and trace metal level in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Results show pH ranged from 7.56 to 7.88 mg/L; conductivity, 33,489.00 to 33,592.00 mu Scm(-1); salinity, 15.33 to 15.50 parts per thousand; turbidity, 4.35 to 6.65 NTU; total dissolved solids, 22111.00 to 23263.00 gm(-3); dissolved oxygen, 4.53 to 6.65 mg/L; and biochemical oxygen demand, 1.72 mg/L. The level of some trace metals (Ca, Mg, K, Zn, Pb, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, and Na) were also analyzed by Atomic absorption spectrometry with K, Zn, and Co being statistically significant (P < 0.05). The results were compared with USEPA and WHO Permissible Limits for water quality standards. It was observed that the water quality parameters in the Bonny Estuary show seasonal variation with higher values for pH, DO, BOD, temperature, and salinity during the dry season than wet season. Concentrations of trace metals such as Pb, Cd, Zn, Ni, and Cr were higher than stipulated limits by WHO (2006). The result of the Metal Pollution Index suggests that the river was slightly affected and therefore continuous monitoring is necessary to avert possible public health implications of these metals on consumers of water and seafood from the study area.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				MAY	2017	7	2					951	959		10.1007/s13201-015-0306-y								WOS:000411081600035

Assessment of surface water quality of inland valleys for cropping in SW Nigeria	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Inland valley agro-ecosystems which are a category of wetlands have potential for sustainable crop production relative to uplands. A major challenge to their utilisation in the study area is their heterogeneity in hydrology, morphology, soil types and agro-economy. The study assessed the surface water quality of three typologies of the agro-ecosystems-amphitheatre-like valley-heads (Am), valley-side (VS), and low depression (LD)-for cropping. Surface water of six sites were sampled during the wet and dry seasons. The physicochemical properties and metal concentrations of the samples were analysed. Descriptive statistics and water quality indices were used to assess the suitability of the waters of the agro-ecosystems for cropping. Results showed that the valleys have neutral to slightly alkaline waters. Values of physicochemical parameters are generally within the acceptable range for cropping. The concentration of major cations varied across the inland valley types, but exhibited similar characteristics within each valley. The dominance of the major cations is in the order of Na > Ca > K > Mg. ANOVA results indicated that there is no significant difference in the concentration of heavy metals across the valleys (F = 2.044, p = 0.138, alpha = 0.05). Generally, most of the physicochemical parameters and trace metals have low concentrations and are non-toxic to plants. Values of water quality indices (sodium adsorption ratio, soluble sodium percentage, total dissolved solids and permeability index) indicated that the concentrations of minerals in waters across the valley typologies are generally within permissible limits for cropping.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				MAY	2017	7	2					987	996		10.1007/s13201-015-0309-8								WOS:000411081600037

Environmental assessment of water and soil contamination in Rajakhali Canal of Karnaphuli River (Bangladesh) impacted by anthropogenic influences: a preliminary case study	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Soil and water quality determines the health of an aquatic ecosystem. Rajakhali Canal, a tributary of Karnaphuli River estuary, flowing through Chittagong City (the commercial capital of Bangladesh) receives a huge amount of domestic and industrial wastes and sewages. Monitoring the environmental status of Karnaphuli River and its tributaries is very important for their ecological and economical services provided to city areas. This study evaluated some environmental characteristics of water and soil in the Rajakhali Canal as it affected the environment, and ultimately the life and human beings of Chittagong City. The mean concentrations of physicochemical parameters were pH (8.5), DO (0.1 mg/L), TA (47.6 mg/L), TDS (631.8 mg/L), TSS (280 mg/L), SO4-S (2.3 mg/L), NH3 (1.1 mg/L), NO3-N (0.2 mg/L) and PO4P (0.1 mg/L) in the dry season. During the rainy season, the mean concentrations of physico-chemical parameters were pH (7.01), DO (0.55 mg/L), TA (65.9 mg/L), TDS 653.6 mg/L), TSS (300.3 mg/L), SO4-S (1 mg/L), NH3- (0.6 mg/L), (NO3-N (0.3 mg/L) and PO4-P (0.5 mg/L) in water. In case of soil, the mean concentration of physicochemical parameters in dry and rainy seasons was represented respectively as follows: pH (6.8), OM (4.5 %), sand (71.7 %), silt (3.1 %), clay (25.2 %), organic nitrogen (45.4 ppm) and phosphorus (9.6 ppm); and pH (6.7), OM (4.5 %), sand (74.4 %), silt (2.4 %), clay (23.2 %), organic nitrogen (35.3 ppm) and phosphorus (7.6 ppm). The result revealed that water and soil quality of this canal became deteriorated and that the total environment of the water body became polluted due to the anthropogenic activities such as industrial, domestic and irrigation effluents. Statistical analyses also supported that water and soil parameters were strongly correlated (1tailed 0.05 level and 0.01 level significant) with each other at all stations during all seasons. The result of this study will be useful for management and planning for water quality monitoring in this estuary. To protect this vital estuarine region, the government agencies, private agencies and scientists should work with proper attention.

J	Park, Y; Choi, Y; Lee, S				Park, Younjong; Choi, Yongjun; Lee, Sangho			Analysis of membrane fouling in a pilot-scale microfiltration plant using mathematical model and artificial neural network model	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												Since membrane fouling is one of major challenges in hollow fiber microfiltration (MF) membrane processes, many studies have been done to analyze and control it in laboratory-scale systems. However, relatively few works have been accomplished for fundamental understanding of the fouling in pilotor full-scale systems. Accordingly, this study intended to predict membrane fouling in a pilot-scale MF plant using a mathematical model and a statistical model based on artificial neural network (ANN). The effects of temperature, turbidity, total organic carbon, total operating time, and filtration time after chemical cleaning on the membrane fouling were considered. The major fouling mechanism was determined to be cake formation regardless of feed water quality changes. The cake formation model was found to be useful in explaining the membrane fouling in the short-term prediction of pilot-scale hollow fiber submerged membrane system. The results of application of the ANN model indicated high correlation coefficient between the measured and predicted output variables. Therefore, it appears that the ANN model is applicable in the long-term prediction of the membrane performance at different water qualities of the pilot-scale system.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				MAY	2017	77						69	74		10.5004/dwt.2017.20661								WOS:000407719900009

Accordingly, this study focused on the application of microfiltration (MF) together with coagulation for the treatment of the paper mill wastewater. A statistical model based on the response surface methodology (RSM) was attempted to determine the optimum coagulation conditions (i.e., coagulant dose, pH, and temperature). Empirical models were developed to understand the interactive correlation between the responses and process variables. After the coagulation, the MF membranes prepared by an electrospinning method were used to treat the wastewater. Nevertheless, it seems that the coagulation conditions optimized for water quality parameters are not always the appropriate conditions for pretreatment of MF feed water.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				MAY	2017	77						83	88		10.5004/dwt.2017.20676								WOS:000407719900011						
J	Itsukushima, R; Morita, K; Shimatani, Y				Itsukushima, Rei; Morita, Kai; Shimatani, Yukihiro			The Use of Molluscan Fauna as Model Taxon for the Ecological Classification of River Estuaries	WATER												River estuaries are important aquatic environments characterized by large environmental gradients in their water quality, riverbed material, and microtopography in the longitudinal and transverse directions. The geography or habitats in river estuaries differ depending on the energy from the tide, waves, and river; therefore, the biota inhabiting river estuaries vary depending on the river estuary type. In view of this, for effective conservation in river estuaries, there is a need for information about potential habitats and biota based on objective data about the river estuary type. The objective of this study thus was to classify river estuaries by their molluscan fauna and physical indicators to reveal the relationship between molluscan fauna and the physical environment. The classification results using physical indicators indicated three types of river estuaries (wave energy-dominated group, tide energy-dominated group, and low tide and wave energy group). This classification result was similar to the classification of molluscan fauna. Therefore, it was suggested that molluscan fauna is extremely useful as a variable representing the river estuary environment. From the comparison between molluscan fauna and the physical environment, some rivers were not classified into the same group in the classification of molluscan fauna, despite them having similar physical environments. Some of these rivers with a molluscan fauna that diverged from expectations had undergone channel modification, which is expected to have caused a shift in this fauna group. These results suggest that this approach could be used to identify rivers that have been degraded by human activities.

To understand the pollutant transport behaviors in Tieshangang Bay, we developed a combination model (MIKE 21 FM) of the hydrodynamic module and particle tracking module. Simulation results suggest that the water velocities in the west and east troughs (near the entrance of the bay) are distinctly higher than any other areas. Meanwhile, small semi-enclosed bays adjacent to the shoreline could affect local water flow patterns, thereby causing gyres within them. The residence time of pollutants in Tieshangang Bay is significantly affected by seasonal variations (i.e., the residence time of pollutants in Tieshangang Bay in winter is less than that in summer). The results of transport trajectory simulations reveal that the bay head is a slow flushing zone, while the entrance of the bay (west trough) can be identified as a fast flushing zone.

J	Li, D; Jiang, X; Zheng, BH				Li, Da; Jiang, Xia; Zheng, Binghui			Using delta N-15 and delta O-18 Signatures to Evaluate Nitrate Sources and Transformations in Four Inflowing Rivers, North of Taihu Lake	WATER												Taihu Lake is the third largest freshwater lake in China. Due to rapid economic development and excessive nutrient discharges, there is serious eutrophication in the northern part of the lake. Nitrogen (N) is one of the key factors for eutrophication in Taihu Lake, which mainly comes from the rivers around the lake. Samples from four inflowing rivers were analysed for delta N-15 and delta O-18 isotopes in December 2013 to identify the different sources of nitrogen in the northern part of Taihu Lake. The results indicated that the water quality in Taihu Lake was clearly influenced by the water quality of the inflowing rivers and nitrate (NO3--N) was the main component of the soluble inorganic nitrogen in water. The soil organic N represented more than 70% of the total NO3--N loads in the Zhihugang. Domestic sewage was the major NO3--N source in the Liangxi river, with a contribution of greater than 50%. Soil organic N and domestic sewage, with contributions of more than 30% and 35% respectively, were the major NO3--N sources in the Lihe river and Daxigang river. Denitrification might be responsible for the shifting delta N-15-NO3- and delta O-18-NO3- values in the Daxigang river, and a mixing process may play a major role in N transformations in the Lihe river in winter. The results of this study will be useful as reference values for reducing NO3- pollution in the inflowing rivers in the north of Taihu Lake.																	2073-4441					MAY	2017	9	5							345	10.3390/w9050345								WOS:000404558100045

SIRM can also control the variability of the recourse cost as well as capture the notion of risk in stochastic programming. Then, the SIRM model is applied to water pollution control of the Xiangxihe watershed. Tradeoffs between risks and benefits are evaluated, indicating any change in the targeted benefit and risk level would yield varied expected benefits. Results disclose that the uncertainty of system components and risk preference of decision makers have significant effects on the watershed's production generation pattern and pollutant control schemes as well as system benefit. Decision makers with risk-aversive attitude would accept a lower system benefit (with lower production level and pollutant discharge); a policy based on risk-neutral attitude would lead to a higher system benefit (with higher production level and pollutant discharge). The findings can facilitate the decision makers in identifying desired product generation plans in association with financial risk minimization and pollution mitigation.

Algal Bioproductivity in Turbulent Water: An Experimental Study	WATER												Excessive growth of biomass causes eutrophication and other related water quality problems. For the past several decades, these problems have been managed based on the principle of limiting nutrient, which is to reduce the loading of essential nutrients-either nitrogen or phosphorus-through point and non-point waste source control. More recent research efforts indicated that eutrophication of a natural water body such as a lake or a reservoir can be controlled alternatively by altering its turbulent intensity. The success of this alternative approach depends on more knowledge on the intimate relationship between turbulent intensity and the bioproductivity of a water body. In this experimental study, an oscillating grid turbulence (OGT) reactor was constructed to evaluate the effect of turbulent pulsation strength in terms of vibration frequency on algae bioproductivity under adequate nutrient, light, and temperature conditions. Experimental results showed that moderate turbulent intensity with vibration frequency of 0.5 Hz or less increased algal growth; with a vibration frequency of 1.0 Hz, the observed peak chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentration in the reactor was 0.112 mg/L. The experimental results also showed that strong turbulent intensity with vibration frequency of 1.5 Hz or more reduced algal growth; with vibration frequency of 1.5 Hz, the observed peak Chl-a concentration in the reactor was only 0.06 mg/L, which was even lower than the observed peak Chl-a concentration in the reactor with stationary water. In this study, the effect of water turbulence on algal bioproductivity was further verified with experimental data on the variations of other relevant water quality parameters in the OGT reactor including total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), pH, and dissolved oxygen (DO).																	2073-4441					MAY	2017	9	5							304	10.3390/w9050304								WOS:000404558100005						
J	Shi, LL; Mao, ZH; Wu, JP; Liu, ML; Zhang, YW; Wang, Z				Shi, Liangliang; Mao, Zhihua; Wu, Jiaping; Liu, Mingliang; Zhang, Yiwei; Wang, Zheng			Variations in Spectral Absorption Properties of Phytoplankton, Non-Algal Particles and Chromophoric Dissolved Organic Matter in Lake Qiandaohu	WATER												Light absorption by phytoplankton, non-algal particles (NAP) and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) was investigated at 90 sites of a clear, deep artificial lake (Lake Qiandaohu) to study natural variability of absorption coefficients. Our study shows that CDOM absorption is a major contributor to the total absorption signal in Lake Qiandaohu during all seasons, except autumn when it has an equivalent contribution as total particle absorption. The exponential slope of CDOM absorption varies within a narrow range around a mean value of 0.0164 nm(-1) (sd = 0.00176 nm(-1)). Our study finds some evidence for thIS autochthonous production of CDOM in winter and spring. Absorption by phytoplankton, and therefore its contribution to total absorption, is generally greatest in spring, suggesting that phytoplankton growth in Lake Qiandaohu occurs predominantly in the spring. Phytoplankton absorption in freshwater lakes generally has a direct relationship with chlorophyll-a concentration, similar to the one established for open ocean waters. The NAP absorption, whose relative contribution to total absorption is highest in summer, has a spectral shape that can be well fitted by an exponential function with an average slope of 0.0065 nm(-1) (sd = 0.00076 nm(-1)). There is significant spatial variability present in the summer of Lake Qiandaohu, especially in the northwestern and southwestern extremes where the optical properties of the water column are strongly affected by the presence of allochthonous matter. Variations in the properties of the particle absorption spectra with depths provides evidence that the water column was vertically inhomogeneous and can be monitored with an optical measurement program. Moreover, the optical inhomogeneity in winter is less obvious. Our study will support the parameterization of the Bio-optical model for Lake Qiandaohu from in situ or remotely sensing aquatic color signals.																	2073-4441					MAY	2017	9	5							352	10.3390/w9050352								WOS:000404558100052						
J	Turcotte, B; Morse, B				Turcotte, Benoit; Morse, Brian			The Winter Environmental Continuum of Two Watersheds	WATER												This paper examines the winter ecosystemic behavior of two distinct watersheds. In cold-temperate regions, the hydrological signal and environmental parameters can fluctuate dramatically over short periods of time, causing major impacts to aquatic habitats. This paper presents the results of the 2011-2012 winter field campaign in streams and rivers near Quebec City, QC, Canada. The objective was to quantify water quantity and quality parameters and their environmental connectivity from headwater creeks above to the larger rivers below over the entire freeze-up, mid-winter and breakup periods with a view toward exploring the watershed continuum. The paper presents how aquatic pulses (water level, discharge, temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen and turbidity, measured at seven sites on an hourly basis along channels of different sizes and orders) evolve through the aquatic environment. Ice conditions and the areal ice coverage were also evaluated (on a daily time step along each instrumented channel). Some findings of the investigation revealed that water temperatures remained well above 0 degrees C during winter in headwater channels, that dissolved oxygen levels during winter were relatively high, but with severe depletions prior to and during breakup in specific settings, that high conductivity spikes occurred during runoff events, that annual turbidity extremes were measured in the presence of ice and that dynamic ice cover breakup events have the potential to generate direct or indirect mortality among aquatic species and to dislodge the largest rocks in the channel. The authors believe that the environmental impact of a number of winter fluvial processes needs to be further investigated, and the relative significance of the winter period in the annual environmental cycle should be given additional attention.																	2073-4441					MAY	2017	9	5							337	10.3390/w9050337								WOS:000404558100037

Direct laboratory methods have long lead times; indirect methods (refraction, pH, conductivity, turbidity, etc.) would be suitable as they measure indirect values, so correlations must be found between the measured values and the component(s) for analysis. These correlations are often stochastic in nature having a standard deviation of the same magnitude as the measured values. This paper deals with pharmaceutical wastewater with a high sucrose content, the online measurement of its organic material content characterised by chemical oxygen demand (CODcr), refraction and resistance. It finds a correlation between the CODcr and resistance-corrected refraction (r*). To reduce the standard deviation, the concept of cumulative CODcr is introduced. Concentration limit values could be determined to compare with the cumulative CODcr values calculated continuously during the fill up of the wastewater tank. This means that the treatment with the wastewater (into the drain, dilution and transfer) can be decided. The validity of the model is checked by trial calculations based on a high number of measurements.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				MAY	2017	75						268	273		10.5004/dwt.2017.20401								WOS:000404396100029

It has a catchment of similar to 450000 km(2) in the boundary region between Northern Mongolia and Southern Siberia. Climate, land use and dynamic socioeconomic changes go along with rising water abstractions and contaminant loads originating from mining sites and urban wastewater. In the future, these pressures might have negative impacts on the ecosystems of Lake Baikal and the Selenga River Delta, which is an important wetland region in itself and forms the last geobiochemical barrier before the Selenga drains into Lake Baikal. The following study aims to assess current trends in hydrology and water quality in the Selenga-Baikal basin, identify their drivers and to set up models (WaterGAP3 framework and ECOMAG) for the prediction of future changes. Of particular relevance for hydrological and water quality changes in the recent past were climate and land use trends as well as contaminant influx from mining areas and urban settlements. In the near future, additional hydrological modifications due to the construction of dams and abstractions/water diversions from the Selenga's Mongolian tributaries could lead to additional alterations.																	0097-8078	1608-344X				MAY	2017	44	3					399	416		10.1134/S0097807817030113								WOS:000405126000006

Suspended Sediment Balance in Selenga Delta at the Late XX-Early XXI Century: Simulation by LANDSAT Satellite Images	WATER RESOURCES												Adaptation of the technology of water turbidity simulation by satellite image data for the delta of the Selenga R., the largest Baikal tributary is given. The results of processing a series of 82 Landsat images are used to assess the seasonal variability of suspended sediment balance in the Selenga delta in period from 1989 up to the present time. It is shown that, at higher water discharges (> 1500 m(3)/s), suspended material will accumulate in the delta (on the average 15% of the total sediment transport at the delta head), governed by material precipitation within inundated floodplain area and lakes in the lower part of the delta. At lower water discharges (< 1500 m(3)/s), a longitudinal increase in suspended sediment transport may take place, caused by setups from Baikal side and channel erosion in the branches.																	0097-8078	1608-344X				MAY	2017	44	3					463	470		10.1134/S0097807817030071								WOS:000405126000011

Seasonality of Coliform Bacteria Detection Rates in New Jersey Domestic Wells	GROUNDWATER												It is important that indicators of fecal pollution are reliable. Coliform bacteria are a commonly used indicator of fecal pollution. As other investigators have reported elsewhere, we observed a seasonal pattern of coliform bacteria detections in domestic wells in New Jersey. Examination of a statewide database of 10 years of water quality data from 93,447 samples, from 78,207 wells, generated during real estate transactions, revealed that coliform bacteria were detected in a higher proportion of wells during warm weather months. Further examination of the seasonal pattern of other data, including well water pH, precipitation, ground and surface water temperatures, surface water coliform bacteria concentrations, and vegetation, resulted in the hypothesis that these bacteria may be derived from nonfecal (or environmentally adapted) as well as fecal sources. We provide evidence that the coliform seasonality may be the result of seasonal changes in groundwater extraction volumes (and to a lesser extent precipitation), and temperature-driven changes in the concentration of surface or near-surface coliform sources. Nonfecal coliform sources may not indicate the presence of fecal wastes and hence the potential presence of pathogens, or do so in an inconsistent fashion. Additional research is needed to identify the sources of the coliforms detected in groundwater.																	0017-467X	1745-6584				MAY-JUN	2017	55	3					346	361		10.1111/gwat.12482								WOS:000404746300009	27775834

However, its utilization in water desalination is not common due to several barriers and limitations including the saline water quality to be treated and the high cost of such a combined process. Some brackish desalination plants using reverse osmosis (RO) membranes are constructed and under operation. In some of these plants, the raw water is first cooled by damping its heat into the atmosphere using cooling towers. The cooled brackish water is then pumped to the RO membranes. This work discusses several configurations of using geothermal energy to drive desalination of brackish waters. It focuses on the modeling and simulation of a direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) unit powered by geothermal energy sources. The performance of the whole system composed of the geothermal energy source and the desalination unit is modeled using balance equations of mass, energy and species. Hybrid desalination linking membrane distillation (MD) and RO units is also investigated. The results illustrate the benefits of combining the MD-RO and geothermal energy source in terms of enhancement of the plant recovery ratio. They show in particular that the overall recovery ratio for low salinity feed solutions (lower than 2,000 ppm) is high. The simulations show that it can be around 79% and 67% when the feed salinity equals 800 and 2,000 ppm, respectively.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				MAY	2017	76						40	52		10.5004/dwt.2016.11378								WOS:000404397600004

In addition, the surface modifications of luffa sponge were investigated. The results showed that luffa sponge functioned well in a bench scale experiment and in a demonstration project, and the main effluent water indexes reached the class IV standard defined by the surface water quality standard of China (GB3838-2002). However, natural luffa sponge is easily hydrolyzed and should be replaced at regular intervals. A microwave-enhanced KH550 (Silane coupling agent gamma-aminopropyltriethoxysilane) coupling method for modifying luffa sponges were performed to reduce the water absorption rate and prolong the engineering service time of the sponge. The results showed that the water absorption rate of the tested luffa sponge fibers was reduced to 22.39% after the fourth set of modifications, and an orthogonal test revealed that the priority order for the factors that affected the modification process was KH550 concentration >microwave reaction time >NAOH concentration > soaking time. The optimal set of modification conditions for luffa sponge fibers was 2% (w/w) NAOH, 1% (w/w) KH550, 30 min of soaking and 180 s of microwave treatment.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				MAY	2017	76						155	165		10.5004/dwt.2017.20338								WOS:000404397600015

Water quality of Hanna Lake; Balochistan province in Pakistan has been investigated during 2014. A total of 22 samples were collected during summer and winter months. The physicochemical parameters, metals and bacteriological analysis were performed and compared with WHO, guidelines 2011 and NSDWQ (National Standard of Drinking Water Quality, Pakistan). pH, chloride, hardness, nitrate, total dissolved solids (TDS), Na, K, and Zn are well within the permissible limit as per World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines and NSDWQ. The concentration of sulphate, Ni and Pb were relatively higher with respect to WHO guidelines and NSDWQ. As concentration was within the limit as per NSDWQ while it is relatively higher (0.04 mg/l) as per WHO guidelines of (0.01 mg/l). All bacteriological parameters (total coliform, total fecal coliforms and total faecal streptococci) were extremely high from public health stand point that renders the water unfit for human consumption. The continued deteriorating environmental conditions of Hanna lake reflect ignorance from government side that can be mended by consistent supervision, long term management and strict enforcement of environmental laws pertaining to the protection of environmental resources. The present study recommends that priority should be given to monitor the water quality of Hanna lake on long term basis which would be helpful in future planning and management of this important water resource in already water scarce area.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				MAY	2017	76						174	183		10.5004/dwt.2017.20410								WOS:000404397600017

An investigation of the degree of metal contamination in water, sediment and fish species (Puntius sarana and Labeo rohita) of two sampling sites of the Damodar River, situated in close vicinity to fly ash dump site, in India was performed. Bioaccumulation of heavy metals (Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn, Fe and Cd) in liver, gills and muscles of fishes were analyzed by Flame Atomic Absorption spectrophotometry (FAAS). The concentrations of Cu, Mn and Fe in water samples of Site 1 (1.04 mg/L Cu; 0.74 mg/L Mn; 1.13 mg/L Fe) and Site 2 (0.64 mg/L Cu; 0.56 mg/L Mn; 0.90 mg/L Fe) were found above permissible limits (Indian Standards, IS: 10500) of drinking water. Copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) concentrations in sediments of Site 1 ranged from 541.08-552.92 mg/kg and 744.68-754.76 mg/kg dry weight, respectively. Sediments of Site 1 had higher Cu and Zn levels as compared to Site 2 but both the sites had Cu and Zn concentrations above the prescribed sediment limits of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) 1986. Risk Index (RI) for sediments of Site 1 was 102.2, while, for Site 2 was 59.59. The trend for chromium (Cr) concentration in tissues of P. sarana from Site 1 was: muscles > liver > gills and for Lead (Pb) in P. sarana was: liver > gills > muscles. In Site 2, the trend for Zn concentration in L. rohita was: liver > gills > muscles. Concentrations of Cu and Iron (Fe) in muscles of P. sarana of Site 1 were found to be 18.64 mg/kg and 14.26 mg/kg, wet weight, respectively, and were above permissible limits as prescribed by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) 1983 while, at Site 2, Fe (13.91 mg/kg) was above FAO limits for muscles of L. rohita. Highest bioaccumulation factor (BAF) value was observed for Pb (145.18) in liver of L. rohita of Site 2. Target hazard quotient (THQ) values for all the metals were below 1, indicating no risk relating to the consumption of fish on human health.

J	Das, A; Munoz-Arriola, F; Singh, SK; Jha, PK; Kumar, M				Das, Aparna; Munoz-Arriola, Francisco; Singh, Sudhir Kumar; Jha, Pawan Kumar; Kumar, Manish			Nutrient dynamics of the Brahmaputra (tropical river) during the monsoon period	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												A rapid population growth and continuous migration to urban centers are posing serious challenges to urban water supplies and demands. Urban demands for continuous and secure water supplies relays on available water resources in quantity and quality. The same supplies of water in urban areas are associated with the uncontrolled releases of organic and inorganic chemical species, including nutrients. The lack of technologies or access to them reduces the ability of water systems to restore its original water quality. Further, areas driven by a single release of water in the form of summer precipitation such as the monsoon require water management strategies that allow assessments of water availability, in quantity and quality, all year long. This work aims to characterize the intra-seasonal drivers of contaminant dynamics in response to rainfall. The objective is to use a single precipitation pulse (intra-seasonal monsoonal rainfall) in a large-scale river basin [Brahmaputra River Basin (BRB)] to evidence water quality responses to hydro-climate forcings. The BRB is located in South East Asia, where summer rainfall influences nutrient replenishment, displacement, and dilution of unregulated pollutants through the basin. Results show that changes in nutrient concentration in streams respond to rainfall patterns and events, evidenced by nutrient displacement through surface runoff. Elevated nutrient concentrations found in some downstream sites can be associated to anthropogenic activities such as agriculture and urban sewage release from densely populated areas in the lower lands of the BRB. Multivariate analysis substantiated the probable source of nutrient release in the BRB. While the source of NO3- can be associated with anthropogenic inputs that of PO43- could be attributed to point sources such as sewage from the ammonia/urea manufacturing industry present near the mainstream. Cluster analysis indicated the potential mobility of PO43- carried by suspended solids in river water and subsequently to organisms some distance away from the source.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				MAY	2017	76						212	224		10.5004/dwt.2017.20788								WOS:000404397600020

Urban water management network of household expectations	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												Access to clean potable water is a global issue while it is also one of the articles of human rights. The demand for water increases as the population rises and economic activities grow. However, the water pollution and declination in water levels in the dams due to global warming as well as the low quality of potable water brings up the issue of running water sufficiency and safety. This study measures consumer satisfaction level and expectations on potable city water quality and services based on the cross-sectional data collected from urban settings in the Mediterranean region of Turkey. The results suggest that 71.4% of households use city water as their potable water and define the quality of potable city water as average quality. While the survey findings indicate that the colour and turbidity qualities of accessed water were ranked quite high, conductivity, taste and odour of the water have received lower rankings of satisfaction within a five Likert-scale. Additionally, lack of pre-information on water cuts, insufficient maintenance and repair services and unsatisfactory responses to the consumer complaints were listed as the main problems encountered in city water services. Besides, quality improvement of potable water, water pricing and safety issues were found as the most important items.

In this work, jet water flow and ultrasonic irradiation with a 200-kHz frequency were integrated to study the effect of the system operation on the water quality of a stagnant Yeo-cheon River section. Samples were continuously collected only under jet flow and then under the combined system for 2 and 10 weeks, respectively. In general, the integrated system showed a localized improvement in the water quality in terms of Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and dissolved reactive phosphate. Dissolved oxygen (DO) increased by more than 100% at 5 and 25 m, and increased in average by 60% further downstream. Even though flow was expected to suspend the sediments and increase turbidity, in the combined treatment, there was no increase, which was likely due to the agglomeration and settling out of particles due to sonication. However, the nitrogen and dissolved organic carbon concentrations showed a fluctuating trend. The inverse association between DO and Chl-a decreased from a coefficient of 0.51-0.37 when the ultrasonic irradiation unit was coupled with the flow, which resulted in a reduction effect on the Chl-a concentration from ultrasonication. The relationship between DO and reactive phosphate also indicated a higher influence of ultrasonication than flow on the phosphorus concentration. In general, the cumulative effect of the water flow and ultrasonic irradiation met the water quality requirement of the river for a healthy ecological interaction.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				MAY	2017	74						115	124		10.5004/dwt.2017.20600								WOS:000403572000011

Assessment of water quality of man-made lakes in Klang Valley (Malaysia) using chemometrics: the impact of mining	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												Assessing water quality of the ex-mining ponds for its proper utilization is pertinent considering the metal pollutants and lack of proper environmental measures is associated with the mining operations. In this study, water samples from 13 man-made lakes including 8 ex-mining ponds in the Klang Valley, Malaysia were analyzed for dissolved oxygen, suspended solid, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), biological oxygen demand (BOD), ammoniacal nitrogen (AN), total dissolved solid (TDS), and metals including As, Cd, Pb, Mn, Fe, Na, Mg, and Ca. The variations in these parameters were evaluated with the chemometric techniques. The results from the principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis suggested that in addition to the degree of contamination, the variations in heavy metal concentrations were mainly attributed to the ex-mining activities, whereas deviations in BOD, TDS, AN, and EC were subjected to the current domestic inputs. The linear discriminant analysis showed that water samples from the ex-mining ponds were highly associated with Mn, Cd, Ca, and As. The As and Cd levels recorded in most of the ex-mining ponds were 11.3 +/- 0.4, 116 +/- 2, and 42 +/- 0.5 mu g/L; and 12.9 +/- 0.2, 12.23 +/- 0.02, 12.19 +/- 0.01, and 12.15 +/- 0.01 mu g/L, respectively. These values surpassed the reference limits, which make them unfit for domestic uses.

Chemical depletion-enrichment profiles of soils, combined with regolith thickness and groundwater data indicate the importance to stream hydrochemistry of incongruent dissolution of silicate minerals during deep bedrock weathering, which is primarily limited by water fluxes, in this highly fractured, young volcanic terrain. Under high flow conditions (e.g., spring snowmelt), wetting of soil and regolith surfaces and presence of organic acids promote mineral dissolution and provide a constant supply of base cations, Si, and DIC to soil water and groundwater. Mixing of waters from different hydrochemical reservoirs in the near stream environment during wet periods leads to the chemostatic behavior of DIC, base cations, and Si in stream flow. Metals transported by organic matter complexation (i.e., Ge, Al) and/or colloids (i.e., Al) during periods of soil saturation and lateral connectivity to the stream display a positive relationship with Q. Variable Si-Q relationships, under all but the highest flow conditions, can be explained by nonconservative transport and precipitation of clay minerals, which influences long versus short-term Si weathering fluxes. By combining measurements of the CZ obtained across different spatial and temporal scales, we were able to constrain weathering processes in different hydrological reservoirs that may be flushed to the stream during hydrologic events, thereby informing C-Q relationships.

In the present study, three outlier identification methods the three sigma rule (3 sigma), inter quantile range (IQR), and median absolute deviation (MAD) that take advantage of the ensemble regression method are proposed by considering non-Gaussian characteristics of groundwater data. For validation purposes, the performance of the methods is compared using simulated and actual groundwater data with a few hypothetical conditions. In the validations using simulated data, all of the proposed methods reasonably identify outliers at a 5% outlier level; whereas, only the IQR method performs well for identifying outliers at a 30% outlier level. When applying the methods to real groundwater data, the outlier identification performance of the IQR method is found to be superior to the other two methods. However, the IQR method shows limitation by identifying excessive false outliers, which may be overcome by its joint application with other methods (for example, the 3 sigma rule and MAD methods). The proposed methods can be also applied as potential tools for the detection of future anomalies by model training based on currently available data. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Effects of in-stream structures and channel flow rate variation on transient storage	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												In-stream structures can potentially enhance surface and subsurface solute retention. They form naturally in small streams and their installation has gained popularity in stream restoration for multiple purposes, including improved water quality. Yet few studies have quantified the cumulative effect of multiple structures on solute transport at the reach scale, nor how this varies with changing stream flow. We built a series of weirs in a small stream to simulate channel spanning structures such as natural debris dams and stream restoration log dams and boulder weirs. We conducted constant rate conservative (NaCl) tracer injections to quantify the effect of the weirs on solute transport at the reach scale. We used a one dimensional solute transport model with transient storage to quantify the change of solute transport parameters with increasing number of weirs. Results indicate that adding weirs significantly increased the cross-sectional area of the surface stream (A) and transient storage zones (A(s)) while exchange with transient storage (cc) decreased. The increase in A and As is due to backwater behind weirs and increased hydrostatically driven hyporheic exchange induced by the weirs, while we surmise that the reduction in alpha is due at least in part to reduced hydrodynamically driven hyporheic exchange in bed ripples drowned by the weir backwater. In order for weir installation to achieve net improvement in solute retention and thus water quality, cumulative reactions in weir backwater and enhanced hydrostatically driven hyporheic exchange would have to overcome the reduced hydrodynamically driven exchange. Analysis of channel flow variation over the course of the experiments indicated that weirs change the relationship between transient storage parameters and flow, for example the trend of increasing a with flow without weirs was reversed in the presence of weirs. Effects of flow variation were substantial, indicating that transient storage measurements at a single point in time typically cannot be extrapolated to estimate net annual effects. Thus, rigorous evaluation of water quality effects of stream restoration structures requires measurements at multiple channel flow rates. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.					Rana, S.M.

In this paper, two scenarios were considered for Multi-Station (MS) nitrate load modeling of the Little River watershed. In the first scenario, Markovian characteristics of streamflow-nitrate time series were proposed for the MS modeling. For this purpose, feature extraction criterion of Mutual Information (MI) was employed for input selection of artificial intelligence models (Feed Forward Neural Network, FFNN and least square support vector machine). In the second scenario for considering seasonality-based characteristics of the time series, wavelet transform was used to extract multi-scale features of streamflow-nitrate time series of the watershed's sub-basins to model MS nitrate loads. Self-Organizing Map (SOM) clustering technique which finds homogeneous sub series clusters was also linked to MI for proper cluster agent choice to be imposed into the models for predicting the nitrate loads of the watershed's sub-basins. The proposed MS method not only considers the prediction of the outlet nitrate but also covers predictions of interior sub-basins nitrate load values. The results indicated that the proposed FFNN model coupled with the SOM-MI improved the performance of MS nitrate predictions compared to the Markovian-based models up to 39%. Overall, accurate selection of dominant inputs which consider seasonality-based characteristics of streamflow-nitrate process could enhance the efficiency of nitrate load predictions.

Data and techniques that allow detailed identification and quantification of pyrite oxidation are therefore crucial for assessing and predicting the adverse water quality changes that may be associated with this process. In this study, we explore the benefits of combining stable sulphur isotope analysis with reactive transport modelling to improve the identification and characterisation of pyrite oxidation during an aquifer storage and recovery experiment in a chemically and physically heterogeneous aquifer. We characterise the stable sulphur isotope signal (634S) in both the ambient groundwater and the injectant as well as its spatial distribution within the sedimentary sulphur species. The identified stable sulphur isotope signal for pyrite was found to vary between 32 and +34%o, while the signal of the injectant ranged between +9.06 and +14.45%0 during the injection phase of the experiment. Both isotope and hydrochemical data together suggest a substantial contribution of pyrite oxidation to the observed, temporally variable delta S-34 signals. The variability of the delta S-34 signal in pyrite and the injectant were both found to complicate the analysis of the stable isotope data. However, the incorporation of the data into a numerical modelling approach allowed to successfully employ the delta S-34 signatures as a valuable additional constraint for identifying and quantifying the contribution of pyrite oxidation to the redox transformations that occur in response to the injection of oxygenated water.

M.; Han, Dawei			Representing radar rainfall uncertainty with ensembles based on a time-variant geostatistical error modelling approach	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The application of radar quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) to hydrology and water quality models can be preferred to interpolated rainfall point measurements because of the wide coverage that radars can provide, together with a good spatio-temporal resolutions. Nonetheless, it is often limited by the proneness of radar QPE to a multitude of errors. Although radar errors have been widely studied and techniques have been developed to correct most of them, residual errors are still intrinsic in radar QPE. An estimation of uncertainty of radar QPE and an assessment of uncertainty propagation in modelling applications is important to quantify the relative importance of the uncertainty associated to radar rainfall input in the overall modelling uncertainty. A suitable tool for this purpose is the generation of radar rainfall ensembles. An ensemble is the representation of the rainfall field and its uncertainty through a collection of possible alternative rainfall fields, produced according to the observed errors, their spatial characteristics, and their probability distribution. The errors are derived from a comparison between radar QPE and ground point measurements. The novelty of the proposed ensemble generator is that it is based on a geostatistical approach that assures a fast and robust generation of synthetic error fields, based on the time-variant characteristics of errors. The method is developed to meet the requirement of operational applications to large datasets. The method is applied to a case study in Northern England, using the UK Met Office NIMROD radar composites at 1 km resolution and at 1 h accumulation on an area of 180 km by 180 km. The errors are estimated using a network of 199 tipping bucket rain gauges from the Environment Agency. 183 of the rain gauges are used for the error modelling, while 16 are kept apart for validation. The validation is done by comparing the radar rainfall ensemble with the values recorded by the validation rain gauges. The validated ensemble is then tested on a hydrological case study, to show the advantage of probabilistic rainfall for uncertainty propagation. The ensemble spread only partially captures the mismatch between the modelled and the observed flow. The residual uncertainty can be attributed to other sources of uncertainty, in particular to model structural uncertainty, parameter identification uncertainty, uncertainty in other inputs, and uncertainty in the observed flow.

Trace organic chemical attenuation during managed aquifer recharge: Insights from a variably saturated 2D tank experiment	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Meaningful model-based predictions of water quality and quantity are imperative for the designed footprint of managed aquifer recharge installations. A two-dimensional (2D) synthetic MAR system equipped with automated sensors (temperature, water pressure, conductivity, soil moisture, oxidation-reduction potential) and embedded water sampling ports was used to test and model fundamental subsurface processes during surface spreading managed aquifer recharge operations under controlled flow and redox conditions at the meso-scale. The fate and transport of contaminants in the variably saturated synthetic aquifer were simulated using the finite element analysis model, FEFLOW. In general, the model concurred with travel times derived from contaminant breakthrough curves at individual sensor locations throughout the 2D tank. However, discrepancies between measured and simulated trace organic chemical concentrations (i.e., carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, tris (2-chloroethyl) phosphate, trimethoprim) were observed. While the FEFLOW simulation of breakthrough curves captured overall shapes of trace organic chemical concentrations well, the model struggled with matching individual data points, although compound-specific attenuation parameters were used. Interestingly, despite steady-state operation, oxidation-reduction potential measurements indicated temporal disturbances in hydraulic properties in the saturated zone of the 2D tank that affected water quality.

J	Sun, L; Yeh, GT; Zhao, GQ				Sun, Lu; Yeh, Gour-Tsyh; Zhao, Guoqun			Applications of quadrilateral and quadrilateral-prism mesh generation in overland and subsurface simulations	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												This paper developed an automatic mesh generator used for simulating real-world problems of hydrological cycles, fluid flow, salinity and thermal transport, sediment and water quality transport, etc. The 2-D overland area was discretized with quadrilaterals based on conformal mapping technique. A position percent interpolation equation was established to determine nodal vertical-coordinates and match boundaries. For 3-D simulations of subsurface zones, an additional mesh generation method was proposed to create quadrilaterals for filling the empty regions along river reaches and around junctions with storage, ponds or lakes. In order to deal With special storage region with an odd number of boundary nodes, an additional triangle was inserted. Five topological optimization templates were proposed to improve the quality of degenerated elements. This paper proposed the basic algorithms to generate quadrilateral-prism meshes through stretching the quadrilateral mesh along vertical directions based on material domains. Aiming at four types of fractures, corresponding extraction methods were presented to preserve geometric features. In order to accommodate the need for overland and subsurface simulations, 1-D/2-D/3-D correspondence was established between rivers, junctions, ponds, lakes, control structures and finite element meshes. Finally, several realistic hydrologic and geologic examples for meshing multi-domain areas were provided to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the mesh generator developed in this paper.

Monitoring of both anti-inflammatory and the parameters temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen was held in this water body during 12 consecutive months (October 2008 to September 2009). Water samples were collected monthly at six points representing different sections of the stream. The samples were subjected to solid phase extraction procedure and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. To check the influence of water temperature on the occurrence of the anti-inflammatory drugs diclofenac and naproxen in aquatic environments, it was used a logistic model of regression, the Statistical Analysis System version 9.0. The anti-inflammatory drugs diclofenac and naproxen were detected at different points in the Stream of Onca. The other parameters evaluated in this study were compared with the water quality standards established by the CONAMA Resolution 357/2005. The highest concentration of diclofenac was detected in the point located downstream of the wastewater treatment plant of the city, while the largest concentration of naproxen was recorded at the mouth of the stream. The water temperature influence, in an inversely proportional way, the occurrence of both anti-inflammatory in the stream, the higher the temperature the lower the water body probability of detection of drug diclofenac and naproxen.																	1413-4152	1809-4457				MAY-JUN	2017	22	3					429	435		10.1590/S1413-41522017128719								WOS:000403268900003

Two UF membranes were tested at two different pressures to treat the rainwater collected in a building of the University of Passo Fundo. Rainwater showed a moderate concentration of suspended solids, color, turbidity, organic matter and coliform contamination and a low concentration of nitrites, nitrates and sulfates. The two UF membranes used (with molecular weight cutoff of 4 and 50 kDa) allowed the adjustment of these parameters to the potability, and the permeate flux of hollow fiber (50 kDa) membrane was above 130 L.h(-1).m(-2) (at 2 bar). Therefore, rainwater harvesting and its UF is a promising alternative for a decentralized supply of drinking water.																	1413-4152	1809-4457				MAY-JUN	2017	22	3					481	490		10.1590/S1413-41522017146765								WOS:000403268900009

The physical, chemical and microbiological parameters were analyzed, and the Water Quality Index (WQI) was determined. The data classify creek as an impacted environment, with eutrophic characteristics. In general, the water contamination by fecal coliform is above the standards set for Class 2 waters, and the WQI values are indicative of regular quality waters. Also, there were observed negative anthropic actions at the margins of the creek, an indication that there is an urgent need for conservation measures.																	1413-4152	1809-4457				MAY-JUN	2017	22	3					523	529		10.1590/S1413-41522017154657								WOS:000403268900013

This paper aims to present an innovative technology for building rainwater storage tanks in western Santa Catarina. It presents a slate tank with a capacity of 250 m(3), which is part of a rainwater harvesting system implanted on a pig production in western Santa Catarina (Brazil). In this system, the rainwater is used for livestock drinking and to sanitation farms. It also presents, with less focus, rainwater treatment devices developed in this research project. A comparative analysis of costs between this tank and commonly used tanks in the study area was realized. Physico-chemical and bacteriological tests of rainwater were done in different parts of the system in order to check if the water quality is suitable for the intended uses. This technology showed speed and ease construction and low cost of implementation. The slate plaque, besides serving as a form to ferrocement layer, it's a natural and abundant material in the central region of Santa Catarina. The physical-chemical and bacteriological tests displayed the efficiency of the rainwater treatment devices applied in this research project. Finally, it was noted that rainwater is suitable for animal consumption, since it observed the conditions and standards for waters of Class 3 of CONAMA Resolution 357. Thus, this new technology has great potential for application and economic viability for the study area.																	1413-4152	1809-4457				MAY-JUN	2017	22	3					563	570		10.1590/S1413-41522017177829								WOS:000403268900018

Understanding the dominant processes shaping eutrophication processes is crucial to sustainable water management in lake catchments. The aim of the study was to determine the importance of elements of lake-catchment system structures in the processes of shaping lake water quality. The values of loads delivered to the lake basins from their catchments as well as nutrient output were calculated on the basis of stream discharge and nutrient concentration. A range of hydro-chemical influences of each stream was presented by means of a range of a radius. A model of nutrient transport (prepared in GIS software) was used in the catchment of a lake without tributaries. Additionally, phytoplankton abundance and water quality indices were calculated. The results showed a clear pattern for the following lakes, Syczynskie > Pniowno > Chuteckie > Tarnowskie, in terms of nutrient load as well as water quality. The hydrochemical influence of lake tributaries was determined by runoff processes, which reflected catchment geology, relief, and flushing time. The Q index showed a good ecological status for lakes Chuteckie and Tarnowskie, moderate for Lake Pniowno, and poor for Lake Syczynskie.

Water samples were collected between 2007 and 2008 from 8 sites along a 510 km downstream transect of the NR, and chemical and isotopic compositions of the water samples were evaluated to identify natural and anthropogenic sources contributing to the water chemistry of the NR. The results showed that the major ion concentrations were mainly controlled by chemical weathering that occurred in the watershed, in which a silicate weathering is more dominant than a carbonate weathering. The Sr-87/(86) Sr ratios of the water samples were in a range from 0.71043 to 0.71520 within those of the Mesozoic volcanogenic sedimentary rocks long developed in the watershed, thereby supporting the fact that the water chemistry is governed by a chemical weathering. The delta S-34 values varied in a narrow range of 1.8-3.1%, regardless of spatial and seasonal variations. Mass balance calculations indicated that the contributions of chemical weathering and anthropogenic sources during summer time increased along a downstream transect, from 67.3 +/- 1.3 to 73.6 +/- 0.5% and from 6.0 to 15.7%, respectively. In contrast, the contribution of chemical weathering during winter time decreased from 82.7 +/- 0.8 to 72.5 +/- 0.3%, while anthropogenic contribution increased up to 22.2%. These results indicated that the water chemistry of the NR was mainly caused by a chemical weathering, followed by anthropogenic inputs and rainwater. This study will provide baseline information for comparing the water quality issue before and after the implementation of the Four Rivers Restoration Project of South Korea.

The fruits' physical attributes, physicochemical attributes, nutritional attributes, mineral content as well as consumers' acceptance were evaluated. The properties of the different water sources and their effect, on both the soil and the quality of the fruits, were evaluated. Analysis of the irrigation water revealed that treated waste water was of acceptable quality with reference to irrigation water quality guidelines, while the lake water used for irrigation fell short in several aspects. The different water sources used for irrigation in the farms affected the soil geochemical properties significantly. The quality of guavas harvested from the farms that were irrigated with different water sources was significantly different. Irrigation water qualities were observed to have positive effects on the quality of the fruits and consumers' acceptance as observed from the results of quality analysis and the consumers' acceptance test.

It analyses the temporal and spatial distributions and utilisation of underground water according to the main components and corresponding water quality standards for underground water. Thereby, it can provide a scientific basis for the development, utilisation, planning, and management of groundwater resources. Set pair analysis (SPA), based on the improved five-element connectivity degree, was used in this research to establish a comprehensive evaluation model of water quality, so as to evaluate the groundwater quality in XuChang, Henan Province, China. Meanwhile, fuzzy evaluation was also used to measure groundwater quality. As demonstrated in the research results, SPA is proven to be convenient and useful with objective and stable results, it therefore is an effective approach with which to evaluate groundwater quality. In addition, the results obtained using SPA matched those from fuzzy comprehensive evaluation; it was concluded, based on the analysis, that the groundwater in XuChang was severely polluted. The groundwater quality at the observation points located in the lower reaches is poorer than that of the upper reaches; hazardous substances permeate underground to pollute shallow groundwater through decomposition and loss due to weathering and rainfall.																	1606-9749					MAY	2017	17	3					632	642		10.2166/ws.2016.135								WOS:000401654600002

However, little information exists on the effects of cistern materials and construction methods on water quality. This study assessed the quality of rainwater and harvested rainwater stored in different types of cisterns, using multivariate statistical analysis techniques. The harvesting system consisted of ditches underground to direct the water stream collected by catchments through pipes to the two-stage grit chambers, the rainwater runoff ultimately being fed into the cisterns. Water samples were collected monthly over 6 months from October 2008 to April 2009. The harvested rainwater generally did not meet drinking water standards due to severe bacterial contamination. To determine the factors affecting water quality, principal components and factor analysis divided the water's physicochemical composition into four principal components: ions, suspended pollutants, reducing substances, and acidity-alkalinity, which collectively accounted for 80.4% of the total variance. Cluster analysis confirmed the results. It was determined that pollutants in harvested rainwater were mainly derived from the catchments, surrounding fields, and local atmosphere. Furthermore, factor scores ranked water quality to select the optimum material and construction method. It was concluded that cement was superior to stabilized soil for rainwater storage. However, considering water quality, cost, and environmental friendliness the stabilized soil cistern using the stiff construction method was worthy of consideration.

Legislation mandating the establishment of water resources monitoring, presence of hazardous contaminants in effluents, and perception of the vulnerability of the water distribution system to attacks, have spurred technical and economic interest. Alternatively to traditional analyzers, chemosensors operate according to physical principles, without sample collection (online), and are capable of supplying parameter values continuously and in real-time. This review paper contains a comprehensive survey of existing and expected online monitoring technologies for measurement/detection of pollutants in water. The state-of-the-art in online water monitoring and contaminant warning systems is presented. Application examples are reported. Monitoring costs will become a lesser part of a water utility budget due to the fact that automation and technological simplification will abate human cost factors, and reduce the complexity of laboratory procedures.																	1606-9749					MAY	2017	17	3					707	725		10.2166/ws.2016.168								WOS:000401654600009

This study aimed to better understand the presence of these metals in the source water, removal of these metals through the conventional treatment process, and final water quality trends, for the period 2008 to 2014. Aluminium and iron concentrations were highly variable and showed significant influence on colour and turbidity in source water. Sedimentation performed well, and removed over 70% of the metal concentration from the raw water. Filtration removed 15% of the remaining aluminium and iron concentrations. The pH and turbidity of the final water had minor effects on the metal concentration in the final water. The conventional treatment process was shown to be capable of removing aluminium and iron from the source water as both were within water quality limits in the final water. This study highlighted the importance of source water quality monitoring and treatment plant efficacy in evaluating whether the current treatment technology is appropriate for current and future challenges.																	1606-9749					MAY	2017	17	3					733	744		10.2166/ws.2016.170								WOS:000401654600011

Many factors affect the delivery of water through distribution networks. Some of these factors are relevant to water quality, quantity and the condition of the infrastructure itself. The deterioration of water quality in the WDN leads to failure at the water quality level, which can be critical because it is closest to the point of delivery and there are virtually no safety barriers before consumption. Accordingly, developing a powerful monitoring system that takes into consideration water demand distribution, the vulnerability of the distribution system and the sensitivity of the population to the deterioration of water quality can be very beneficial and, more importantly, could save lives if there was any deterioration of water quality due to operational failure or cross-contamination events. In this paper, a framework for a water quality monitoring system that considers water demand distribution, the vulnerability of the system and the sensitivity of the population using fuzzy synthetic evaluation and optimization algorithms is developed. The proposed approach has been applied to develop a monitoring system for a real WDN in Saudi Arabia.																	1606-9749					MAY	2017	17	3					811	824		10.2166/ws.2016.174								WOS:000401654600019

Numerical approaches to modeling pollution transmission in rivers are useful tools for managing the water quality. The advection-dispersion equation is the governing equation in the transport of pollution in rivers. Recently, due to advances in fractional calculus in engineering modeling, the simulation of pollution transmission in rivers has been improved using the fractional derivative approach. In this study, by solving the fractional advection-dispersion equation (FRADE), a numerical model was developed for the simulation of pollution transmission in rivers with stagnant zones. To this purpose, both terms of the FRADE equation (advection and fractional dispersion) were discretized separately and the results were connected using a time-splitting technique. The analytical solution of a modified advection-dispersion equation (MADE) model and observed data from the Severn River in the UK were used to demonstrate the model capabilities. Results indicated that there is a good agreement between observed data, the analytical solution of the MADE model, and the results of the developed numerical model. The developed numerical model can accurately simulate the long-tailed dispersion processes in a natural river.

We manufactured filter disks with varied clay, burn-out material, burn-out material sieved with different mesh sizes, and burn-out material to clay ratios and calculated filter characteristics, including porosity, density, shrinkage, and flow rate. Water was run through filters daily for 4 weeks, and flow rate and Escherichia coli reduction, as measured by log reduction value (LRV), were tested twice weekly. Our results suggest: (1) the first and last LRV test results do not correlate strongly (R-2 = 0.38, p < 0.010); (2) there is not a strong association between flow rate and first, average, or last LRV results (R-2 = 0.17, p = 0.090; R-2 = 0.30, p = 0.020; R-2 = 0.24, p = 0.040); and (3) first and average LRV are associated with burn-out material (R-2 = 0.68, p < 0.001; R-2 = 0.60, p < 0.001), and last LRV is associated with burn-out material and mesh size (R-2 = 0.54, p < 0.050). Recommendations for filter factories, are to: (1) verify filtration efficacy with repeated bacteria reduction tests when materials, processing, or filter characteristics vary; (2) carefully control production variables; and (3) continue flow rate testing each filter to evaluate within and across batch production consistency.																	1606-9749					MAY	2017	17	3					859	869		10.2166/ws.2016.176								WOS:000401654600024

Hydrochemical characterization and suitability assessment of groundwater in Baga-Calangute stretch of Goa, India	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The present study is the first attempt to determine the suitability of groundwater for drinking and irrigation in the Baga-Calangute stretch of Goa. The suitability of groundwater for potable use was assessed by comparing observed values against standards prescribed by the Bureau of Indian Standards, and the quality was classified based on the Weighted Arithmetic Water Quality Index. Most of the groundwater samples (90%) were found to be suitable for drinking except for hardness, chlorides, and nitrates. The percent sodium (%Na), residual sodium carbonate, soluble sodium percentage, sodium adsorption ratio, Kelly's ratio, and Permeability Index were found to be within the prescribed limits for irrigation purposes. The major mechanism controlling groundwater chemistry, i.e., rock-water interaction, was also studied, and it was found that silicate weathering plays a major role in the dissolution of minerals. Based on the hydrochemical characterization, the water was observed to be of the Ca-Na-SO4 composition type except for one sample which was of the Na-Cl composition type. Classification of the meteoric genesis suggested that the groundwater in surficial aquifers in the region had a deep meteoric percolation, and its chemistry is regulated by rock-water interaction.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				MAY	2017	76	9							341	10.1007/s12665-017-6679-5								WOS:000401323600013

Multivariate statistical analysis for the assessment of groundwater quality under different hydrogeological regimes	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Multivariate statistical analysis has been widely used for hydrogeochemical characterization of groundwater quality. In this study, hydrochemical data from three hydrological basins were used and two methods (factor and cluster analyses) were applied. The first area is the coastal area of Eastern Thermaikos Gulf where groundwater is influenced by seawater intrusion and geothermal fluids. The other two areas are the inland basins of Gallikos and Perdikas in which agricultural and industrial activities constitute the main anthropogenic pollution sources of groundwater. Initially, the aforementioned methods were applied for each area separately and resulted in a different number of significant factors and clusters, while the natural and anthropogenic influences were spatially determined in each area. Additionally, factor and cluster analyses were applied coupling data from all areas. Therefore, five clusters and three major factors were determined distinguishing the hydrochemical processes and impacts from anthropogenic activities in more detail. It is worth mentioning that the application of cluster analysis in the coupled groundwater samples of all studied areas resulted beneficially in the most hydrochemically complex area. Salinization dominates in the coastal area, while in Gallikos and Perdikas basins high concentrations of NO3 occur mainly due to agricultural activities and small livestock units. The numerous hydrochemical samples are identified as the main issue for the higher discretization and reliability of the second approach. Nevertheless, this study is associated with a number of limitations of multivariable statistical analysis regarding extreme concentrations of Cl and Na. This issue stimulates further research in overcoming and understanding these drawbacks.

All major groundwater quality descriptors and selected trace elements (iron, manganese, arsenic, and aluminum) were studied. The study demonstrated evidence of higher concentrations of bicarbonates (60-590 mg/L), total iron (2.2-5336 mu g/L), total manganese (0.1-804 mu g/L) and total arsenic (0.4-14.5 mu g/L) in certain samples with low values of Eh (-32.0 to +25.8) and NO3- (<= 8.2 mg/L) against WHO standards. Thirty-six percent of samples were rated as poor using the water quality index (WQI) criteria. No scaling potential was observed using the Langelier analysis. The majority of samples were of the mixed-bicarbonate type with the abundance order of cations as Ca2+>Na+>Mg2+>K+. Carbonate dissolution, silicate weathering and cation exchange were identified as possible main geochemical control mechanisms. The sources responsible for fluoride and nitrate include anthropogenic activities and rock-water interaction. Dissolution/precipitation and pH control the levels of As, Fe and Mn.

Large tracts of the Selenga River Basin have been developed for industry, urbanization, mining, and agriculture, resulting in the release of suspended solids (SS) that affect downstream water quality and primary productivity. This study addressed SS as the main factor controlling pollutant transport and the primary indicator of land degradation in the Selenga River system. Tributaries with larger areas dedicated to agricultural use had higher SS concentrations, reaching 862 mg L-1, especially during the high runoff and intensive cultivation season. Although the large SS flux was detected in the main river, the small tributaries were distinguished by high SS concentrations. The high SS concentration corresponded to widespread development in the watershed. Watersheds with high potential of SS release are sensitive to intensive land uses. SS in the river system had a constant elemental composition consisting mainly of Fe and Al oxides, indicating that surface soils were major constituents of the tributary SS. Three heavymetals (Zn, Cu, and Cr) appeared in high concentrations downstream of urban and mining areas (two-to sixfold increases), indicating that these contaminants are carried by SS. At two tributary junctions, the concentration of contaminants on the SS decreased due to a large influx of SS with low heavy metal contents. Changes in electric conductivity and pH at downstream of tributary junctions enhanced the sedimentation of SS and the removal of contaminants from the water phase after aggregation of the SS. Land use changes in the tributary watersheds are major controlling factors for the fate of contaminants in the river system.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				MAY	2017	76	9							346	10.1007/s12665-017-6664-z								WOS:000401323600018

Assessment of the quality of groundwater from different parts of southeastern Nigeria for potable use	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Groundwater samples from three different states of southeastern Nigeria were analyzed for a range of physicochemical parameters and heavy metal constituents in order to determine their potability as drinking water sources. The results indicate that the physicochemical parameters (pH, temperature, TDS, TH, electrical conductivity, Cl-, NO3- and SO42-) tested for have most of their values fall within the permissible limits given by the Nigerian and World Health Organization standards for drinking water quality. The results also reveal that apart from Cu and Pb the rest of the tested heavy metals (As, Zn, Ni, total Fe, Cd and Mn) recorded values that are significantly above the maximum permissible limits for drinking water purposes and therefore have the potential to cause health impacts for long-term potable use. On the basis of principal component analysis, the sources of the measured chemical constituents are likely to be predominantly geogenic (weathering of soluble minerals in the formations) and partly anthropogenic (industrial effluent, agricultural practices and mining activities). Single-factor ANOVA tests indicated insignificant differences in the datasets within/between states or geological units. Caution or adequate treatment is generally required when utilizing the groundwater from the area for drinking purpose due to the elevated metal concentrations and rating as poor to unsuitable water quality.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				MAY	2017	76	9							344	10.1007/s12665-017-6680-z								WOS:000401323600016

Stormwater is a carrier of non-point source pollutants and contains VOCs from land surfaces and air. Samples of stormwater and influent to sewage treatment plants were collected and analyzed for 61 VOCs, while the VOCs in emission sources, air and groundwater were investigated through literature reviews for comparison. The results showed that the most frequently detected VOCs in stormwater were similar to those in air. However, the atmospheric concentrations of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX), and methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) were too low to explain their frequent detection and high concentrations in stormwater. As a result, land surfaces seem to be a primary source of these VOCs in stormwater. Comparison of the VOCs in stormwater and groundwater showed that toluene and MTBE were frequently detected in both media, but more often and at higher concentrations in stormwater. This finding indicates that stormwater recharge is a source of toluene and MTBE in groundwater. Regarding groundwater, land surfaces seem to be a primary source of toluene, while urban air is the primary source in the case of MTBE. Specifically, the MTBE values in air were sufficiently high to explain its levels in groundwater, which had continually increased and remained low afterward. Furthermore, the high ratios of TEX (toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes) to benzene and MTBE in stormwater indicated that TEX had additional sources other than vehicles, most likely hydrocarbon solvents. These solvents seem to be a primary source of TEX and other frequently detected VOCs in stormwater. However, trichloroethylene (TCE), tetrachloroethylene (PCE) and their dechlorination intermediates were far more frequently detected and at higher concentrations in groundwater than in stormwater. Additionally, their concentrations frequently exceeded the water- quality criteria. It seems that halogenated solvents had produced contamination plumes of these chlorinated VOCs in the Seoul aquifer. Based on VOCs detected in Seoul, stormwater was mixed with groundwater in combined sewers and flowed into sewage treatment plants. The results imply that organic solvents should be handled with extreme care to protect groundwater quality.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				MAY	2017	76	9							338	10.1007/s12665-017-6666-x								WOS:000401323600010

In order to evaluate the effect on groundwater recharge, of decreasing surface-water bodies and land-use change caused by urbanization, the relevant groundwater systems and recharge pathways must be characterized in detail. To this end, water levels and water quality were monitored for 3 years regarding groundwater and adjacent surface-water bodies, at two typical suburban sites in Hanoi. Stable isotope (delta O-18, delta D of water) analysis and hydrochemical analysis showed that the water from both aquifers and aquitards, including the groundwater obtained from both the monitoring wells and the neighboring household tubewells, was largely derived from evaporation-affected surface-water bodies (e.g., ponds, irrigated farmlands) rather than from rivers. The water-level monitoring results suggested distinct local-scale flow systems for both a Holocene unconfined aquifer (HUA) and Pleistocene confined aquifer (PCA). That is, in the case of the HUA, lateral recharge through the aquifer from neighboring ponds and/or irrigated farmlands appeared to be dominant, rather than recharge by vertical rainwater infiltration. In the case of the PCA, recharge by the above-lying HUA, through areas where the aquitard separating the two aquifers was relatively thin or nonexistent, was suggested. As the decrease in the local surface-water bodies will likely reduce the groundwater recharge, maintaining and enhancing this recharge (through preservation of the surface-water bodies) is considered as essential for the sustainable use of groundwater in the area.

J	Abraham, J; Dowling, K; Florentine, S				Abraham, Joji; Dowling, Kim; Florentine, Singarayer			The Unquantified Risk of Post-Fire Metal Concentration in Soil: a Review	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Forest fire is a natural disturbance that occurs in many terrestrial ecosystems specifically in the semi-arid environments and is considered to be an important cause of environmental change. Though many causes of fire are identified, including lightning, volcanic eruption, power line sparks, etc., human involvement is the most significant factor. Fire events are able to alter the physical, chemical and biogeochemical properties of the soil and surface materials and are able to release major and trace metals into the environment. This may be more significant in mining-affected and industrial landscapes, where elevated concentrations of metals present in the soil. After the fire event, metals become more mobile due to the increase in soil surface exposure and the mobility associated with ash dispersal. This mobility may increase the bioavailability of the metals, which may generate water quality issues and may contribute to human and environmental health concerns. Even though, the influences of fire on many soil properties are well established, the behaviour of metals with respect to fire is not well investigated. However, a few studies report that major and trace metals include Cd, Cr, Co, Cu, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn and As are mobilized after fire with increased concentrations in soil and water resources and this might pose a risk to human health and ecosystems. Climate change may increase the intensity, frequency and areal extend of fire events and hence increase the metal concentrations and their potential health impacts. This paper reviews post-fire (wild fire) mobility of metals in soil common in contaminated forest ecosystems. The human and ecological health risks of these metals are also considered.

We hypothesized that the disappearance of algal blooms by dilution could be explained by flow regime, nutrient concentrations, and their interaction. This study investigated the effects of daily renewal rate (d), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentration, and their interaction on the domination between Microcystis aeruginosa and Cyclotella sp. through a monoxenic culture experiment. The simulation model as functions of the N: P mass ratio and dilution rate (D) (calculated from d) was constructed, and the dominant characteristics of both species were predicted based on the model using parameters obtained in a monoculture experiment and our previous study. Results of monoxenic culture experiment revealed that M. aeruginosa dominated in all conditions (d = 5 or 15%; N = 1.0 or 2.5 or 5.0 mg-N L-1; P = 0.1 or 0.5 mg-P L-1) and the predicted cell densities were substantially correspondent to experimental data. Under various N: P ratios and D values, characteristics of domination for each species were predicted, indicating that Cyclotella sp. tended to be dominant under high P concentrations (P = 0.36 mg-P L-1) when the N: P ratio was less than 7.0, and M. aeruginosa could not form algal blooms at the N: P ratio = 7.0 (N = 0.7 mg-N L-1). It was also suggested that the dilution rate leading to the Cyclotella sp. domination required 0.20 day(-1) or higher regardless of the N: P ratios.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				MAY	2017	228	5							174	10.1007/s11270-017-3343-3								WOS:000401070100006

The methodology provides suitable information to generate strategies focusing on health problems. Giardia cysts (GC) and Cryptosporidium oocysts (CO) are considered emerging pathogens that can infect human and animals by ingesting contaminated food or water, where food and water are transport vehicles for these parasites. Studies for GC and CO have reported occurrences for these parasites in water up to 100%, and some of these studies documented a number of cases, about 403,000 people, infected worldwide. This review is focused on compiling the most relevant works assessing the risk for GC and CO and their presence in different water samples that are susceptible for direct and indirect human consumption. The annual risk infection probability for these parasites has been reported from different water sources, with a range between 1 x 10(-6) and 1, while the world standard regulation is 1 x 10(-4). The infection probability depends not only on water quality but also on water treatment implementations.

Twelve of the 15 urban lakes investigated were eutrophic, of which five were hypertrophic, while only seven of the 16 suburban lakes were eutrophic. The Trophic Index (TRIX) was the best predictive index to identify the eutrophication level of the lakes. Classification trees (CTs) were applied to study the trophic status of lakes and identify the driving variables. The results demonstrated that eutrophication in the lakes of Hanoi was driven by nutrients and organic enrichment, as well as by inappropriate management such as unplanned embankment and water uses. DIN, BOD, lake size and embankment were the key parameters controlling eutrophication in the lakes of Hanoi.																	1747-6585	1747-6593				MAY	2017	31	2					176	183		10.1111/wej.12231								WOS:000401235100005

Determination of volatilisation rate constants of trihalomethanes from heated distilled and finished tap water	WATER AND ENVIRONMENT JOURNAL												Disinfection of drinking water is one of the major responsibilities facing cities, towns and rural areas around the world. However, most disinfectants react with organic material in the water to produce a wide variety of by-products. Halogenated methane compounds (THMs) are among these by-products and have been linked to adverse health effects in humans. The human exposure pathway includes: ingestion, inhalation and dermal adsorption, and THM volatilisation plays a role in all three. This paper examines the volatilisation of four trihalomethane compounds and relates their volatilisation rate constants to temperature, concentration and solvent matrix. Volatilisation rate constants were incorporated into a first-order model that will allow resulting THM exposure concentrations to be calculated for household uses that involve heating of drinking water. Utilisation of the THM volatilisation rate constants developed in this manuscript should improve future exposure estimates.																	1747-6585	1747-6593				MAY	2017	31	2					252	261		10.1111/wej.12246								WOS:000401235100014

Field campaign on sediment transport behaviour in a pressure main from pumping station to wastewater treatment plant in Berlin	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												As part of the project KURAS, the Berliner Wasserbetriebe realized a field campaign in 2015 in order to increase the process knowledge regarding the behaviour of transported sediment in the pressure main leading from the pumpstation to the wastewater treatment plant. The field campaign was conducted because of a lack of knowledge about the general condition of the pressure main due to its bad accessibility and the suspicion of deposits caused by hydraulic underload. The practical evidence of the sediment transport performance of this part of the sewer system, dependent on different load cases, should present a basis for further analysis, for example regarding flushing measures. A positive side-effect of the investigation was the description of the amount of pollutants caused by different weather conditions in combined sewer systems and the alterations of the sewage composition due to biogenic processes during transport. The concept included the parallel sampling of the inflow at the pumpstation and the outflow at the end of the pressure main during different weather conditions. By calculating the inflow to the pressure main, as well as its outflow at different flow conditions, it was possible to draw conclusions in regard to the transport behaviour of sediment and the bioprocesses within an 8.5 km section of the pressure main. The results show clearly that the effects of sedimentation and remobilization depend on the flow conditions. The balance of the total suspended solids (TSS) load during daily variations in dry weather shows that the remobilization effect during the run-off peak is not able to compensate for the period of sedimentation happening during the low flow at night. Based on the data for dry weather, an average of 238 kg of TSS deposits in the pressure main remains per day. The remobilization of sediment occurs only due to the abruptly increased delivery rates caused by precipitation events. These high pollution loads lead to a sudden strain at the wastewater treatment plant. It was found that the sediment transport behaviour is characterized by sedimentation up to a flow velocity of 0.35 m/s, while remobilization effects occur above 0.5 m/s. The assumption of bad sediment transport performance in the pressure main was confirmed. Therefore, the results can be used as a basis for further analysis, for example regarding periodical flushing as a means of cleaning the pressure main. The findings, especially regarding the methods and processes, are transferable and can be applied to other pressure mains in combined sewer systems. Besides the outlined evaluation of the sediment transport behaviour of the pressure main, the collected data were used in the project to calibrate a sewer system model, including a water quality model for the catchment area, and as a contribution towards an early physically based sediment transport modelling in InfoWorks CS.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				MAY	2017	75	9					2025	2033		10.2166/wst.2017.044								WOS:000401150500004	28498115

Both global production of chemicals and global water withdrawal grow faster than human population. This implies increased chemical threats to water, and creates a strong driver for mitigation to protect human health, ecosystem integrity and ecosystem services. Here we connect the perspectives of the water cycle and the chemical life cycle and review possible mitigation options. We categorize mitigation options in various stages of the chemicals' life cycle, taking various sectors and environmental pathways into account. More technologically oriented versus other types of mitigation options are discerned, and their relevance on spatial and temporal scale is discussed. We review various water treatment techniques in relation to physical-chemical properties of chemicals. Finally we discuss how a mitigation database can be used to assess the effectiveness of interventions, by coupling them to regional or global hydrological models. A solution-focused and systems-oriented perspective combined with a mitigation database offers a common perspective amongst actors on the effects for water quality of possible mitigation options throughout the chemical's life cycle, in various sectors and at various places in the water system. This can stimulate coherent implementation of effective mitigation options, cross-sectoral learning and further innovations to improve water quality.				van Wezel, Annemarie/N-9758-2013	van Wezel, Annemarie/0000-0002-6875-957X; Posthuma, Leo/0000-0003-0399-5499												2053-1400	2053-1419				MAY 1	2017	3	3					403	414		10.1039/c7ew00077d								WOS:000400932400003

To address this limitation, this study provides a new transient-state operation mode for an MFC sensor, which is proved applicable for three kinds of detections with higher sensitivity. Under the transient-state mode, the sensitivity increases by 50% to 247% when testing organic matter, acidic toxicants and heavy metals, compared to that of an MFC sensor in conventional constant external resistance connected mode. The mechanism for the improvement is analyzed both experimentally and with an equivalent circuit model. To obtain a higher sensitivity, the output signal of Uon (connected to the external resistance) is more adapted for organic matter monitoring with a wider range, while the output signal of Uoff (disconnected to the external resistance) is better for toxicity monitoring.

Water quality and filter performance of nutrient-, oxidant- and media-enhanced drinking water biofilters	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY												Nutrient, oxidant and media enhancement strategies were applied to pilot-scale biofilters with the objective of enhancing biodegradation to improve effluent water quality (e.g., TOC, DOC, SUVA, THMfp, HAAfp) and filter performance (e.g., effluent turbidity and head loss). While some statistically significant (alpha = 0.05) differences in DOC removal and DBPfp were identified as a result of specific enhancement strategies, enhancement strategies did not result in improvements in water quality (as measured by TOC, DOC, SUVA and DBPfp) that could be considered of practical operational importance. Water quality improvements were either operationally inconsistent, small in magnitude and/or within the deviation that would be expected from the biofilters when operated under equivalent ambient (i.e., not enhanced) conditions. With respect to filter performance, enhancement strategies also occasionally resulted in a statistically significant difference in effluent turbidity and head loss. However, when identified, statistically significant mean differences in effluent turbidity were deemed not meaningful given the instrument accuracy (i.e., perpendicular to 0.02 NTU), the relatively small magnitude of the mean differences, or the magnitude of the mean difference observed between biofilters operated under equivalent ambient conditions. With respect to head loss, statistically significant mean differences in head loss that were also considered meaningful given the magnitude of the deviation between ambient biofilters and the accuracy of the pressure transmitters, were largely consistent with the literature; however, the magnitude of the mean differences that showed improvement to head loss were small (10-18 cm), and likely would not be sufficient to substantially extended filter run times to have any practical operational importance.

Variable rate nitrogen management in corn: Response in two crop rotations	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Decision-making criteria to accurately predict nitrogen (N) rates in corn (Zea mays L.) would greatly benefit canopy sensor-guided variable rate N (VRN) management with positive implications for water quality. The objectives of this study were to measure corn yield response to VRN applied at the midvegetative corn growth stage and compare yield and agronomic efficiency (AE) between a one-time spring-N application (preplant or early sidedress) and two VRN management strategies, split-N (VRNS) and rescue-N (VRNR). Field sites located across Iowa received spring-N fertilizer at six application rates, with additional N potentially applied with each VRN spring-N rate and for the VRNS and VRNR strategies at the V10 growth stage based on canopy sensing. Drought conditions were evident during 2012 and 2013 in Iowa, which resulted in reduced corn yield and requirement for N fertilizer at many site-years. The VRN with 0 and 56 kg N ha-1 (50 lb N ac-1) applied in the spring was most closely aligned with calculated economic optimum N rate and AE. The VRNS and VRNR strategies applied more N than was needed, compared to spring-N only. Canopy sensors did not detect adequate to excess N, and therefore N applied prior to VRN application should be part of sensing-based algorithm criteria. Mean corn yield with the soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.)-corn rotation was not maintained with VRN when no spring-N was applied. Yield comparison showed no differences between spring-N, VRNS, and VRNR for both rotations. However, the greatest AE was achieved with spring-N and the VRNS strategy in the soybean-corn rotation. Weather events that occur during and after canopy sensing and VRN application remain an important factor for successful corn yield response to N rate and timing, and should be considered with canopy sensor VRN. Results from this study provide feedback on how to translate remote sensing data into VRN management.																	0022-4561	1941-3300				MAY-JUN	2017	72	3					183	190		10.2489/jswc.72.3.183								WOS:000400389700005

Cost-effectiveness of reverse auctions for watershed nutrient reductions in the presence of climate variability: An empirical approach for the Boone River watershed	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has predicted that changes in climate patterns (higher temperatures, changes in extreme precipitation events, and higher level of humidity) will adversely impact water quality. Given the implications of climate change on water and soil quality, it is important for watershed managers, stakeholders, and policymakers to understand not only the effectiveness of different conservation practices in improving water quality, but also the cost-effectiveness of a watershed-level policy program designed for implementing conservation practices. A system of points measuring the efficiency of five conservation practices in reducing nutrient (nitrogen [N] and phosphorus [P]) runoff are estimated using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model in this study for the Boone River watershed (BRW) in north central Iowa. The points can be interpreted as indices of the environmental benefits associated with each conservation practice. Among the various market instruments proposed as resource and cost-revelation mechanisms, competitive biddings, also referred to as "reverse auctions" or procurement auctions, have come to the attention of researchers and policymakers. Competitive bidding mechanisms induce landowners to submit bids close to their opportunity costs, thus increasing the budgetary cost-effectiveness and revealing the true costs of adopting different conservation practices. This study considers the cost efficiency of reverse auction programs designed for improving water quality in the BRW, where the bids are constructed using the system of points.																	0022-4561	1941-3300				MAY-JUN	2017	72	3					280	295		10.2489/jswc.72.3.280								WOS:000400389700015						
J	Agashichev, S; Kumar, J				Agashichev, Sergey; Kumar, Jayesh			UF pretreatment at elevated temperature within the scheme of hybrid desalination: Performance and environmental impact	MEMBRANE WATER TREATMENT												This study was aimed at ultrafiltration (UF) as a pretreatment before reverse osmosis (RO) within the scheme of hybrid reverse osmosis-multistage flush (RO-MSF) desalination. Seawater at elevated temperature (after MSF heat-exchangers) was used as a feed in this process. The pretreatment system was represented as a set of functionally-linked technological segments such as: UF filtration, backwashing, chemical-enhanced backwashing, cleaning, waste disposal, etc. The process represents the sequences of operating cycles. The cycle, in turn, consists of the following unit operations: filtration, backwashing and chemical-enhanced backwashing (CEB). Quantitative assessment was based on the following indicators: normalized permeability, transmembrane pressure, specific energy and water consumption, specific waste generation. UF pre-treatment is accompanied by the following waste streams: W1= 1.19x10 power of -2 m(3) (disposed NaOCl with 0.0044% wt.)/m(3) (filtrate); W2= 5.95x10 power of -3 m(3) (disposed H2SO4 with 0.052% wt.)/m 3 (filtrate); W3= 7.26x10 power of -2 m(3) (disposed sea water)/m(3) (filtrate). Specific energy consumption is 1.11x10 power of -1 kWh/m(3) (filtrate). The indicators evaluated over the cycles with conventional (non-chemical) backwashing were compared with the cycles accompanied by CEB. A positive impact of CEB on performance indicators was demonstrated namely: normalized UF resistance remains unchanged within the regime accompanied by CEB, whereas the lack of CEB results in 30% of its growth. Those quantitative indicators can be incorporated into the target function for solving different optimization problems. They can be used in the software for optimisation of operating regimes or in the synthesis of optimal flow-diagram. The cycle characteristics, process parameters and water quality data are attached.																	2005-8624	2092-7037				MAY	2017	8	3					279	292		10.12989/mwt.2017.8.3.279								WOS:000399419100005						
J	Mahoney, PC; Bishop, MJ				Mahoney, P. C.; Bishop, M. J.			Assessing risk of estuarine ecosystem collapse	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Estuarine ecosystems are increasingly threatened by coastal development and climate change. The large number of estuaries globally necessitates risk assessment to prioritise conservation efforts. Schemes for assessing risk of ecosystem collapse have been designed around terrestrial ecosystems, often defined by a single characteristic vegetation type, with their applicability to estuaries unclear. Here we consider the causes and symptoms of estuarine ecosystem collapse and assess, using a case study of the Chesapeake Bay, the applicability of ecosystem-level risk assessments to estuarine ecosystems, typified by mosaics of habitats. Functional estuaries are characterised by habitat heterogeneity and connectivity, maintenance of constituent habitats through recruitment, and a complex trophic structure including apex predators. Additionally, primary production and biomass are dominated by benthic, as opposed to pelagic, species. Hence, homogenisation of habitat types, decreased connectivity, recruitment failure, loss of apex predators and a decreased ratio of benthic to pelagic biomass may be symptoms of a trajectory towards collapse. In terrestrial ecosystems, criteria used for assessing risk of ecosystem collapse include declining or restricted distribution of ecosystems, degradation of the abiotic environment, changes in species composition and declining ecological function. As the boundaries of estuaries are typically defined by topography, rarely do significant changes in the area of the ecosystem occur. Furthermore, because the extent of estuaries is typically small, assessments based on area of occupancy may over-inflate risk. Instead, criteria based on abiotic and biotic changes, many of which are documented through monitoring programs, may be most useful for risk assessments of estuarine ecosystems.

J	Feng, D; Kang, YH; Wan, SQ; Liu, SP				Feng, Di; Kang, Yaohu; Wan, Shuqin; Liu, Shiping			Lateral flushing regime for managing emitter clogging under drip irrigation with saline groundwater	IRRIGATION SCIENCE												Water scarcity forces saline water to be used in the Bohai Rim Region, China. However, emitter clogging is a persistent and widespread problem in drip irrigation systems when irrigating with saline water. To find a suitable lateral flushing regime for drip irrigation systems using saline groundwater, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of five different lateral flushing frequencies. The lateral flushing frequencies were at 1-, 5-, 10-, 30- and 50-day intervals using saline and fresh groundwater. The total duration of irrigation was 100 days, with a total application of 122 h for each water source. The drip irrigation system consisted of hydrocyclone separator, disc filters and screen filters with inline-labyrinth emitters and thin-wall laterals. The results of this experiment are trusted only at such conditions, and show that emitter discharge and uniformity decreased in all treatments. Flushing laterals every 5 days was adequate to control emitter clogging for drip irrigation systems applying the fresh groundwater, while the other three less flushing frequencies failed to prevent clogging. Emitters in the saline groundwater treatments clogged earlier and more severely than those in the fresh groundwater treatments. Five flushing frequencies under drip irrigation using saline groundwater failed to prevent clogging. Based on the findings above, to better control emitter clogging, freshwater is suggested to be used to flush laterals following irrigation with saline groundwater and longer flushing duration is recommended, which needs further study.																	0342-7188	1432-1319				MAY	2017	35	3					217	225		10.1007/s00271-017-0536-x								WOS:000399689100005

An evaluation of existent methods for estimation of embankment dam breach parameters	NATURAL HAZARDS												The study of dam-break analysis is considered important to predict the peak discharge during dam failure. This is essential to assess economic, social and environmental impacts downstream and to prepare the emergency response plan. Dam breach parameters such as breach width, breach height and breach formation time are the key variables to estimate the peak discharge during dam break. This study presents the evaluation of existing methods for estimation of dam breach parameters. Since all of these methods adopt regression analysis, uncertainty analysis of these methods becomes necessary to assess their performance. Uncertainty was performed using the data of more than 140 case studies of past recorded failures of dams, collected from different sources in the literature. The accuracy of the existing methods was tested, and the values of mean absolute relative error were found to be ranging from 0.39 to 1.05 for dam breach width estimation and from 0.6 to 0.8 for dam failure time estimation. In this study, artificial neural network (ANN) was recommended as an alternate method for estimation of dam breach parameters. The ANN method is proposed due to its accurate prediction when it was applied to similar other cases in water resources.																	0921-030X	1573-0840				MAY	2017	87	1					545	566		10.1007/s11069-017-2764-z								WOS:000399699100026

Though physically-based hydrodynamic models are the most detailed means to simulate salinity processes, they are commonly restricted by data insufficiency issues both in spatial resolution and temporal lasting. This motivates us to build a statistical model enable simulation and scenario analysis for coastal salinity change with limited observations. A Bayesian neural network (BNN) model is built hereby to simulate salinity. It offers more precise estimation compared with the conventional artificial neural network. Meanwhile, the model gives the uncertainty behaviors of the final salinity simulation which is not available for other methods. Future scenarios of salinity change are constructed and analyzed in different time periods on the basis of the validated BNN model. Results indicate that the water quality over lower Pearl River is degrading along with more significant uncertainties. Further analysis suggests that streamflow alteration has a more direct impact on salinity variations than the sea-level change does. The method allows a profound analysis of the potential influence on water quality degradation in coastal and low-lying regions in support of water management and adaptation toward global climate change.																	1436-3240	1436-3259				MAY	2017	31	4					981	991		10.1007/s00477-017-1399-7								WOS:000399692500010

Interactive Reservoir-Watershed Modeling Framework for Integrated Water Quality Management	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Eutrophication is a serious water pollution problem in many lakes and reservoirs. One method of understanding the causes of eutrophication and devising strategies to address this phenomenon is watershed modeling. An integrated model is developed in this paper for simulating and evaluating the water quality protection strategies of reservoirs based on controlling the upstream point and non-point sources of pollution and also reservoir operation. To achieve this, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model is used for modeling of the surface runoff and transportation of pollutant load over the watershed area and then, the numerical model CE-Qual-W2 is used for simulating the reservoir water quality. These models are linked to simulate the transmission and distribution of water quality variables in the Seimare watershed-reservoir system, west part of Iran. After calibration of the models, different strategies for reduction of pollution over the watershed are simulated and ranked based on their efficiency in reducing the pollution load entering into the reservoir. Results show that completion and modernization of the sewage network and wastewater treatment plant of Kermanshah city as long as adopting some measures against the direct release of municipal wastewater into the Gharehsou River can reduce the pollution load by 40-50% as the best short term strategy. It is also found that in the long-term period, watershed management and decreasing local animal husbandry activities are the most effective measure for reducing the nutrient load entering Seimare reservoir, and thus need to be considered in the future watershed management policies and programs.																	0920-4741	1573-1650				MAY	2017	31	7					2105	2125		10.1007/s11269-017-1627-4								WOS:000399306200004						
J	Hawkins, G				Hawkins, Gay			The impacts of bottled water: an analysis of bottled water markets and their interactions with tap water provision	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER												The phenomenal recent growth of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottled water is distinctively different from previous bottled mineral water markets that have been around for centuries. Plastic bottled water (hereafter BW) has been marketed as a fast moving consumer good, as a healthy drinking choice and, increasingly, as a safer alternative to existing drinking water. BW markets emerged in response to several key factors: changes in consumer drinking practices; opportunistic strategies on the part of beverage companies to diversify into water; the development of PET bottles; the intensification of sophisticated branding techniques; and various drinking water scares ranging from state failure to water quality controversies. In many cities with safe drinking water BW has faced significant opposition. While this opposition appears to have done little to halt market growth it has prompted a whole new terrain of drinking water politics. These politics foreground the effects of representing and delivering drinking water as an individualized good versus distribution via reticulated networks in which consumers gain access to a collective service. However, activist critiques of BW can sometimes miss the subtle ways in which bottles are ontologically interfering with the political and public health values of safe tap water. These impacts are complex and highly variable according to the specific context of existing drinking water provision and hydrocultures and the ways in which bottles interact with these. Understanding these interactions could help limit the capacity of bottled water markets to undermine the ongoing commitment to safe collective water provision in the interest of the common good.

Bioretention-Cistern-Irrigation Treatment Train to Minimize Stormwater Runoff	JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE WATER IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT												Water quality of parking lot (similar to 1,858m(2)) stormwater runoff and corresponding bioretention-treated effluent flow (collected in a cistern) were analyzed for total suspended solids (TSS), total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), electrical conductivity (EC), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn). The novel system includes a standard bioretention facility underdrained to a cistern to store treated stormwater and pumped to a vegetable garden for irrigation. The site abstraction, average bioretention abstraction, and bowl volume were estimated to be 8,500, 4,378, and 895L, respectively; this indicates that rain events of more than 0.45cm are necessary to produce runoff and more than 0.75cm will produce system overflow. Cistern water concentrations averaged (+/- 1 SD) 0.17 +/- 0.04mg/L TP, 1.08 +/- 0.53mg/LTN, 0.11 +/- 0.02mS/cm EC (nonwinter), 15.7 +/- 17.6 mu g/L copper, and 12.2 +/- 6.3 mu g/L zinc. All of these concentrations were lower than measured in tap water, indicating effective treatment by the system and that the cistern represented a good-quality water source for irrigation. However, more data for winter EC are required to address EC removal effectiveness of the treatment train system.

The state of Pennsylvania has older cities and towns, ample water resources, and water quality problems that are all connected by aging, existing infrastructure for stormwater management. As older cities and towns begin to invest in new infrastructure, they have two, relatively new technology options: first, green infrastructure, and second, smart infrastructure, which adds sensors, controls, and communications. This paper examines how officials from cities and water agencies perceive these two solutions for their current stormwater management problems. Semistructured interviews were conducted with officials from the five cities and towns throughout Pennsylvania that have enacted stormwater fees to fund further infrastructure investment. Responses indicate that the officials perceive green infrastructure as performing inconsistently across its lifecycle and requiring labor-intensive maintenance. These officials hold positive views about smart infrastructure but want more information on performance and costs to reduce runoff. This study suggests research and tools that would help these officials address their stormwater management problems.

The major developmental history and applications of the model are also presented. The results provide utility to others looking for a quick reference to gauge the integrity of their own unique SWMM application. A gap analysis assesses the model's ability to perform water-quality simulations considering green infrastructure (GI)/low impact development (LID) designs and effectiveness. It is concluded that the level of detail underlying the conceptual model of SWMM versus its overall computational parsimony is well balancedmaking it an adequate model for large and medium-scale hydrologic applications.

J	O'Connor, TP				O'Connor, Thomas P.			Detection of Semivolatile Organic Compounds in Permeable Pavement Infiltrate	JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE WATER IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT												The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Edison Environmental Center (EEC) has a research and demonstration permeable parking lot comprised of three different permeable systems: permeable asphalt, pervious concrete, and permeable interlocking concrete pavers. Water quality and quantity analysis has been ongoing since January 2010. This paper describes analysis of semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs) to determine if hydrocarbons were in water that infiltrated through the permeable surfaces. SVOCs were analyzed in samples collected from 11 dates over a 3-year period, from February 8, 2010 to April 1, 2013. Results are broadly divided into three categories: 42 chemicals were never detected; 12 chemicals (11 chemical test) were detected at a rate of less than 10% or less; and 22 chemicals were detected at a frequency of 10% or greater (ranging from 10 to 66.5% detections). Fundamental and exploratory statistical analyses were performed on the 22 most observed chemicals. The statistical analyses were limited due to low frequency of detections and dilutions of samples, which impacted detection limits. The infiltrate data through three permeable surfaces were analyzed as nonparametric data by the Kaplan-Meier estimation method for fundamental statistics; there were some statistically observable differences in median concentration between pavement types when using Tarone-Ware comparison hypothesis test. A result was that three groups could be identified based on whether observed porous asphalt infiltrate concentration were greater than, similar to, or less than permeable interlocking concrete pavers infiltrate concentration. Identifying these three groups allowed one-way analysis on chemical attributes; the octonal water partitioning (logKOW), number of benzene rings, and molecular complexity were all significant. These 22 most observed chemicals in the infiltrate were further tested by Spearman rank order nonparametric for correlations between frequency of detection and chemical attributes; significant correlations were observed for porous asphalt frequency of detection and molecular weight (MW), Henry's constant, logKOW and molecular complexity, while both permeable concretes did not have any significant correlations between frequency of detection and chemical parameters. Conclusions from the statistical analyses on the 22 most frequently observed SVOCs in the infiltrate indicate that porous asphalt acts as a source for chemicals with low logKOW and MW and a sink for chemicals with high logKOW and MW, while no significant pattern was observed in the SVOC infiltrate concentrations of the two types of concrete.																	2379-6111					MAY	2017	3	2							04017005	10.1061/JSWBAY.0000822								WOS:000398595700002						
J	Sun, HF; Shi, BY; Yang, F; Wang, DS				Sun, Huifang; Shi, Baoyou; Yang, Fan; Wang, Dongsheng			Effects of sulfate on heavy metal release from iron corrosion scales in drinking water distribution system	WATER RESEARCH												Trace heavy metals accumulated in iron corrosion scales within a drinking water distribution system (DWDS) could potentially be released to bulk water and consequently deteriorate the tap water quality. The objective of this study was to identify and evaluate the release of trace heavy metals in DWDS under changing source water conditions. Experimental pipe loops with different iron corrosion scales were set up to simulate the actual DWDS. The effects of sulfate levels on heavy metal release were systemically investigated. Heavy metal releases of Mn, Ni, Cu, Pb, Cr and As could be rapidly triggered by sulfate addition but the releases slowly decreased over time. Heavy metal release was more severe in pipes transporting groundwater (GW) than in pipes transporting surface water (SW). There were strong positive correlations (R-2 > 0.8) between the releases of Fe and Mn, Fe and Ni, Fe and Cu, and Fe and Pb. When switching to higher sulfate water, iron corrosion scales in all pipe loops tended to be more stable (especially in pipes transporting GW), with a larger proportion of stable constituents (mainly Fe3O4) and fewer unstable compounds ((beta-FeOOH, gamma-FeOOH, FeCO3 and amorphous iron oxides). The main functional iron reducing bacteria (IRB) communities were favorable for the formation of Fe3O4. The transformation of corrosion scales and the growth of sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) accounted for the gradually reduced heavy metal release with time. The higher metal release in pipes transporting GW could be due to increased Fe-6(OH)(12)CO3 content under higher sulfate concentrations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Water quality effects of intermittent water supply in Arraijan, Panama	WATER RESEARCH												Intermittent drinking water supply is common in low- and middle-income countries throughout the world and can cause water quality to degrade in the distribution system. In this study, we characterized water quality in one study zone with continuous supply and three zones with intermittent supply in the drinking water distribution network in Arraijan, Panama. Low or zero pressures occurred in all zones, and negative pressures occurred in the continuous zone and two of the intermittent zones. Despite hydraulic conditions that created risks for backflow and contaminant intrusion, only four of 423 (0.9%) grab samples collected at random times were positive for total coliform bacteria and only one was positive for E. coli. Only nine of 496 (1.8%) samples had turbidity >1.0 NTU and all samples had >0.2 mg/L free chlorine residual. In contrast, water quality was often degraded during the first-flush period (when supply first returned after an outage). Still, routine and first-flush water quality under intermittent supply was much better in Arraijan than that reported in a previous study conducted in India. Better water quality in Arraijan could be due to better water quality leaving the treatment plant, shorter supply outages, higher supply pressures, a more consistent and higher chlorine residual, and fewer contaminant sources near pipes. The results illustrate that intermittent supply and its effects on water quality can vary greatly between and within distribution networks. The study also demonstrated that monitoring techniques designed specifically for intermittent supply, such as continuous pressure monitoring and sampling the first flush, can detect water quality threats and degradation that would not likely be detected with conventional monitoring.

However, the related human disturbances and natural processes reflect a great complexity, which hinders quantitative Understanding. We here consider the Zaamar Goldfield in Mongolia, one of the world's largest placer mining sites, located in the Tuul River basin (upper Lake Baikal basin). A main study aim is to investigate relations between patterns of increased sediment loads along the Tuul River and the (spatially variable) area coverage of active or recently abandoned placer mines in the river vicinity. Specifically, we compare observed loads derived from nested catchment areas with the output from spatially distributed soil erosion modelling. Results showed that riverine sediment loads in mining areas reflect soil losses both from soil erosion and direct human impacts (e.g. waste water discharge), which are two to three orders of magnitude higher than the input from natural areas dominated by soil erosion alone. Notably, the sediment load contributions from the mining areas were insensitive to changes in hydrometeorological conditions, whereas contributions from natural areas were much lower during drier periods (as expected when governed by soil erosion by water). Accordingly, the relative contribution to the total sediment load (TSL) of metal-enriched soil from mining areas is likely to be particularly pronounced (with estimated values of about 80% of TSL) under drier hydrometeorological conditions. This is consistent with observations of considerably elevated metal concentrations under low flow conditions and implies that if annual average discharge continues to decrease in the Tuul River as well as the entire Selenga River system, increased metal concentrations may be one of the consequences.

J	Perez, FF; Sweeck, L; Elskens, M; Bauwens, W				Perez, Fabricio Fiengo; Sweeck, Lieve; Elskens, Marc; Bauwens, Willy			A discontinuous finite element suspended sediment transport model for water quality assessments in river networks	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Suspended sediment plays an important role in the distribution and transport of many pollutants (such as radionuclides) in rivers. Pollutants may adsorb on fine suspended particles (e.g. clay) and spread according to the suspended sediment movement. Hence, the simulation of the suspended sediment mechanism is indispensable for realistic transport modelling. This paper presents and tests a simple mathematical model for predicting the suspended sediment transport in river networks. The model is based on the van Rijn suspended load formula and the advection-diffusion equation with a source or sink term that represents the erosion or deposition fluxes. The transport equation is solved numerically with the discontinuous finite element method. The model evaluation was performed in two steps, first by comparing model simulations with the measured suspended sediment concentrations in the Grote Nete-Molse Nete River in Belgium, and second by a model intercomparison with the sediment transport model NST MIKE 11. The simulations reflect the measurements with a Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency of 0.6, while the efficiency between the proposed model and the NST MIKE 11 simulations is 0.96. Both evaluations indicate that the proposed sediment transport model, that is sufficiently simple to be practical, is providing realistic results.																	0885-6087	1099-1085				APR 30	2017	31	9					1804	1816		10.1002/hyp.11151								WOS:000400159100010

Variable nitrate concentration-discharge relationships in a forested watershed	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The relationship between solute concentrations and discharge can inform an integrated understanding of hydrological and biogeochemical processes at watershed scales. Recent work from multiple catchments has shown that there is typically little variation in concentration relative to large variations in discharge. This pattern has been described as chemostatic behavior. Pond Branch, a forested headwater catchment in Maryland, has been monitored for stream nitrate (NO3-) concentrations at weekly intervals for 14years. In the growing season and autumn of 2011 a high-frequency optical NO3- sensor was used to supplement the long-term weekly data. In this watershed, long-term weekly data show that NO3- concentrations decrease with increasing discharge whereas 6months of 15-minute sensor observed concentrations reveal a more chemostatic behavior. High-frequency NO3- concentrations from the sensor collected during different storm events reveal variable concentration-discharge patterns highlighting the importance of high resolution data and ecohydrological drivers in controlling solute export for biologically reactive solutes such as NO3-.																	0885-6087	1099-1085				APR 30	2017	31	9					1817	1824		10.1002/hyp.11136								WOS:000400159100011

However, little is known about the abundance or temporal variation of major ions in urban runoff. This study explores the spatio-temporal variation of major dissolved ions (Na, K, Ca, Mg, Cl, NO3, and SO4) and total dissolved solids (TDS) in cold climate urban stormwater. Three watersheds with varying degrees of urban land use intensity and imperviousness (from 36% to 66%) in Helsinki, Finland, were continuously monitored for 5 years using an automated sampling procedure to obtain stormwater discharge and ion concentrations and, thus, loadings. High-resolution datasets, including long-term continuous discharge, both measured and simulated (using Storm Water Management Model), and automatic water quality sampling enabled the accurate calculation of loads of ions and TDS. Water quality was related to explanatory watershed characteristics (e.g., watershed physiography and sampling time) using hierarchical clustering, nonmetric multidimensional scaling, and hierarchical partitioning methods. Urban land use contributed to increased ion concentrations and loads year-round. This study highlights how stormwater ion concentrations are elevated across seasons, indicating chronic pollution phenomena. The greatest loads occurred during summer (except for Na and Cl), while the highest variation in loads was observed in autumn. Significant clusters among ions were found in the hierarchical cluster analysis, suggesting similar temporal patterns and sources for the ions in each cluster. The importance of land use was evident, though in the most urbanized watershed, concentrations were not linked to any of the investigated watershed characteristics. Based on our results, only Na and Cl are manageable by alternative winter road antiskid practices, whereas other ions resulted from diffuse pollution sources, being therefore more difficult to control. Finally, this study contributes to an increased understanding of the temporal and spatial patterns of ions in stormwater and highlights the need for consistent time series data for ion monitoring under cold climatic conditions in order to enable reliable estimates of their loads to adjacent water bodies. Finally, year-round stormwater treatment is highly recommended.

Effects of reservoir stratification and watershed hydrology on manganese and iron in a dam-regulated river	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The presence of metals, including manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe), adversely impacts water quality. In seasonally stratified reservoirs, Mn and Fe can accumulate in the water column due to reducing conditions in sediments and be released to downstream rivers through dam discharge. In addition to reservoir stratification influences, the release of metals downstream is influenced by hydrologic conditions in the river. We examined the seasonal and spatial variability of Mn and Fe concentrations in a eutrophic, hydropower reservoir and the downstream river over a two-year period. Overall, we found that reservoir stratification was a strong predictor of tailrace Mn and Fe concentrations but that tailrace Fe concentrations were also influenced by dam discharge. Downgradient of the tailrace, river discharge and suspended sediment were the dominant predictors of both Mn and Fe concentrations. Using our data, we develop a conceptual model of seasonal and hydrologic drivers of metal concentrations. The model can be modified for other systems aiding drinking water utilities and other water users in forecasting under what seasonal and hydrologic conditions that Mn and Fe concentrations in river systems are likely to be elevated.

J	Kenari, SLD; Barbeau, B				Kenari, Seyedeh Laleh Dashtban; Barbeau, Benoit			Integrated pyrolucite fluidized bed-membrane hybrid process for improved iron and manganese control in drinking water	WATER RESEARCH												Newly developed ceramic membrane technologies offer numerous advantages over the conventional polymeric membranes. This work proposes a new configuration, an integrated pyrolucite fluidized bed (PFB)-ceramic MOH hybrid process, for improved iron and manganese control in drinking water. A pilot-scale study was undertaken to evaluate the performance of this process with respect to iron and manganese control as well as membrane fouling. In addition, the fouling of commercially available ceramic membranes in conventional preoxidation-MF/UF process was compared with the hybrid process configuration. In this regard, a series of experiments were conducted under different influent water quality and operating conditions. Fouling mechanisms and reversibility were analyzed using blocking law and resistance-in-series models. The results evidenced that the flux rate and the concentration of calcium and humic acids in the feed water have a substantial impact on the filtration behavior of both membranes. The model for constant flux compressible cake formation well described the rise in trans membrane pressure. The compressibility of the filter cake substantially increased in the presence of 2 mg/L humic acids. The presence of calcium ions caused significant aggregation of manganese dioxide and humic acid which severely impacted the extent of membrane fouling. The PFB pretreatment properly alleviated membrane fouling by removing more than 75% and 95% of iron and manganese, respectively. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Keupers, I; Willems, P				Keupers, Ingrid; Willems, Patrick			Development and testing of a fast conceptual river water quality model	WATER RESEARCH												Modern, model based river quality management strongly relies on river water quality models to simulate the temporal and spatial evolution of pollutant concentrations in the water body. Such models are typically constructed by extending detailed hydrodynamic models with a component describing the advection-diffusion and water quality transformation processes in a detailed, physically based way. This approach is too computational time demanding, especially when simulating long time periods that are needed for statistical analysis of the results or when model sensitivity analysis, calibration and validation require a large number of model runs. To overcome this problem, a structure identification method to set up a conceptual river water quality model has been developed. Instead of calculating the water quality concentrations at each water level and discharge node, the river branch is divided into conceptual reservoirs based on user information such as location of interest and boundary inputs. These reservoirs are modelled as Plug Flow Reactor (PFR) and Continuously Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) to describe advection and diffusion processes. The same water quality transformation processes as in the detailed models are considered but with adjusted residence times based on the hydrodynamic simulation results and calibrated to the detailed water quality simulation results. The developed approach allows for a much faster calculation time (factor 10(5)) without significant loss of accuracy, making it feasible to perform time demanding scenario runs.

Effect of advanced oxidation on N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) formation and microbial ecology during pilot-scale biological activated carbon filtration	WATER RESEARCH												Water treatment combining advanced oxidative processes with subsequent exposure to biological activated carbon (BAC) holds promise for the attenuation of recalcitrant pollutants. Here we contrast oxidation and subsequent biofiltration of treated wastewater effluent employing either ozone or UV/ H202 followed by BAC during pilot-scale implementation. Both treatment trains largely met target water quality goals by facilitating the removal of a suite of trace organics and bulk water parameters. Nnitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) formation was observed in ozone fed BAC columns during biofiltration and to a lesser extent in UV/H2O2 fed columns and was most pronounced at 20 min of empty bed contact time (EBCT) when compared to shorter EBCTs evaluated. While microbial populations were highly similar in the upper reaches, deeper samples revealed a divergence within and between BAC filtration systems where EBCT was identified to be a significant environmental predictor for shifts in microbial populations. The abundance of Nitrospira in the top samples of both columns provides an explanation for the oxidation of nitrite and corresponding increases in nitrate concentrations during BAC transit and support interplay between nitrogen cycling with nitrosamine formation. The results of this study demonstrate that pretreatments using ozone versus UV/H2O2 impart modest differences to the overall BAC microbial population structural and functional attributes, and further highlight the need to evaluate NDMA formation prior to full-scale implementation of BAC in potable reuse applications.

Flow cytometric bacterial cell counts challenge conventional heterotrophic plate counts for routine microbiological drinking water monitoring	WATER RESEARCH												Drinking water utilities and researchers continue to rely on the century-old heterotrophic plate counts (HPC) method for routine assessment of general microbiological water quality. Bacterial cell counting with flow cytometry (FCM) is one of a number of alternative methods that challenge this status quo and provide an opportunity for improved water quality monitoring. After more than a decade of application in drinking water research, FCM methodology is optimised and established for routine application, supported by a considerable amount of data from multiple full-scale studies. Bacterial cell concentrations obtained by FCM enable quantification of the entire bacterial community instead of the minute fraction of cultivable bacteria detected with HPC (typically < 1% of all bacteria). FCM measurements are reproducible with relative standard deviations below 3% and can be available within 15 min of samples arriving in the laboratory. High throughput sample processing and complete automation are feasible and FCM analysis is arguably less expensive than HPC when measuring more than 15 water samples per day, depending on the laboratory and selected staining procedure(s). Moreover, many studies have shown FCM total (TCC) and intact (ICC) cell concentrations to be reliable and robust process variables, responsive to changes in the bacterial abundance and relevant for characterising and monitoring drinking water treatment and distribution systems. The purpose of this critical review is to initiate a constructive discussion on whether FCM could replace HPC in routine water quality monitoring. We argue that FCM provides a faster, more descriptive and more representative quantification of bacterial abundance in drinking water. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Numerical modeling of simultaneous tracer release and piscicide treatment for invasive species control in the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, Chicago, Illinois	ENVIRONMENTAL FLUID MECHANICS												In December 2009, during a piscicide treatment targeting the invasive Asian carp in the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, Rhodamine WT dye was released to track and document the transport and dispersion of the piscicide. In this study, two modeling approaches are presented to reproduce the advection and dispersion of the dye tracer (and piscicide), a one-dimensional analytical solution and a three-dimensional numerical model. The two approaches were compared with field measurements of concentration and their applicability is discussed. Acoustic Doppler current profiler measurements were used to estimate the longitudinal dispersion coefficients at ten cross sections, which were taken as reference for calibrating the longitudinal dispersion coefficient in the one-dimensional analytical solution. While the analytical solution is fast, relatively simple, and can fairly accurately predict the core of the observed concentration time series at points downstream, it does not capture the tail of the breakthrough curves. These tails are well reproduced by the three-dimensional model, because it accounts for the effects of dead zones and a power plant which withdraws nearly 80 % of the water from the canal for cooling purposes before returning it back to the canal.

J	Schachtschneider, K; Chamier, J; Somerset, V				Schachtschneider, Klaudia; Chamier, Jessica; Somerset, Vernon			Phytostabilization of metals by indigenous riparian vegetation	WATER SA												Given the increasing pressure of man-made activities on riparian zones, the capacity of the riparian vegetation along the Upper Olifants River, South Africa, to phytoextract and phytostabilize aluminium (Al), manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe) from the soil was investigated. The aim of the study was to gain better understanding of the capacity of indigenous vegetation in riparian zones to immobilize metals in the soil, thereby improving river water quality and ecosystem services. Seven commonly-occurring pollution-tolerant riparian plant species were evaluated to establish their potential as bioaccumulators for Fe, Al and Mn. Species included: Cyperus haspan, Schoenoplectus corymbosus, Typha capensis, Phragmites australis, Cynodon dactylon, Cyperus marginatus and Juncus effusus, which were sampled in five riparian areas in the Upper Olifants catchment. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) for Mn was > 1 for all species investigated with a maximum of 5 for Typha capensis, which also showed the highest accumulation of Al (10.26) and Fe (7.03). The remaining species presented with Al and Fe BCF between 0.11 and 2.00, with minimal transfer from root to shoot. When measured against an ideal hypothetical buffer zone, the buffer zones under investigation varied between intact and severely compromised. Intact riparian zones showed elevated metal concentrations in the soil, yet significantly lower concentrations in the river water compared to areas with insufficient vegetative cover. A polluted riparian area overgrown by P. australis effectively phytoextracted 204 960 g/m(2) Al, 204 400 g/m(2) Fe and 27 887 g/m(2) Mn. The two indigenous Cyperus spp. were not ideal for metal immobilization with low bioaccumulation and transfer factors as well as low biomass. High biomass and Al, Fe and Mn phytostabilizing species: P. australis, T. capensis, S. corymbosus and J. effusus, should be considered in the rehabilitation of South African buffer areas.																	0378-4738	1816-7950				APR	2017	43	2					177	185		10.4314/wsa.v43i2.01								WOS:000408428800001						
J	Utete, B; Tsamba, J				Utete, Beaven; Tsamba, Joshua			Trophic state categorisation and assessment of water quality in Manjirenji Dam, Zimbabwe, a shallow reservoir with designated multi-purpose water uses	WATER SA												Intermittent, dire droughts and water abstraction pressures impact shallow man-made reservoirs with multiple designated water uses, often leading to water quality deterioration, and loss of biological integrity and utility value of a lake, threatening the livelihoods of lake shore communities. Thus, water quality information is crucial in setting up guidelines for freshwater resources management. In this study we investigated the water quality, determined the trophic state and assessed the influence of lake zones on the physical-chemical parameters of the Manjirenji Dam, Zimbabwe. Furthermore, we tested the applicability of two customary temperate water quality indices, the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment ( CCME) Water Quality Index and the Carlson Trophic State Index, for a tropical lake system. Ten littoral and seven pelagic sites were sampled monthly over 9 months for the following water parameters: pH, conductivity, turbidity, total dissolved solids, suspended solids, chlorophyll a, temperature, dissolved oxygen, water transparency, ammonia, nitrogen, nitrates, total and reactive phosphorus. Despite slight fluctuations/variations, water quality in the Manjirenji Dam was generally fair, with a CCME value averaging 78.1, and the Carlson Trophic State Index reflecting oligotrophy. Non-significant differences in water quality parameters between pelagic and littoral sites in the Manjirenji Dam reflect the high connectivity of different spatial zones in a shallow lentic system. Index scores of the adapted temperate water indices detect similar water quality conditions for the Manjirenji Dam, thus perhaps indicating their potential applicability. The current water quality data set for the Manjirenji Dam is vital for formulating prudent management strategies to formulate/ensure adequate multi-purpose water usage and service for this aquatic ecosystem.																	0378-4738	1816-7950				APR	2017	43	2					192	199		10.4314/wsa.v43i2.03								WOS:000408428800003

Tests were conducted to assess the sensitivity of the mussel Anodonta woodiana, installed on the Mosselmonitor, to seven contaminants and evaluate the usefulness of these sensors for detecting pollution events in the Po River (Italy). Mussels were exposed for 30 min to increasing concentrations of chromium (range 0.01-5 mg/L); arsenic (range 0.05-2.5 mg/L); sodium dodecyl sulphate SDS (range 0.25-50 mg/L); phenol (range 0.1-100 mg/L); oxadiazon (range 0.001-5 mg/L); trichloroethylene (range 0.01-100 mg/L); and crude oil (range 0.5-50 mg/L). Treatment with the highest concentration of SDS elicited two types of alarm response. In a second set of tests, the bivalves were exposed for 6 h to a selected concentration of each chemical. Only SDS led to a dramatic alteration of valve opening, resulting in alarms. This system would have limited applications for monitoring drinking water influent.

J	Fitchett, A				Fitchett, Anne			SuDS for managing surface water in Diepsloot informal settlement, Johannesburg, South Africa	WATER SA												Sustainable drainage systems (SuDS) imitate natural water management processes in catchments that have been degraded due to urbanisation. The aim is to reduce the quantity of stormwater runoff and improve water quality. Management of rainwater in the informal settlement of Diepsloot in Johannesburg is compounded by domestic wastewater discharged into the informal lanes. These lanes fall outside the mandate of the City of Johannesburg's stormwater management system; hence residents need to rely on their own initiatives to address surface-water problems. This preliminary study investigated the introduction of SuDS to enhance existing surface-water interventions, as a low-cost flexible approach. Using action research methods, small-scale interventions were designed, constructed and refined by residents and researchers at two sites close to the Jukskei River. While the primary intention of the research was to reduce standing water in the public areas, water quality testing indicates that the SuDS reduced some pollutants. Nitrate and phosphate concentrations were slightly lowered through the introduction of permeable channels and soakaways, while these interventions had a moderate effect on chemical oxygen demand. The involvement of residents at the two sites was markedly different, reflecting divergent priorities and social dynamics. Spontaneous continuation of the SuDS system at one of the sites indicates successful knowledge and skills exchange. This study was of limited duration with only two sets of water quality tests; therefore, longer term monitoring is strongly advised to be able to give more robust assessment of this type of intervention.

It values the improvement of water quality in Switzerland in terms of the reduction in environmental and public health risks that would result from implementing new wastewater treatment technologies that substantially reduce micropollutant discharges into water bodies.

This manuscript advocates the physicochemical, bacteriological characteristics and heavy metal pollution in the creek system. In the present investigation, the pH, salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO), bio-chemical oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (COD), chlorophyll, cyanide, oil and grease, total phosphate, phenol, Kjeldahl nitrogen and total organic carbon (TOC) values were recorded from 36 sampling sites during 6 field surveys conducted in 2011-2013. The creek water samples were also analyzed for their heavy metal contents (As, Cd, Cr, Pb, Ni and Zn). The bacteriological parameters included in the study were total coliform count (TCC), total fecal coliform count (TFC), and total fecal streptococci (TFS). These parameters were determined as per methods described in reference [ 12]. Salinity of water samples ranged between 15 and 32 parts per thousand while pH ranged from 7.2 to 7.6. High salinity values indicated the progression of seawater into the creek system. The mean DO was low with a range of 4.2-5.7 mg/L. Low DO concentration was due to high BOD5 (range 10-78 mg/L) while COD ranged from 320 to 1,334 mg/L. High BOD5 load is mainly due to organic pollution coming from nearby human settlements. The mean chlorophyll-a content was 0.114 mg/L. Interestingly, higher chlorophyll-a concentration was observed near the mangroves area. The mean cyanide concentration was high, though the source of cyanide could not be traced that needs further study. Oil and grease content of water was also substantial, mainly originated from faulty boats operated in the area. Excessive concentration of oil and grease could be deleterious to marine life forms. The concentration of phosphate ranged between 2.1 and 4.6 mg/L mainly attributed to the agriculture runoff. Phenol concentration was not high (0.01-0.08 mg/L) and, therefore, could not be responsible for adverse environmental implications. The mean concentrations of total Kjeldahl nitrogen and TOC were 59.27 and 4.97 mg/L, respectively. The concentrations of heavy metals in the samples were found to be in the order Zn > Ni > Pb > As > Cr > Cd. The bacterial load was exceptionally higher in all the samples in terms of organisms of public health importance that is mainly attributed to domestic wastewater originated from nearby squatter settlements. In essence, the present study disclosed that the creeks of Indus delta are likely to be polluted mainly because of anthropogenic sources. The continuous accumulation of pollutants in the creek area may have severe ecological and health implications.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				APR	2017	70						95	105		10.5004/dwt.2017.20466								WOS:000404544200009

Characterization of raw water resources in northern and central Taiwan	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												Water quality standards of raw water resources are getting more stringent in Taiwan. This is due to the higher number of potential contaminants released to the water bodies leading to the potential risks to the human health. Raw water resources, including one river and three reservoirs representative of the major raw water resources in northern and central Taiwan, at four locations were selected to measure turbidity, electrical conductivity (EC), oxidation and reduction potential (ORP), pH, alkalinity, total organic compounds (TOC), zeta potential, particle size, Al, Fe and heavy metal contents. Natural organic matter (NOM) was also examined using high-performance size-exclusion chromatography to distinguish the different molecular weight distribution of organic compounds, such as humic acids, that might affect the subsequent raw water treatment. TOC is highly related to NOM, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) and chemical oxygen demand, and the influent standard is 4 mg/L in Taiwan. EC, ORP, pH, alkalinity, TOC and zeta potential had values of 231.68-350.60 mu S/cm, 210.5-271.55 mV, 8.17-8.58, 65.65-86.25 mg/L, 1.54-2.73 mg/L and -16.58 to -22.60 mV, respectively. However, average turbidity (128.24 NTU) and average particle size at the Daiji River (5,067.56 nm) were higher than those at the Shimen, Yongheshan and Liyutan Reservoirs (2.20-6.39 NTU and 1,105.12-1,627.26 nm, respectively). These measured data and metal contents (the latest three years' data, at least two seasons including summer and autumn) met the regulatory standards in Taiwan. Water quality index (WQI) containing dissolved oxygen solubility, faecal coliforms, pH, BOD5, nitrates, total phosphates, temperature deviation, turbidity and total solids indicated good conditions for three reservoirs and medium condition for Daiji River. NOM, which might produce potential disinfectant by-products, had similar patterns and contained humic acids and low molecular weight acids (LMWs), with the intensity order of Yongheshan Reservoir > Shimen Reservoir > Liyutan Reservoir > Daiji River. The Carlson trophic state index and field-emission scanning electron microscope plot of filtered solid of raw water showed the potential risk of algae to drinking water safety.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				APR	2017	70						106	116		10.5004/dwt.2017.20488								WOS:000404544200010

Potassium permanganate (KMnO4) has been widely used to remove organic pollutants from wastewater. The oxidative degradation of 5-FU and Ara-C in aqueous solution by KMnO4 has not been reported. In this study, the oxidative degradation of 5-FU and Ara-C with KMnO4 in aqueous solution was investigated. 5-FU was oxidized rapidly by KMnO4 due to the olefinic group in the central heterocyclic ring. The degradation kinetics of 5-FU was well described by the equation of -d[5-FU]/dt = k(app)[5-FU](0.77)[KMnO4](0.86). The degradation kinetics of Ara-C followed a generalized second-order rate law. The apparent rate constant (kapp) of these two target compounds was strongly depended on the reaction temperature, pH, humic acid (HA) and water quality. The apparent activation energies (E-a) of 5-FU and Ara-C were 32 and 40 kJ.mol(-1), respectively, indicating that 5-FU was more easily decomposed by KMnO4 as compared with Ara-C. The maximum values of kapp for 5-FU and Ara-C were 1.73 x 10(-4) mu M-0.63.s(-1) at pH 7.4 and 1.52 M-1.s(-1) at pH 3.5, respectively. The oxidative degradation of 5-FU was inhibited by HA, while the oxidation of Ara-C was enhanced by HA. Reaction of both 5-FU and Ara-C was influenced by water quality. Thus, this study provides new insights into the degradation of antineoplastic drugs.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				APR	2017	70						339	346		10.5004/dwt.2017.20240								WOS:000404544200039

Factors controlling the ripening of manganese removal filters in conventional aeration-filtration groundwater treatment	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												Relatively long operational time is required to achieve effective manganese removal in conventional aeration-filtration groundwater treatment with virgin filter media. Ripening period depends on water quality, operational parameters, and the filter media used. This study assessed the role of filter media type, backwashing and iron loading on the time required to achieve very effective manganese removal. Filter runs were conducted with two set-ups each with six pilot filters with virgin sand or anthracite, and different types of manganese oxide coated sand/anthracite (MOCS/MOCA). Pre-treated groundwater (aeration-rapid sand filtration), either directly, or after an additional pre-treatment (ultrafiltration-UF), was used as feed water. UF pre-treatment eliminated head loss development in pilot filters and backwashing was consequently not required. Filters that received feed water without UF pre-treatment required backwashing after 14 d of continuous operation. Use of virgin sand and anthracite resulted in comparable ripening time (25 d and 14 d for feed water without and with UF pre-treatment, respectively). Use of fresh MOCS/MOCA directly taken from operational filters, eliminated the need for ripening of virgin filter media, while dried MOCS was less effective than fresh one, while the total period required to achieve highly effective manganese removal (>= 95%) was not shortened.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				APR	2017	72						22	29		10.5004/dwt.2017.0306								WOS:000404374300003

Therefore Kizilirmak river basin is under pressure from a diverse range of human activities. Six stations were sampled along the Kizilirmak river located in Nevsehir city during 2013-2014 seasonally. The physico-chemical parameters (water temperature, biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), conductivity, nitrite (NO3), ammonium (NH4), ammonia (NH3), phosphate (PO4), sulfate (SO4) and some metal concentrations (Zn, Cu, B, Cr, Ni, Pb, Hg, As, Se, Sb, Mn, Cd and Al) were measured in the water samples to determine the water quality of the Kizilirmak river. When the water quality classes were examined in terms of the measured physico-chemical parameters, it was detected that the river is IV. class for nitrite, III. class for BOD, phosphate and pH, II. class for NH4-N. The results showed that the heavy metal concentrations in water of the Kizilirmak river were within the quality class I. limits of the EPA and WPCR.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				APR	2017	72						328	334		10.5004/dwt.2017.20437								WOS:000404374300038						
J	Akomeah, E; Lindenschmidt, KE				Akomeah, Eric; Lindenschmidt, Karl-Erich			Seasonal Variation in Sediment Oxygen Demand in a Northern Chained River-Lake System	WATER												Sediment oxygen demand (SOD) contributes immensely to hypolimnetic oxygen depletion. SOD rates thus play a key role in aquatic ecosystems' health predictions. These rates, however, can be very expensive to sample. Moreover, determination of SOD rates by sediment diagenesis modeling may require very large datasets, or may not be easily adapted to complex aquatic systems. Water quality modeling for northern aquatic systems is emerging and little is known about the seasonal trends of SOD rates for complex aquatic systems. In this study, the seasonal trend of SOD rates for a northern chained river-lake system has been assessed through the calibration of a water quality model. Model calibration and validation showed good agreement with field measurements. Results of the study show that, in the riverine section, SOD20 rates decreased from 1.9 to 0.79 g/m(2)/day as urban effluent traveled along the river while a SOD20 rate of 2.2 g/m(2)/day was observed in the lakes. Seasonally, the SOD20 rates in summer were three times higher than those in winter for both river and lakes. The results of the study provide insights to the seasonal trend of SOD rates especially for northern rivers and lakes and can, thus, be useful for more complex water quality modeling studies in the region.

In this study, the Environmental Fluid Dynamic Code (EFDC) was applied in the Famosa Slough, a small tidal marsh system in urban San Diego County, California, to analyze multiple management scenarios focusing on different aspects of controlling processes: watershed load reduction, macroalgae harvesting, dredging, and the combination of different options. In order to evaluate these management scenarios, a previous EFDC model was enhanced through modifying the model code to allow simulations of both benthic and floating macroalgae as separate state variables, and configuring a sediment diagenesis model to predictively represent the dynamic interactions between the watershed load and benthic nutrient flux. The model was calibrated and verified by comparing model predictions with the observed data of hydrodynamic and water quality parameters throughout 2008. The calibrated model was then applied to simulate the water quality response to various management scenarios. The simulated results showed that combining watershed nutrient load reductions and harvesting floating macroalgae can produce significant water quality benefits. The results provide useful information for hydrological ecosystem protection and can be used for determining cost-effective implementation actions in the future.																	2073-4441					APR	2017	9	4							277	10.3390/w9040277								WOS:000404556400047

However, studies of water quality dynamics during flood events are not often reported in literature, probably due to difficult conditions for sampling during flood events. Water quality parameters in open water (canals, rivers, and lakes), flood water on roads and water in sewers have been monitored during the extreme fluvial flood event on 7 October 2013 in the city of Can Tho, Vietnam. This is the pioneering study of urban flood water pollution in real time in Vietnam. The results showed that water quality is very dynamic during flooding, especially at the beginning of the event. In addition, it was observed that the pathogen and contaminant levels in the flood water are almost as high as in sewers. The findings show that population exposed to flood water runs a health risk that is nearly equal to that of being in contact with sewer water. Therefore, the people of Can Tho not only face physical risk due to flooding, but are also exposed to health risks.

This study investigated and analyzed the characteristics of non-point source pollution in Baoding City. A simulation model for non-point source pollution was developed based on the Stormwater Management Model (SWMM), and, the process of non-point source pollution was simulated for Baoding City. The data was calibrated using data from two observed rainfall events (25.6 and 25.4 mm, the total rainfall on 31 July 2008 (07312008) was 25.6 mm, the total rainfall amount on 21 August 2008 (08212008) was 25.4 mm) and validated using data from an observed rainfall event (92.6 mm, the total rainfall on 08102008 was 92.6 mm) (Our monitoring data is limited by the lack of long-term monitoring, but it can meet the requests of model calibration and validation basically). In order to analyze the effects of non-point source pollution on Baiyangdian Lake, the characteristics and development trends of water pollution were determined using a one-dimensional water quality model for Baoding City. The results showed that the pollutant loads for Pb, Zn, TN (Total Nitrogen), and TP (Total Phosphorus) accounted for about 30% of the total amount of pollutant load. Finally, applicable control measures for non-point source pollution especially for Baoding were suggested, including urban rainwater and flood resources utilization and Best Management Practices (BMPs) for urban non-point source pollution control.																	2073-4441					APR	2017	9	4							249	10.3390/w9040249								WOS:000404556400019						
J	Logsdon, SD; Sauer, P				Logsdon, Sally D.; Sauer, Patricia			Improved or Unimproved Urban Areas Effect on Soil and Water Quality	WATER												Construction in urban areas usually results in compacted soil, which restricts plant growth and infiltration. Nutrients may be lost in storm runoff water and sediment. The purpose of this study was to determine if existing lawns benefit from aeration and surface compost additions without the negative impact of nutrient loss in runoff. Four sets of lawns were compared, with or without compost plus aeration, as a paired comparison. Surface bulk density was significantly reduced in the treated lawns (1.32 versus 1.42 Mg.m(-3)). Visual evaluation of soil structure showed improvement in the treated lawns. Of fifteen measurement dates over four years, four dates showed significantly higher surface soil water contents in the treated lawns compared with the untreated lawns. When compared over time, three of the four treated lawns had significantly higher soil water content than the untreated lawns. Nutrient concentrations in rainfall simulator runoff were not significantly different between treated and control lawns, which showed that compost did not negatively impact water quality. Compost and aeration helped restore soil quality for urban soils of recent construction.																	2073-4441					APR	2017	9	4							247	10.3390/w9040247								WOS:000404556400017

Manual boreholes are increasingly advocated as a safe and cost-effective substitute to mechanized drilling, as well as to traditional excavation methods. This research banks on the assumption that field and remote sensing data can be integrated within a geospatial database in order to map the viability of manual boreholes based on factors such as rock type, water table depth, landforms, or water quality. The approach presents three main novelties in relation to methodological precedents: (1) outcomes are not only expressed in terms of technical feasibility, but also as a function of drilling time and cost; (2) maps refer to a specific drilling technique; and (3) results take into account borehole diameter, as this constrains both drilling time and cost. The method provides univocal outcomes that can be immediately useful for non-experts, donors, planners, or practitioners and that can be readily exported to other catchment-scale settings. Results were validated against geophysical data.					martinez-santos, pedro/0000-0003-2014-4063												2073-4441					APR	2017	9	4							262	10.3390/w9040262								WOS:000404556400032

Samples were taken from hot and cold water supplies from guest rooms' faucets in 12 hotels in Hanoi city, Vietnam, and 13 hotels in Japan for comparison. A simple water quality measurement and determination of Legionella was carried out. The results showed that residual effective chlorine-which guarantees bactericidal properties-was not detected in tap water supplied in hotel rooms in Vietnam, and nitrite (an indicator of water pollution) was detected in 40% of buildings. In the hotels in Japan, the prescribed residual chlorine concentration met the prescribed levels, and nitrite was not detected. Additionally, while there was no Legionella detected in the Japanese cases, it was detected in most of the Vietnamese hotels, which were found to manage the hot water storage tank at low temperatures of 40-50 degrees C. It was found that there were deficiencies in cold and hot water supply quality, and that there was no effective system in place for building operation maintenance and management.																	2073-4441					APR	2017	9	4							251	10.3390/w9040251								WOS:000404556400021						
J	Wang, TX; Xu, SG; Liu, JW				Wang, Tianxiang; Xu, Shiguo; Liu, Jianwei			Dynamic Assessment of Comprehensive Water Quality Considering the Release of Sediment Pollution	WATER												Comprehensive assessment of water quality is an important technological measure for water environmental management and protection. Previous assessment methods tend to ignore the influences of sediment pollutant release and dynamic change of the water boundary. In view of this, this paper explores a new method for comprehensive water quality assessment. Laboratory simulation experiments are conducted to analyze the influences of sediment pollutant release on water quality, and the results are taken as increments, coupled with original samples, to constitute a new set of evaluation samples. Dynamic and comprehensive water quality assessment methods are created based on a principal component analysis (PCA)/analytic hierarchy process (AHP)-variable fuzzy pattern recognition (VFPR) model and adopted to evaluate water quality. A geographic information system (GIS) is applied to visually display the results of water quality assessment and the change of the water boundary. This study takes Biliuhe Reservoir as an engineering example. The results show the change process of the water boundary, during which the water level is reduced from 63.10 m to 54.15 m. The reservoir water quality is fine, of which the water quality level (GB3838-2002) is between level 2 and level 3, and closer to level 2 taking no account of sediment pollutant release. The water quality of Biliuhe Reservoir, overall, is worse in summer and better in winter during the monitoring period. Meanwhile, the water quality shows the tendency of being better from upstream to downstream, and the water quality in the surface layer is better than that in the bottom layer. However, water quality is much closer, or even inferior, to level 3 when considering the release of nitrogen and phosphorus in sediments, and up to 42.7% of the original assessment results of the samples undergo changes. It is concluded that the proposed method is comparatively reasonable as it avoids neglecting sediment pollutant release in the water quality assessment, and the presentation of the evaluation results and change of the water boundary is intuitive with the application of GIS.																	2073-4441					APR	2017	9	4							275	10.3390/w9040275								WOS:000404556400045						
J	Yuan, Q; Guerra, HB; Kim, Y				Yuan, Qingke; Guerra, Heidi B.; Kim, Youngchul			An Investigation of the Relationships between Rainfall Conditions and Pollutant Wash-Off from the Paved Road	WATER												Stormwater runoff monitoring was carried out from 2011 to 2015 to investigate the relationships between rainfall conditions (antecedent dry days (ADDs), rainfall intensity, depth and duration), and water quality parameters of stormwater from a paved road in Korea. Factor analysis suggested that the effect of rainfall conditions on the concentrations of selected pollutants varied depending on the pollutant. As total COD (total chemical oxygen demand) concentration increased, the level of heavy metals increased and resulted in a decrease of BOD5 (biochemical oxygen demand) because of their toxicity. In addition, ADDs had a significant impact on the wash-off of solids from paved road. The predominant particles in stormwater were 30 mu m and smaller, and increased in concentration as ADDs increased. Thus, the initial load of accumulated particles became a major factor in the wash-off process. The mass of particle-related pollutants was also subject to the effect of ADDs due to the affinity between pollutants and predominant particles (< 30 mu m). However, the effect of ADDs on the mass of organic matter and nitrogen was relatively weak. ADDs contributed to the decrease of some pollutants by photo-oxidation, volatilization and natural decay over dry days, as well as desorption from solids during rainfall.																	2073-4441					APR	2017	9	4							232	10.3390/w9040232								WOS:000404556400002

Characterization results show that both kinds of biopolymers are of similar molecular weight. Longer than one year water quality monitoring results show that the C/N ratio in the secondary effluent biopolymers was relatively constant at around 4.8, while that in the surface water macromolecules fluctuated at around 6.9. Under a similar mass load, the investigated secondary effluent biopolymers lead to hydraulic resistance slightly higher than that caused by filtering surface water macromolecules; however, the correspondingly formed fouling is significantly less reversible by hydraulic backwashing. The quantity of the nitrogenous biopolymers in the secondary effluent demonstrated a strong correlation with the extent of the irreversible fouling in ultrafiltration (UF), while that from the surface water did not. In membrane fouling cleaning tests, certain detergent demonstrated high efficiency in removing the irreversible fouling after UF of the secondary effluent, but presented no effect in eliminating fouling caused by the surface water foulants. In-line coagulation using FeCl3 prior to UF was shown as an effective fouling control method, but the effect depends heavily on the type of feed water.

Integrated approach for brackish water desalination and distribution: which desalination technology to choose?	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												In the southern part of Tunisia, brackish water is desalinated and blended with raw water to be delivered to the consumer. The desalination technique used is reverse osmosis (RO). However, it is an energy intensive process compared to other water treatment technologies such as nanofiltration (NF). The latter technique is capable of retaining polyvalent ions and could provide the same distributed water quality with much lower energy consumption. In this work, simulations were conducted in order to compare reverse osmosis and nanofiltration performances in brackish water desalination process within arid regions and to determine the best technique for desalting brackish water for lower energy and water consumptions. For a given distributed water quality, specific energy consumption could be reduced by 40% when nanofiltration is used instead of reverse osmosis. Water consumption when NF is applied is reduced as well. The distributed water quality is not significantly affected by applying NF instead of RO. Besides, these environmental aspects, scaling assessment favored NF as well.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				APR	2017	73						121	126		10.5004/dwt.2017.20861								WOS:000404376700013

Analysis of high efficiency membrane pilot testing for membrane design optimisation	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												The construction of the new seawater intake at reverse osmosis desalination plant located in Almeria (Spain) finished on May 2011. From this moment, the water catchment was located at 35 m depth instead of the 14 m depth of the former intake. The most significant outcome has been a new thermal scenario with lower maximum temperatures and more stable in time. Because of the lower maximum temperatures while the minimum temperatures remain the same, the pressure for water quality requirements accomplishment at high temperatures have decreased. Therefore new design and operation development opportunities have appeared. Taking into account that membrane replacement and retrofit projects are about to come at this desalination plant, and under this new thermal scenario, a pilot test has been developed. On the one hand, the purpose of this study was to compare the performance of the different membranes manufacturers and on the other hand, to determine the optimal membrane configuration and operation conditions able to achieve water quality and quantity needs under the new thermal intake conditions by the design of a pilot test. The best option has been determined taking into account investment versus operation (energy) costs.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				APR	2017	73						208	214		10.5004/dwt.2017.20573								WOS:000404376700022

Preferences for policy attributes and willingness to pay for water quality improvements under uncertainty	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												When exploring environmental policy options, sometimes neither the current state of the environmental good being analyzed nor the effectiveness of the proposed policy is known with certainty. This is the case with privately owned, residential, onsite wastewater treatment systems (septic systems)-there is ample evidence that they can contribute to water quality impairment, but their contribution is generally stochastic in nature and the efficacy of technological solutions is uncertain. Furthermore, the benefits of ameliorating water quality impairments are public in nature. Septic system owners are legally responsible for maintaining their systems, but requiring them to upgrade otherwise properly functioning tanks is outside the scope of water quality regulations. An incentive structure is necessary to induce private homeowners to invest in septic upgrades that deliver both private benefits in addition to the positive externality for the wider public and environment. The question for policy makers is how these private incentives should be financed, and whether public support can be garnered. Results of a choice experiment in Gwinnett County, Georgia, accounting for both sources of uncertainty-the current state of water quality and the efficacy of the intervention-in the design of water quality policy are presented. We find baseline water quality conditions and policy efficacy significantly affect public support for a policy transferring public funds to private homeowners, in terms of both sentiment and willingness to pay. The manner in which costs are shared across stakeholders also affects the selection of a policy option, but not willingness to pay for it.

If the IFDM crop were a biofuel crop, both environmental and private benefits may be generated; however, little is known about this possibility. As such, we develop a bioeconomic programming model of irrigated agricultural production to examine the role salt-tolerant biofuel crops might play within an IFDM system. Our results, generated by optimizing profits over land, water, and crop choice decisions subject to resource constraints, suggest that based on the private profits alone, biofuel crops can be a competitive alternative to the common practices of land retirement and nonbiofuel crop production under both low to high drainage water salinity. Yet IFDM biofuel crop production generates 30-35% fewer GHG emissions than the other strategies. The private market competitiveness coupled with the public good benefits may justify policy changes encouraging the growth of IFDM biofuel crops in arid agricultural areas globally.

Results showed that the performance of both models can 'satisfactorily' predict NO3-N concentration. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), ratio of the root mean squared error to the standard deviation (RSR), and percent bias (PBIAS) for DRAINMOD-N II were 0.87, 0.36, and -2%, respectively, in simulating NO3-N concentration; and 0.84, 0.39, and -9%, respectively, in simulating NO3-N loss. By contrast, NSE, RSR, and PBIAS for RZWQM2 were 0.76, 0.49, and -3%, respectively, in simulating NO3-N concentration; and 0.64, 0.6, and -16%, respectively, in simulating NO3-N loss. This study indicated that both models can be used to simulate NO3-N loss and concentration in drainage flow at different N application rates. However, DRAINMOD-N II demonstrated slightly better performance than RZWQM2. In terms of the maximum contaminant level, the threshold N rates predicted by RZWQM2 and DRAINMOD-N II did not differ significantly from those in observations and can be used for agricultural production. This study highlights the advantages of DRAINMOD-N II in assessing the effects of nitrogen management practices.

VERTICAL ELECTRICAL SOUNDING (VES) FOR SALINITY ASSESSMENT OF WATER-BEARING FORMATIONS	IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE												Electrical resistivity surveys (1-D) were carried out at selected sites in the region between the confluent rivers (Ravi and Jhelum) of Punjab, Pakistan, to audit tubewell placement and depth in order to minimize the amount of salt applied to the soil through irrigation. The Schlumberger electrode configuration was employed to collect the resistivity data and the resultant resistivity vs depth models for each site were estimated. From the interpretation of vertical electrical sounding (VES) data, the sites had one to three aquifer layers of different salinity levels and fitness for irrigation (FFI) classes ranging from good groundwater quality (FFI1) to highly saline up to 6.4 dS m(-1) (FFI3). Twenty-one tubewells were investigated and it was found that not only were most wells theoretically suboptimally placed (57%) with respect to the best water quality available but also 33% were sunk at too deep a level, bypassing aquifer layers of better water quality [FFI1]. From the cost-benefit analysis, it was estimated that a total of 64 000 Pakistan rupees could have been saved on five wells through installation costs due to suboptimal depths. It is concluded that VES is an effective method for the evaluation of existing wells and aquifer systems.

Identification and Quantification of Nitrogen in a Reservoir, Jiaodong Peninsula, China	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												Identification of nitrogen (N) sources is important in water quality control and management. Nitrogen pollution can lead to eutrophication of waterbodies and high concentrations of nitrate in drinking water can pose potential health problems. The N-15 isotope and nitrogen fluxes budget approach is useful for determining the source of NO3- to surface waters. In this study, mass balance and N-15 isotope approaches and nitrogen flux budgets were applied to identify total nitrogen (TN) sources and nitrogen transformation processes in the Menlou Reservoir (MR), Jiaodong Peninsula, China. The different fractions of nitrogen and their N-15 isotope signatures were analyzed in the reservoir water, river water, groundwater, soil, and atmospheric precipitation. The results indicate that surface runoff pollution (e.g., fertilizer and animal manure) is the main source of NO3- in MR. High concentrations of TN in MR are caused by low nitrogen self-purification (denitrification) rate, low sediment adsorption capacity, and the influx of NO3- rich groundwater.

However, previous studies have not systematically defined the baseline changes in the quantity and quality of the river water. In this study, we associate variations in flow quantity and quality of water with natural aspects. We analysed flow data from 1970 to 2010 for the river at the Turkish-Syrian border to assess the effect of upstream dam construction, correlating these data with precipitation variation in Syria in the same period. In addition, we compared flow data between Syria and Iraq in a period with no dam construction in those countries (2000 to 2010). Regarding water quality, we collected samples from the Turkish-Syrian and Syrian-Iraqi borders to identify levels of salinity through laboratorial analysis. We complemented the data analysis with fieldwork along the river basin, and with evidence from the literature. We conclude that the slight diminishing of flow as well as the increasing salinity towards downstream are both associated with natural aspects of the landscape, more than human actions.																	1366-7017					APR	2017	19	2					233	256		10.2166/wp.2017.077								WOS:000401815400003

Reduced Phytoplankton and Zooplankton Diversity Associated with Increased Cyanobacteria in Lake Champlain, USA	JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY WATER RESEARCH & EDUCATION												Anthropogenic inputs of nutrients threaten water quality around the world, causing eutrophication and altering phytoplankton communities. In freshwater systems, certain physiochemical conditions, including high TP, low TN:TP, and warm temperatures, can lead to problematic cyanobacteria blooms. Cyanobacteria can decrease phytoplankton diversity and phytoplankton diversity has been positively linked to zooplankton diversity, suggesting that cyanobacteria may have indirect negative effects on zooplankton diversity. Using monitoring data from Lake Champlain, we tested three hypotheses: (1) cyanobacteria density and phytoplankton diversity are inversely related; (2) phytoplankton diversity and zooplankton diversity are positively related; and by extension (3) cyanobacteria density and zooplankton diversity are inversely related. Relationships were investigated separately at shallow (4-15 m) and deep (25-100 m) sites using several diversity metrics. At deep sites, cyanobacteria density was only related (positively) to zooplankton Shannon diversity. At shallow sites, all three hypotheses were supported by three of four diversity metrics; low phytoplankton richness appears to be the link between high cyanobacteria density and low zooplankton diversity. Our results suggest that cyanobacteria may indirectly reduce zooplankton diversity by decreasing resource heterogeneity, although our results based on observational data were also consistent with well-known direct pathways. Because low biodiversity can alter ecosystem processes and impair functioning, our results suggest that shallow systems may be more responsive to global change than deeper systems.																	1936-704X					APR	2017	160	1					100	118		10.1111/j.1936-704X.2017.03243.x								WOS:000401529000008

Isotherms were generated at pH=4.7 and 7.6 and the results were best fitted by the Freundlich isotherm model; good As(V) adsorption capacity was achieved for the Fe3O4 adsorbent at both pH values. Furthermore, pH effects were evaluated; the optimal pH value for adsorption was 8.27 with the adsorption capacity and the removal efficiency being 18.55 mg/g and 93.69%, respectively. Based on the measurements of the zeta potential and particle size of the adsorbent, we proposed that the overall pH dependence was a result of the combined effects of the zeta potential, particle size of the adsorbent, and existing form of As(V). From kinetics studies, the As(V) adsorption by Fe3O4 adsorbent followed the pseudo-second-order model and could be described by a two stage mechanism. When initial As(V) concentration was 1 ppm, 73% of the As(V) was adsorbed within the first 2.5 minutes and an overall removal efficiency of 82.5% was achieved in 2 hours. Increased removal efficiency is expected at higher adsorbent loading, thus allowing the post-treatment water to meet drinking water quality standards.																	1936-704X					APR	2017	160	1					132	143		10.1111/j.1936-704X.2017.03245.x								WOS:000401529000010

The resulting eutrophication promotes phytoplankton blooms, in many cases of toxic cyanobacteria. Ecological models can simulate the main processes driving algal blooms. They help to understand how phytoplankton responds to different forcing. Another major use of models is as predictive tool supporting the management of water resources. Yuqiao Reservoir is the main drinking water source for Tianjin, the fifth most populated city in China. During the last decade, drinking water production has been impaired by recurrent cyanobacteria blooms. The water quality management of the reservoir, conducted by the Hai River Water Conservancy Commission, requires an early warning system in order to anticipate the cyanobacteria blooms and to adapt the treatment process. Therefore, within the framework of a French-Chinese project on Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) of the catchment of the Hai river, a modelling approach of cyanobacteria growth, which could be later embedded in an early warning system, was proposed. In this study, we calibrated a one-dimensional vertical, physical-ecological model aimed at forecasting cyanobacteria blooms in the Yuqiao Reservoir. We first introduce the study site and its ecological status. Then we describe the model and the input data set. The calibration and validation results are presented for water temperature and chlorophyll-a concentration at the measurement dates. The short-term forecast modelling is performed for temperature and cyanobacteria over a 5-day ahead period. Two weather scenarios are considered: one favourable for cyanobacteria and one disfavourable.

DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF A PHYSICALLY BASED MODEL OF STREAMBANK EROSION FOR COUPLING WITH A BASIN-SCALE HYDROLOGIC MODEL SWAT	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												A comprehensive streambank erosion model based on excess shear stress has been developed and incorporated in the hydrological model Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). It takes into account processes such as weathering, vegetative cover, and channel meanders to adjust critical and effective stresses while estimating bank erosion. The streambank erosion model was tested for performance in the Cedar Creek watershed in north-central Texas where streambank erosion rates are high. A Rapid Geomorphic field assessment (RAP-M) of the Cedar Creek watershed was done adopting techniques developed by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), and the stream segments were categorized into various severity classes. Based on the RAP-M field assessment, erosion pin sites were established at seven locations within the severely eroding streambanks of the watershed. A Monte Carlo simulation was carried out to assess the sensitivity of different parameters that control streambank erosion such as critical shear stress, erodibility, weathering depth, and weathering duration. The sensitive parameters were adjusted and the model was calibrated based on the bank erosion severity category identified by the RAP-M field assessment. The average observed erosion rates were in the range 25367 mm year(-1). The SWAT model was able to reasonably predict the bank erosion rates within the range of variability observed in the field (R-2 = 0.90; E = 0.78).

EFFECTS OF SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF PRAIRIE VEGETATION IN AN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE ON CURVE NUMBER VALUES	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												The curve number (CN) method is used to calculate runoff in many hydrologic models, including the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The CN method does not account for the spatial distribution of land cover types, an important factor controlling runoff patterns. The objective of this study was to empirically derive CN values that reflect the strategic placement of native prairie vegetation (NPV) within row crop agricultural landscapes. CNs were derived using precipitation and runoff data from a seven-year period for 14 small watersheds in Iowa. The watersheds were planted with varying amounts of NPV located in different watershed positions. The least squares and asymptotic least squares methods (LSM) were used to derive CNs using an initial abstraction coefficient (lambda) of 0.2 and 0.05. The CNs were verified using leave-one-out cross-validation and adjustment for antecedent moisture conditions (AMC) was tested. The asymptotic method produced CN values for watersheds with NPV treatment that were 8.9 and 14.7% lower than watersheds with 100% row crop at lambda = 0.2 and lambda = 0.05, respectively. The derived CNs produced Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency values ranging from 0.4 to 0.7 during validation. Our analyses show the CNs verified best for the asymptotic LSM, when using lambda of 0.05 and adjusting for AMC. Further, comparison of derived CNs against an area weighted CN indicated that the placement of vegetation does impact the CN value.

EFFECTS OF IMPERVIOUS AREA AND BMP IMPLEMENTATION AND DESIGN ON STORM RUNOFF AND WATER QUALITY IN EIGHT SMALL WATERSHEDS	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												The effects of increases in effective impervious area (EIA) and the implementation of water quality protection designed detention pond best management practices (BMPs) on storm runoff and stormwater quality were assessed in Gwinnett County, Georgia, for the period 2001-2008. Trends among eight small watersheds were compared, using a time trend study design. Significant trends were detected in three storm hydrologic metrics and in five water quality constituents that were adjusted for variability in storm characteristics and climate. Trends in EIA ranged from 0.10 to 1.35, and changes in EIA treated by BMPs ranged from 0.19 to 1.32; both expressed in units of percentage of drainage area per year. Trend relations indicated that for every 1% increase in watershed EIA, about 2.6, 1.1, and 1.5% increases in EIA treated by BMPs would be required to counteract the effects of EIA added to the watersheds on peak streamflow, stormwater yield, and storm streamflow runoff, respectively. Relations between trends in EIA, BMP implementation, and water quality were counterintuitive. This may be the result of (1) changes in constituent inputs in the watersheds, especially downstream of areas treated by BMPs; (2) BMPs may have increased the duration of stormflow that results in downstream channel erosion; and/or (3) spurious relationships between increases in EIA, BMP implementation, and constituent inputs with development rates.

Rainfall effects on inflow and infiltration in wastewater treatment systems in a coastal plain region	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Aging wastewater collection and treatment systems have not received as much attention as other forms of infrastructure, even though they are vital to public health, economic growth, and environmental quality. Inflow and infiltration (I&I) are among potentially widespread problems facing central sewage collection and treatment systems, posing risks of sanitary system overflows (SSOs),system degradation, and water quality impairment, but remain poorly quantified. Whole-system analyses of I& I were conducted by regression analyses of system flow responses to rainfall and temperature for 93 wastewater treatment plants in 23 counties in eastern North Carolina, USA, a coastal plain region with high water tables and generally higher rainfalls than the continental interior. Statistically significant flow responses to rainfall were found in 92% of these systems, with 2-year average I& I values exceeding 10% of rainless system flow in over 40% of them. The effects of rainfall, which can be intense in this coastal region, have region-wide implications for sewer system performance and environmental management. The positive association between rainfall and excessive I& I parallels the effects of storm water runoff on water quality, in that excessive I& I can also drive SSOs, thus confounding water quality protection efforts.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				APR	2017	75	8					1909	1921		10.2166/wst.2017.072								WOS:000400374700017	28452783					
J	Batabyal, AK				Batabyal, Asit Kumar			Hydrogeochemical processes and contaminants enrichment with special emphasis on fluoride in groundwater of Birbhum district, West Bengal, India	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The hydrogeochemistry of groundwater in rural parts of Birbhum district, West Bengal, India, has been studied to understand the contaminants and prime processes involved in their enrichment with a focus on F- concentration. The lithological units consist of Quaternary alluviums with underlying Rajmahal basaltic rocks of Middle Jurassic age. Groundwater occurs in the alluviums, weathered residuum and fracture zone of Rajmahal rocks. Studies show elevated concentration of Cl-, SiO2, Fe and F-; excess Cl- is attributed to anthropogenic inputs, SiO2 is ascribed to high degree of weathering of silica rich host rocks, and high Fe is due to the interaction of water with Fe-rich sediments under reducing condition. The F- concentration is found high (>1.20 mg/L) mainly in water from Rajmahal rocks revealing a lithological control on F- enrichment. The weathering of silicates and ion exchange are the leading controlling processes for major ions in groundwater. The F- enrichment is due to the dissolution of F--bearing minerals and perhaps also through anion exchange (OH- for F-) on clay minerals at high alkaline conditions; precipitation of CaCO3 favours CaF2 dissolution leading to elevated F- concentration. CaHCO3, the dominant water type, contains low F- while NaHCO3 and NaCl types exhibit high F- concentrations. Among the three spatial associations, Cluster-1 and Cluster-2 are CaHCO3 type; Cluster-3 shows NaHCO3 and NaCl waters with low Ca2+ and Mg2+ and high Na+ contents. Cluster-1 and Cluster-2 waters are, in general, drinkable barring the elevated Fe content, while Cluster-3 water is unsafe for drinking due to the high F- concentration.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				APR	2017	76	7							285	10.1007/s12665-017-6584-y								WOS:000399674700022

Serpentine geology links to water quality and heavy metals in sediments of a stream system in central Queensland, Australia	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Serpentinite soils, common throughout the world, are characterized by low calcium-to-magnesium ratios, low nutrient levels and elevated levels of heavy metals. Yet the water quality and heavy metal concentrations in sediments of streams draining serpentine geology have been little studied. The aim of this work was to collect baseline data on the water quality (for both wet and dry seasons) and metals in sediments at 11 sites on the Marlborough Creek system, which drains serpentine soils in coastal central Queensland, Australia. Water quality of the system was characterized by extremely hard waters (555-698 mg/L as CaCO3), high dissolved salts (684-1285 mg/L), pH (8.3-9.1) and dissolved oxygen (often >110% saturation). Cationic dominance was Mg > Na > Ca > K and for anions HCO3 > Cl > SO4. Al, Cu and Zn in stream waters were naturally high and exceeded Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council guidelines. Conductivity displayed the highest seasonal variability, decreasing significantly after wet season flows. There was little seasonal variation in pH, which often exceeded regional guidelines. Stream sediments were enriched with concentrations of Ni, Cr, Co and Zn up to 35, 21, 10 and 2 times the world average for shallow sediments, respectively. Concentrations for Ni and Cr were up to 60 and 16 times those of the relevant Interim Sediment Quality Guidelines Low Trigger Values, respectively. The distinctive nature of the water and sediment data suggests that it would be appropriate to establish more localized water quality and sediment guidelines for the creek system for the water quality parameters conductivity, Cu and Zn (and possibly Cr and Cd also), and for sediment concentrations of Cd, Cr and Ni.

Thermal groundwater contributions of arsenic and other trace elements to the middle Provo River, Utah, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Groundwater inputs can impact river water quality but are difficult to disentangle from agricultural, urban, and storm runoff. To better understand the multiple processes affecting water quality, we used major solute and trace element concentrations with continuous measurements of flow rates and specific conductance to track temporal and spatial changes in surface water and groundwater solute inputs into the middle Provo River, located in northern Utah, USA. Thermal groundwater was the most important source of major solutes and trace elements to the middle Provo River, with concentrations of As, B, Cs, Li, Sr, and Rb increasing dramatically (twofold to tenfold) downstream of thermal water inputs in the Snake Creek tributary. Snake Creek accounted for only 20% of the flow to the Provo River but increased the As concentrations similar to four-fold. Diffuse groundwater inputs, including thermal water, along the Provo River also contributed a measureable increase in solute concentrations. Mixing calculations indicate that groundwater contributed up to 10% of the total streamflow to the middle Provo River, causing an increase in thermal groundwater- derived trace element concentrations. In addition to natural groundwater inputs, water quality was impacted by anthropogenic trace and major element inputs from surface water tributaries. Nitrate, Ba, and V concentrations increased substantially downstream of agricultural/urban inputs. Specific conductance data showed that tributaries added solutes to the Provo River during runoff events, likely from the washoff of road salts. With evidence of both natural and anthropogenic inputs of trace and major elements to the middle Provo River, our study has implications for understanding water quality in complex coupled human-natural systems and demonstrates the influence of thermal groundwater inputs on water quality where such systems discharge.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				APR	2017	76	7							268	10.1007/s12665-017-6594-9								WOS:000399674700006

In order to prevent the expert judgments of the parameters weight that occurs when the Water Quality Index (WQI) method is used, the entropy method was used. Entropy and its weight were calculated, and parameters spatial autocorrelation was then determined. The spatial autocorrelation assessment confirmed the entropy theory results. The maximum spatial autocorrelation, minimum entropy and therefore the highest effectiveness rate on groundwater quality of Azarshahr Plain were found to be associated with bicarbonate. Using the entropy weighted WQI, the groundwater quality was classified into five categories: excellent, good, moderate, poor and extremely poor. According to the entropy weighted WQI, the groundwater quality of study area can be classified into "good'' to "poor'' domains.

Hierarchical approach to hydrological model calibration	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Hydrological models have been widely used for water resources management. Successful application of hydrological models depends on careful calibration and uncertainty analysis. Spatial unit of water balance calculations may differ widely in different models from grids to hydrological response units (HRU). The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) software uses HRU as the spatial unit. SWAT simulates hydrological processes at sub-basin level by deriving HRUs by thresholding areas of soil type, land use, and slope combinations. This may ignore some important areas, which may have great impact on hydrological processes in the watershed. In this study, a hierarchical HRU approach was developed in order to increase model performance and reduce computational complexity simultaneously. For hierarchical optimization, HRUs are first divided into two-HRU types and are optimized with respect to some relevant influence parameters. Then, each HRU is further divided into two. Each child HRU inherits the optimum parameter values of the parent HRU as its initial value. This approach decreases the total calibration time while obtaining a better result. The performance of the hierarchical methodology is demonstrated on two basins, namely Sarisu-Eylikler and Namazgah Dam Lake Basins in Turkey. In Sarisu-Eylikler, we obtained good results by a combination of curve number (CN2), soil hydraulic conductivity, and slope for generating HRUs, while in Namazgah use of only CN2 gave better results.

Uncontrolled flows from poorly constructed and uncapped artesian wells over the last 30 years have caused the deterioration of the quality of shallow groundwater and surface water. They also have been accelerating the discharge of saline water from deep aquifers and have caused the loss of shallow fresh groundwater resources through the downward percolation of fresh water to replace the extracted deep salty groundwater. A lack of adequate controls on the construction and maintenance of artesian wells is leading to widespread water quality problems in the region, which limits the ability of future generations to access high-quality water, a clear breach of the principle of intergenerational equity.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				APR	2017	76	7							291	10.1007/s12665-017-6610-0								WOS:000399674700028

Continuous Organic Characterization for Biological and Membrane Filter Performance Monitoring	JOURNAL AMERICAN WATER WORKS ASSOCIATION												Continuous organic characterization at a full-scale drinking water treatment plant was achieved using fluorescence spectroscopy. The feasibility of this method was demonstrated through monitoring the performance of biological activated carbon contactors (BACCs), which serve as pretreatment for fouling control of ultrafiltration (UF) membranes. Fluorescence monitoring was applied successfully to identify the preferential removal of select fluorescence components and addition of another microbial humic-like component by the biological filters. Spikes in BACC influent organic matter and fouling development on the downstream UF membranes highlighted the importance of preozonation. To demonstrate possible use of the short-term continuous fluorescence data, neural networks were used to predict fouling development on downstream UF on the basis of BACC effluent water quality. Short-term fluctuations in fouling development were well predicted by incorporation of continuous fluorescence characterization data. Continuous organic characterization shows promise for the application of fluorescence spectroscopy for real-time process optimization and control in drinking water treatment systems.																	2164-4535					APR	2017	109	4					E86	E98		10.5942/jawwa.2017.109.0031								WOS:000400052300003

Impact of Shrub Willow (Salix spp.) as a Potential Bioenergy Feedstock on Water Quality and Greenhouse Gas Emissions	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												The development of shrub willow as a bioenergy feedstock contributes to renewable energy portfolios in many countries with temperate climates and marginal croplands. As willow is developed commercially in the US Northeast, there is a need to better understand its impact on water quality and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to alternative land uses (e.g., corn, hay). We measured the impact of cultivated willow of various ages (2 and 5 years) and management strategies (fertilized vs. unfertilized) compared to corn and hay on water table depth, soil water NO3- and PO43- concentrations, and (NO)-O-2, CH4, and CO2 fluxes at the soil-atmosphere interface during a drier than normal year in heavy clay soils with marginal agricultural value in upstate New York, USA. Soil water concentrations resulted in higher PO43- in willow and higher NO3- in corn and hay, although willow is unlikely to negatively impact water quality with respect to phosphorus due to shorter periods of hydrologic connectivity in willow and hay than in corn. Gas fluxes varied spatially and temporally with hot moments of CH4 and N2O in corn and hay and seasonally variable CO2 in willow. While CH4 did not vary between fields, N2O was higher in corn and hay, and CO2 in willow, resulting in no net difference between CO2 equivalent (CH4, CO2, and N2O) emissions between fields. Converting marginal cropland on clay soils from corn or hay to willow left overall GHG emissions unaffected, slightly increased PO43-, and decreased NO3- concentrations in soil water.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				APR	2017	228	4							170	10.1007/s11270-017-3350-4								WOS:000399872600049

A Mechanistic Model for Secchi Disk Depth, Driven by Light Scattering Constituents	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												An optics theory-based mechanistic model for Secchi disk depth (Z(SD)) is advanced, tested, and applied for Cayuga Lake, NY. Robust data sets supported the initiative, including for (1) Z(SD), (2) multiple light attenuation metrics, most importantly the beam attenuation (c) and particulate scattering (b(p)) coefficients, and (3) measures of constituents responsible for contributions to b(p) by phytoplankton (b(o)) and minerogenic particles (b(m)). The model features two serially connected links. The first link supports predictions of b(p) from those for b(o) and b(m). The second link provides predictions of Z(SD) based on those for b(p), utilizing an earlier optical theory radiative transfer equation. Recent advancements in mechanistically strong estimates of b(m), empirical estimates of b(o), and more widely available bulk measurements of c and b(p) have enabled a transformation from a theory-based conceptual to this implementable Z(SD) model for lacustrine waters. The successfully tested model was applied to quantify the contributions of phytoplankton biomass, and minerogenic particle groups, such as terrigenous clay minerals and autochthonously produced calcite, to recent b(p) and Z(SD) levels and dynamics. Moreover, it has utility for integration as a submodel into larger water quality models to upgrade their predictive capabilities for Z(SD).

Water Use and Treatment in Container-Grown Specialty Crop Production: A Review	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												While governments and individuals strive to maintain the availability of high-quality water resources, many factors can "change the landscape" of water availability and quality, including drought, climate change, saltwater intrusion, aquifer depletion, population increases, and policy changes. Specialty crop producers, including nursery and greenhouse container operations, rely heavily on available high-quality water from surface and groundwater sources for crop production. Ideally, these growers should focus on increasing water application efficiency through proper construction and maintenance of irrigation systems, and timing of irrigation to minimize water and sediment runoff, which serve as the transport mechanism for agrichemical inputs and pathogens. Rainfall and irrigation runoff from specialty crop operations can contribute to impairment of groundwater and surface water resources both on-farm and into the surrounding environment. This review focuses on multiple facets of water use, reuse, and runoff in nursery and greenhouse production including current and future regulations, typical water contaminants in production runoff and available remediation technologies, and minimizing water loss and runoff (both on-site and off-site). Water filtration and treatment for the removal of sediment, pathogens, and agrichemicals are discussed, highlighting not only existing understanding but also knowledge gaps. Container-grown crop producers can either adopt research-based best management practices proactively to minimize the economic and environmental risk of limited access to high-quality water, be required to change by external factors such as regulations and fines, or adapt production practices over time as a result of changing climate conditions.

Sources and Persistence of Fecal Indicator Bacteria and Bacteroidales in Sand as Measured by Culture-Based and Culture-Independent Methods: a Case Study at Santa Monica Pier, California	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												This study investigated causes of persistent fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) in beach sand under the pier in Santa Monica, CA. FIB levels were up to 1000 times higher in sand underneath the pier than that collected from adjacent to the pier, with the highest concentrations under the pier in spring and fall. Escherichia coli (EC) and enterococci (ENT) under the pier were significantly positively correlated with moisture (rho = 0.61, p < 0.001, n = 59; rho = 0.43, p < 0.001, n = 59, respectively), and ENT levels measured by qPCR (qENT) were much higher than those measured by membrane filtration (cENT). Microcosm experiments tested the ability of EC, qENT, cENT, and general Bacteroidales (GenBac) to persist under in situ moisture conditions (10 and 0.1%). Decay rates of qENT, cENT, and GenBac were not significantly different from zero at either moisture level, while decay rates for EC were relatively rapid during the microcosm at 10% moisture (k = 0.7 days(-1)). Gull/pelican marker was detected at 8 of 12 sites and no human-associated markers (TaqHF183 and HumM2) were detected at any site during a 1-day site survey. Results from this study indicate that the high levels of FIB observed likely stem from environmental sources combined with high persistence of FIB under the pier.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				APR	2017	228	4							124	10.1007/s11270-017-3291-y								WOS:000399872600003

The maintenance of high quality of inland water status necessitates development of means for rapid quality monitoring. Imaging spectrometry techniques are proven technology that can provide useful information for the estimation of inland water quality attributes due to fast speed, noninvasiveness, ease of use, and in situ operation. Although there have been many studies conducted on the use of imaging spectrometry for marine water quality monitoring and assessment, relatively few studies have considered inland water bodies. The aim of this review is to present an overview of imaging spectrometry technologies for the monitoring of inland waters including spaceborne and airborne and field or ground-based hyperspectral systems.

Nutrient enrichment of water bodies has intensified eutrophication which degrades water quality and ecosystem health. In this study, we carried out a trend analysis of total phosphorus and total nitrogen loads in the South Saskatchewan River (SSR) catchment using a novel approach to analyse nutrient time series. Seasonal analysis of trends at each of the water quality stations was performed to determine the relationships between annual flow regimes and nutrient loads in the catchment, in particular, the influence of the high spring runoff on nutrient export. Decadal analysis was also performed to determine the long-term relationships of nutrients with anthropogenic changes in the catchment. Although it was found that seasonal and historical variability of nutrient load trends is mainly determined by streamflow regime changes, there is evidence that increases in nitrogen concentration can also be attributed to anthropogenic changes.

We chose the recently developed IWA RWQM1 principles to model in-stream conversion of water quality components due to its sound physical background. An engine (a simulator) based on the RWQM1 principles was integrated with three other engine componentshydrological (SWAT), hydraulic (SWMM) and stream water temperaturein the OpenMI interface. We applied the integrated model to the River Zenne, Belgium. The results indicate that the integrated model can simulate various water quality components with a wide range of accuracy, from Unsatisfactory to Very Good. However, we could not validate the model against each of the RWQM1 components as most of the components were not measured in traditional river monitoring programmes.

Effect of seasonal flushing on nutrient export characteristics of an urbanizing, remote, ungauged coastal catchment	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES												Urbanization is a primary driver of nutrient export in coastal catchments; however, estimating the rate of export from urbanizing, remote and ungauged communities with episodic rainfall characteristics has rarely been reported in tropical and subtropical areas. In this study, the coastal catchment of Roebuck Bay near Broome, northwestern Australia, was instrumented to elucidate the effect of seasonal flushing on nutrient export. A cost-effective framework involving temporary gauging and community participation led to a quantitative estimate of surface hydrology and nutrient dynamics from this urbanizing, remote and ungauged catchment. The contribution of nutrient export was larger from the older Broome town site sub-catchments compared to sub-catchments that have been progressively urbanized since 2000. A distinctive seasonal first flush phenomenon, with an initial 30% of runoff volume containing 40-70% of the nutrient load was a key feature. This indicates there are opportunities for storm-water management to minimize impacts through adopting water-sensitive urban design principles.

Stream-aquifer and in-stream processes affecting nitrogen along a major river and contributing tributary	JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY												This study assesses the spatio-temporal patterns of water and nutrient mass exchange in a stream-riparian system of a major river and a contributing tributary in an irrigated semi-arid region. Field monitoring is performed along reaches of the Arkansas River (4.7 km) and Timpas Creek (2.0 km) in southeastern Colorado during the 2014 growing season, with water quantity and water quality data collected using a network of in-stream sampling sites and groundwater monitoring wells. Mass balance approaches were used to identify temporal and spatial trends in flow, nitrogen (N), and salinity in stream-aquifer exchange. In the Arkansas River, percent decrease of N concentration along the study reach averaged 36% over the period, with results from a stochastic mass balance simulation indicating a 90% probability that 44% to 50% of NO3-N mass in the study reach (109-124 kg/day/km) was removed by in-stream processes between 1 September and 8 November. Results suggest that contact with organic-rich river bed sediments has a strong impact on N removal. A greater decrease in concentrations of NO3-N along the reach during the low flow period suggests the effect of both in-stream processes and dilution by inflowing groundwater that undergoes denitrification as it flows through the riparian and hyporheic zones into the river. In contrast, N concentration decreases in the smaller Timpas Creek were negligible. Results for the Arkansas River also are in contrast with other large agriculturally-influenced rivers, which have not exhibited capacity to remove N at significant rates. Results provide important insights across spatial and temporal scales and point to the need for investigating nutrient dynamics in large streams draining agriculturally-dominated watersheds.

Between nine and 15 of the 23 selected sites along the river were sampled fortnightly over three rounds. In all, 307 E. coli were typed using the PhP typing method and were grouped into common (C) or single (S) biochemical phenotypes (BPTs). A representative from each of the 31 identified C-BPTs was tested for 58 virulence genes (VGs) associated with intestinal and extra-intestinal E. coli, resistance to 22 antibiotics, production of biofilm and cytotoxicity to Vero cells. The number of E. coli in the first sampling round was significantly (P< 0.01) higher than subsequent rounds, whereas the number of VGs was significantly (P< 0.05) higher in isolates from the last sampling round when compared to previous rounds. Comparison of the C-BPTs with an existing database from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in the same catchment showed that 40.6% of the river isolates were identical to the WWTP isolates. The relatively high number of VGs and antibiotic resistance among the C-BPTs suggests possessing and retaining these genes may provide niche advantages for those naturalised and/or persistent E. coli populations which may pose a health risk to the community.																	1477-8920					APR	2017	15	2					196	208		10.2166/wh.2016.285								WOS:000399317700003	28362301

Rapid molecular identification of fecal origin-colonies growing on Enterococcus spp.-specific culture methods	JOURNAL OF WATER AND HEALTH												The mEI, Chromocult (R) enterococci, and m-Enterococcus culture-based methods used to assess water quality by the detection of Enterococcus spp. were first compared in terms of sensitivity using (1) 41 different type strains of Enterococcus spp. and (2) environmental colonies identified by 16S rRNA sequencing. Then, two specific-rtPCR assays targeting Enterococcus spp. and Enterococcus faecalis/faecium were tested for their ability to confirm the identity of putative enterococcal colonies. The mEI, Chromocult (R) enterococci, and m-Enterococcus methods detected beta-glucosidase activity for 28 (68.3%), 32 (78.0%), and 12 (29.3%) of the 41 reference enterococcal strains tested, respectively. Analysis with environmental colonies showed that mEI and Chromocult (R) enterococci media had false positive rates of 4.3% and 5.0%, respectively. Finally, the two rtPCR assays showed a specificity of 100%. Only two (2/19) colonies of E. faecium isolated from mEI agar were not detected by the Enterococcus faecium rtPCR assay, for a sensitivity of 89.5%. Our results showed that Chromocult (R) enterococci medium recovered more E. faecalis/faecium cells than the two other methods. Thus, the use of Chromocult (R) enterococci combined with the Enterococcus faecalis/faecium rtPCR assay showed the best combination to decrease the high false-positive rate obtained when the entire Enterococcus genus is targeted.																	1477-8920					APR	2017	15	2					239	250		10.2166/wh.2016.199								WOS:000399317700007	28362305

In order to study the hydrochemical characteristics and trace element contents of the natural waters of this region, 62 water samples were collected from Lan'gao area in the NDM. The hydrochemical composition was principally characterized by Ca center dot Mg-HCO3 center dot SO4. F and As concentrations ranged from 0.01 to 0.67 mg/L and from 0.33 to 6.29 mu g/L, respectively, lower than Chinese national standard and international guidelines for drinking water quality. One year of monitoring proved that F and As in natural water were not the sources of the local fluorosis and arseniasis in the NDM. The average Se concentration in fissure water was 5.20 mu g/L. The average Se content of river water was 2.82 mu g/L, 14 times that of the world's surface level (0.2 mu g/L). The Se content in eight samples reached the Chinese national standards for mineral drinking water quality (> 10 mu g/L). Contrasting the water samples of May, July, and September in 2015 shows that the Se content is relatively stable and the increase of humidity might be beneficial to increase the content of selenium and strontium in water.																	1477-8920					APR	2017	15	2					273	287		10.2166/wh.2016.132								WOS:000399317700010	28362308

Updating national standards for drinking-water: a Philippine experience	JOURNAL OF WATER AND HEALTH												The latest version of the Philippine National Standards for Drinking-Water (PNSDW) was issued in 2007 by the Department of Health (DOH). Due to several issues and concerns, the DOH decided to make an update which is relevant and necessary to meet the needs of the stakeholders. As an output, the water quality parameters are now categorized into mandatory, primary, and secondary. The ten mandatory parameters are core parameters which all water service providers nationwide are obligated to test. These include thermotolerant coliforms or Escherichia coli, arsenic, cadmium, lead, nitrate, color, turbidity, pH, total dissolved solids, and disinfectant residual. The 55 primary parameters are site-specific and can be adopted as enforceable parameters when developing new water sources or when the existing source is at high risk of contamination. The 11 secondary parameters include operational parameters and those that affect the esthetic quality of drinking-water. In addition, the updated PNSDW include new sections: (1) reporting and interpretation of results and corrective actions; (2) emergency drinking-water parameters; (3) proposed Sustainable Development Goal parameters; and (4) standards for other drinking-water sources. The lessons learned and insights gained from the updating of standards are likewise incorporated in this paper.																	1477-8920					APR	2017	15	2					288	295		10.2166/wh.2016.177								WOS:000399317700011	28362309

The current paper examines the feasibility of using an alternative approach in which observed streamflow time series are disaggregated into baseflow, point source, and nonpoint source time series, which are then used as forcing functions to generate point and nonpoint source pollution load predictions. The potential utility of the approach is examined by comparing the results of four different watershed simulations against results obtained from the traditional approach using an Loading Simulation Program C (LSPC) model with standard statistical tests for both calibration and validation analyses.

Solute transport characterization in karst aquifers by tracer injection tests for a sustainable water resource management	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Protection of water resources is a major challenge today, given that territory occupation and land use are continuously increasing. In the case of karst aquifers, its dynamic complexity requires the use of specific methodologies that allow establishing local and regional flow and transport patterns. This information is particularly necessary when springs and wells harnessed for water supply are concerned. In view of the present state of the art, this work shows a new approach based on the use of a LiCl based tracer injection test through a borehole for transport characterization from a local to a regional scale. Thus a long term tracer injection test was conducted in a particularly sensitive sector of the Egino karst massif (Basque Country, Spain). The initial displacement of tracer in the vicinity of the injection was monitored in a second borehole at a radial distance of 10.24 m. This first information, assessed by a radial divergent model, allows obtaining transport characteristic parameters in this immediate vicinity during injection. At a larger (regional) scale, the tracer reaches a highly transmissive network with mean traveling velocities to the main springs being from 4.3 to 13.7 m/h. The responses obtained, particularly clear in the main spring used for water supply, and the persistence of part of the tracer in the injection zone, pose reconsidering the need for their protection. Thus, although the test allows establishing the 24-h isochrone, which is the ceiling value in present European vulnerability approaches, the results obtained" advise widening the zone to protect in order to guarantee water quality in the springs. Overall, this stimulus-response test allows furthering the knowledge on the dynamics of solute transport in karst aquifers and is a particularly useful tool in studies related to source vulnerability and protection in such a complex medium.

Improving riverine constituent concentration and flux estimation by accounting for antecedent discharge conditions	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Regression-based approaches are often employed to estimate riverine constituent concentrations and fluxes based on typically sparse concentration observations. One such approach is the recently developed WRTDS ("Weighted Regressions on Time, Discharge, and Season") method, which has been shown to provide more accurate estimates than prior approaches in a wide range of applications. Centered on WRTDS, this work was aimed at developing improved models for constituent concentration and flux estimation by accounting for antecedent discharge conditions. Twelve modified models were developed and tested, each of which contains one additional flow variable to represent antecedent conditions and which can be directly derived from the daily discharge record. High-resolution (daily) data at nine diverse monitoring sites were used to evaluate the relative merits of the models for estimation of six constituents chloride (Cl), nitrate-plus-nitrite (NOx), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), total phosphorus (TP), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), and suspended sediment (SS). For each site-constituent combination, 30 concentration subsets were generated from the original data through Monte Carlo subsampling and then used to evaluate model performance. For the subsampling, three sampling strategies were adopted: (A) 1 random sample each month (12/year), (B) 12 random monthly samples plus additional 8 random samples per year (20/year), and (C) flow-stratified sampling with 12 regular (non-storm) and 8 storm samples per year (20/year). Results reveal that estimation performance varies with both model choice and sampling strategy. In terms of model choice, the modified models show general improvement over the original model under all three sampling strategies. Major improvements were achieved for NO. by the long-term flow -anomaly model and for Cl by the ADF (average discounted flow) model and the short-term flow -anomaly model. Moderate improvements were achieved for SS, TP, and TKN by the ADF model. By contrast, no such achievement was achieved for SRP by any proposed model. In terms of sampling strategy, performance of all models (including the original) was generally best using strategy C and worst using strategy A, and especially so for SS, TP, and SRP, confirming the value of routinely collecting stormflow samples. Overall, this work provides a comprehensive set of statistical evidence for supporting the incorporation of antecedent discharge conditions into the WRTDS model for estimation of constituent concentration and flux, thereby combining the advantages of two recent developments in water quality modeling.

J	De Caro, M; Crosta, GB; Frattini, P				De Caro, Mattia; Crosta, Giovanni B.; Frattini, Paolo			Hydrogeochemical characterization and Natural Background Levels in urbanized areas: Milan Metropolitan area (Northern Italy)	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Although aquifers in densely populated and industrialized areas are extremely valuable and sensitive to contamination, an estimate of the groundwater quality status relative to baseline conditions is lacking for many of them. This paper provides a hydrogeochemical characterization of the groundwater in the Milan metropolitan area, one of the most densely populated areas in Europe. First, a conceptual model of the study area based on the analysis of the spatial distribution of natural chemical species and indicator contaminants is presented. The hydrochemical facies of the study area depend on the lithology of catchments drained by the main contributing rivers and on the aquifer settings. The anthropogenic influence on the groundwater quality of superficial aquifers is studied by means of probability plots, concentration versus depth plots and spatial-temporal plots for nitrate, sulfate and chloride. These allow differentiation of contaminated superficial aquifers from deep confined aquifers with baseline water quality. Natural Background Levels (NBL) of selected species (Cl, Na, NH4, SO4, NO3, As, Fe, Mn and Zn) are estimated by means of the pre-selection (PS) and the component separation (CS) statistical approaches. The NBLs depend on hydrogeological settings of the study area; sodium, chloride, sulfate and zinc NBL values never exceed the environmental water quality standards. NBL values of ammonium, iron, arsenic and manganese exceed the environmental water quality standards in the anaerobic portion of the aquifers. On the basis of observations, a set of criteria and precautions are suggested for adoption with both PS and CS methods in the aquifer characterization of highly urbanized areas.

J	Kovacs, K; West, G; Xu, Y				Kovacs, Kent; West, Grant; Xu, Ying			The use of efficiency frontiers to evaluate the optimal land cover and irrigation practices for economic returns and ecosystem services	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Efficiency frontiers are a useful tool for governmental agencies that balance the protection of ecosystem services with the economic returns from an agricultural landscape because the tool illustrates that a compromise of objectives generates greater value to society than optimizing a sole objective. Policy makers facing the problem of groundwater overdraft on an agricultural landscape want to know if regulations or irrigation technology adoption will enhance both economic and ecosystem service benefits. Conjunctive water management with on-farm reservoirs and tail water recovery system is frequently suggested to alleviate groundwater and surface water quality problems in the Lower Mississippi River Basin of the United States, and this study evaluates the consequence of the adoption of this technology for the balance of ecosystem service and economic objectives. A compromise of objectives that maximizes the value to society provides 76% more value to society without reservoirs and 66% more value to society with reservoirs than the sole objective of economic returns. The reservoirs help an agricultural landscape maximizing economic returns to align more closely with a landscape maximizing the value to society, although there are still significant gains possible from finding a landscape that directly compromises on the objectives.

J	Hagemann, M; Park, MH				Hagemann, Mark; Park, Mi-Hyun			Capacity of semi-parametric regression models to predict extreme-event water quality in the Northeastern US	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												This study assessed the capacity of semi-parametric regression models to predict riverine solute concentrations during extreme high-flow hydrologic events, when such events are absent from the models' calibration data. Using a large dataset from 459 monitoring stations across the US Northeast, the models showed a tendency to overpredict extreme-event concentrations, with increasing bias and variance for increasingly extreme hydrologic conditions. The validation framework in this study effectively compared model performance across disparate hydrologic regimes and constituents, yet can be used to estimate individual model performance under an unobserved extreme-flow condition, regardless of whether any extreme-flow data are available for that model. The validation procedure can further be generalized to explore model performance in an arbitrarily defined extreme condition for a broad range of model types. Despite an overall increase in uncertainty for extreme-event concentration estimates, estimates under extreme hydrologic conditions could be improved by taking into account the observed bias in the aggregated regional database.

Sediment transport in steep forested catchments - An assessment of scale and disturbance	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Stream sediment loads (both bedload and suspended sediment) are problematic to measure due to the time and equipment needed. There is a dearth of such data sets globally let alone for Australia. However, such data are needed to quantify sediment transport type and rates, landscape evolution, effect of human disturbance as well as patterns and temporal response. Here we present the findings from 8 steepslope forested catchments dominated by headwater streams (size range 15-100 ha) in southeastern Australia where both bedload and suspended load have been measured over multiple years. The results demonstrate that suspended load is the dominant component and there is no consistent suspended to bedload ratio for the catchments. The suspended sediment to bedload ratio appears to be catchment specific. There was no relationship between total load (or bedload/suspended load) and average catchment slope, stream length, shape or any geomorphic descriptor. However catchment total load was found to be significantly related to catchment area. Of the 8 catchments examined here, 6 had been harvested for timber in previous decades (with large areas of forest removed) while 2 catchments had minimal disturbance (Control catchments). There was no difference in sediment loads from the harvested and Control catchments. The results demonstrate that although land disturbance had previously occurred the management practices employed in each catchment were effective in the long term. This provides confidence that the forest harvesting and subsequent management do not produce detrimental effects in the medium to long term. An assessment of erosion rates and likely soil production rates suggests that the catchments are eroding soil at the rate it is being produced.

The efficient and optimal decision-making on loading reduction is generally based on water quality modeling and the quantitative identification of nutrient sources at the watershed scale. The modeling process is influenced inevitably by inherent uncertainties, especially by uncertain parameters due to equifinality. Therefore, the emerging question is: if there is parameter uncertainty, how to ensure the robustness of the optimal decisions? Based on simulation-optimization models, an integrated approach of pattern identification and analysis of robustness was proposed in this study that focuses on the impact of parameter uncertainty in water quality modeling. Here the pattern represents the discernable regularity of solutions for load reduction under multiple parameter sets. Pattern identification is achieved by using a hybrid clustering analysis (i.e., Ward-Hierarchical and K-means), which was flexible and efficient in analyzing Lake Bali near the Yangtze River in China. The results demonstrated that urban domestic nutrient load is the most potential source that should be reduced, and there are two patterns for Total Nitrogen (TN) reduction and three patterns for Total Phosphorus (TP) reduction. The patterns indicated different total reduction of nutrient loads, which reflect diverse decision preferences. The robust solution was identified by the highest accomplishment with the water quality at monitoring stations that were improved uniformly with this solution. We conducted a process analysis of robust decision-making that was based on pattern identification and uncertainty, which provides effective support for decision making with preference under uncertainty.

A GIS-based tool for integrated management of clogging risk and nitrogen fertilization in drip irrigation	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Precipitation of insoluble compounds poses a relevant concern in the management of drip irrigation. This risk is controlled by acidification of irrigation water. The main objective of this work was the development of a GIS-based tool to control drip clogging risk in drip irrigation by nitric acid injection in irrigation water. The study was performed in the province of Jaen (south Spain) focused on the irrigation of olive orchards. The GIS-based model was developed incorporating climate and water data in order to identify zones with different risks of drip clogging which require different rates of acid injection in the irrigation water. Volume of nitric acid injected increased with irrigation frequency and acid injection time. The model provided information on the total amount of N supplied with acidulated irrigation water; e.g. with 30 min injection time in daily irrigations, more than 10 kg N ha(-1) were applied in 47% of land potentially irrigated with surface water, meanwhile this percentage was around 60% of that potentially irrigated with underground water. This means that N supply with acid injections to reduce clogging risk may account for a relevant portion of N fertilization requirements in olive orchards. Consequently, this supply should be integrated in fertilization programs to avoid agronomic and environmental constraints. The GIS-based tool proposed was able to provide complementary technical solutions to the clogging problem in drip irrigation. For each alternative released, a precise estimation of N supply to be considered in accurate N fertilizer management was provided. The tool also supplied graphical visualization of information and functionality of handling geographic data with an easy update. All this is necessary in planning and decision making at regional scale with changing properties in irrigation water. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, incorrect management of manure may cause environmental problems due to sediments and nutrients losses associated to runoff. The aims of this work were to: (i) evaluate the time effect of post-liquid dairy manure (LDM) application on runoff, sediment and nutrient losses; (ii) compare the effect of conventional tillage and no-till systems on runoff, sediment and nutrients losses after LDM application. A rainfall simulation experiment was conducted on intact soil blocks collected from fields that had been under conventional tillage and no-till systems. Rainfall was applied 24 h or 7 days after LDM application. Conventional tillage without manure application resulted on higher runoff, sediment and nutrient losses (mainly the particulate fraction) than no-till without manure. The greatest runoff, sediment and nutrients losses occurred in the treatments where simulated rainfall was performed 24 h after LDM application independent of the tillage system. An interval of 7 days between manure application and the rainfall event reduced sediment, particulate P, and particulate N losses in both conventional and no-till systems. In practical terms, we would recommend a minimum of 7 days between LDM application and rainfall-runoff event to provide agronomic benefits minimizing the potential risk of water pollution.

Winter rye as a cover crop reduces nitrate loss to subsurface drainage as simulated by HERMES	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												HERMES is a widely used agricultural system model; however, it has never been tested for simulating N loss to subsurface drainage. Here, we integrated a simple drain flbw component into HERMES. We then compared the predictions to four years of data (2002-2005) from central Iowa fields in corn-oybean with winter rye as a cover crop (CC) and without winter rye (NCC). We also compared the HERMES predictions to the more complex Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) predictions for the same dataset. The average annual observed and simulated N loss to drain flow were 43.8 and 44.4 kg N/ha (NCC) and 17.6 and 18.9 kg N/ha (CC). The slightly over predicted N loss for CC was because of over predicted nitrate concentration, which may be partly caused by slightly under predicted average annual rye shoot N (observed and simulated values were 47.8 and 46.0 kg N/ha). Also, recent research from the site suggests that the soil field capacity may be greater in CC while we used the same soil parameters for both treatments. A local sensitivity analysis suggests that increased field capacity affects HERMES simulations, which includes reduced drain flow nitrate concentrations, increased denitrification, and reduced drain flow volume. HERMES-simulated cumulative monthly drain flow and annual drain flow were reasonable compared to field data and HERMES performance was comparable to other published drainage model tests. Unlike the RZWQM simulations, however, the modified HERMES did riot accurately simulate the year to year variability in nitrate concentration difference between NCC and CC, possibly due in part to the lack of partial mixing and displacement of the soil solution. The results suggest that 1) the relatively simple model HERMES is a promising tool to estimate annual N loss to drain flow under corn-soybean rotations with winter rye as a cover crop and 2) soil field capacity is a critical parameter to investigate to more thoroughly understand and appropriately model denitrification and N losses to subsurface drainage.

In the Gulf of Aqaba (GoA), coral reefs are considered the dominating ecosystem, while seagrass meadows, recognized worldwide as important ecosystems, have received little attention. Absence of comprehensive seagrass maps limits awareness, evaluations of associated ecosystem services, and implementation of conservation and management tools. 2. Presented here are the first detailed maps of seagrass meadows along the Israeli coast of the northern GoA. Mapping was performed by snorkelling along transects perpendicular to the shore above meadows growing at 15-25 m. Measurements along these transects included position, meadow depth and visual estimations of seagrass cover. Shallow boundaries of meadows, parallel to shore, were recorded by GPS tracking. Supplementary work included drop-camera boat surveys to determine the position of the deeper edge of meadows. In addition, GIS layers were created that indicated shoreline infrastructures, near-shore human activities and potential pollution threats. Ecosystem services of seagrass meadows mapped were valuated using a benefit transfer approach. 3. In total, 9.7 km of the 11 km shoreline were surveyed and 2830 data points collected. Seagrasses were growing along 7.5 km of the shoreline, with shallow (15-25 m) meadows found to cover an area of 707 000 m(2) and valued at more than US$ 2 000 000 yr(-1) in associated ecosystem services. Pilot drop-camera surveys (additional 283 data points) indicated that meadows can extend down to 50 m in some places. Coastal uses and threats varied in character and location. A municipality runoff point and drainage canal located close to the largest meadow were identified as the main threats to local seagrasses. 4. These low-cost methods enhance our understanding of seagrass distribution in the northern GoA. They demonstrate a GIS-based tool for assessing how environmental changes might affect the cover and state of seagrasses, improving efforts to conserve seagrass, and have particular relevance to seagrass mapping in developing countries and/or island nations.

Combining ex situ and in situ methods to improve water quality testing for the conservation of aquatic species	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												1. Determining whether water quality is suitable is an important part of managing aquatic species for conservation, although it is often challenging to achieve. Past approaches have largely consisted of tests exposing individuals to artificial solutions, or field studies that examine the effect of a subset of water quality parameters on the distribution or abundance of a species. 2. Owing to the complex nature of water chemistry in natural systems, which is difficult to replicate using laboratory studies or to capture entirely with correlational field studies, these types of study may not be suitable for determining accurately whether or not water quality at a particular site is suitable for a target species. In situations where conservation outcomes rely heavily on achieving this, an alternative approach is therefore needed. 3. Embryos of the threatened green and golden bell frog Litoria aurea were placed in water collected from ponds that were used by this species for breeding and ponds where breeding was not detected at Sydney Olympic Park, Australia. After 19 days, the tadpoles were placed in enclosures in the same breeding and non- breeding ponds, and monitored until they metamorphosed. 4. There was no difference in tadpole survival, time to metamorphosis or body condition between the two treatments, indicating that poor water quality was not a cause of low pond occupancy by tadpoles at the site and resources should be directed towards investigating other potential causes. 5. We suggest that this method of an ex situ followed by an in situ exposure study is an effective approach to eliminating or confirming poor water quality as a cause of population declines and reduced occupancy, for species that are aquatic for at least part of their life cycle. Other applications include establishing that artificially created habitat provides suitable water chemistry, or identifying a potential location for a reintroduction project.

Ehsan; Berglund, Emily Zechman			Complex Adaptive Systems Framework to Simulate the Performance of Hydrant Flushing Rules and Broadcasts during a Water Distribution System Contamination Event	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT												In the event that a contaminant is introduced to a water distribution system, utility managers must respond quickly to protect public health. Mitigation strategies specify response actions, such as warning consumers to reduce water activities using the news media and flushing contaminated water at hydrants. The performance of alternative response actions may be influenced by sociotechnical dynamics, as consumer reactions to contaminant exposure and information about the event can change water demands, hydraulics, propagation of a contaminant plume, and public health consequences. This research develops a modeling framework to test and evaluate mitigation decisions that a utility manager may take to protect public health over a wide range of contamination events. An agent-based modeling framework is developed to integrate social behaviors with technical artifacts in a sociotechnical model to evaluate the public health consequences of a water event. Social actors, including consumers and utility managers, are represented as agents and are coupled with a water distribution network model and a news media model to evaluate the performance of response strategies. Strategies for flushing hydrants are encoded as decision trees that specify the location and timing of hydrant flushing, based on the activation of water-quality sensors. The agent-based model is described using the Overview, Design, and Details protocol and is demonstrated for a virtual midsized municipality, Mesopolis. Results compare the effectiveness of flushing hydrants using cautious and adaptive response strategies and the use of the news media to disseminate warning messages. The framework can be applied for cities to evaluate alternative management strategies.

J	Julian, P				Julian, Paul, II			Assessment of Upper Taylor Slough water quality and implications for ecosystem management in Everglades National Park	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												This study addresses water quality conditions across several distinct hydrologic regimes in the Upper Taylor Slough (UTS) region of Everglades National Park and briefly considers implications for long-term water quality management. Due to upstream changes in water delivery and construction of a detention area, Taylor Slough has experienced a significant change in hydrology over a 27-year period, progressing from direct discharge at varying amounts to sheet flow via groundwater conditions. Cumulative flow and rainfall relationships at the inflow and outflow of UTS demonstrate distinct break points. These changes in water delivery and subsequent upstream water management have resulted in a change in water quality conditions within the UTS region. Since 1986, total phosphorus (TP) flow-weighted mean concentrations exiting UTS have significantly decreased from 10 mu g/L in the late 1980s to 4 mu g/L or less since 2010. Based on analysis of surface water ion ratios, saltwater intrusion is unlikely and rather hyporheic exchange could be occurring between the inflow and outflow of the UTS region. Based on the analysis of existing water quality data, the UTS region is a resilient oligotrophic wetland system retaining strong assimilation capacity in the face of major management changes. While TP concentrations remain extremely low, restoration is not complete for Taylor Slough and adjacent coastal basins will inevitably bring additional nutrient loading. Management of the Slough should recognize this and consider what water quality condition is best for long-term sustainability of Taylor Slough's ecology.																	0923-4861	1572-9834				APR	2017	25	2					191	209		10.1007/s11273-016-9509-8								WOS:000398185800005						
J	Yang, YY; Toor, GS				Yang, Yun-Ya; Toor, Gurpal S.			Sources and mechanisms of nitrate and orthophosphate transport in urban stormwater runoff from residential catchments	WATER RESEARCH												Nutrients export from residential catchments contributes to water quality impairment in urban water bodies. We investigated the concentrations, transport mechanisms, and sources of nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) and orthophosphate-phosphorus (PO4-P) in urban stormwater runoff generated in residential catchments in Tampa Bay, Florida, United States. Street runoff samples, collected over 21 storm events, were supplemented with rainfall and roof runoff samples from six representative residential catchments. Samples were analyzed for N and P forms, N and oxygen (O) isotopes of nitrate (delta O-18-NO3- and delta N-15 -NO3-), and delta O-18 and hydrogen (delta D) isotopes of water (H2O). We found that the main NO3-N source in street runoff was atmospheric deposition (range: 35-64%), followed by chemical N fertilizers (range: 1 -39%), and soil and organic N (range: 7-33%), whereas PO4-P in the street runoff likely originated from erosion of soil particles and mineralization from organic materials (leaves, grass clippings). The variability in the sources and concentrations of NO3-N and PO4-P across catchments is attributed to different development designs and patterns, use of various fill materials during land development, and landscaping practices. This data can be useful to develop strategies to offset the impacts of urban development (e.g., designs and patterns resulting in variable impervious areas) and management (e.g., fertilizer use, landscaping practices) on NO3-N and PO4-P transport in urban residential catchments.

THM and HAA formation from NOM in raw and treated surface waters	WATER RESEARCH												The disinfection by-product (DBP) formation potential (FP) of natural organic matter (NOM) in surface water sources has been studied with reference to the key water quality determinants (WQPs) of UV absorption (UV254), colour, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration. The data set used encompassed raw and treated water sampled over a 30-month period from 30 water treatment works (WTWs) across Scotland, all employing conventional clarification. Both trihalomethane (THM) and haloacetic acid (HM) FPs were considered. In addition to the standard bulk WQDs, the DOC content was fractionated and analysed for the hydrophobic (HPO) and hydrophilic (HPI) fractions. Results were quantified in terms of the yield (dDBPFP/dWQD) and the linear regression coefficient R-2 of the yield trend. The NOM in the raw waters was found to comprise 30-84% (average 66%) of the more reactive HPO material, with this proportion falling to 18-63% (average 50%) in the treated water. Results suggested UV254 to be as good an indicator of DBPFP as DOC or HPO for the raw waters, with R-2 values ranging from 0.79 to 0.82 for THMs and from 0.71 to 0.73 for HAAs for these three determinants. For treated waters the corresponding values were significantly lower at 0.52-0.67 and 0.46-0.47 respectively, reflecting the lower HPO concentration and thus UV254 absorption and commensurately reduced precision due to the limit of detection of the analytical instrument. It is concluded that fractionation offers little benefit in attempting to discern or predict chlorinated carbonaceous DBP yield for the waters across the geographical region studied. UV254 offered an adequate estimate of DBPFP based on a mean yield of similar to 2600 and similar to 2800 mu g per cm(-1) absorbance for THMFP for the raw and treated waters respectively and similar to 3800 and similar to 2900 g cm(-1) for HAAFP, albeit with reduced precision for the treated waters.

The present work demonstrates the bactericidal effect of chloridized silver wires, where chloridization was achieved through chemical/electrochemical methods. The disinfection kinetics of uncoated and chloridized silver wires immersed in a 100 mL batch reactor were compared for one Gram positive and two Gram negative model bacterial strains, i.e., Bacillus subtilis MTCC 441 and Escherichia coli MTCC 443 and MTCC 739, respectively. Results showed that the chloridized silver wires could achieve better bactericidal effect compared to the uncoated silver wires. Initial cell concentration (N-0) had a significant influence on the time required for complete disinfection which increased by more than 60 fold as N-0 increased from 10(3) to 10(9) CFU/mL. The disinfection kinetics was correlated with release of silver ions from the chloridized surfaces and was affected by changes in water quality and presence of other constituents in water. High alkalinity showed minimal adverse effect whereas high values of hardness and natural organic matter had severe adverse effect on disinfection kinetics and silver release. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This situation makes the application of advanced water treatment technologies compulsory. In this study, applicability of nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) methods was investigated for reuse of industrial wastewater treated with advanced treatment method at organized industrial zone. For this purpose, two NF (HL-GE and DL-GE) and one RO (AG-BWRO) membranes were used at 10 bar of applied pressure. Permeability test revealed that HL membrane exhibited the highest permeability with 7.22 +/- 0.79 L/m(2) h bar of permeability constant followed by AG membrane with a permeability constant of 6.03 +/- 0.25 L/m(2) h bar. Less permeable membrane was DL with a permeability constant of 2.08 +/- 0.11 L/m(2) h bar. In terms of rejection performance, conductivity, salinity, chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC), color, divalent ions (Ca2+, Mg2+ and SO42-) and monovalent ions (Na+, K+, Cl- and HCO3-) were rejected by HL membrane with an average rejection of 37.2 +/- 2.1%, 38.6 +/- 2.5%, 72.5 +/- 5.5%, 79.9 +/- 6.1%, 85.4 +/- 1.2%, 86.0 +/- 0.5%, 88.8 +/- 0.3%, 99.9 +/- 0.0%, 46.0 +/- 0.9%, 27.0 +/- 0.3% 17.9 +/- 1.1%, 64.3 +/- 2.8%, respectively. The respective rejections by DL membrane were 31.1 +/- 0.8%, 31.2 +/- 1.1%, 36.8 +/- 16.4%, 68.2 +/- 7.3%, 81.0 +/- 4.0%, 77.9 +/- 0.7%, 84.7 +/- 07%, 99.9 +/- 0.0%, 41.0 +/- 04%, 18.4 +/- 1.7%, 14.0 +/- 1.3%, and 45.2 +/- 2.7%. On the other hand, higher water quality was obtained with AG-BWRO membrane. AG-BWRO achieved conductivity, salinity, COD, TOC and color rejections of 96.8 +/- 0.2%, 96.9 +/- 0.1%, 74.7 +/- 2.8%, 90.5 +/- 4.8% and 87.6 +/- 1.9%, respectively. Divalent ions and monovalent ions were rejected by AG-BWRO membrane with an average rejection of higher than 94%. In conclusion, AG-BWRO membrane was found to be the best membrane considering both product water quality and quantity. DL membrane was found to be the worst one among the three membranes investigated in this work.

Understanding the relationship between landscape characteristics and water quality is of great importance to improve water contamination prediction in unmonitored watersheds and for providing guidelines for watershed land use planning. In this study, five water sampling sites in the upper Dan River basin were established to monitor seasonal water chemical contamination over the period of 2000 to 2008. The relationships between land use patterns and water quality were analyzed across multiple-scales using redundancy analysis. The results showed that stream water quality variables displayed highly temporal variations, with electrical conductivity (EC), ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), and total suspended solids (TSS) all generally displaying higher levels in the wet season, while there were higher concentrations of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (CODcr), and dissolved oxygen (DO) in the dry season. The total contribution of land use patterns on overall water quality was stronger at the riparian scale than at the catchment and reach scales during the wet season. However, different land use metrics had different scale effects. Urban land had a higher positive relationship with degraded water quality at small scales than at large scales, whereas agricultural land displayed the opposite scale effects. Forest and grassland explained more water quality variations at the riparian scale than at other scales. Analyses of spatial development patterns suggested that size, density, aggregation, and diversity of landscape patterns were important factors impacting on stream water quality. The results provide important information regarding sustainable land use and landscape planning at multiple-scales that can be used to improve water quality. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Assortment and spatiotemporal analysis of surface water quality using cluster and discriminant analyses	CATENA												In this study, cluster analysis (CA) and discriminant analysis (DA) were used to assess the water quality and evaluate its spatial and temporal variations in South Florida. For this purpose, 15 years (2000-2014) data set of 12 water quality variables covering 16 monitoring stations, and about 35,000 observations were used. Agglomerative hierarchical CA grouped 16 monitoring sites into three groups (low pollution, moderate pollution, and high pollution) based on their similarity of water quality characteristics. DA, as an important data reduction method, and CA were used to assess the water pollution status and analysis of its spatiotemporal variation. It was found by the stepwise DA that five variables (chI-a, DO, TKN, TP and water temperature) were the most important discriminating water quality parameters responsible for temporal variations. In spatial DA, the stepwise mode identified seven variables (chl-a, DO, TKN, TP, magnesium, chloride, and sodium) and six variables (DO, TKN, TP, turbidity, magnesium, and chloride) as the most important discriminating variables responsible for spatial variations in wet and dry seasons, respectively. Different patterns associated with spatial variations were identified depending on the variables and considered season, however the overall trend of environment pollution problems was found from the low pollution (LP) region to high pollution (HP) region. It is believed that the results of this study could be very useful to the local authorities for the control and management of pollution and better protection of important riverine water quality.

J	Jin, YX; Lee, H; Jin, YO; Hong, S				Jin, Yongxun; Lee, Hyunkyung; Jin, Yang Oh; Hong, Seungkwan			Application of multiple modified fouling index (MFI) measurements at full-scale SWRO plant	DESALINATION												Recently, a modified fouling index (MFI) is published on ASTM, and thus, is expected to become a standard method for evaluating fouling potential, as a supplement to silt density index (SDI). Employing membranes with smaller pore size in MFI measurements has been continuously suggested in many previous studies. However, there was a lack of practical studies verifying the usefulness of MFI. In this study, the applicability of multiple MFIs (i.e., MFI0.45, MFI-UF100 (kDa) and MFI-UP10 (kDa)) were evaluated at a full-scale UF/RO seawater desalination plant located in the Middle East. For a year, MFIs were measured with RO feed water and the results were correlated with increments in differential pressure (DP) of RO process. Regression analysis was conducted in order to find out whether the fouling index could predict RO performance deterioration. The observed MFIs clearly showed correlation with DP variation, while SDI and water quality parameters (e.g. turbidity and UV254) exhibited relatively low accordance. Particularly, MFI-UF100 (kDa) was the most sensitive, indicating that colloidal fouling is the main cause of fouling in SWRO desalination. The regression results were reconfirmed through specific events where feed water quality was severely changed due to red tide or ship movement at intake. These events provided unconventional feed water characteristics, but similar trend was observed that MFI-UF100 (kDa) was most sensitive. The application of MFI in an actual plant provided valuable contribution for the further advancement of MFI measurements. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Freezing, gravity-driven and centrifugal desalination (FGCD) technologies were combined in the experitnents. Seawater taken from Bohai Bay was frozen and then the seawater ice samples were placed in ambient temperature to melt gradually with the brine drained induced by gravity. The gravity-induced brine drainage proportion for each sample was different because the melting time was not the same. Then the remaining ice was centrifuged for further brine removal. The influences of the gravity driven brine drainage on the gravity-induced salt removal efficiency, the overall salt removal efficiency after FGCD process and the ice yield rate were quantified. The results showed that the maximum Cl- removal efficiency can be >99% and the Cl concentration of the produced ice can meet the requirement of the standards for drinking water quality. Whereas the salt removal efficiency was negatively correlated with the ice yield rate: the more the ice yield, the lower the salt removal efficiency and vice versa. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Multispectral images were acquired from a fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) while concomitant measurements of gas exchange, plant water status, leaf structural traits and chlorophyll were taken in a commercial farm located in southeast Spain with two Citrus species, grapefruit and mandarin irrigated for eight years with saline reclaimed water (RW) combined with regulated deficit irrigation (RDI). Measurements at leaf scale and airborne flights were carried out twice a day, at 7 and 10 GMT. Irrigation with RW decreased gas exchange and leaf dry mass per unit area (LMA) on grapefruit. However, salinity from RW resulted in an increase in pressure potential (gyp) on mandarin and allowed maintaining net photosynthesis (A) and stomatal conductance (g(s)) when vapour pressure deficit increased. On both crops, leaf total chlorophyll (ChlT) concentrations were significantly reduced by RW. Moreover, RDI decreased A, gs and stem water potential (psi s) on grapefruit, independently of water quality. Regarding spectral data, red wavelength (R) was significantly correlated with Chl T (p < 0.001), except when mandarin was subjected to stressful climatic conditions (at 10 GMT); since R was influenced, in addition to Chl T, by the plant water and gas exchange status. Near infrared (NIR) was a useful indicator of psi s, A and gs on both crops. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was clearly related to gas exchange in both species and to psi s only on mandarin. Finally, we combined data from both Citrus species and the best indicators were NIR and R. The novelty of this study was to show that diurnal changes in physiological and structural traits of Citrus irrigated with RW combined with RDI can be determined by multispectral images from UAVs.

A lab in the field: high-frequency analysis of water quality and stable isotopes in stream water and precipitation	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												High-frequency measurements of solutes and isotopes (O-18 and H-2) in rainfall and streamflow can shed important light on catchment flow pathways and travel times, but the workload and sample storage artifacts involved in collecting, transporting, and analyzing thousands of bottled samples severely constrain catchment studies in which conventional sampling methods are employed. However, recent developments towards more compact and robust analyzers have now made it possible to measure chemistry and water isotopes in the field at sub-hourly frequencies over extended periods. Here, we present laboratory and field tests of a membrane-vaporization continuous water sampler coupled to a cavity ring-down spectrometer for real-time measurements of delta O-18 and delta H-2 combined with a dual-channel ion chromatograph (IC) for the synchronous analysis of major cations and anions. The precision of the isotope analyzer was typically better than 0.03% for delta O-18 and 0.17% for delta H-2 in 10 min average readings taken at intervals of 30 min. Carryover effects were less than 1.2% between isotopically contrasting water samples for 30 min sampling intervals, and instrument drift could be corrected through periodic analysis of secondary reference standards. The precision of the ion chromatograph was typically similar to 0.1-1 ppm or better, with relative standard deviations of similar to 1% or better for most major ions in stream water, which is sufficient to detect subtle biogeochemical signals in catchment runoff. We installed the coupled isotope analyzer/IC system in an uninsulated hut next to a stream of a small catchment and analyzed stream water and precipitation samples every 30 min over 28 days. These high-frequency measurements facilitated a detailed comparison of event-water fractions via endmember mixing analysis with both chemical and isotope tracers. For two events with relatively dry antecedent moisture conditions, the event-water fractions were <21% based on isotope tracers but were significantly overestimated (40 to 82 %) by the chemical tracers. These observations, coupled with the storm-to-storm patterns in precipitation isotope inputs and the associated stream water isotope response, led to a conceptual hypothesis for runoff generation in the catchment. Under this hypothesis, the pre-event water that is mobilized by precipitation events may, depending on antecedent moisture conditions, be significantly shallower, younger, and less mineralized than the deeper, older water that feeds baseflow and thus defines the "pre-event" endmember used in hydrograph separation. This proof-of-concept study illustrates the potential advantages of capturing isotopic and hydrochemical behavior at a high frequency over extended periods that span multiple hydrologic events.

HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The design and evaluation of solutions for integrated surface water quality management requires an integrated modelling approach. Integrated models have to be comprehensive enough to cover the aspects relevant for management decisions, allowing for mapping of larger-scale processes such as climate change to the regional and local contexts. Besides this, models have to be sufficiently simple and fast to apply proper methods of uncertainty analysis, covering model structure deficits and error propagation through the chain of sub-models. Here, we present a new integrated catchment model satisfying both conditions. The conceptual "iWaQa" model was developed to support the integrated management of small streams. It can be used to predict traditional water quality parameters, such as nutrients and a wide set of organic micropollutants (plant and material protection products), by considering all major pollutant pathways in urban and agricultural environments. Due to its simplicity, the model allows for a full, propagative analysis of predictive uncertainty, including certain structural and input errors. The usefulness of the model is demonstrated by predicting future surface water quality in a small catchment with mixed land use in the Swiss Plateau. We consider climate change, population growth or decline, socio-economic development, and the implementation of management strategies to tackle urban and agricultural point and non-point sources of pollution. Our results indicate that input and model structure uncertainties are the most influential factors for certain water quality parameters. In these cases model uncertainty is already high for present conditions. Nevertheless, accounting for today's uncertainty makes management fairly robust to the foreseen range of potential changes in the next decades. The assessment of total predictive uncertainty allows for selecting management strategies that show small sensitivity to poorly known boundary conditions. The identification of important sources of uncertainty helps to guide future monitoring efforts and pinpoints key indicators, whose evolution should be closely followed to adapt management. The possible impact of climate change is clearly demonstrated by water quality substantially changing depending on single climate model chains. However, when all climate trajectories are combined, the human land use and management decisions have a larger influence on water quality against a time horizon of 2050 in the study.

Risk assessment and risk management are major tasks for drinking water systems engineers, managers and the regulatory agencies. Development of contingency plans are necessary to water systems, and having a multi barrier system is an approach started to become familiar to avoid any potential public exposure to water contamination that could have a serious impact on human health. Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) are becoming a continuous challenge to the ecosystem and human health due to climate change, discharged nutrients from agriculture activities, improperly treated or untreated sewage effluents and others.

Use of fluorescence spectroscopy to control ozone dosage in recirculating aquaculture systems	WATER RESEARCH												The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of fluorescence spectroscopy to be used as an ozone dosage determination tool in recirculating aquaculture systems (RASs), by studying the relationship between fluorescence intensities and dissolved organic matter (DOM) degradation by ozone, in order to optimise ozonation treatment. Water samples from six different Danish facilities (two rearing units from a commercial trout RAS, a commercial eel RAS, a pilot RAS and two marine water aquariums) were treated with different O-3 dosages (1.0-20.0 mg/L ozone) in bench-scale experiments, following which fluorescence intensity degradation was eventually determined. Ozonation kinetic experiments showed that RAS water contains fluorescent organic matter, which is easily oxidised upon ozonation in relatively low concentrations (0-5 mg O-3/L). Fluorescence spectroscopy has a high level of sensitivity and selectivity in relation to associated fluorophores, and it is able to determine accurately the ozone demand of each system. The findings can potentially be used to design offline or online sensors based on the reduction by ozone of natural fluorescent-dissolved organic matter in RAS. The suggested indirect determination of ozone delivered into water can potentially contribute to a safer and more adequate ozone-based treatment to improve water quality. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
