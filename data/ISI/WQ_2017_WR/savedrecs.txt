The role of baseflow in dissolved solids delivery to streams in the Upper Colorado River Basin	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Salinity has a major effect on water users in the Colorado River Basin, estimated to cause almost $300million per year in economic damages. The Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Program implements and manages projects to reduce salinity loads, investing millions of dollars per year in irrigation upgrades, canal projects, and other mitigation strategies. To inform and improve mitigation efforts, there is a need to better understand sources of salinity to streams and how salinity has changed over time. This study explores salinity in the baseflow fraction of streamflow, assessing whether groundwater is a significant contributor of dissolved solids to streams in the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB). Chemical hydrograph separation was used to estimate baseflow discharge and baseflow dissolved solids loads at stream gages (n=69) across the UCRB. On average, it is estimated that 89% of dissolved solids loads originate from the baseflow fraction of streamflow, indicating that subsurface transport processes play a dominant role in delivering dissolved solids to streams in the UCRB. A statistical trend analysis using weighted regressions on time, discharge, and season was used to evaluate changes in baseflow dissolved solids loads in streams (n=27) from 1986 to 2011. Decreasing trends in baseflow dissolved solids loads were observed at 63% of streams. At the three most downstream sites, Green River at Green River, UT, Colorado River at Cisco, UT, and the San Juan River near Bluff, UT, baseflow dissolved solids loads decreased by a combined 823,000metrictons (mT), which is approximately 69% of projected basin-scale decreases in total dissolved solids loads as a result of salinity control efforts. Decreasing trends in baseflow dissolved solids loads suggest that salinity mitigation projects, landscape changes, and/or climate are reducing dissolved solids transported to streams through the subsurface. Notably, the pace and extent of decreases in baseflow dissolved solids loads declined during the most recent decade; average decreasing loads during the 2000s (28,200mT) were only 54% of average decreasing loads in the 1990s (51,700mT).

Prediction of storm transfers and annual loads with data-based mechanistic models using high-frequency data	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Excess nutrients in surface waters, such as phosphorus (P) from agriculture, result in poor water quality, with adverse effects on ecological health and costs for remediation. However, understanding and prediction of P transfers in catchments have been limited by inadequate data and over-parameterised models with high uncertainty. We show that, with high temporal resolution data, we are able to identify simple dynamic models that capture the P load dynamics in three contrasting agricultural catchments in the UK. For a flashy catchment, a linear, second-order (two pathways) model for discharge gave high simulation efficiencies for short-term storm sequences and was useful in highlighting uncertainties in out-of-bank flows. A model with non-linear rainfall input was appropriate for predicting seasonal or annual cumulative P loads where antecedent conditions affected the catchment response. For second-order models, the time constant for the fast pathway varied between 2 and 15 h for all three catchments and for both discharge and P, confirming that high temporal resolution data are necessary to capture the dynamic responses in small catchments (10-50 km(2)). The models led to a better understanding of the dominant nutrient transfer modes, which will be helpful in determining phosphorus transfers following changes in precipitation patterns in the future.

Hydrologic processes that govern stormwater infrastructure behaviour	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Using water budget data from published literature, we demonstrate how hydrologic processes govern the function of various stormwater infrastructure technologies. Hydrologic observations are displayed on a Water Budget Triangle, a ternary plot tool developed to visualize simplified water budgets, enabling side-by-side comparison of green and grey approaches to stormwater management. The tool indicates ranges of hydrologic function for green roofs, constructed wetlands, cisterns, bioretention, and other stormwater control management structures. Water budgets are plotted for several example systems to provide insight on structural and environmental design factors, and seasonal variation in hydrologic processes of stormwater management systems. Previously published water budgets and models are used to suggest appropriate operational standards for several green and grey stormwater control structures and compare between conventional and low-impact development approaches. We compare models, characterize and quantify water budgets and expected ranges for green and grey infrastructure systems, and demonstrate how the Water Budget Triangle tool may help users to develop a data-driven approach for understanding design and retrofit of green stormwater infrastructure.

Some studies showed that DES can be removed by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, However, no one has paid attention to the formation of oestrogenic disinfection by-products (DBPs) and the persistence of DES in surface water remains a mystery. In this study, UV was found to be very effective in removing oestrogenic activity regardless of water quality. Three oestrogenic DBPs were specifically isolated by oestrogen receptor-based affinity chromatography and identified as 9,10-diethylphenanthrene-3,6-diol, cis-DES and Z,Z-dienestrol. Among them, 9,10-diethylphenanthrene-3,6-diol was proved to have stronger oestrogenic activity than E2, but it can be further photodegraded. In addition, DES was also demonstrated to be a photochromic compound, whose UV-induced intermediates can be transformed back to DES under sunlight, which significantly slows down the photodegradation of DES. This study solves the question as to why UV-degradable DES is still detectable in the ambient water and provides a deep understanding of DES removal during UV disinfection.

Integrated treatment of acid mine drainage using BOF slag, lime/soda ash and reverse osmosis (RO): Implication for the production of drinking water	DESALINATION												Acid mine drainage has been an issue of prime concern to international scientific communities. This is due to the magnitude, nature and extent of its environmental impacts. Acid mine drainage (AMD) contains hazardous and toxic chemical species that require removal prior discharging mine water to different environmental compartments. A number of mine water treatment technologies have been developed but they were reported to contain certain benefits and drawbacks. However, there is a need to come-up with environmental friendly and zero liquid -discharge technologies. The purpose of this novel study was to produce drinking water and recover valuable minerals from acid mine drainage using an integration of Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) slag, lime, soda ash and Reverse Osmosis (RO) system. The process can produce very pure water and recover valuable minerals such as hematite, goethite, gypsum, and limestone. Furthermore, brine will be taken to free desalinator for further recovery of salts. To achieve the goals of this study, semi-pilot experiments were done in the laboratory using the aforementioned integrated approach. Interaction of BOF and AMD increased the pH of mine water to >= 8. > 99% metals and 75% sulphate were also removal using BOF slag. Residual sulphates and hardness were reduced using lime and soda ash respectively. Gypsum and brucite were recovered as valuable minerals in the lime reactor. Ca as hydrated lime and limestone were recovered in the soda ash reactor. The recovered minerals could be sold as valuable minerals to metallurgical houses and off-set the process/running cost. Reverse Osmosis (RO) was used to further clean the water to meet drinking water quality. A single pass RO system was simulated in Reverse Osmosis System Analysis (ROSA). The produced water meets the requirements of the South African National Standard (SANS) 241 Drinking Water Specifications. As such, it can be concluded that this integrated technology has shown that drinking water and valuable minerals can be recovered from AMD.

Additionally, these fluxes are seldom measured, hindering critical evaluation of model output. Analysis of the Canadian Small Lake Model (CSLM), a one-dimensional integral lake model, was performed to assess its ability to reproduce diurnal and seasonal variations in heat fluxes and the sensitivity of simulated fluxes to changes in model parameters, i.e., turbulent transport parameters and the light extinction coefficient (K-d). A C++ open-source software package, Problem Solving environment for Uncertainty Analysis and Design Exploration (PSUADE), was used to perform sensitivity analysis (SA) and identify the parameters that dominate model behavior. The generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) was applied to quantify the fluxes' uncertainty, comparing daily-averaged eddy-covariance observations to the output of CSLM. Seven qualitative and two quantitative SA methods were tested, and the posterior likelihoods of the modeled parameters, obtained from the GLUE analysis, were used to determine the dominant parameters and the uncertainty in the modeled fluxes. Despite the ubiquity of the equifinality issue - different parameter-value combinations yielding equivalent results-the answer to the question was unequivocal: K-d, a measure of how much light penetrates the lake, dominates sensible and latent heat fluxes, and the uncertainty in their estimates is strongly related to the accuracy with which K-d is determined. This is important since accurate and continuous measurements of K-d could reduce modeling uncertainty.																	1027-5606	1607-7938				DEC 14	2017	21	12					6345	6362		10.5194/hess-21-6345-2017								WOS:000417943600002

However, these wetland ecosystems are dependent on local climate and hydrology, and are therefore at risk due to climate and land use change. This study develops site-specific empirical hydrologic models for five forested wetlands with different characteristics by analyzing long-term observed meteorological and hydrological data. These wetlands represent typical cypress ponds/swamps, Carolina bays, pine flatwoods, drained pocosins, and natural bottomland hardwood ecosystems. The validated empirical models are then applied at each wetland to predict future water table changes using climate projections from 20 general circulation models (GCMs) participating in Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project 5 (CMIP5) under the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. We show that combined future changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration would significantly alter wetland hydrology including groundwater dynamics by the end of the 21st century. Compared to the historical period, all five wetlands are predicted to become drier over time. The mean water table depth is predicted to drop by 4 to 22 cm in response to the decrease in water availability (i.e., precipitation minus potential evapotranspiration) by the year 2100. Among the five examined wetlands, the depressional wetland in hot and humid Florida appears to be most vulnerable to future climate change. This study provides quantitative information on the potential magnitude of wetland hydrological response to future climate change in typical forested wetlands in the southeastern US.

J	Magee, MR; Wu, CH				Magee, Madeline R.; Wu, Chin H.			Response of water temperatures and stratification to changing climate in three lakes with different morphometry	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Water temperatures and stratification are important drivers for ecological and water quality processes within lake systems, and changes in these with increases in air temperature and changes to wind speeds may have significant ecological consequences. To properly manage these systems under changing climate, it is important to understand the effects of increasing air temperatures and wind speed changes in lakes of different depths and surface areas. In this study, we simulate three lakes that vary in depth and surface area to elucidate the effects of the observed increasing air temperatures and decreasing wind speeds on lake thermal variables (water temperature, stratification dates, strength of stratification, and surface heat fluxes) over a century (19112014). For all three lakes, simulations showed that epilimnetic temperatures increased, hypolimnetic temperatures decreased, the length of the stratified season increased due to earlier stratification onset and later fall overturn, stability increased, and longwave and sensible heat fluxes at the surface increased. Overall, lake depth influences the presence of stratification, Schmidt stability, and differences in surface heat flux, while lake surface area influences differences in hypolimnion temperature, hypolimnetic heating, variability of Schmidt stability, and stratification onset and fall overturn dates. Larger surface area lakes have greater wind mixing due to increased surface momentum. Climate perturbations indicate that our larger study lakes have more variability in temperature and stratification variables than the smaller lakes, and this variability increases with larger wind speeds. For all study lakes, Pearson correlations and climate perturbation scenarios indicate that wind speed has a large effect on temperature and stratification variables, sometimes greater than changes in air temperature, and wind can act to either amplify or mitigate the effect of warmer air temperatures on lake thermal structure depending on the direction of local wind speed changes.

Here, we present a proof-of-concept study of a "lab in the field" called the "River Lab" (RL), based on the idea of permanently installing a suite of laboratory instruments in the field next to a river. Housed in a small shed, this set of instruments performs analyses at a frequency of one every 40 min for major dissolved species (Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cl-, SO42-, NO3- )through continuous sampling and filtration of the river water using automated ion chromatographs. The RL was deployed in the Orgeval Critical Zone Observatory, France for over a year of continuous analyses. Results show that the RL is able to capture long-term fine chemical variations with no drift and a precision significantly better than conventionally achieved in the laboratory (up to +/- 0.5% for all major species for over a day and up to 1.7% over 2 months). The RL is able to capture the abrupt changes in dissolved species concentrations during a typical 6-day rain event, as well as daily oscillations during a hydrological low-flow period of summer drought. Using the measured signals as a benchmark, we numerically assess the effects of a lower sampling frequency (typical of conventional field sampling campaigns) and of a lower precision (typically reached in the laboratory) on the hydrochemical signal. The highresolution, high-precision measurements made possible by the RL open new perspectives for understanding critical zone hydro-bio-geochemical cycles. Finally, the RL also offers a solution for management agencies to monitor water quality in quasi-real time.

Hence, it is important to develop an eco-friendly and cost effective technology to treat the tannery effluent wastewater. Our present investigation on integrated approach of electrochemical oxidation (EO) of tannery effluent (TE) using RuO2-IrO2-TiO2 anode and titanium mesh electrode as cathode and followed by the biodegradation process (BP) of the treated EO effluent. Various parameters viz., sodium chloride concentration (NaCl) (1-5 g/L) and current density (10-30 mA/cm(2) ) are optimized. The agro waste peanut hull (PH) and rice hull (RH) are utilized as carbon source for biodegradation of tannery effluent. A maximum of 87% decolorization is observed at 5 g/L of NaCl concentration and 30 mA/cm(2) of current density after 135 min of EO treatment. The EO treated TE is further treated by BP with Pseudomonas stutzeri MN1, Acinetobacter baumannii MN3 and mixed consortia of MN1 and MN3. The 97% of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 96% of Cr(VI) reduction was observed after 72 h of BP with mixed consortia and rice hull as carbon source. Thus, the integrated approach of EO with BP can be implied for complete a decolorization and degradation of tannery effluent.																	2214-7144					DEC	2017	20						22	28		10.1016/j.jwpe.2017.09.008								WOS:000431411700003

Hydrology and water quality of isolated wetlands: Stormflow changes along two episodic flowpaths	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												The Dougherty Plain in southwest Georgia is a flat, karstic, depressional-landscape dominated by irrigated and dry-land agriculture devoted to row-crops and pasture with interspersed wetlands and forests. Stormwater runoff rarely discharges into perennial rivers and streams, except during large storms that induce hydrologic connectivity between fields, wetlands, and streams (event return period is less than one per year). We report the hydrologic and water-quality effects of a 173-mm rainfall event that generated three weeks (Feb 15 to Mar 9, 2014) of continuous flows through and between three normally isolated wetlands. A suite of water-quality parameters (physical, nutrients, and pathogen indicators) was monitored daily from offsite (agricultural) and onsite (forested) sources at two sites along one flowpath and five sites along a second at the Joseph W Jones Ecologic Research Center at Ichauway. Decreasing sediment, nutrient, and pathogen concentrations were observed as water moved across the forested landscapes with embedded wetlands. Two physical parameters (specific conductance and turbidity) were strongly-to-moderately correlated (r > 0.8, 0.5, respectively) with laboratory-measured parameters (e.g., nutrients, suspended solids, pathogens), which suggest their utility for routine stormwater monitoring and prioritizing sample collection for laboratory analyses at this site.																	2214-5818					DEC	2017	14						23	36		10.1016/j.ejrh.2017.10.001								WOS:000426118300003

Study focus: Groundwaters have been sampled along a transect. Based on environmental tracers (REEs, Br, B, delta B-11, Sr, Sr-87/Sr-86) aquifer vulnerability and sustainability issues are identified. New hydrological insights for the region: For sites near to aquifer outcrop, REE and Sr signatures (and relatively light delta C-13) trace possible vertical recharge from flood basalts directly overlying the GAS. This highlights aquifer vulnerability where confined by fewer basalts and/or having cross-cutting fractures. C-14 activities for these waters, however, suggest the impact of this recharge is significantly delayed in reaching the GAS. Anthropogenic sources for boron are not currently encountered; delta B-11 highlights feldspar dissolution, isotopically lighter signatures in the deepest sampled GAS waters resulting from pH/hydrochemical speciation changes down-gradient. Br/Cl signatures (and heavier delta O-18, delta H-2) in these latter samples appear to reflect a past climatic signature emplaced under more arid conditions; carbon isotope systematics (delta C-13, C-14) support that these represent fossil waters, and care must be taken in their water resources management in regard to sustainability of abstraction. delta O-18, delta S-34 (sulfate) signatures confirm hydrological arguments that waters leak out of the base of the GAS aquifer in this locality rather than underlying formations with poorer water quality potentially mixing in, although other deep GAS waters in the region do show this inter-aquifer mixing.																	2214-5818					DEC	2017	14						130	149		10.1016/j.ejrh.2017.10.006								WOS:000426118300010						
J	Kanakoudis, V; Tsitsifli, S				Kanakoudis, V.; Tsitsifli, S.			Potable water security assessment - a review on monitoring, modelling and optimization techniques, applied to water distribution networks	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												The paper tries to investigate some of the most important issues that need to be addressed to provide an integrated system for potable water security, in developed countries. It can be understood that in developing countries both supplied water quantity and quality are important for water security. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, "water security is defined as prevention and protection against contamination and terrorism." Water quality safeguarding has been addressed by many researchers during the last decades trying to define ways to ensure water of proper quality for the public. As unexpected contamination events may occur in water distribution systems, early warning systems providing the water managers with enough time to act effectively need to be developed. These systems should include interconnected: (a) monitoring tools to monitor in real time at least the most crucial water quality characteristics; (b) modelling tools to simulate the transport of any harmful contaminant and calculate the variations of its concentration; and (c) optimization tools to define the optimal locations and density of the monitoring sensors and disinfection stations. The drinking water supply system addressed in this paper consists of the supply system after the water treatment plant and until the consumers' taps, with special emphasis on the water distribution system. Drinking water security is addressed in cases other than normal operating conditions. Specifically, the paper examines contamination phenomena due to operational failures (e.g., during the disinfection process), natural disasters, pollution accidents and malicious actions. Contamination phenomena due to other factors, such as lead contamination are not included in this paper. It reviews the literature on monitoring, modelling and optimization techniques used in water distribution systems while at the same time proposes an integrated approach consisting of risk assessment methods and the use of "simheuristics" to deal with drinking water security.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				DEC	2017	99						18	26		10.5004/dwt.2017.21784								WOS:000425242300004

Development of a novel two-stage powdered activated carbon-dynamic membrane filtration (PAC-DMF) system for direct physicochemical wastewater treatment	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												Due to the issues of high energy consumption, high carbon emissions, and low resource and energy recovery, there is an urgent need to develop new paradigms for simultaneous wastewater treatment and resource utilization using physicochemical processes rather than conventional biological means. Recently, direct membrane filtration of municipal wastewater using ultrafiltration/microfiltration technology was proposed and showed satisfactory performance, with high membrane costs and fast membrane fouling as the main limitations. In this study, a novel two-stage powdered activated carbon-dynamic membrane filtration (PAC-DMF) system was developed using PAC as a carrier to enhance DM formation and organic pollutant retention. The particle size and dosage of PAC, strategy for operating the continuous reactor in the first stage, and selection of the PAC particle size in the second stage were investigated. The effluent from the first stage was found to have a stable water quality, with turbidity in the range of 50-70 NTU. Efficient retention of organic materials was also achieved with a retention rate of 74%-82%, and the COD content in the concentrate was above 3,000 mg/L in the cycle filtration experiment. In the second stage, further enhancement of water quality and organics retention were observed, as evidenced by the low effluent COD (<70 mg/L) and turbidity (5-20 NTU). Meanwhile, the effluent that was rich in nitrogen and phosphorus was suitable for agricultural irrigation or gardening. The results indicated that the developed two-stage PAC-DMF system could be a highly promising alternative to the conventional wastewater treatment process.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				DEC	2017	99						299	308		10.5004/dwt.2017.21750								WOS:000425242300038

Economic development has led to negative impacts on the environment and the health of populations. Several methods have been developed to limit the concentrations and a load of effluents in the natural environment. Lakes, reservoirs and closed bays are particularly sensitive to contaminant inputs. Their hydrodynamics promote sedimentation and lead to slow mixing of the effluent in the medium. In this context, the present study was concerned with the environmental objectives of discharges (EOD) of the Protuil manufacturing (metal production) in a salted and protected area of the Fetzara Lake. This method permits the calculation of concentrations and loads of contaminants potentially discharged into an aquatic environment without the compromise of water quality. The calculation of EOD for heavy metals (Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn) has shown a significant overcoming of these toxic contaminants threatening the ecosystem integrity and/or the environment.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				DEC	2017	99						338	343		10.5004/dwt.2017.21749								WOS:000425242300043

Effects of combined calcium hypochlorite and chlorine dioxide on drinking water quality in Qatar and disinfection by-products formation	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												Chlorite, chlorate, bromate and trihalo methanes (THMs) are included in WHO guidelines for drinking water quality. This study examined dosing different chlorine concentrations as calcium hypochlorite (Ca(ClO)(2)) to water containing chlorine dioxide to evaluate the control of water quality in storage and the distribution system in Qatar with emphasis on chlorite, chlorate, bromate, pH and other parameters. Seven water samples were collected from the Ras Laffan-Q Power desalination plant outlet in amber bottles having a chlorine dioxide concentration of 0.3 mg/L in 1 liter. The bottles were spiked with Ca(ClO)(2) in sequence to give concentration of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, and 1.2 mg/L as free chlorine. The mixtures were stored for 7 days at 25 degrees C in the dark then heated to 45 degrees C for two days more, and analyzed daily for physical and chemical parameters. A total of 312 sub-samples were analyzed for chlorite, chlorate, bromate, bromide, chloride, nitrate, nitrite, sulfate, THMs, temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, and chlorine and chlorine dioxide residuals. Chlorite concentration reductions were observed from the first day forward as 59, 65, 68, 94, 100, and 100%, and 17.4, 22.1, 39.2, 63.9, 66.0, 68.9% (from 0.157 to 0.049 mg/L) respectively based on observed means for seven days the commensurate respective chlorate concentrations increases were 196, 344, 516, 602, 703, 787% (from 0.035 to 0.313 mg/L) based on observed mean values for seven days. These data were statistically analyzed by multivariate regression. There were no significant changes in THMs concentrations and the reductions in chlorite and increases in chlorate concentration are chlorine dosage dependent. No bromate formation was observed. Chlorine dioxide levels decrease as the free chlorine residual levels increased. This study demonstrates that hypochlorite/chlorine dioxide can be used as an operational tool to control the chlorite levels, and slow the disappearance of the chlorine dioxide over time during distribution, that is usually faster than chlorine disappearance. The original chlorine dioxide dosage will determine the ultimate chlorate concentration.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				DEC	2017	100						333	339		10.5004/dwt.2017.21895								WOS:000425243300037

Simultaneous corrosion control and water quality improvement in water distribution systems	WATER PRACTICE AND TECHNOLOGY												The effects of different dosages of sodium hexametaphosphate and sodium orthophosphate on corrosion inhibition and water quality in two model water distribution systems, and the corrosion inhibition mechanism on pipe walls were investigated. Results show that adding sodium hexametaphosphate and sodium orthophosphate can not only provide a remedy for the damaged cement coating surface, but improve water quality by reducing hardness, turbidity and total iron in cement-coated water distribution systems. The surface exposed to sodium hexametaphosphate was covered by a discontinuous glass-like film, while the other was covered by some phosphate crystals and a thin film. The glass-like film sequestered Ca, Fe and Al on its surface, where calcium hexametaphosphate could be in complex with Fe2O3 or Al2O3 to form the film, while orthophosphate crystals and the thin film were related to Fe and Ca, FePO4 and Ca-3(PO4)(2) formed and deposited on the surface composing the thin film.																	1751-231X					DEC	2017	12	4					790	796		10.2166/wpt.2017.084								WOS:000424141200004

This paper presents the design and preliminary field results from a network of low-cost mobile robots called NUSwan, a system aimed at addressing this issue. NUSwan robots can autonomously traverse a reservoir to provide real-time water quality data over the Internet, and allow users to modify the sampling missions interactively based on their interpretation of the data. The quality of measurements generated is comparable to that obtained from standard manual sampling. Moreover, the system incurs little logistics overhead while allowing higher monitoring frequency and spatial coverage. We present an example to show NUSwan's capability in detecting the emergence of water quality hotspots. Lastly, we demonstrate the potential of using data collected from a short mission carried out by NUSwan to rapidly assess the relationship between water quality indicators.																	1751-231X					DEC	2017	12	4					806	817		10.2166/wpt.2017.089								WOS:000424141200006						
J	Ehya, F; Moghadam, ZF				Ehya, Farhad; Moghadam, Zeynab Firouzeh			Hydrochemistry and water quality assessment of the Maroon River in Behbahan area, SW Iran	WATER PRACTICE AND TECHNOLOGY												Assessing water quality is important in optimizing water usage. In this study, six water samples were taken from points along the Maroon River in order to evaluate its quality. The concentrations of Cl-, SO42-, HCO3-, CO32-, NO3-, K+, Mg2+, Na+, and Ca2+, as well as pH, electrical conductivity (EC) and total dissolved solids (TDS) were measured. The results were compared with the WHO (World Health Organization) drinking water guidelines and the FAO (Food and Agricultural Organization of United Nations) standard for irrigation water. The values of EC, TDS, Ca2+, Cl- and SO42- in two samples, and that of Mg2+ in one sample from downstream exceed WHO recommended limits. The K+, Na+ and NO3- concentrations are below the WHO limits. The dominant water facies is bicarbonate-calcium (HCO3-Ca). A Schoeller diagram shows that the water samples are of 'Good' and 'Intermediate' classes, while a Wilcox diagram reveals that the water is in classes C2S1, C3S3 and C3S2 - i.e., 'Good' or 'Intermediate' - for agricultural purposes. The water quality indices %Na, sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), permeability index (PI), magnesium adsorption ratio (MAR) and Kelly's ratio (KR), also indicate that the water is suitable for irrigation. In terms of EC, the water samples are of 'Good' and 'Permissible' quality. Geochemical investigations show that the water chemistry is influenced by evaporation, dissolution of evaporitic minerals, ion exchange and human activities.																	1751-231X					DEC	2017	12	4					818	831		10.2166/wpt.2017.088								WOS:000424141200007

Visualization of water quality data is an important part of the monitoring and analysis of water quality. Because water quality data have geographic features, their visualization can be realized using maps, which not only provide intuitive visualization, but also reflect the relationship between water quality and geographical position. For this study, the heat map provided by Google Maps was used for water quality data visualization. However, as the amount of data increases, the computational efficiency of traditional development models cannot meet the computing task needs quickly. Effective storage, extraction and analysis of large water data sets becomes a problem that needs urgent solution. Hadoop is an open source software framework running on computer clusters that can store and process large data sets efficiently, and it was used in this study to store and process water quality data. Through reasonable analysis and experiment, an efficient and convenient information platform can be provided for water quality monitoring.																	1751-231X					DEC	2017	12	4					882	893		10.2166/wpt.2017.093								WOS:000424141200012

Monitoring of surface water is essential to know the current status of water quality and maintain it at certain desirable level. In this study surface water quality of Amingaon has been analysed. Amingaon is a locality in North Guwahati (Assam, India). In last few decades' the locality has undergone rapid and uncontrolled development activities which have a detrimental impact on its ecology and environment. Samples were collected from 12 lakes and analysed for 24 parameters namely temperature (T), pH, electrical conductivity (EC), turbidity (Tur), total suspended solids (TSS) and total dissolved solids (TDS), total alkalinity (TA), total hardness (TH), chloride ion (Cl-), fluoride (F-), sulphate (SO42-), sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), dissolved oxygen (DO) biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonium nitrogen (NH3-N), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), nitrate (NO3-) total phosphorus (TP) and available phosphorus (AP). Multivariate statistical techniques were used for the assessment of water quality. Cluster analysis (CA) was used for classification of water quality parameters and principal component analysis (PCA) was used to identify the sources of pollution. CA grouped all the water quality parameters in three cluster. PCA resulted in six useful components which explained 90.54% of the total variance. Based on overall study it was concluded that the sources of pollution of lakes were the use of fertilizers, storm water runoff, land development and domestic waste water discharge. Trophic state of lakes was also evaluated using Carlson's Trophic State Index (TSI).																	1751-231X					DEC	2017	12	4					997	1008		10.2166/wpt.2017.107								WOS:000424141200024

We investigate the hydrologic impacts of 122 ARs that occurred in the Salt and Verde river basins in northeastern Arizona during the cold seasons from 1979 to 2009. We focus on the relationship between precipitation, snow water equivalent (SWE), soil moisture, and extreme flooding. During the cold season (October through March) ARs contribute an average of 25%/29% of total seasonal precipitation for the Salt/Verde river basins, respectively. However, they contribute disproportionately to total heavy precipitation and account for 64%/72% of extreme total daily precipitation (exceeding the 98th percentile). Excess precipitation during AR occurrences contributes to snow accumulation; on the other hand, warmer than normal temperatures during AR landfallings are linked to rain-on-snow processes, an increase in the basins' area contributing to runoff generation, and higher melting lines. Although not all AR events are linked to extreme flooding in the basins, they do account for larger runoff coefficients. On average, ARs generate 43% of the annual maximum flows for the period studied, with 25% of the events exceeding the 10 year return period. Our analysis shows that the devastating 1993 flooding event in the region was caused by AR events. These results illustrate the importance of AR activity on the hydrology of inland semiarid regions: ARs are critical for water resources, but they can also lead to extreme flooding that affects infrastructure and human activities. Plain Language Summary Within the Salt and Verde River basins in the semiarid northeastern Arizona, natural ecosystems and humans compete for over-allocated water resources. The basins are highly dependent on winter precipitation for ecosystem functioning, water supply, fire suppression, and in the case of extreme events, for water quality, flood control and dam safety. Atmospheric Rivers (ARs) are narrow corridors of concentrated water vapor that bring copious amount of rainfall from the Pacific into the region and contribute to its hydrology by increasing snow pack and replenishing soil moisture in the basins. ARs are also responsible for extreme precipitation and streamflow events, such as the 1993 flooding event, which caused human casualties and economic losses. These results illustrate the importance of AR activity on the hydrology of inland semiarid regions: ARs are critical for maintaining natural ecosystem health, but they can also lead to extreme flooding that affects infrastructure and human activities.

Respondents are asked to rate eight photographs that depict varying algae conditions. Our initial results show that Utah resident preferences for benthic algae levels are quite similar to those of Montana residents, thus replicating the Montana study. For the full Utah sample, though, Cronbach's a indicated poor internal consistency in rating the photographs, so a "monotonicity rule'' was used to identify respondents providing monotonic preferences with respect to chlorophyll a densities. Simple graphical analyses are combined with ordered probit analysis to determine the maximum desirable density of chlorophyll a (Chl a). Our analysis indicates that Chl a levels in excess of 150 mg Chl a/m(2) are undesirable, but the regression model suggests that those with strictly monotonic preferences were far more likely favor a more stringent standard. Plain Language Summary Excess nutrients in water can cause eutrophication, a potentially undesirable condition that fosters the growth of nuisance algae. Unlike many other water quality problems, excess algae are easily discerned by those who recreate at streams, rivers, and lakes. EPA has recently tasked state water quality agencies with establishing a numeric criterion for excess nutrients. Some agencies have used public opinion surveys to gauge aesthetic preferences for algae when developing a chlorophyll a-based criterion. This approach implicitly assumes that (1) chlorophyll a densities closely correspond to the quantity and type of benthic algae and (2) preferences for algae are strictly monotonic, i.e., less algae are preferred to more algae. We scientifically replicate a Montana study and find that preferences of Utah residents demonstrate a remarkable similarity to those of Montana residents. However, responses for a significant proportion of the sample were not monotonic. Hence, the water quality criterion implied by survey data may be sensitive to the assumption of monotonicity. Multiple preferred criteria may emerge, each differing according to how researchers treat the monotonicity assumption. We find that respondents whose preferences for chlorophyll a are strongly monotonic are more likely to favor a more stringent criterion.

Estimating Discharge and Nonpoint Source Nitrate Loading to Streams From Three End-Member Pathways Using High-Frequency Water Quality Data	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The myriad hydrologic and biogeochemical processes taking place in watersheds occurring across space and time are integrated and reflected in the quantity and quality of water in streams and rivers. Collection of high-frequency water quality data with sensors in surface waters provides new opportunities to disentangle these processes and quantify sources and transport of water and solutes in the coupled groundwater-surface water system. A new approach for separating the streamflow hydrograph into three components was developed and coupled with high-frequency nitrate data to estimate time-variable nitrate loads from chemically dilute quick flow, chemically concentrated quick flow, and slowflow groundwater end-member pathways for periods of up to 2 years in a groundwater-dominated and a quick-flow-dominated stream in central Wisconsin, using only streamflow and in-stream water quality data. The dilute and concentrated quick flow end-members were distinguished using high-frequency specific conductance data. Results indicate that dilute quick flow contributed less than 5% of the nitrate load at both sites, whereas 8968% of the nitrate load at the groundwater-dominated stream was from slowflow groundwater, and 84625% of the nitrate load at the quick-flow-dominated stream was from concentrated quick flow. Concentrated quick flow nitrate concentrations varied seasonally at both sites, with peak concentrations in the winter that were 2-3 times greater than minimum concentrations during the growing season. Application of this approach provides an opportunity to assess stream vulnerability to nonpoint source nitrate loading and expected stream responses to current or changing conditions and practices in watersheds. Plain Language Summary The input of nutrients, such as nitrogen, to streams has been identified as contributing to the classification of the ecological condition of 42% of wadeable streams in the United States as "poor.'' Elevated nutrients increase the costs of drinking water treatment, and reduction of nutrient loading is necessary for compliance with environmental regulations in many watersheds. Effective mitigation of the impacts of nutrients on stream ecosystems requires an understanding of where nutrients are coming from; for example, in runoff from farm fields or in groundwater. However, when nutrients are delivered to streams from many different parts of a watershed it is difficult to determine how much of the nutrient load measured in a stream is from a given location. We used water quality data measured at 15 min intervals for a period of 2 years in two streams in central Wisconsin to estimate the amount of nitrogen loading to streams from runoff and different parts of the groundwater system. The approach presented here provides an opportunity to assess stream vulnerability to nutrient loading and expected stream responses to current or changing conditions and practices in watersheds.

Sensitivity of Catchment Transit Times to Rainfall Variability Under Present and Future Climates	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Hydrologists have a relatively good understanding of how rainfall variability shapes the catchment hydrograph, a reflection of the celerity of hydraulic head propagation. Much less is known about the influence of rainfall variability on catchment transit times, a reflection of water velocities that control solute transport. This work uses catchment-scale lumped parameter models to decompose the relationship between rainfall variability and an important metric of transit times, the time-varying fraction of young water (<90 days old) in streams (FYW). A coupled rainfall-runoff model and rank StorAge Selection (rSAS) transit time model were calibrated to extensive hydrometric and environmental tracer data from neighboring headwater catchments in Plynlimon, Wales from 1999 to 2008. At both sites, the mean annual FYW increased more than 13 percentage points from the driest to the wettest year. Yearly mean rainfall explained most between-year variation, but certain signatures of rainfall pattern were also associated with higher FYW including: more clustered storms, more negatively skewed storms, and higher covariance between daily rainfall and discharge. We show that these signatures are symptomatic of an "inverse storage effect'' that may be common among watersheds. Looking to the future, changes in rainfall due to projected climate change caused an up to 19 percentage point increase in simulated mean winter FYW and similarly large decreases in the mean summer FYW. Thus, climate change could seasonally alter the ages of water in streams at these sites, with concomitant impacts on water quality. Plain Language Summary Scientists use information about the age of water in streams to help diagnose the source of water and what pollution it may carry. Most stream water originates from rain, and its "age'' is the time that has passed since it fell from the sky. "Old'' water tends to seep into the stream from deep underground where it has been stored and filtered for years or even decades. "Young'' water, on the other hand, comes from recent storms and tends to carry pollution from the land surface directly into streams. This study used stream data and computer simulations to understand how the amount of young water in streams changes in response to wet and dry periods at two small streams in Plynlimon, Wales. We show that the proportion of young water is much higher during wet periods and can be surprisingly sensitive to the rainfall pattern. We also show that changes in rainfall due to climate change could significantly increase the proportion of young stream water in winter and decrease it in summer. We conclude that changes in rainfall under present and future climate conditions can significantly alter the age of water in streams and, in turn, the pollution it carries.

The importance and widespread use of petroleum products and the threats posed by these products on surface water resources in Iran necessitates the access to numerical hydrodynamic and water quality simulation models with appropriate capabilities. Simulation the fate and transport of VOC in both flowing and standing water bodies is a fairly complex problem. In this research, CE-QUAL-W2 model is modified to simulate the fate and transport of VOC [i.e., Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), benzene] in standing and flowing water bodies. The performance of the modified CE-QUAL-W2 model is evaluated in a MTBE pollution spill at Khalife-Tarkhan river along the headwaters of Gheshlagh reservoir, Kordestan, Iran. The results show the modified CE-QUAL-W2 model's capability to depict the spatial and temporal variation of MTBE in comparison with recorded data from MTBE spill event of Gheshlagh reservoir. Based on the simulation results of modified CE-QUAL-W2 model, reservoir cleanup time in different meteorological and hydrological scenarios is evaluated. The results show Gheshlagh reservoir cleanup time reduced in scenarios that included air temperature reduction, wind speed increasing, and high inflow condition.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				DEC	2017	76	23							803	10.1007/s12665-017-7108-5								WOS:000418850500003

Groundwater vulnerability mapping for a sub-catchment of the Rio La Venta watershed, Chiapas, Mexico	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Karst systems are particularly vulnerable to overexploitation and pollution due to their high hydraulic conductivity and points of rapid infiltration that allow quick influx of runoff and pollutants into the aquifer. The sustainability of non-contaminated groundwater in these systems is imperative for both humans and groundwater-dependent ecosystems. An important practice in managing groundwater sustainability involves assessing aquifer vulnerability. This study created the first groundwater vulnerability map (GVM) for a sub-catchment of the Rio La Venta watershed in Chiapas, Mexico, using an adaptation of the hazard-pathway-target method. This project also conducted the first tracer study in the Rio la Venta watershed to establish connectivity between the catchment and the Rio La Venta Canyon. Finally, this study evaluated the results of the GVM through a sensitivity analysis. Results of the GVM clearly demarcate areas of very high, high, moderate, and low vulnerability within the study area most of which being classified as low vulnerability. The zones of high vulnerability were successfully validated through two dye tracer tests that measured rapid groundwater flow velocities. With the limited resources available to land managers in this area, a problem common in many developing countries, tools that quickly and inexpensively highlight areas that require special protection to help maintain or improve water quality in their watersheds have great utility. Conveying this information to land managers and policymakers can lead to potential changes in current land use practices and allow for the reallocation of resources in support of reducing future negative human-landscape interactions.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				DEC	2017	76	23							797	10.1007/s12665-017-7113-8								WOS:000418850500004

The majority of the population uses groundwater from shallow, rudimentary dug wells and also surface water from the Mapunda River, which crosses the city. The city has very poor systems for collecting domestic sewage and household wastes. The majority of domestic sewage is dumped directly into the Mapunda River or in pit latrines. In this study, the surface water quality and groundwater quality were assessed. In surface water, the low oxygen contents are related to the high temperature (T) in the warm rainy season and with high contents of oxygen-consuming organic pollution and nutrients, as shown by PCA, in both seasons. Anoxic conditions, with negative ORP values (-55.7 mV), are caused by oxygen-consuming organic pollution, added with low flow regime during the dry, cold season. The very low ecological quality of the surface water is also indicated by the high contents of -PO4 and -Cl-t (up to 2.00 and 0.44 mg L-1, respectively). The phosphate contamination is higher in the warm rainy season, due to higher run-off and higher T, as expressed by PCA, both in river water and groundwater. Most groundwater sampling points are contaminated with nitrate (contents up to 132 mg L-1). The pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), alkalinity, -Clt and K, determined in the surface water reflect the anthropic contribution to the river water. The variations in water bulk parameters (T, TDS, alkalinity, ORP, DO) and chemical species are indicative of pollution by diffuse sources (N-species, phosphates). The PCA shows that non-point sources such as the free discharge of household wastewater, intense laundering in the river, agriculture and animal grazing are the main contributors to low water quality, associated with seasonality and low contents of dissolved oxygen due to its consumption by organic matter. The multivariate analysis allows the evaluation of the changes in water quality, in fast-growing cities where the climate has a clear seasonality.

However, performance data for these facilities are generally lacking, particularly at the field scale. This study investigated the runoff quantity regulation and pollutant removal performance of bioswale and rain garden systems from 2014 to 2017. A performance assessment of these facilities demonstrated that anti-seepage rain garden, bioswale-A, and bioswale-B effectively retained inflow volumes by the filter media, reducing runoff volumes by 54.08, 98.25, and 77.65%, respectively, on average, with only two events of overflowing. According to the water quality data in 24 rainfall events, the main pollutant indexes for the new city include total nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand, and the median values for their respective effluent event median concentrations were 1.29 and 40.13 mg/L for anti-seepage rain garden and 1.68 and 74.00 mg/L for bioswale-B systems. The mean values of pollutant removal of the three bioretention systems, except for infiltration rain garden, were 39.8-59.73% (median = 54.32%), 61.06-72.66% (median = 73.47%), and 76.67%-88.16% (median = 80.64%). Meanwhile, outflow volume of water was found to be most influenced by inflow volumes for the bioswales and anti-seepage rain garden. Mass removals were higher than concentrations owing to water volume attenuation. Based on the data of monitored pollution loads, this study estimated the annual pollutant load removal as 75.45 and 90.7% for anti-seepage rain garden and bioswale-B according to the percent of monitoring rainfall depth in total annual precipitation. This study also established the target pollutant service life model on the basis of accumulated annual load and media adsorption capacity. The results of this study will contribute to a greater understanding of the treatment performance of bioretention systems, assisting in the design, operation, and maintenance of them.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				DEC	2017	228	12							468	10.1007/s11270-017-3636-6								WOS:000419533000005

Tracking the Limnoecological History of Lake Hiidenvesi (Southern Finland) Using the Paleolimnological Approach	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												We examined a sediment record from Lake Hiidenvesi in southern Finland using paleolimnological methods to trace its limnoecological history. In our record, beginning from the 1940s, chironomid (Diptera) assemblages shifted from typical boreal taxa towards mesotrophic community assemblages at similar to 1960-1980 CE being finally replaced by eutrophic taxa from the 1990s onward. The diatom (Bacillariophyceae) assemblages reflected relatively nutrient rich conditions throughout the record showing a further increase in eutrophic taxa from the 1970s onward. A chironomid-based reconstruction of late-winter hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen (DO) conditions suggested anoxic conditions already in the 1950s, probably reflecting increased inlake production due to allochthonous nutrient inputs and related increase in biological oxygen consumption. However, the reconstruction also indicated large variability in long-term oxygen conditions that appear typical for the basin. With regard to nutrient status, chironomid- and diatom-based reconstructions of total phosphorus (TP) showed a similar trend throughout the record, although, chironomids indicated a more straightforward eutrophication process in the benthic habitat and seemed to reflect the intensified human activities in the catchment more strongly than diatoms. The DO and TP reconstructions were mostly similar in trends compared to the measured data available since the 1970s/1980s. However, the increase in TP during the most recent years in both reconstructions was not visible in the monitored data. The results of our multiproxy study emphasize the significance of including both epilimnetic and hypolimnetic systems in water quality assessments and provide important long-term limnoecological information that will be useful in the future when setting targets for restoration.

To date, few numerical models are able to simulate hydrological processes at catchment scale at a reasonable time scale to describe flash events with accurate details. Considering a similar to 810 km(2) Mediterranean river coastal basin (southwestern France) as a study case, the objective of the present study was to assess the ability of the sub-daily module of the lumped Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to simulate discharge (1) time-continuously, by testing two sub-basin delineation schemes, two catchment sizes, and two output time-steps; and (2) at flood time-scale, by comparing the performances of SWAT to the performances of the event-based fully distributed MARINE model when simulating flash flood events. We showed that there was no benefit of decreasing the size of the minimum drainage area (e.g., from similar to 15 km(2) down to similar to 1 km(2)) when delineating sub-basins in SWAT. We also showed that both the MARINE and SWAT models were equally able to reproduce peak discharge, flood timing and volume, and that they were both limited by rainfall and soil data. Hence, the SWAT model appears to be a reliable modelling tool to predict discharge over long periods of time in large flash-flood-prone basins.				sauvage, sabine/P-1742-2015	sauvage, sabine/0000-0002-6360-1036; Roux, Helene/0000-0001-7076-5015; Boithias, Laurie/0000-0003-3414-7329												2073-4441					DEC	2017	9	12							929	10.3390/w9120929								WOS:000419225500024

This reservoir controls the high part of Capibaribe river basin, area affected several actions that can compromise the reservoir water quality such as disposal of domestic sewage, industrial wastewater and agriculture with use of fertilizers. This study aimed to identify the factors that lead to water quality of the Jucazinho reservoir using a database containing information of nine years of reservoir water quality monitoring in line with a multivariate statistical technique known as Principal Component Analysis (PCA). To use this technique, it was selected two components which determine the quality of the reservoir water. The first principal component, ranging from an annual basis, explained the relationship between the development of cyanobacteria, the concentration of dissolved solids and electrical conductivity, comparing it with the variation in the dam volume, total phosphorus levels and turbidity. The second principal component, ranging from a mensal basis, explained the photosynthetic activity performed by cyanobacteria confronting with the variation in the dam volume. It observed the relationship between water quality parameters with rainfall, featuring an annual and seasonal pattern that can be used as reference to behaviour studies of this reservoir.																	2073-4441					DEC	2017	9	12							955	10.3390/w9120955								WOS:000419225500049

More specifically, this work is comprised of: (i) analysis of Chl-a and trophic dynamics; (ii) characterization of CDOM; (iii) estimation of Chl-a and CDOM from OLI/Landsat-8 and RapidEye imagery. The monitoring lasted 20 months within a multi-year drought, which contributed to water-quality deterioration. Chl-a and trophic state analysis showed a highly eutrophic status for the perennial reservoir during the entire study period, while the non-perennial reservoirs ranged from oligotrophic to eutrophic, with changes associated with the first events of the rainy season. CDOM characterization suggests that the perennial reservoir is mostly influenced by autochthonous sources, while allochthonous sources dominate the non-perennial ones. Spectral-group classification assigned the perennial reservoir as a CDOM-moderate and highly eutrophic reservoir, whereas the non-perennial ones were assigned as CDOM-rich and oligotrophic-dystrophic reservoirs. The remote sensing initiative was partially successful: the Chl-a was best modelled using RapidEye for the perennial one; whereas CDOM performed best with Landsat-8 for non-perennial reservoirs. This investigation showed potential for retrieving water quality parameters in dry areas with small reservoirs.				de Araujo, Jose Carlos/J-9629-2012; Foerster, Saskia/D-3881-2011	de Araujo, Jose Carlos/0000-0002-2649-151X; Foerster, Saskia/0000-0001-7752-7394												2073-4441					DEC	2017	9	12							913	10.3390/w9120913								WOS:000419225500008

Quantifying Effectiveness of Streambank Stabilization Practices on Cedar River, Nebraska	WATER												Excessive sediment is a major pollutant to surface waters worldwide. In some watersheds, streambanks are a significant source of this sediment, leading to the expenditure of billions of dollars in stabilization projects. Although costly streambank stabilization projects have been implemented worldwide, long-term monitoring to quantify their success is lacking. There is a critical need to document the long-term success of streambank restoration projects. The objectives of this research were to (1) quantify streambank retreat before and after the stabilization of 18 streambanks on the Cedar River in North Central Nebraska, USA; (2) assess the impact of a large flood event; and (3) determine the most cost-efficient stabilization practice. The stabilized streambanks included jetties (10), rock-toe protection (1), slope reduction/gravel bank (1), a retaining wall (1), rock vanes (2), and tree revetments (3). Streambank retreat and accumulation were quantified using aerial images from 1993 to 2016. Though streambank retreat has been significant throughout the study period, a breached dam in 2010 caused major flooding and streambank erosion on the Cedar River. This large-scale flood enabled us to quantify the effect of one extreme event and evaluate the effectiveness of the stabilized streambanks. With a 70% success rate, jetties were the most cost-efficient practice and yielded the most deposition. If minimal risk is unacceptable, a more costly yet immobile practice such as a gravel bank or retaining wall is recommended.																	2073-4441					DEC	2017	9	12							930	10.3390/w9120930								WOS:000419225500025						
J	Dinka, MO				Dinka, Megersa Olumana			Delineating the Drainage Structure and Sources of Groundwater Flux for Lake Basaka, Central Rift Valley Region of Ethiopia	WATER												As opposed to most of the other closed basin type rift valley lakes in Ethiopia, Lake Basaka is found to be expanding at an alarming rate. Different studies indicated that the expansion of the lake is challenging the socio-economics and environment of the region significantly. This study result and previous reports indicated that the lake's expansion is mostly due to the increased groundwater (GW) flux to the lake. GW flux accounts for about 56% of the total inflow in recent periods (post 2000) and is found to be the dominant factor for the hydrodynamics and existence of the lake. The analysis of the drainage network for the area indicates the existence of a huge recharge area on the western and upstream side of the catchment. This catchment has no surface outlet; hence most of the incoming surface runoff recharges the GW system. The recharge area is the main source of GW flux to the lake. In addition to this, the likely sources/causes of GW flux to the lake could be: (i) an increase of GW recharge following the establishment of irrigation schemes in the region; (ii) subsurface inflow from far away due to rift system influence, and (iii) lake neotectonism. Overall, the lake's expansion has damaging effect to the region, owing to its poor water quality; hence the identification of the real causes of GW flux and mitigation measures are very important for sustainable lake management. Therefore a comprehensive and detailed investigation of the parameters related to GW flux and the interaction of the lake with the GW system of the area is highly recommended.																	2073-4441					DEC	2017	9	12							797	10.3390/w9120797								WOS:000419225500001

Impact of Spatiotemporal Characteristics of Rainfall Inputs on Integrated Catchment Dissolved Oxygen Simulations	WATER												Integrated Catchment Modelling aims to simulate jointly urban drainage systems, wastewater treatment plant and rivers. The effect of rainfall input uncertainties in the modelling of individual urban drainage systems has been discussed in several studies already. However, this influence changes when simultaneously simulating several urban drainage subsystems and their impact on receiving water quality. This study investigates the effect of the characteristics of rainfall inputs on a large-scale integrated catchment simulator for dissolved oxygen predictions in the River Dommel (The Netherlands). Rainfall products were generated with varying time-aggregation (10, 30 and 60 min) deriving from different sources of data with increasing spatial information: (1) Homogeneous rainfall from a single rain gauge; (2) block kriging from 13 rain gauges; (3) averaged C-Band radar estimation and (4) kriging with external drift combining radar and rain gauge data with change of spatial support. The influence of the different rainfall inputs was observed at combined sewer overflows (CSO) and dissolved oxygen (DO) dynamics in the river. Comparison of the simulations with river monitoring data showed a low sensitivity to temporal aggregation of rainfall inputs and a relevant impact of the spatial scale with a link to the storm characteristics to CSO and DO concentration in the receiving water.

J	Rahman, A				Rahman, Ataur			Recent Advances in Modelling and Implementation of Rainwater Harvesting Systems towards Sustainable Development	WATER												Rainwater harvesting (RWH) is perhaps the most ancient practice to meet water supply needs. It has received renewed attention since the 1970s as a productive water source, water savings and conservation means, and sustainable development tool. In RWH, it is important to know how much water can be harvested at a given location from a given catchment size, whether the harvested water meets the intended water quality, whether the RWH system is economically viable and whether the state regulations favor the RWH. Furthermore, the selected RWH system should be suitable to local rainfall and field conditions, downstream impacts, and socio-economic and cultural characteristics. In this regard, this paper provides an overview of the special issue on Rainwater Harvesting: Quantity, Quality, Economics and State Regulations. The selected papers cover a wide range of issues that are relevant to RWH such as regionalization of design curves, use of spatial technology, urban agriculture, arid-region water supply, multi criteria analysis and application of artificial neural networks.																	2073-4441					DEC	2017	9	12							959	10.3390/w9120959								WOS:000419225500053

However, studies on the response of mixed algal cultures and associated water quality parameters to ultrasound are limited. In this lab-scale sonication, the removal of cyanobacteria at a pre-set frequency of 200 kHz on mixed algae suspensions collected from a eutrophic lake was investigated. The caution (17.5 mu g/L) and outbreak (1450 mu g/L) alert levels in terms of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations of the initial samples were each sonicated for 10, 15, and 20 min, and then kept in an incubator. Fifteen minutes of sonication resulted in best removal efficiency of 0.94 and 0.77, at an ultrasonic dose of 30 kWh/m(3) at the outbreak and caution level concentrations, respectively. Immediately after 15 min sonication, and after standing in the incubator for a day, chlorophyll-a removal efficiencies of 0.28 and 0.90 were achieved in the outbreak level, respectively, and the matching removal efficiencies for the caution level were 0.23 and 0.64. Even though the removal was substantial in both cases, the final 147 mu g/L chlorophyll-a concentration of the outbreak, which is itself still in the outbreak level range, shows that ultrasonication is not effective to satisfactorily remove algae from a concentrated suspension. Total dissolved nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand were reduced, overall, due to sonication. However, total dissolved phosphorus of the concentrated level was increased during the treatment. Although sonication needs further replicated experimental testing in whole-lake systems, our results show that 200 kHz sonication was able to reduce chlorophyll-a concentrations in small-scale laboratory tests.																	2073-4441					DEC	2017	9	12							915	10.3390/w9120915								WOS:000419225500010

Despite intensive research on possible hydrological responses in those regions to a warmer environment, our knowledge on erosion and sediment yield induced by the climate change in high-latitude headwaters is still limited. In this study, we estimated suspended sediment yields from 2021 to 2050 in a typical headwater area of far Northeast China to elucidate potential impacts of future climate change on surface runoff and erosion in higher latitude regions. We first parameterized the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) using historical measurements to estimate runoff from the river basin. The model performed well in both the calibration (2006-2011) and the validation (2012-2014) periods, with an R-2 of 0.85 and 0.88 and a Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of 0.7 and 0.73, respectively. We also utilized historical measurements on sediment yields from the period 2006-2014 to develop a runoff-sediment yield rating curve, and the rating curve obtained an excellent goodness of fit (R-2 = 0.91, p < 0.001). We then applied the calibrated SWAT model to two climate change projections, also known as Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), for the period from 2021 to 2050 to obtain future runoff estimates. These runoff estimates were then used to predict future sediment yield by using the developed runoff-sediment yield rating curve. Our study found a significant increase of annual sediment yield (p < 0.05) for both climate change projections (RCP4.5 = 237%; RCP8.5 = 133%) in this, China's high-latitude region. The increases of sediment yield were prevalent in summer and autumn, varying from 102-299% between the two RCPs scenarios. Precipitation was the dominated factor that determined the variation of runoff and sediment yield. A warming climate could bring more snowmelt-induced spring runoff and longer rainy days in autumn, hence leading to higher erosion. These findings demonstrate that under the changing climate, soils in this high-latitude headwater area would be eroded twice to three times that of the baseline period (1981-2010), indicating a potential risk to the downstream water quality and reservoir management.

Accordingly, the monitoring of the groundwater quality based on different tools and methods becomes a necessity. The aim of this study was to apply several approaches to assess the water quality and to define the main hydrochemical process which affect groundwater of the Maritime Djeffara shallow aquifer. In addition to the hydrochemical approach, two multivariate statistical analyses, hierarchical clusters analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA), were carried out to identify the natural and the anthropogenic processes affecting groundwater chemistry. Hydrochemical approach, based on 47 analyzed groundwater samples, shows that most of samples present a sulfate to mixed chloride, with sodi-potassic tendency facies. According to their chemically composition, the HCA revealed three different groups (C1, C2 and C3) according to their electrical conductivity (EC) values: C1 (average EC = 4500 mu S/cm), C2 (average EC = 7040 mu S/cm) and C3 (average EC = 9767 mu S/cm). Furthermore, PCA results show two principal factors account 84.05% of the total variance: (1) F1 represents the natural component, and (2) F2 symbolizes the anthropic component. Moreover, the groundwater quality map of the Maritime Djeffara shows three categories: suitable, doubtful and unsuitable water for irrigation. These different results should be taken to protect water resources in arid and semiarid regions, especially at the alluvial coastal regions. Also, they help to make a suitable planning to manage and protect the groundwater resources.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				DEC	2017	76	24							821	10.1007/s12665-017-7168-6								WOS:000418851700018

Combined hydrochemical, isotopic, and multivariate statistics techniques to assess the effects of discharges from a uranium mine on water quality in neighboring streams	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The Caldas Uranium Mine (CUM), located on the Pocos de Caldas Plateau in the southeastern region of Brazil, is presently undergoing a decommissioning process. The aim of the present investigation is to identify and characterize the effects of acid mine drainage (AMD) originating from the CUM on surface water quality. To achieve these aims, sampling stations were located at two AMD sources: the retention pond at the foot of waste rock pile#4 (WRP#4) and the settling pond that receives effluents from the tailings dam (TD). Ten additional sampling stations were located along watercourses in the vicinity, both downstream and upstream of the mine. Sampling was performed during the rainy and dry seasons in 2010 and 2011. The water analysis detected significant changes in pH, electrical conductivity, F-, Cd, U, Zn, Al, Mn, As, Ca, -SO4 2-, Pb, U-238, Ra-226, Pb-210, Th-232, Ra-228, and Mo in waters downstream of both pond discharge sites. It was demonstrated that the disequilibrium between Ra-226 and U-238 can be used to trace the extent of AMD impacts in nearby streams. Variations in O-18 and H-2 enabled the flow of mining-impacted water to be traced from the ponds to nearby streams. Multivariate analysis yielded a three-factor model: Factor 1 was interpreted as being associated with AMD (from WRP# 4) and Factor 2 with a Ca-Mo relationship associated with the chemical constitution of the ore and with the treatment of tailings wastes in the area (from TD); Factor 3 was interpreted as being associated with the natural influence of geogenic processes on water quality in the area. The results of this study provide a scientific basis for recommending appropriate remedial actions during mine decommissioning.

J	de Souza, MM; Gastaldini, MDC; Pivetta, GG				de Souza, Marielle Medeiros; Cauduro Gastaldini, Maria do Carmo; Pivetta, Glaucia Ghesti			Nonpoint pollution load in river catchments with different anthropic impacts: a case study in Southern Brazil	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Diffuse or nonpoint source (NPS) pollution results in different pollutant concentrations, which depend on river catchments, land use and precipitation events and may vary along a single event. This study aimed to assess NPS pollution loads of organic matter, nutrients, bacteria and heavy metals in four river catchments associated with different types of land use in Southern Brazil. Cluster analysis was used to identify similarities between basins and main component analysis (PCA) to identify the main variables that characterize diffuse pollution in each basin. The use and occupation of the soil were determinant in the formation of the clusters. The basins with rural characteristics formed one group, whereas the basin with urban characteristic generated another group. PCA suggests that changes in the water quality of the catchments in this study can be explained by organic pollutants and farming activities. The Rancho do Amaral catchment, with 55.8% of native forest, displayed the lowest NPS pollution load for all tested parameters. The Alto da Colina catchment, with the largest urban area and largest agricultural land use (50%), showed the highest NPS for all variables in the study, even though it has the smallest area. The differences in pollutant loads can be attributed to the intense degradation processes associated with anthropic activities, such as urbanization, agricultural activity and the discharge of effluents, which are different for each catchment.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				DEC	2017	76	24							833	10.1007/s12665-017-7111-x								WOS:000418851700005						
J	Reisch, CE				Reisch, Chad E.			Potential use of low-cost data loggers for groundwater temperature in a regulatory program for public water supply: impact of measurement frequency at a karst spring	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												A simple low-cost procedure for data collection and evaluation was developed to investigate the utility of continuous data loggers and the impact of measurement frequency on a water-quality monitoring method for use in a regulatory program for public water supply and groundwater under the direct influence of surface water (GWUDI). Data loggers were utilized to continuously measure groundwater temperature, descriptive statistics and the coefficient of variation to demonstrate rapid and significant variations. Temperature data were collected from a karst spring located in the Great Valley section of Pennsylvania and reported on daily and 15-min measurement frequencies. In response to five summer rain events, thermographs constructed with the 15-min measurements indicated rapid large-magnitude temperature variations. The average magnitude of change across the five events was 5.3 degrees C, but the shifts operated on quick timescales; thus, variations were not captured when data were reported on the daily frequency. This resulted in a distorted evaluation on how significant the groundwater temperature variations were, because results were dependent on measurement frequency. The average coefficient of variation percentage for the 15-min datasets was 12%, compared to 3% for the dataset of daily measurements. These findings could have important implications to a public water-supply regulatory program, because the regulatory definition for GWUDI includes those groundwater sources that display rapid and significant variations in water quality. Without high-frequency measurements, one alarming result could be that GWUDI sources, particularly those located in fast-acting hydrogeologic settings, are misevaluated when maximum or minimum water-quality variations are not included in the evaluation. Advancement in science and technology has resulted in data loggers for groundwater temperature that are economical, robust, and easy to install. Thus, their application in regulatory programs should no longer be underutilized, especially in karst spring settings where source construction deficiencies and focused recharge features can result in rain-induced rapid infiltration and waterquality variations on the minute-to-hour timescale.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				DEC	2017	76	24							813	10.1007/s12665-017-7164-x								WOS:000418851700014						
J	Gurevin, C; Erturk, A; Albay, M				Gurevin, Cenk; Erturk, Ali; Albay, Meric			Predicting the effects of sediment based internal nutrient loads on eutrophication in Kucukcekmece Lagoon for rehabilitation planning	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEDIMENT RESEARCH												In deep stratified coastal lagoons, hypoxic waters that result from phytoplankton decomposition in the stratified bottom waters are often associated with eutrophication. Decomposing biomass reaches the bottom sediments and enriches them with nutrients and organic matter. Nutrients trapped in sediments are released with time and promote excessive phytoplankton growth in the surface water. Because eutrophication in lentic ecosystems progresses in a self-fuelling cycle, outflow is the only available process for exporting excess nutrients to recover from eutrophication. Thus, rehabilitation of eutrophic coastal lagoons that have limited seawater interactions is a long term process. The importance of nutrient release from sediments on eutrophication and the delay effect of internal nutrient loading on the rehabilitation of a eutrophic coastal lagoon with limited seawater exchange were analysed in this study. An ecological model that couples the water column and the sediment diagenesis processes, was developed for water quality management purposes. Our findings indicate that the recovery of the Lagoon from eutrophication will be taken decades even in the absence of external nutrient loading. Therefore, we suggest applying rehabilitation strategies that control the nutrient fluxes from sediments for a faster recovery from heavily eutrophic conditions. Land-based nutrient sources must also be controlled because they feed water column and the bottom sediments with nutrients.

J	Cavus, I; Kalin, L; Kara, F				Cavus, Ilkim; Kalin, Latif; Kara, Ferhat			Impacts of urban headwater disturbances on downstream sediment loading where streamside management zones for forest harvesting activities are present downstream	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEDIMENT RESEARCH												Watershed disturbances caused by land use/land cover (LU/LC) change, intensive forestry practices, and other forms of watershed disturbance are known to negatively affect water quality, if best management practices (BMPs) are not present. Disturbances near or around headwaters where BMPs are absent or are inadequate may impact downstream water quality and stream ecology regardless of the presence of downstream BMPs. In this study, the recovery of two small forest-dominated watersheds (W-w and E-w) in Auburn, Alabama, USA, was monitored 6-years after a partial clearcut was done. The streamside management zone (SMZ) in W-w was also partially harvested shortly after the partial clearcut to improve its sediment trapping effectiveness over the long-term. The hydrology and sediment transport in these watersheds were expected to stabilize over this period, however, new disturbances in the headwaters of both watersheds changed the watershed dynamics. Streamflow and sediment load were examined over a 15-month period from February 2014 to May 2015. The clearcut in W-w and E-,(w) and the partially harvested SMZ in W-w seemed to have recovered; however, substantial amount of sediment load were measured across all monitoring sites in both watersheds as a result of upstream disturbances. This study emphasizes the necessity of watershed management as a whole, and the importance of BMP applications within the entire watershed. It also highlights the fact that watershed management and BMP implementation is a dynamic process, thus, strategies and techniques need to be continuously adapted in response to environmental changes.

Hydro-sedimentary Dynamics of a Drained Agricultural Headwater Catchment: A Nested Monitoring Approach	VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL												Soil erosion and sediment transfer are extensive in lowland agricultural catchments. In these environments, high-frequency datasets of both water discharge and suspended sediment concentrations are often lacking. In particular, the impact of tile drainage networks on sediment fluxes in these catchments is poorly understood. Our research quantified sediment fluxes between 2013 and 2016 at five nested stations including a tile drain outlet across a small (25-km(2)) agricultural catchment (located in the Loire River basin, France) representative of lowland cultivated environments of the middle part of this basin. Sediment fluxes varied from 1 to 38 t km(-2) yr(-1) across the monitored subcatchments. Most of sediment fluxes (79 +/- 9%) were measured during flood events (n = 44), mostly occurring in winter (75%) and spring (20%). Seasonality controlled most of the variations of sediment fluxes. Sediment transfers in tile drains occurred episodically. Flows were measured during 11.4% of the monitoring time. A mean time lag of 80 min was recorded between the peak discharge at the drain outlet and the downstream river station. At the event scale, sediment fluxes exported from the tile drain varied between 1.1 x 10(-4) and 2.5 t km(-2) and remained of the same order of magnitude as those measured at the downstream river station, although the latter were on average 53% lower. Results suggest significant storage of sediment material in the river channel and its export during the most intense flood events. Our research emphasizes the need for continuous monitoring of water and sediment transfers in agricultural catchments equipped with tile drains.																	1539-1663					DEC	2017	16	12								10.2136/vzj2017.05.0113								WOS:000418354300006

Review: Sediment-Related Controls on the Health of the Great Barrier Reef	VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL												Linking terrestrial soil erosion to the degradation of marine ecosystems relies on a long chain of evidence. Here, this chain of evidence is reviewed for Australia's Great Barrier Reef and its catchments. Excessive sediment delivery to the marine environment is one component of an interlinked group of stressors that include coral bleaching, damage by storms, and plagues of crown-of-thorns starfish. Sediment and the pollutants they carry are one of the drivers of marine ecosystem decline and adversely impact recovery following disturbance by other stressors. Significantly, a portion of the N species carried by fine sediment in the freshwater system is released in the marine environment, thereby perturbing marine ecology. Available controls on sediment and pollutant delivery are hillslope erosion rates, gully and streambank erosion rates, sediment deposition rates in sediment sinks including footslopes, floodplains, and water reservoirs, and the application rates of pesticides and fertilizers. By reducing sediment fluxes through the combined strategies of erosion control and deposition enhancement, near- and offshore impacts can be reduced. Gully and streambank erosion are more significant sources of fine sediment than hillslope erosion. Fertilizer and non-fertilizer N and pesticides carried by sediment play an important role in coral reef degradation. A graphic summary of the spatial configuration the sources and sinks is provided to guide the prioritization of interventions. The scale of intervention required to achieve the desired marine outcome is so large that a combined voluntary and regulatory approach is needed.																	1539-1663					DEC	2017	16	12								10.2136/vzj2017.05.0115								WOS:000418354300002

Spatial and Temporal Variation of Water Quality in the Bertam Catchment, Cameron Highlands, Malaysia	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												The spatio-temporal variability of water quality associated with anthropogenic activities was studied for the Bertam River and its main tributaries within the Bertam Catchment, Cameron Highlands, Malaysia. A number of physico-chemical parameters of collected samples were analyzed to evaluate their spatio-temporal variability. Nonparametric statistical analysis showed significant temporal and spatial differences (p<0.05) in most of the parameters across the catchment. Parameters except dissolved oxygen and chemical oxygen demand displayed higher values in rainy season. The higher concentration of total suspended solids was caused by massive soil erosion and sedimentation. Seasonal variations in contaminant concentrations are largely affected by precipitation and anthropogenic influences. Untreated domestic wastewater discharge as well as agricultural runoff significantly influenced the water quality. Poor agricultural practices and development activities at slope areas also affected the water quality within the catchment. The analytical results provided a basis for protection of river environments and ecological restoration in mountainous Bertam Catchment.																	1061-4303	1554-7531				DEC 1	2017	89	12					2088	2102		10.2175/106143017X14839994522740								WOS:000418398800004	28087920					
J	Humphrey, CP; Iverson, G; O'Driscoll, M				Humphrey, Charles P., Jr.; Iverson, Guy; O'Driscoll, Michael			Nitrogen Treatment Efficiency of a Large Onsite Wastewater System in Relation to Water Table Dynamics	CLEAN-SOIL AIR WATER												The objective of this study is to determine if the nitrogen treatment efficiency of a large onsite wastewater system (OSW) in the coastal plain of North Carolina is influenced by changes in the elevation of the water table. Groundwater readings including depth to water, pH, temperature, specific conductance, and dissolved oxygen are recorded eight times over a 15-month period (May 2013-August 2014) encompassing typically "wet" (two sampling events) and "dry" (three sampling events) seasons, and a water table fluctuation of 1.7 m. Groundwater from piezometers (n = 7) near the OSW and septic tank effluent samples are collected for analyses of total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) during each field visit to determine if the TDN treatment efficiency is influenced by the water table elevation. The treatment efficiency of the OSW is directly correlated with wastewater strength (r = 0.882; p = 0.004) and inversely correlated to water table elevation (r = -0.754; p = 0.031). The TDN treatment efficiency at this site decreases with increases in water table elevation, and groundwater TDN concentrations beneath the OSW are typically higher when wastewater concentrations of TDN are higher. Sea level rise and climate change are projected to increase groundwater levels and therefore may have negative effects on water quality adjacent to OSW. Ensuring that OSW are installed with the maximum practical vertical separation to groundwater and setback distances to surface waters, designed with long trenches and oriented perpendicular to the dominant groundwater flow direction will help to maximize TDN treatment.																	1863-0650	1863-0669				DEC	2017	45	12							1700551	10.1002/clen.201700551								WOS:000417491100004

Conceptual modelling of E. coli in urban stormwater drains, creeks and rivers	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Accurate estimation of faecal microorganism levels in water systems, such as stormwater drains, creeks and rivers, is needed for appropriate assessment of impacts on receiving water bodies and the risks to human health. The underlying hypothesis for this work is that a single conceptual model (the MicroOrganism Prediction in Urban Stormwater model-i.e. MOPUS) can adequately simulate microbial dynamics over a variety of water systems and wide range of scales; something which has not been previously tested. Additionally, the application of radar precipitation data for improvement of the model performance at these scales via more accurate areal averaged rainfall intensities was tested. Six comprehensive Escherichia coli (E. coli) datasets collected from five catchments in south-eastern Australia and one catchment in Raleigh, USA, were used to calibrate the model. The MOPUS rainfall runoff model performed well at all scales (Nash-Sutcliffe E for instantaneous flow rates between 0.70 and 0.93). Sensitivity analysis showed that wet weather urban stormwater flows can be modelled with only three of the five rainfall runoff model parameters: routing coefficient (K), effective imperviousness (IMP) and time of concentration (TOC). The model's performance for representing instantaneous E. coli fluctuations ranged from 0.17 to 0.45 in catchments drained via pipe or open creek, and was the highest for a large riverine catchment (0.64); performing similarly, if not better, than other microbial models in literature. The model could also capture the variability in event mean concentrations (E = 0.17-0.57) and event loads (E = 0.32-0.97) at all scales. Application of weather radar-derived rainfall inputs caused lower overall performance compared to using gauged rainfall inputs in representing both flow and E. coli levels in urban drain catchments, with the performance improving with increasing catchment size and being comparable to the models that use gauged rainfall inputs at the large riverine catchment. These results demonstrate the potential of the MOPUS model and its ability to be applied to a wide range of catchment scales, including large riverine systems.

J	Nukazawa, K; Kihara, K; Suzuki, Y				Nukazawa, Kei; Kihara, Kousuke; Suzuki, Yoshihiro			Negligible contribution of reservoir dams to organic and inorganic transport in the lower Mimi River, Japan	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Rivers fulfill an essential ecological role by forming networks for material transport from upland forests to coastal areas. The way in which dams affect the organic and inorganic cycles in such systems is not well understood. Herein, we investigated the longitudinal profiles of the various components of the water chemistry across three cascade dams in Japan: the Yamasubaru Dam, Saigou Dam, and Ohuchibaru Dam, which are situated along the sediment-productive Mimi River in different flow conditions. We analyzed the following water quality components: suspended solids (SS), turbidity, total iron (TFe), dissolved iron (DFe), total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), humic substance (HS), and major ionic components (Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cl-, NO3-, and SO42-) in the downstream channels of the three dams during the low-intermediate-flow and high-flow events from 2012 to 2014. We estimated hourly loads of each component using hourly turbidity data and discharge data (i.e., L-Q model) separately, and the results are integrated to estimate the annual fluxes. The annual fluxes between the methods were compared to verify predictability of the conventional L-Q models. Annual flux of TOC, TN, DFe, and HS estimated by the turbidity displayed similar values, whereas the flux of SS, TFe, and TP tended to increase downstream of the dams. Among the dams, estimated flux proportions for TP and TFe were higher during high-flow events (74%-94%). Considering geographic conditions (e.g., absence of major tributary between the dams), the result implies that accumulated TP and TFe in the reservoirs may be flushed and transported downstream with SS over the short height dams during flood events. Assuming this process, the reservoir dams probably make only a fractional contribution to the organic and inorganic transport in the catchment studied. The percent flux errors for SS, TFe, and TP fluxes ranged from -7.2% to -97% (except for the TP flux in 2013), which highlights the risk of underestimating these components when using an L-Q model.

Vadose zone processes delay groundwater nitrate reduction response to BMP implementation as observed in paired cultivated vs. uncultivated potato rotation fields	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Nitrate leaching from crop production contributes to groundwater contamination and subsequent eutrophication of the receiving surface water. A study was conducted in a 7-ha potato-grain-forages rotation field in Prince Edward Island (PEI), Canada during 2011-2016 to link potato rotation practices and groundwater quality. The field consists of fine sandy loam soil and is underlain by 7-9 m of glacial till, which overlies the regional fractured "red-bed" sandstone aquifer. The water table is generally located in overburden close to the bedrock interface. Field treatments included one field zone taken out of production in 2011 with the remaining zones kept under a conventional potato rotation. Agronomy data including crop tissue, soil, and tile-drain water quality were collected. Hydrogeology data including multilevel monitoring of groundwater nitrate and hydraulic head and data from rock coring for nitrate distribution in overburden and bedrock matrix were also collected. A significant amount of nitrate leached below the soil profile after potato plant kill (referred to as topkill) in 2011, most of it from fertilizer N. A high level of nitrate was also detected in the till vadose zone through coring in December 2012 and through multilevel groundwater sampling from January to May 2014 in both cultivated and uncultivated field zones. Groundwater nitrate concentrations increased for about 2.5 years after the overlying potato field was removed from production. Pressure-driven uniform flow processes dominate water and nitrate transport in the vadose zone, producing an apparently instant water table response but a delayed groundwater quality response to nitrate leaching events. These data suggest that the uniform flow dominated vadose zone in agricultural landscapes can cause the accumulation of a significant amount of nitrate originated from previous farming activities, and the long travel time of this legacy nitrate in the vadose zone can result in substantially delayed responses of groundwater quality to field management adjustments. The delayed effects should also apply to the transport of other contaminants. This study also suggests that management practices should be optimized to reduce soil nitrate build-up during the non-growing season (when plant N uptake is diminishing and the soil contains excessive moisture, for example, after the potato harvest period in PEI) in order to protect groundwater quality.

However, the factors behind increased hypolimnetic anoxia in lakes and reservoirs are often diverse and may involve processes at different spatial and temporal scales. Here, we evaluate the combined effects of different anthropogenic pressures on the oxygen dynamics and water chemistry of Lake Enol, an emblematic mountain lake in Picas de Europa National Park (NW Spain). A multidisciplinary study conducted over a period of four years (2013-2016) indicates that the extent and duration of hypolimnetic anoxia has increased dramatically in recent years. The extent and duration of hypolimnetic anoxia is typical of meso-eutrophic systems, in contrast with the internal productivity of the lake, which remains oligo-mesotrophic and phosphorus-limited. This apparent contradiction is ascribed to the combination of different external pressures in the catchment, which have increased the input of allochthonous organic matter in recent times through enhanced erosion and sediment transport. The most important among these pressures appears to be cattle grazing, which affects not only the import of carbon and nutrients, but also the lake microbiology. The contribution of clear-cutting, runoff channelling, and tourism is comparatively less significant. The cumulative effects of these local human impacts are not only affecting the lake metabolism, but also the import of sulfate, nitrate- and ammonium-nitrogen, and metals (Zn). However, these local factors alone cannot explain entirely the observed oxygen deficit. Climatic factors (e.g., warmer and drier spring and autumn seasons) are also reducing oxygen levels in deep waters through a longer and increasingly steep thermal stratification. Global warming may indirectly increase anoxia in many other mountain lakes in the near future. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Due to the strong and size-dependent adsorption capability of soil particles to radio-nuclides, a better understanding of erosion and transport of soil particles and identification of erosion prone areas within watersheds are significant for contaminant management. For this purpose, we simulated soil erosion and transport in a partially forested catchment for multiple particle size classes. Critical erosion areas were identified by the spatial distribution of net soil erosion. Comparisons between simulated and measured suspended solids concentration at multiple locations throughout the catchment demonstrated successful model performance. For the period Mar. 12, 2011 through Dec. 31, 2014, model results indicated that 5500 tonnes of clay, 52000 tonnes of silt, and 22000 tonnes of sand are transported from the catchment. The results showed that soil erosion in the middle part of the catchment is greater mainly because of steep slopes and large fraction of agricultural lands. These simulations suggest that soil decontamination of erosion-prone agricultural lands in the mid- catchment areas would be effective in reducing radiocesium migration with soil particles.																	1570-6443	1876-4444				DEC	2017	17						18	29		10.1016/j.jher.2017.09.003								WOS:000418105600003

The scale problem in tackling diffuse water pollution from agriculture: Insights from the Avon Demonstration Test Catchment programme in England	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS					National Meeting of the British-Hydrological-Society (BHS)	JUL, 2016	Loughborough Univ, Loughborough, ENGLAND	British Hydrol Soc	Loughborough Univ			Mitigation of diffuse water pollution from agriculture is of concern in the United Kingdom, so that freshwater quality can be improved in line with environmental objectives. Targeted on-farm mitigation is necessary for controlling sources of pollution to rivers; a positive impact must also be delivered at the subcatchment and catchment scales before good ecological status can be achieved. A farm on the River Sem in the Hampshire Avon Demonstration Test Catchment was selected for monitoring due to its degraded farmyard, track, and drainage ditch, which was targeted by the Demonstration Test Catchment programme for improvement using a treatment train of interventions. The river was monitored before and after, upstream and downstream, of the potential sources of pollution and subsequent mitigation, both locally at farm scale, and downstream at the subcatchment scale. Sediment was obtained from the riverbed using a conventional disturbance technique, and source samples were collected from across the subcatchment. Samples were analysed for geochemistry, mineral magnetism, and environmental radionuclide activity using the <63-m fraction, before sediment source fingerprinting was conducted to apportion sources. Source tracing revealed that, although the degraded farm track was experiencing channelized flow and erosion in the pre-mitigation period, it was not a major sediment source even at farm scale. Repeat source apportionment during the pre- and post-mitigation periods showed that the targeted treatment train did not result in statistically significant decreases in predicted contributions from the farm track sources at either scale. Sediment sources must be determined at a range of spatial scales to support effective mitigation.																	1535-1459	1535-1467				DEC	2017	33	10			SI		1527	1538		10.1002/rra.3222								WOS:000417916000003

Assessing the Mechanistic Basis for Fine Sediment Biomonitoring: Inconsistencies among the Literature, Traits and Indices	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS					National Meeting of the British-Hydrological-Society (BHS)	JUL, 2016	Loughborough Univ, Loughborough, ENGLAND	British Hydrol Soc	Loughborough Univ			Classification of species sensitivity for biomonitoring has been approached under two different frameworks, using either empirical data or expert opinion. Two tools for fine sediment (i.e. clogging and colmation) biomonitoring in the UK tend towards these contrasting approaches. The Proportion of Sediment-sensitive Invertebrates (PSI) index was developed using expert judgement. Empirical weightings were subsequently added at genus or species (EPSI) and mixed (EPSImixed) taxonomic levels, but scores remain constrained by the original categories. In contrast, the Combined Fine Sediment Index, composed of separate taxon scores along organic matter and total fine sediment gradients, was developed using a purely empirical approach. We tested the mechanistic bases for these indices by relating taxon scores to species traits. We compared the results with those for the well-established Whalley Hawkes Paisley Trigg index of organic pollution. After controlling for varying sample sizes, Whalley Hawkes Paisley Trigg could be better predicted by a linear combination of all available traits (mean R-2=0.92) than any of the fine sediment indices (0.68<mean R-2<0.76). When only traits expected to respond to fine sediment were offered as independent variables, the goodness of fit was substantially reduced for all fine sediment indices (0.27<mean R-2<0.46). Our findings demonstrate the lack of integration between the literature on macroinvertebrate responses to fine sediment, the available trait data and taxon scores. Refinement of the trait database is recommended to build on the valuable work performed to date. As the UK has taken the lead in embedding fine sediment into routine biomonitoring programmes, these findings have important international implications. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Spatiotemporal variation of bacterial water quality and the relationship with pasture land cover	JOURNAL OF WATER AND HEALTH												Pathogens are a major cause of water quality impairment and public health concern world-wide. In the United States, each state is tasked with developing water quality standards (WQS) to protect the designated use(s) of waterbodies. Several streams in the Illinois River Watershed in northwest Arkansas are currently listed as impaired due to elevated levels of pathogens. Our objective was to evaluate Escherichia coli (E. coli) numbers at 29 stream sites, compare these numbers to the applicable WQS, and investigate the relationship between E. coli numbers and land cover variables. E. coli numbers in samples collected at most sites were within allowable limits, although there were several instances of violations of the WQS. Violations were variable from year to year at some sites, and elevated levels of E. coli were spatially localized during baseflow. Violations also were positively related to pasture land cover in the drainage area, and particularly within the riparian buffer area. This relationship was non-linear, or threshold based, where there was a significant increase in the mean E. coli exceedances when riparian pasture land cover was greater than approximately 50%. These results can be used to identify specific stream reaches where E. coli numbers might be elevated and the implementation of best management practices can be geographically targeted.																	1477-8920					DEC	2017	15	6					839	848		10.2166/wh.2017.101								WOS:000417269400001	29215349

While transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that the majority of the viruses were bacteriophages, a number of presumptive enteric virus families were visualized, some of which include Picornaviridae, Adenoviridae, Polyomaviridae and Reoviridae. Finally, primer specific nested polymerase chain reaction (nested-PCR)/reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) coupled with BLAST analysis identified human adenovirus, polyomavirus and hepatitis A and C virus genomes in river water samples. Taken together, the complexity of both bacteriophage and enteric virus populations in the river has potential health implications. Finally, a systematic integrated risk assessment and management plan to identify and minimize sources of faecal contamination is the most effective way of ensuring water safety and should be established in all future guidelines.																	1477-8920					DEC	2017	15	6					966	981		10.2166/wh.2017.066								WOS:000417269400012	29215360					
J	Cook, J; Lahren, S				Cook, Joseph; Lahren, Sheena			Why do water points fail? Learning from open-ended failure descriptions in the WPDx dataset	JOURNAL OF WATER SANITATION AND HYGIENE FOR DEVELOPMENT												Despite the explosion of geospatial data collected on water points, there have been relatively few efforts to date to use these data to understand the correlates and potential causes of water point breakdowns. We add to this literature by coding open-ended responses around functionality status in the open-access WPDx (Water Point Data Exchange) database. We code responses into 41 different categories of functionality problems for 244,075 water points from 25 countries in Africa, Asia and Central America, though we narrow our analysis to 41,716 points in six countries. We find that descriptions of technical breakdowns or problems are most common, though concerns about water resources and water quality feature prominently. We also find that 7% of records in our analysis subset spontaneously mention concerns over vandalism or theft, something which has received relatively little attention in the sector. Information on user financial contributions is mostly omitted by uploaders to WPDx, but we find that users are not contributing at all in 40% of the 96,651 water points with these data. Our results should be interpreted cautiously considering the obvious selection and subjectivity concerns, but the analysis highlights the potential benefits of coordinating an augmented data collection standard.																	2043-9083					DEC	2017	7	4					535	545		10.2166/washdev.2017.022								WOS:000417972100001						
J	Walter, CT; Kooy, M; Prabaharyaka, I				Walter, Carolin Tina; Kooy, Michelle; Prabaharyaka, Indrawan			The role of bottled drinking water in achieving SDG 6.1: an analysis of affordability and equity from Jakarta, Indonesia	JOURNAL OF WATER SANITATION AND HYGIENE FOR DEVELOPMENT												Bottled water serves an increasingly large percentage of urban poor populations in lower-income countries, yet receives little attention within international development research and policy. This study investigates the impact of packaged drinking water (refill water) on affordability and equity of drinking water access by the urban poor under SDG 6.1, comparing refill water cost and consumption across socioeconomic quintiles drawn from two sub-districts of Jakarta, Indonesia. Analysis of a customer survey (n = 80) and in-depth interviews with 12 small-scale refill water providers reveals the significance of water quality, convenience, and reliability of water in defining affordable water access. Lower-income households perceive refill water to be the most affordable, safe drinking water source available to them, despite representing the second highest per unit cost source. Piped water is considered more expensive despite its low per unit volume cost, because of total costs associated with guaranteeing its reliability and quality. We suggest that the combined costs of securing domestic and drinking water for poorer households need to be considered for future approaches targeting the provision of inclusive water access under SDG 6.1 in Indonesia. Packaged water needs to be taken into account in the strategies designed to increase access, and measurements of affordability and equity of access.																	2043-9083					DEC	2017	7	4					642	650		10.2166/washdev.2017.046								WOS:000417972100011						
J	Dao, AD; Nguyen, DC; Han, MY				Anh Dzung Dao; Duc Canh Nguyen; Han, Moo Young			Design and operation of a rainwater for drinking (RFD) project in a rural area: case study at Cukhe Elementary School, Vietnam	JOURNAL OF WATER SANITATION AND HYGIENE FOR DEVELOPMENT												Since 2014, awell-designed rainwater for drinking (RFD) project has been successfully operating at Cukhe Elementary School, near Hanoi, Vietnam. During that time, daily rainfall data, water consumption, water quality and questionnaires to the community were prepared. Several concerns over the design and operation of RFD projects, such as lack of sufficient rainfall data, water quality concerns, and public acceptance, are identified and overcome. Modeled results from using observed daily rainfall data, and using a simplified method from insufficient monthly data, are compared. The simplified method using insufficient rainfall data is acceptable for design within the error range of 0-11%. Rainwater quality after the use of the point of use treatment device proved that a well-designed rainwater harvesting (RWH) system ensures safe drinking water, which complies with WHO and Vietnam drinking water quality standards (VDWQS) guidelines. The people of the community liked the RFD system because of the satisfactory water quality and the economic benefits of not needing to purchase bottled water. The success of the RFD project at the Cukhe Elementary School proved the potential of promoting rainwater as drinking water in rural areas in developing countries, where a safe drinking water supply is a challenge, and should be promoted as an important means to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 6.																	2043-9083					DEC	2017	7	4					651	658		10.2166/washdev.2017.055								WOS:000417972100012						
J	He, MB; Chen, C; Guo, C; Wang, S; Chang, HQ; Liu, BC				He, Meibo; Chen, Chen; Guo, Can; Wang, Shuai; Chang, Haiqing; Liu, Baicang			Optimization of aeration conditions in the hybrid process of coagulation-ultrafiltration with air sparging	JOURNAL OF WATER SUPPLY RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY-AQUA												To optimize the aeration conditions in the hybrid process of coagulation-ultrafiltration with air sparging, a series of air flow rates under continuous and intermittent sparging were investigated. The water quality characteristics that surrounded membranes, bubble characteristics, fouling resistances, and energy consumption under different aeration conditions were analyzed. The results showed that increasing air flow rates generated more bubbles with a wider size distribution (i.e., more favorable hydrodynamic conditions). The turbidity and ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (UV254) of the water that surrounded membranes were reduced as the air sparging kept flocs away from membranes. Thus, the membrane fouling was effectively mitigated by increasing air flow rates despite aeration modes. For a given air flow rate, less fouling was obtained under continuous sparging than the intermittent mode. With respect to intermittent sparging, the mode of 40-min aeration per hour more effectively alleviated membrane fouling than the mode of 30-min aeration per hour. Weighing the energy consumption and membrane fouling, optimum air flow rates under continuous mode were between 15 and 30 mL/min, and the optimal aeration condition for intermittent mode was set at the air flow rate of 30 mL/min under the mode of 40-min aeration per hour.

J	Zhang, ZC				Zhang, Zhenchao			Treatment of oilfield wastewater by combined process of micro-electrolysis, Fenton oxidation and coagulation	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												In this study, a combined process was developed that included micro-electrolysis, Fenton oxidation and coagulation to treat oilfield fracturing wastewater. Micro-electrolysis and Fenton oxidation were applied to reduce chemical oxygen demand (COD) organic load and to enhance organic components gradability, respectively. Orthogonal experiment were employed to investigate the influence factors of micro-electrolysis and Fenton oxidation on COD removal efficiency. For micro-electrolysis, the optimum conditions were: pH, 3; iron-carbon dosage, 50 mg/L; mass ratio of iron-carbon, 2: 3; reaction time, 60 min. For Fenton oxidation, a total reaction time of 90 min, a H2O2 dosage of 12 mg/L, with a H2O2/Fe2+ mole ratio of 30, pH of 3 were selected to achieve optimum oxidation. The optimum conditions in coagulation process: pH, cationic polyacrylamide dosage, mixing speed and time is 4.3, 2 mg/L, 150 rpm and 30 s, respectively. In the continuous treatment process under optimized conditions, the COD of oily wastewater fell 56.95%, 46.23%, 30.67%, respectively, from last stage and the total COD removal efficiency reached 83.94% (from 4,314 to 693 mg/L). In the overall treatment process under optimized conditions, the COD of oily wastewater was reduced from 4,314 to 637 mg/L, and the COD removal efficiency reached 85.23%. The contribution of each stage is 68.45% (micro-electrolysis), 24.07% (Fenton oxidation), 7.48% (coagulation), respectively. Microelectrolysis is the uppermost influencing process on COD removal. Compared with the COD removal efficiency of three processes on raw wastewater under optimized conditions: the COD removal efficiency of single micro-electrolysis, single Fenton oxidation, single coagulation is 58.34%, 44.88% and 39.72%, respectively. Experiments proved the effect of combined process is marvelous and the overall water quality of the final effluent could meet the class III national wastewater discharge standard of petrochemical industry of China (GB8978-1996).																	0273-1223	1996-9732				DEC	2017	76	12					3278	3288		10.2166/wst.2017.486								WOS:000417838300012	29236007

Spatio-temporal variations of water quality in Nova Ponte Reservoir, Araguari River Basin, Brazil	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												Multivariate techniques, like cluster analysis (CA) and principal component analysis (PCA), were used to evaluate the spatial and temporal variability of surface water quality in a large neotropical hydroelectric reservoir (Nova Ponte Reservoir). The dataset, obtained during the period of 1995-2011 from the Energy Company of Minas Gerais State (CEMIG), contains 14 parameters surveyed quarterly in 14 sites, at different depths. The CA grouped the 14 sites in three main groups: lotic sites, half of the photic zone sites and bottom sites. Statistical tests showed that only three parameters (total dissolved solids, nitrate and chemical oxygen demand) have no significant difference between cluster groups. The PCA results showed temporal changes of the water quality in all groups, illustrating modifications to the importance of the parameters over time. PCA also revealed the major causes of water deterioration from 1995 to 2005 were related to agricultural and livestock activities. Currently, the water quality parameters related to organic pollution are also highlighted. Generally, this study shows that possible optimization of the monitoring network should consider temporal variation of water quality parameters.																	1606-9749					DEC	2017	17	6					1507	1514		10.2166/ws.2017.055								WOS:000417947000002

This study aims to quantitatively evaluate the impact of river streamflow on the joint occurrence of water quality variables in the heavily polluted Huai River Basin (HRB). Using data from three representative stations, joint distributions were set up for two key water quality indexes, CODMn and NH3-N, for three different streamflow scenarios: low, medium and high streamflows, and the joint probabilities of different water quality combinations were calculated. The results showed that there was a significant negative relationship between streamflow and the water quality index, while the water quality indexes were significantly positively correlated. In general, the higher the river streamflow, the lower the joint probability of water quality variables under the three scenarios in each station. It is concluded that, in both the main stream and the tributary, high streamflow scenarios do help to improve the joint probability of water quality combination under a higher water quality grade, compared with a decrease under a lower quality grade. This study is expected to provide scientific references for water quality management and implementation of water pollution prevention in the HRB.				she, dunxian/B-4667-2018	she, dunxian/0000-0003-4660-3301												1606-9749					DEC	2017	17	6					1602	1615		10.2166/ws.2017.046								WOS:000417947000011

Simulation of multiple water source ecological replenishment for Chagan Lake based on coupled hydrodynamic and water quality models	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												Chagan Lake serves as an irrigation storage reservoir for the Qianguo Irrigation Area and an important ecological barrier in western Jilin. The coupled TUFLOW-FV and Aquatic Ecodynamic (AED2) models were used to simulate the hydrodynamic and water quality of Chagan Lake, and propose the water diversion scheme that could improve the water quality to reach Grade III and maintain the ecological water level. The simulation results showed a satisfactory agreement with observations. The total carrying loads of NH3-N, total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) for Chagan Lake were 1,147.6, 3,686.2 and 100.8 t from May to October. The range of the minimum amounts of water diversion to keep the water quality as Grade III and maintain the maximum ecological water level of 131.5 m for TN, TP were separately [32.60, 49.84, 57.19, 63.70, 70.91], [117.25, 135.26, 168.17, 190.65, 218.32] million m(3) and the corresponding reduction amounts of farmland drainage for TN, TP were separately [4.03, 0, 0, 0, 0], [73.08, 61.88, 50.23, 40.94, 31.98] million m(3) under the rainfall guarantee rates of 10%, 20%, 50%, 75%, 90%, respectively.

Simulation of NOM events in pilot plant evaluation of DAF/Ozone/BAC for drinking water treatment	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												Pilot plant testing is invaluable for ascertaining the robustness of water treatment processes against raw water quality events such as turbidity and colour spikes, whether it be for stress testing of an existing process or designing of a new process. Unfortunately, the natural occurrence of such events (particularly colour) can be difficult to predict and commercial humic materials generally fail to closely match the indigenous natural organic matter (NOM) present in the raw water. Therefore, it is highly desirable to be able to simulate NOM event conditions. This paper describes a simple brewing method that we developed and used in our recent pilot plant evaluation of a proposed DAF/Ozone/BAC process for drinking water treatment. Using this method we successfully prepared, by using fallen leaves etc. collected from the local catchment area, large quantities of a concentrated NOM stock solution with its specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA), when diluted, very close to the median SUVA of historical NOM events. The brewed solution showed broadly similar NOM characteristics to those of the raw water encountered during the pilot investigation period in terms of molecular weight distribution and fractionation. The coagulation behaviour was also examined for the spiked and non-spiked raw water.																	1606-9749					DEC	2017	17	6					1793	1800		10.2166/ws.2017.086								WOS:000417947000029						
J	Hao, FZ; Li, JS; Wang, Z; Li, YF				Hao, Fengzhen; Li, Jiusheng; Wang, Zhen; Li, Yanfeng			Effect of Ions on Clogging and Biofilm Formation in Drip Emitters Applying Secondary Sewage Effluent	IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE												On-site drip irrigation experiments that were continued for 54days with a daily operation of 12h with sewage effluent and groundwater application were conducted to investigate the effect of two typical ions (Fe2+ and Ca2+) on emitter clogging. At the end of the experiment, several representative emitters were sampled to investigate the clogging mechanism through measuring the dry weight of biofilm substances (DW) and analysing the mineral constituents of clogging solids and the extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) of attached biofilm. The plain emitters demonstrated significantly better anti-clogging performance than the labyrinth emitters. For sewage application, the ions added increased the EPS and DW compared with sewage without ions added. Moreover, clogging in the labyrinth emitters increased with an increasing ion complex and concentration. Different irrigation water qualities produced similar mineral constituents of clogging solids: quartz, Ca+Mg carbonate, silicate, and iron oxide. However, the clogging risk and inducing mechanism varied with the types of ion added. Fe2+ promoted production of microorganisms and precipitation of solid particles, increasing the risk of biochemical clogging, while Ca2+ mainly caused chemical precipitation. A complex of Fe2+ and Ca2+ increased the risk of biochemical clogging under sewage application, while it caused chemical clogging for groundwater application. Therefore, the strategies for protecting emitter clogging should be developed through comprehensively considering water quality and emitter type used.

J	Guo, LJ; Li, JS; Li, YF; Xu, D				Guo, Lijun; Li, Jiusheng; Li, Yanfeng; Xu, Di			Nitrogen Utilization under Drip Irrigation with Sewage Effluent in the North China Plain	IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE												Field experiments were performed on maize (Zea mays L.) to explore the impacts of water quality and nitrogen (N) application rate on soil N balance and nitrate leaching in the North China Plain. N application rates ranging from 0 to 180kg ha(-1) were tested, applying either secondary sewage effluent (SW) or groundwater (GW). Increasing the N application rate from 120 to 180kg ha(-1) did not significantly increase N uptake but substantially enhanced the apparent N loss (ANL) and nitrate leaching. Compared with GW irrigation, SW irrigation increased N uptake by 8% and soil residual N by 9% on average, whereas the ANL increased by 18%, suggesting that the detrimental impacts of SW irrigation may outweigh the benefits. The ANL values were enhanced mostly with increasing N application rates, followed by increasing initial soil N and nitrogen contained in irrigation water (irrigation N). Additionally, the ranking of factors increasing the leaching of nitrate was fertilizer N, deep percolation, irrigation N and initial soil N. Thus, SW irrigation combined with a high N application rate amplified the ANL and nitrate leaching losses. This study recommends N application rates ranging from 116 to 132kg ha(-1) to minimize the N losses when maize is irrigated with SW under drip irrigation in the North China Plain.

J	Li, YF; Li, JS; Wen, JL				Li, Yanfeng; Li, Jiusheng; Wen, Jiangli			Drip Irrigation with Sewage Effluent Increased Salt Accumulation in Soil, Depressed Sap Flow, and Increased Yield of Tomato	IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE												Sewage application is a cost-effective method for meeting the challenge of irrigation in water-short regions. However, there is concern about the accumulation of salt from sewage effluent in soil. Experiments were conducted for 3 years in a greenhouse to investigate the effects of water quality on salt accumulation in soil and on sap flow for drip-irrigated tomato. The types of irrigation water used in the experiments included secondary sewage effluent, groundwater, and blended water that was obtained by mixing the secondary sewage effluent and the groundwater in equal volumes. The results demonstrated that soil bulk electrical conductivity (ECb) increased with irrigation rates, and sewage application produced a more rapid increase than did blended water and groundwater treatments. Irrigation throughout the growing season could produce a 21-44% increase in salt content from its initial values to values at harvest, and salt accumulation occurred mainly at the 30-45 cm depth of soil. Sewage irrigation was likely to decrease sap flow but increased tomato yield and improved fruit quality parameters excluding ascorbic acid compared with groundwater irrigation. These results suggest that secondary sewage application using drip irrigation increases salt accumulation in the root zone, and depresses crop transpiration to some extent, but does not have a negative influence on tomato yield and fruit quality.

J	Qiu, ZJ; Li, JS; Zhao, WX				Qiu, Zhenjie; Li, Jiusheng; Zhao, Weixia			Effect of Applying Sewage Effluent with Subsurface Drip Irrigation on Soil Enzyme Activities during the Maize Growing Season	IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE												Subsurface drip irrigation is an appropriate method when using sewage effluent for crop irrigation, but its resultant heterogeneous distribution of water and nutrients in the soil may affect enzyme activities (EAs). Field experiments were designed, with three lateral depths at 0, 15, and 30cm beneath the soil surface and three irrigation levels of 70, 100, and 130% of evapotranspiration, to investigate the effects of lateral depth, irrigation level, and water quality on the EAs of alkaline phosphatase, urease, and invertase in soil. Over 2years, a greater lateral depth noticeably enhanced EAs in deeper soils, while EAs at a shallow lateral depth were higher in topsoil. Compared to lateral depth, the effects of irrigation level on EAs were unstable in both years. The correlations between urease activities and NO3-N content indicated that the character of urease activities in soil N cycling was initially facilitating N mineralization and was subsequently converted to facilitate N uptake and immobilization during the maize growing seasons. Additionally, the EAs with both sewage effluent and groundwater irrigation at harvest, were generally higher than EAs measured prior to sowing. Furthermore, the sewage effluent irrigation imposed no negative effects on nutrient exchange and ecosystem functions in the soil. Our study recommends subsurface drip irrigation as a promising method for applying sewage effluent.

Simulation of Daily Flow Pathways, Tile-Drain Nitrate Concentrations, and Soil-Nitrogen Dynamics Using SWAT	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Tile drainage significantly alters flow and nutrient pathways and reliable simulation at this scale is needed for effective planning of nutrient reduction strategies. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) has been widely utilized for prediction of flow and nutrient loads, but few applications have evaluated the model's ability to simulate pathway-specific flow components or nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) concentrations in tile-drained watersheds at the daily time step. The objectives of this study were to develop and calibrate SWAT models for small, tile-drained watersheds, evaluate model performance for simulation of flow components and NO3-N concentration at daily intervals, and evaluate simulated soil-nitrogen dynamics. Model evaluation revealed that it is possible to meet accepted performance criteria for simulation of monthly total flow, subsurface flow (SSF), and NO3-N loads while obtaining daily surface runoff (SURQ), SSF, and NO3-N concentrations that are not satisfactory. This limits model utility for simulating best management practices (BMPs) and compliance with water quality standards. Although SWAT simulates the soil N-cycle and most predicted fluxes were within ranges reported in agronomic studies, improvements to algorithms for soil-N processes are needed. Variability in N fluxes is extreme and better parameterization and constraint, through use of more detailed agronomic data, would also improve NO3-N simulation in SWAT.

Evaluation of Existing and Modified Wetland Equations in the SWAT Model	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												The ability to accurately simulate flow and nutrient removal in treatment wetlands within an agricultural, watershed-scale model is needed to develop effective plans for meeting nutrient reduction goals associated with protection of drinking water supplies and reduction of the Gulf of Mexico hypoxic zone. The objectives of this study were to incorporate new equations for wetland hydrology and nutrient removal in Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), compare model performance using original and improved equations, and evaluate the ramifications of errors in watershed and tile drain simulation on prediction of NO3-N dynamics in wetlands. The modified equations produced Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency values of 0.88 to 0.99 for daily NO3-N load predictions, and percent bias values generally less than 6%. However, statistical improvement over the original equations was marginal and both old and new equations provided accurate simulations. The new equations reduce the model's dependence on detailed monitoring data and hydrologic calibration. Additionally, the modified equations increase SWAT's versatility by incorporating a weir equationand an irreducible nutrient concentration and temperature coefficient. Model improvements enhance the utility of SWAT for simulating flow and nutrients in wetlands and other impoundments, although performance is limited by the accuracy of inflow and NO3-N predictions from the contributing watershed.

To explore this balance, we developed a multi-objective decision support system for allocating BMP type and placement by coupling the Soil and Water Assessment Tool with a nondominated sorted genetic algorithm that minimizes total phosphorus (TP) yields from agricultural hydrologic response units (HRUs) and costs, while using stakeholder BMP familiarity as a constraint; conventional tillage, no tillage, nutrient management, riparian buffers, and contour cropping were explored. Using constraints representing current conditions, the optimization resulted in 59.6 to 81.0% reduction in agricultural TP yield from HRUs at costs ranging between US $0.8 and US $5.3 million. The constrained optimization tended to select mostly single BMPs or at most two BMPs for a given HRU due to these BMPs having higher acceptability to stakeholders. In contrast, the unconstrained case, representing full familiarity, selected 2- and 3-BMP applications. There was little difference in costs between the constrained and unconstrained cases below an 80% TP yield reduction; however, significant differences were found at larger reductions, supporting the value of stakeholder education and extension efforts.

We used the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to investigate how natural gas development could impact streamflow and sediment, total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorous (TP) loadings in the upper Delaware River Basin (DRB), a relatively undeveloped watershed of 7,950km(2) that lies above the Marcellus Shale formation. If gas development was permitted, our projections show the DRB could experience development of over 600 well pads to extract natural gas at build out, which, with supporting infrastructure (roads, gathering pipelines), could convert over 5,000ha from existing land uses in the study area. In subbasins with development activity we found sediment, TN, and TP yields could increase by an average of 15, 0.08, and 0.03kg/ha/yr, respectively (an increase of 2, 3, and 15%, respectively) for each one percent of subbasin land area converted into natural gas infrastructure. At the study area outlet on the Delaware River at Port Jervis, New York, we found increases in the annual average streamflow and sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus loads of up to 0.01, 0.2, 0.2, and 1%, respectively, for a rapid development year, and 0.08, 1.3, 2.0, and 11%, respectively, for the full development scenario.

Specifically, the three accompanying studies describe the water quality implications of adopting the three biofuel-cropping systems via large-scale conversion of cropland or targeting to marginal lands for three smaller watersheds located in the western or eastern Corn Belt, or across the Upper Mississippi and Ohio-Tennessee River Basins. Other results such as climate change related impacts for two eastern Corn Belt watersheds are also discussed. These studies are supported by the CenUSA Bioenergy coordinated agricultural project funded by the USDA to develop a regional system for producing cellulosic biofuels. A description of the evolving federal policy related to cellulosic biofuel production and consumption is provided as are other potential drivers for encouraging the adoption of stover removal, switchgrass, and Miscanthus as perennial feedstocks. Findings from the SWAT studies and their implications for environmental and economic performance in their respective agroecosystems are discussed, and commonalities and divergences in results are identified. The potential for policy design to improve the performance of these systems based on the findings of these modeling studies, and continuing research needs and directions for improved policy design are discussed.

We quantify ecosystem services of bioenergy-based land use change and estimate the potential changes of ecosystem services due to climate change projections. We considered 17 bioenergy-based scenarios with Miscanthus, switchgrass, and corn stover as candidate bioenergy feedstock. Soil and Water Assessment Tool simulations of biomass/grain yield, hydrology, and water quality were used to quantify ecosystem services freshwater provision (FWPI), food (FPI) and fuel provision, erosion regulation (ERI), and flood regulation (FRI). Nine climate projections from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase-3 were used to quantify the potential climate change variability. Overall, ecosystem services of heavily row cropped Wildcat Creek watershed were lower than St. Joseph River watershed which had more forested and perennial pasture lands. The provision of ecosystem services for both study watersheds were improved with bioenergy production scenarios. Miscanthus in marginal lands of Wildcat Creek (9% of total area) increased FWPI by 27% and ERI by 14% and decreased FPI by 12% from the baseline. For St. Joseph watershed, Miscanthus in marginal lands (18% of total area) improved FWPI by 87% and ERI by 23% while decreasing FPI by 46%. The relative impacts of land use change were considerably larger than climate change impacts in this paper.

Assessment of Bioenergy Cropping Scenarios for the Boone River Watershed in North Central Iowa, United States	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Several biofuel cropping scenarios were evaluated with an improved version of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) as part of the CenUSA Bioenergy consortium for the Boone River Watershed (BRW), which drains about 2,370km(2) in north central Iowa. The adoption of corn stover removal, switchgrass, and/or Miscanthus biofuel cropping systems was simulated to assess the impact of cellulosic biofuel production on pollutant losses. The stover removal results indicate removal of 20 or 50% of corn stover in the BRW would have negligible effects on streamflow and relatively minor or negligible effects on sediment and nutrient losses, even on higher sloped cropland. Complete cropland conversion into switchgrass or Miscanthus, resulted in reductions of streamflow, sediment, nitrate, and other pollutants ranging between 23-99%. The predicted nitrate reductions due to Miscanthus adoption were over two times greater compared to switchgrass, with the largest impacts occurring for tile-drained cropland. Targeting of switchgrass or Miscanthus on cropland 2% slope or 7% slope revealed a disproportionate amount of sediment and sediment-bound nutrient reductions could be obtained by protecting these relatively small areas of higher sloped cropland. Overall, the results indicate that all biofuel cropping systems could be effectively implemented in the BRW, with the most robust approach being corn stover removal adopted on tile-drained cropland in combination with a perennial biofuel crop on higher sloped landscapes.

To address the water quality implications of increased biofuel production, biofuel scenarios were tested with a Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model revision featuring improved biofuel crop representation. Scenarios included corn stover removal and the inclusion of two perennial bioenergy crops, switchgrass and Miscanthus, grown on marginal lands (slopes >2% and erosion rates >2 t/ha) and nonmarginal lands. The SWAT model estimates show water quality is not very sensitive to stover removal. The perennial bioenergy crops reduce simulated sediment, nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) yields by up to 60%. Simulated sediment and P reductions in marginal lands were generally twice that occurring in the nonmarginal lands. The highest unit area reductions of N occurred in the less sloping tile-drained lands. Productivity showed corn grain yield was independent from stover removal, while yields of the two perennial bioenergy crops were similar in the marginal and nonmarginal lands. The results suggest planning for biofuel production in the Corn Belt could include the removal of stover in productive corn areas, and the planting of perennial bioenergy crops in marginal land and in low-sloped tile-drained areas characterized by high N pollution.

Assessing Parameter Uncertainty of a Semi-Distributed Hydrology Model for a Shallow Aquifer Dominated Environmental System	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												This paper examines the performance of a semi-distributed hydrology model (i.e., Soil and Water Assessment Tool [SWAT]) using Sequential Uncertainty FItting (SUFI-2), generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE), parameter solution (ParaSol), and particle swarm optimization (PSO). We applied SWAT to the Waccamaw watershed, a shallow aquifer dominated Coastal Plain watershed in the Southeastern United States (U.S.). The model was calibrated (2003-2005) and validated (2006-2007) at two U.S. Geological Survey gaging stations, using significant parameters related to surface hydrology, hydrogeology, hydraulics, and physical properties. SWAT performed best during intervals with wet and normal antecedent conditions with varying sensitivity to effluent channel shape and characteristics. In addition, the calibration of all algorithms depended mostly on Manning's n-value for the tributary channels as the surface friction resistance factor to generate runoff. SUFI-2 and PSO simulated the same relative probability distribution tails to those observed at an upstream outlet, while all methods (except ParaSol) exhibited longer tails at a downstream outlet. The ParaSol model exhibited large skewness suggesting a global search algorithm was less capable of characterizing parameter uncertainty. Our findings provide insights regarding parameter sensitivity and uncertainty as well as modeling diagnostic analysis that can improve hydrologic theory and prediction in complex watersheds.

Good performance was achieved with a hydraulic loading rate of 0.1 m(3)/m(2).d, indicating that the effluent water quality could meet the primary grade A values as put forth by the 'Cities Sewage Treatment Plant Pollutant Discharge Standard' (GB18918-2002). In addition, the results of three inflow total phosphorus (TP) concentrations (5 mg L-1, 15 mg L-1, and 30 mg L-1) indicated that high-levels of phosphorus were more advantageous in regards to improving the activity of denitrifying bacteria in soil and strengthening the effect of nitrogen removal, suggesting that the effluent total nitrogen (TN) concentration could meet the primary grade A standard (TN <= 15 mg L-1). It was further observed that soil depth was less crucial when inflow TP concentrations were higher. Therefore, the results indicated that inflow phosphorus concentrations could greatly influence nitrogen migration and transformation in deep subsurface wastewater infiltration systems.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				DEC	2017	76	11					3086	3093		10.2166/wst.2017.483								WOS:000417163700021	29210694

Riparian and microhabitat factors determine the structure of the EPT community in Andean headwater rivers of Ecuador	ECOHYDROLOGY												This research was conducted in the high-Andean basin of the Zhurucay River in southern Ecuador. In 4 river reaches, 19 sampling campaigns were conducted per reach spread over a period of 35months. The biotic samples were selected in the periods with greatest flow stability. Parallel to each sampling, 37 environmental variables grouped into 3 factors (riparian corridor, hydromorphology, and water quality) were recorded. The study aimed to analyse during periods of stable flow the influence of these environmental factors on the structure and density of the EPT community (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera) in a quasi-pristine aquatic ecosystem. Multivariate statistical analysis revealed that the Froude number, gravel type, and width/depth ratio are the most relevant hydromorphological variables explaining variations in EPT density. Xiphocentronidae, Contulma, and Helicopsyche were observed to have a relationship with the order of the river, while Ochrotrichia, Nectopsyche, and Phylloicus varied with the type of riparian vegetation. Phylloicus, Ochrotrichia, and Nectopsyche were common in lentic sites, while the proportion of gravel and the width/depth ratio restricted the genus Helicopsyche. The only relevant water quality factor was the total phosphorus, which was related with 2 taxa. In conclusion, although macroinvertebrates are currently employed in water quality studies, riparian vegetation and hydromorphological factors are determinant for their communities in pristine Andean rivers. Such factors are therefore crucial in the study of environmental flows and the assessment of the ecological integrity.																	1936-0584	1936-0592				DEC	2017	10	8							UNSP e1894	10.1002/eco.1894								WOS:000417099800009						
J	Le, TTH; Lorenz, M; Zeunert, S; Nguyen, CV; Meon, G				Thi Thu Huyen Le; Lorenz, Malte; Zeunert, Stephanie; Cong Vu Nguyen; Meon, Guenter			Spatial and temporal variability of water quantity and water quality of the Thi Vai catchment in southern Vietnam - Data analysis of a monitoring program	HYDROLOGIE UND WASSERBEWIRTSCHAFTUNG												The Thi Vai estuary and its catchment have been suffering for many years from a strongly deficient water quality, which has been caused by numerous sources of pollution (industrial zones, urban areas, agriculture). An integrated water management, which takes into account the most important present and future pollution sources, had not yet been established for the Thi Vai catchment before the beginning of the BMBF project EWATEC-COAST, coordinated by the TU Braunschweig. The primary objective of this project was, therefore, to develop a model-based management system for sustainable water and environmental protection of the Thi Vai catchment. For such a system, monitoring data are an essential basis for assessing the current state of rivers in the catchment, for identifying the existing processes and pollution sources and for calibrating and validating the model-based management system. Based on the existing historical water quality data, which were collected quarterly within the governmental monitoring program, an evaluation of the spatial and especially temporal dynamics of water quality was not possible. For this reason, a separate monitoring program of water quantity and quality was initiated at the beginning of the project. At 7 monitoring stations along the Thi Vai estuary and its important tributaries, water quantity was measurery 10 minutes and lasted from March 2013 to September 2014 (19 months). Due to financial reasons, the monitoring of water quality had a duration of 11 months (from March 2013 to January 2014). At the same stations, water quality was measured once a week. Investigated water quality parameters aed evre water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity, ammonium, nitrite, nitrate, total nitrogen, dissolved phosphate, total phosphorus, iron and total suspended solids. In this paper, the spatial and temporal variability of the collected data is examined. The data show the strong influence of the tide on the Thi Vai estuary. While the areal rainfall divides the hydrological regime of the inflows into low-water and high-water phases, the Thi Vai estuary is mainly influenced by the tide. The water quality data show a pollution of the inflows with ammonium, nitrite, TSS and iron. For the Thi Vai estuary, the low oxygen contents and the very high nitrite concentrations are the main water quality problems. In addition, data from this monitoring are compared with data from the past in order to understand the development of the water quality of the estuary.																	1439-1783					DEC	2017	61	6					370	382		10.5675/HyWa_2017,6_1								WOS:000416850700002

Although the catchment is a prominent pollution source for the Thi Vai Estuary, it was ignored by the local authorities up to now. Within the BMBF research project EWATEC-COAST a coupled model system was developed. It consists of an eco-hydrological catchment model and a hydrodynamic water quality model for the tidal main river. The eco-hydrological model, which was calibrated with data collected in the project, is in the focus of this contribution. Water and substance balances of the catchment were simulated for an extended historical time period with the calibrated eco-hydrological model PANTA RHEI-WQ using available meteorological long-term series. It was demonstrated that today the catchment is a primary source of pollution for the Thi Vai Estuary, delivering higher substance loads than the adjacent industrial zones. It was also shown, that the upper part of the Thi Vai is the current pollution hot spot. Approximately 55 % of the substance load from the catchment and approx. 35 % of the substance load from the industrial zones are entering the Thi Vai in that area. Furthermore the impact of climate change (2046 to 2065) on the water quantity and quality was quantified and was compared to a combined scenario, which accounts for a progressive development of the anthropogenic pollution in addition to climate change. It was demonstrated, that, under the given boundary conditions, the anthropogenic impact on water quantity and quality is stronger than the impact of climate change on its own. It was also shown, that the combined scenario of climate change and anthropogenic development can lead to an amplification of negative effects.

J	Zeunert, S; Lorenz, M; Nguyen, HQ; Meon, G				Zeunert, Stephanie; Lorenz, Malte; Hong Quan Nguyen; Meon, Guenter			Model-based analysis of the impacts of climate change and ongoing anthropogenic developments on the water quality of the tropical Thi Vai estuary	HYDROLOGIE UND WASSERBEWIRTSCHAFTUNG												Due to untreated discharges from numerous anthropogenic sources, the Thi Vai estuary, situated in South Vietnam, has been heavily polluted during the past years. The effects of climate change and a further increase in pollution, as a result of the rapid development of industry, population and agriculture in the catchment, were quantified for the water quantity and quality of the estuary in the framework of the BMBF project EWATEC-COAST. The joint German-Vietnamese project was coordinated by the TU Braunschweig. As part of an integrated management system, a hydrodynamic water quality model (Delft3D) was setup for the Thi Vai estuary. The model was closely linked to the eco-hydrological model PANTA RHEI-WQ, which provides time series for the upstream inflow boundary conditions. Data from a monitoring program initiated in the project were used to calibrate the hydrodynamics and the water quality. For the hydrodynamic calibration of water level and discharge in the estuary good results were obtained, which are confirmed by high correlation coefficients. The calibration of the water quality posed a bigger challenge due to the lack of data and several uncertainties. However, taking into account the mentioned uncertainties, the model showed adequate representations of the measured data. The calibrated model was used to estimate the impact of climate change and associated sea level rise as well as the impact of a progressive development of industry, population and a change in land use in the catchment on the water quantity and quality of the estuary. Considering the sole influence of climate change, the results generally show slightly reduced substance concentrations in the estuary. This is partly due to the increased dilution volume caused by the increase in sea level and to the increased temperature-dependent process rates of organic degradation and nitrification. At the same time, it has to be considered that both processes require oxygen, which leads to a drop in oxygen concentrations in the estuary. When considering the combined climate and development scenario, which takes into account climate change as well as a progressive development of population, industry and a change in land use, the partly positive effects on the water quality of the estuary are negated. Especially in the upper reaches of the estuary, increasing substance concentrations and a further decrease in oxygen contents are indicated. The results show, that for the long-term improvement of the water quality of the Thi Vai estuary a sustainable water quality management is necessary.

Often, decision makers are lacking well-developed planning criteria as well as model-based integrated planning tools for an integrated and sustainable water resources management. Within the research project EWATEC-COAST in the frame of the funding initiative CLIENT of the German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), an initial basic version of a GIS-based management system (WAMS.bas) was developed in close cooperation with Vietnamese institutions and authorities. It integrates collected data and results of all sub-projects and supplies the processed data to the user. At present, the system can be used as a planning tool. It was developed in close cooperation with university institutions and the local environmental agency of the affected provinces as main users. It gives the Vietnamese planners and stakeholders a holistic view into the project results and allows them to use the system for decision making, for example for restrictions to industrial zones. The data, maps and processed results of the monitoring and modeling of the sub-projects are stored within the data base. In this way, an overall picture is created of the hydrology, ecohydrology, hydrodynamics and water quality within the Thi Vai area. Furthermore, the influence of climate and anthropogenic change on the water quantity and quality can be examined. The data from the monitoring and the results of the coupled modeling stored in the management system serve as a basis for decision making processes with the main goal of improving the water quality of the estuary. Presently, the basic version, WAMS. bas, is used by the responsible governmental environmental agency. Upon request of the agency, it is planned to expand the basic version regarding planning alternatives and process routines and extend the system to other catchments. Furthermore, the system will be developed further to an operational version integrating online water quality data. The final aim will be to apply the expanded future system for the daily water resources management, but also for disaster early warning related to water pollution and storm surges.

Aeration was conducted by pumping epilimnetic water through the thermocline to the hypolimnion without breaking the thermal stratification. The model used time transient equation based on Navier-Stokes equation. The model was fitted to the vertical temperature distribution and environmental parameters (wind, air temperature, and solar radiation) before the onset of aeration, and the model was used to predict the vertical temperature distribution 3 and 15 days after the onset of aeration (1 August and 22 August). The difference between the modelled and observed temperature was on average 0.6 A degrees C. The average percentage model error was 4.0% on 1 August and 3.7% on 22 August. In the epilimnion, model accuracy depended on the difference between the observed temperature and boundary conditions. In the hypolimnion, the model residual decreased with increasing depth. On 1 August, the model predicted a homogenous temperature profile in the hypolimnion, while the observed temperature decreased moderately from the thermocline to the bottom. This was because the effect of sediment was not included in the model. On 22 August, the modelled and observed temperatures near the bottom were identical demonstrating that the heat transfer by the aerator masked the effect of sediment and that exclusion of sediment heat from the model does not cause considerable error unless very short-term effects of aeration are studied. In all, the model successfully described the effects of the aerator on the lake's temperature profile. The results confirmed the validity of the applied computational fluid dynamic in artificial aeration; based on the simulated results, the effect of aeration can be predicted.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				DEC	2017	7	8					4169	4176		10.1007/s13201-017-0577-6								WOS:000416833900001

To investigate the hydrogeochemical characteristics of groundwater and its suitability, twenty samples were collected from the shallow tubewells of study area having screen depth 21-54 m. The water quality assessment has been carried out by evaluating the physicochemical parameters such as temperature, pH, EC, TDS and major ions i.e., Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, SO4 (2-), NO3 (-), HCO3 (-). Results found that, the water is slightly alkaline and brackish in nature. The trends of cations and anions are Na+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > K+ and Cl- > HCO3 (-) > SO4 (2-) > NO3 (-), respectively and Na-Cl-HCO3 is the dominant groundwater type. The analyzed samples were also characterized with different indices, diagram and permissible limit i.e., electric conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), chloride content (Cl), soluble sodium percentage (SSP), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), magnesium adsorption ratio (MAR), Kelley's ratio (KR), Wilcox diagram and USSL diagram, and results showed that groundwater are not suitable for drinking and irrigational use. The factors responsible for the geochemical characterization were also attempted by using standard plot and it was found that mixing of seawater with entrapped water plays a significant role in the study area.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				DEC	2017	7	8					4219	4236		10.1007/s13201-017-0533-5								WOS:000416833900005

In total, 34 groundwater samples were analyzed for major elements (Tp, pH, EC, K+, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, SO4 (2-), NO3 (-), NO2 (-), NH4 (+), H2PO4 (-), CO3, and HCO3 (-)) and trace metal (Al, Cd, Cu, Fe, and Zn) content. The results show that the pH values range between 6.7 and 8.9, electrical conductivity ranges between 740 and 7340 A mu S/cm, and nitrate content ranges between 1.7 and 212 mg/l. Hydrochemical facies represented using a Piper diagram indicate an Na-K-Cl type water. All the trace metal concentrations are within the admissible standard range except for Cd. The bacteriological analysis showed that the majority of groundwater samples are contaminated. Generally, the content of total coliforms, fecal coliforms, and fecal streptococci ranged from 0 to 140, 0 to 125, and 0 to 108 CFU/100 ml, respectively. The samples are grouped according to three factors. Factor 1 shows strong positive loadings of EC, Mg, Cl, Na and K with 51.91% of total variance (TV); factor 2 shows strong negative loadings of NO3, SO4 and Ca with 17.98% of TV; and factor 3 shows strong negative loading of HCO3 with 15.56 of TV. We conclude that the quality of this groundwater is suitable for irrigation and domestic use (cleaning house, ect).

The extensive mining of the area has resulted in disruption of the groundwater availability in terms of both quantity and quality. This has led to a drinking water crisis, especially during the pre-monsoon period in the West Bokaro coalfield area. The characterization of the hydrogeological system and the artificial recharging of the aquifers might help to better manage the problem of the groundwater-level depletion. For this purpose, seven important hydrogeological factors (water depth, slope, drainage, soil, infiltration, lithology, and landuse) have been considered to define the most suitable locations for artificial groundwater recharging in the mining area. Different thematic maps were prepared from existing maps and data sets, remote-sensing images, and field investigations for identification of the most suitable locations for artificial recharge. Thematic layers for these parameters were prepared, classified, weighted, and integrated into a geographic information system (GIS) environment by means of fuzzy logic. The results of the study indicate that about 29 and 31% of the area are very suitable and suitable for recharging purposes in the West Bokaro coalfield. However, the rest of the area is moderate to unsuitable for recharging due to the ongoing mining and related activities in the study area. The groundwater recharging map of the study area was validated with measured electrical conductivity (EC) values in the groundwater, and it indicated that validation can be accepted for the identification of groundwater recharging sites. These findings are providing useful information for the proper planning and sustainable management of the groundwater resources in the study area.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				DEC	2017	7	8					4513	4524		10.1007/s13201-017-0603-8								WOS:000416833900027

The analyzed data revealed that iron and zinc metals were found to be the most abundant metals in the river Godavari and its tributaries. Iron (Fe) recorded the highest, while cadmium (Cd) had the least concentration. Arsenic, cadmium, chromium, iron and zinc metals are within the acceptable limit of BIS (Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) 1050 (2012) Specification for drinking water, pp 1-5). The analysis of Godavari river and its tributary's water samples reveals that the water is contaminated at selected points which are not suitable for drinking. Nickel and Copper concentration is above acceptable limit and other metal concentration is within the acceptable limit. Comprehensive study of the results reveals that out of 18 water quality stations monitored, water samples collected at 7 water quality stations are found to be within the permissible limit for all purposes. While Rajegaon, Tekra, Nandgaon, P. G. Bridge, Bhatpalli, Kumhari, Pauni, Hivra, Ashti, Bamini, and Jagda stations were beyond the desirable limit due to presence of copper and nickel metals. The contents of copper metal ions were higher at some water quality stations on Wunna river (Nandgaon); Wardha river (Hivra) and Wainganga river (Kumhari, Pauni, Ashti) during Feb. 2012, while nickel concentration during Feb. 2012, June 2012, March 2013 and Aug. 2013 at some water quality stations on rivers Bagh, Indravati, Pranhita, Wunna, Penganga, Peddavagu, Wainganga and Wardha. It can be concluded that rapid population growth and industrialization have brought about resource degradation and a decline in environmental quality.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				DEC	2017	7	8					4539	4548		10.1007/s13201-017-0607-4								WOS:000416833900029

Jafar			Multivariate statistical techniques for the evaluation of groundwater quality of Amaravathi River Basin: South India	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The study of groundwater in Amaravathi River basin of Karur District resulted in large geochemical data set. A total of 24 water samples were collected and analyzed for physico-chemical parameters, and the abundance of cation and anion concentrations was in the following order: Na+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > K+ = Cl- > HCO3 (-) > SO4 (2-). Correlation matrix shows that the basic ionic chemistry is influenced by Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and Cl-, and also suggests that the samples contain Na+-Cl-, Ca2+-Cl- an,d mixed Ca2+-Mg2+-Cl- types of water. HCO3 (-), SO4 (2-), and F- association is less than that of other parameters due to poor or less available of bearing minerals. PCA extracted six components, which are accountable for the data composition explaining 81% of the total variance of the data set and allowed to set the selected parameters according to regular features as well as to evaluate the frequency of each group on the overall variation in water quality. Cluster analysis results show that groundwater quality does not vary extensively as a function of seasons, but shows two main clusters.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				DEC	2017	7	8					4633	4649		10.1007/s13201-017-0627-0								WOS:000416833900036

Assessment of hydro-geochemistry and groundwater quality of Rajshahi City in Bangladesh	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The study was carried out to understand the hydro-geochemistry and ground water quality in the Rajshahi City of Bangladesh. A total of 240 groundwater samples were collected in 2 years, i.e., 2009 and 2010 covering the pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. Aquifer soil samples were collected from 30 locations during the monsoon in 2000. All the samples were analyzed for various physicochemical parameters according to standard methods of analysis, these includes pH, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, total hardness, and total alkalinity, major cations such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and Fe2+, major anions such as HCO3 (-), NO3 (-), Cl-, and SO4 (2-) and heavy metals such as Mn, Zn, Cu, As, Cd and Pb. The results illustrated that the groundwater was slightly acidic to neutral in nature, total hardness observed in all samples fall under the hard to a very hard category. The bicarbonate and calcium concentration in the groundwater exceeded the permissible limits may be due to the dissolution of calcite. The concentration of calcium, iron, manganese, arsenic and lead were far above the permissible limit in most of the shallow tube well samples. The study found that the major hydrochemical facies was identified to be calcium-bicarbonate-type (CaHCO3). A higher concentration of metals including Fe, Mn, As and Pb was found indicating various health hazards. The rock-water interaction was the major geochemical process controlling the chemistry of groundwater in the study area. The study results revealed that the quality of the groundwater in Rajshahi City area was of great concern and not suitable for human consumption without adequate treatment.					Mostafa, Md.

Water with desirable quality is necessary for human life. Therefore, knowledge of water quality and its temporal changes is of particular importance in sustainable management of water resources. In this study, available data during 20 years from two hydrometry stations located in the way of Horroud River in Lorestan province were used and analyzed using Aq.QA software. Piper, Schoeller, Stiff, and Wilcox diagram were drawn and Mann-Kendal test was used for determining data trend. According to Wilcox diagram, water of this river in both stations is placed in c(2)s(1) class which is good for agricultural purposes, and according to Schoeller diagram, there is no restrict for drinking purposes. Results of Man-Kendal test show increasing trend for colorine, EC, TDS while decreasing trend for potassium in Kakareza station. On the other hand in Dehnu station, positive trend was seen in calcium and colorine while negative trend for sulfate and potassium. For other variables, no specific trend was found.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				DEC	2017	7	8					4725	4733		10.1007/s13201-017-0635-0								WOS:000416833900043

A total of sixteen physico-chemical parameters including temperature, hardness, alkalinity, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, pH, calcium, magnesium, chlorides, nitrates, sulphates and phosphates were recorded during 2014 and 2015 between June and August in ice-free period. The mean values of pH ranged from 6.85 to 7.10; water temperature fluctuated from 0.1 to 0.3 A degrees C; dissolved oxygen varied from 5.90 to 6.0 mg.L-1; free CO2 varied from 8.40 to 8.60 mg.L-1; total dissolved solids varied from 88.0 to 89.5 mg.L-1; calcium from 7.88 to 7.95 mg.L-1; magnesium from 0.53 to 0.66 mg.L-1. All the physico-chemical values were within the prescribed WHO/BIS limit for drinking water. Water Quality Index (WQI) calculated based on these parameters also revealed the excellent quality of lake water.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				DEC	2017	7	8					4757	4764		10.1007/s13201-017-0638-x								WOS:000416833900046

Despite human dependence on river systems, anthropogenic activities severely degrade water quality. The main aim of this study was to assess the river health of Ngamo River using diatom and macroinvertebrate community structure based on multivariate analyses and community metrics. Ammonia, pH, salinity, total phosphorus and temperature were found to be significantly different among the study seasons. The diatom and macroinvertebrate taxa richness increased downstream suggesting an improvement in water as we moved away from the pollution point sources. Canonical correspondence analyses identified nutrients (total nitrogen and reactive phosphorus) as important variables structuring diatom and macroinvertebrate community. The community metrics and diversity indices for both bioindicators highlighted that the water quality of the river system was very poor. These findings indicate that both methods can be used for water quality assessments, e.g. sewage and agricultural pollution, and they show high potential for use during water quality monitoring programmes in other regions.

J	Turner, RE				Turner, R. Eugene			The mineral sediment loading of the modern Mississippi River Delta: what is the restoration baseline?	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												A restoration baseline for river deltas establishes a framework for achieving goals that can be thwarted by choosing an improper historical background. The problem addressed here is identify the size of the modern Mississippi River delta that restoration should use as that baseline. The sediment loading to the Mississippi River main stem delta fluctuated over the last 160 years with a consequential dependent plasticity in delta size. A visual time series of the delta size is presented, and the area: sediment loading ratio is calculated. This ratio ranged from 1.8 to 3.9 km(2) per Mmt sediment y(-1) during the pre-European colonization of the watershed in the 1800s, a maximum size in the 1930s, and then lower after soil conservation and dam construction decades later. This land building rate is similar to the 1.3 to 3.7 km(2) per Mmt sediment y(-1) for the Wax Lake and Atchafalaya sub-deltas located to the west, which receives some of the Mississippi River sediment and water from the main channel below St. Francisville, LA. The significance to restoration of delta land lost since the 1930s is that the baseline for the 1930s was conditioned on previous sediment loading that has since declined. Most sediment is trapped in the delta, and so the existing situation is close to a zero-sum land balance. The restoration potential should be based on the delta land area that could be built from the current sediment loading, not from those of the era during peak agricultural expansion and soil erosion in the watershed. Sediment diversions upstream will, therefore, deplete sediment supply downstream where delta land will be lost. The choice of which baseline is used can be seen as a choice between unrealistic perceptions that leads to unachievable goals and agency failures, or, the realism of a delta size limited by current sediment loading.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				DEC	2017	21	6					867	872		10.1007/s11852-017-0547-z								WOS:000416870600012

Estimation of potential zones for offshore mariculture in the Indian Sea using geographical information system as a management tool	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												Coastal mariculture is now facing tremendous pressures, especially from the anthropogenic activities, variable environment, and multi-user conflict. Hence, offshore mariculture is envisioned to enhance the production by promoting the commercial farming (floating cages) of cobia (Rachycentron canadum) and other fin fishes. Essential environmental parameters for mariculture have been selected and converted into thematic layers using Geographical Information System (GIS) tool. Weights of relative importance were assigned to each layer and integrated together through overlay analysis to provide a final model suggesting possible offshore floating marine fish cage deployment sites. In the present study, it is estimated that from 368,009 km(2) area within 100 m depth of Indian Exclusive Economic Zone available for mariculture activities, about 161,188 km(2) area is appropriate for deploying cages. There are 76,396 km(2) of highly suitable and approximately 84,792 km(2) of suitable areas available for mariculture in India including Andaman & Nicobar and Lakshadweep Islands. Analysis of variance (ANOVA-one way) showed significant (p < 0.05) spatial variation for sea surface current, total suspended matter, and chlorophyll-a. This study is an attempt to integrate the weighing criteria and GIS to derive a suitable criterion for deployment of floating cages in the offshore environment, which could serve as a model for similar cases, particularly in the maritime nations for sustainable mariculture.

The in-situ data of water nutrient concentration was collected during the period 2002-2010 by COMAPS from the coastal waters of Gujarat and Maharashtra for the development of algorithms as a part of the application of remote sensing for biochemical cycling in the ocean. Multiple regression analysis was used to develop models for the nutrients and suspended sediments and the results showed the strong correlation between the water nutrients under study and suspended sediment variables with the remote sensing data, having the validated R-2 value of 0.7472 (Total Nitrogen),0.8744 (Total Phosphorus) and 0.971 (Suspended Sediment) respectively in marine waters. The models helped understand the seasonal variability and were also applied to one of the latest sensor VIIRS, which came up with the same results as those derived from MODIS. Thus the models can be used for the real time monitoring of water quality and for the development of an alert system using remote sensing data from both MODIS and VIIRS sensor systems.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				DEC	2017	21	6					917	927		10.1007/s11852-017-0561-1								WOS:000416870600017

Evaluation of water quality is normally based on time consuming and expensive in situ measurements. Remotely sensed data is an efficient alternative for field monitoring because of its spatial and temporal coverage. In this study, remote sensing imagery combined with in situ measurements of water quality were used to estimate an empirical relationship between water surface reflectance and water quality parameters including water turbidity and Total Suspended Sediment (TSS). Surface reflectance values is obtained from MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard the Aqua satellite. The empirical equations were derived from data over summers 2011-13 and show high correlation coefficients of equal to 0.83 and 0.87 for TSS and turbidity respectively. The validity of the proposed equations was tested for summer 2014 data. The NRMSE for prediction of measured data by the proposed equations are 0.36 and 0.3 for TSS and turbidity. Remotely sensed data was also used to produce water quality maps to improve our understanding of the spatiotemporal variations of Fox River turbid plume. The proposed approach can be extended to other coastal regions of Great Lakes and provide a framework to study pollution transportation in coastal areas.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				DEC	2017	21	6					939	950		10.1007/s11852-017-0564-y								WOS:000416870600019

In search of an alternative organic fertilizer for fish culture, the nutrient potential of HU was evaluated. Fries of Indian carps and larvae of freshwater prawn were reared for 120 days under six conditions: (a) aerated and (b) non-aerated fresh HU (0.01%), (c) cattle manure (CM; 1.8 kg tank(-1)), mixed treatment with CM and HU under (d) iso-phosphorus and (e) iso-nitrogenous condition and (f) control. Monitoring of water quality and biological parameters revealed that total fish yield was the highest in CM (621.5 g tank(-1)) followed by mixed treatments under iso-nitrogenous (428 g tank(-1)) and iso-phosphorus (333 g tank(-1)) conditions, aerated HU (321 g tank(-1)) and HU (319 g tank(-1)). The gross primary productivity (GPP) in HU was satisfactory (601.8 mg C m(-2) h(-1)) and superior to all but CM treatment. The abundance of heterotrophic bacteria (HB) was highest in CM and lowest in HU. Both GPP and HB population were correlated positively with fish yield per tank. Although pH in all treatments remained high (pH 8.4-8.9), no ammonia toxicity was observed. No E. coli infestation in any fish muscle was encountered. The concentrations of cadmium and lead in fish muscle were within respective safe level. The study established that high fertilizer potential of HU could be exploited as an alternative organic fertilizer or as a candidate to be blended with cattle manure.

J	Valkama, P; Ruth, O				Valkama, Pasi; Ruth, Olli			Impact of calculation method, sampling frequency and hysteresis on suspended solids and total phosphorus load estimations in cold climate	HYDROLOGY RESEARCH												Load calculations of nutrients and suspended solids (SS) transported by rivers are usually based on discrete water samples. Water quality changes in cold climate regions often occur very rapidly and therefore discrete samples are unrepresentative of the range of water quality occurring. This leads to errors of varying magnitude in load calculation. High-resolution turbidity data were used to determine the SS and total phosphorus (TP), and paired with discharge to determine loads from two small catchments in southern Finland. The effect of sampling frequency was investigated by artificially sub-sampling the high frequency concentrations. Regardless of the sampling frequency, the TP load was more likely underestimated while using discrete samples. To achieve +/- 20% accuracy compared with the reference load, daily sampling should be performed. Hysteresis was detected to have an impact on TP load. Hysteresis analysis also revealed the main source of the TP to be in the fields of the catchment. Continuous measuring proved to be a valuable method for defining loads and short-term fluctuations in water quality in small clayey watercourses in a boreal cold climate, where the climate change will increase the frequency of winter floods.																	1998-9563	2224-7955				DEC	2017	48	6					1594	1610		10.2166/nh.2017.199								WOS:000416144600010

However, their provisioning has been under the increasing pressure from both natural and socio-economic changes. This paper aims to assess the most significant hazards, such as water quality, nitrogen deposition, erosion, floods, invasive species, urbanisation and contaminated sites affecting delivery of ecosystem services in the Czech Republic. Using the multi-hazard assessment, the integrated risk index for ecosystem service provisioning was proposed. The spatial analysis based on this approach was then applied to the Czech Republic as a case study. The results showed that about 48% of the area falls into the very low risk category followed by 30%, 21%, and 1% for low, medium and high categories, respectively. Forest and wetland ecosystems were estimated to have the highest proportion of their total area among the highest risk values. Moreover, we found that the national parks appeared to have the highest proportion of medium- and high-risk classes among the natural areas. The approach presented in this study should aggregate the existing knowledge on ecosystem services and hazards and thus monitor the integrated risk. The results are intended to help with various planning and management decisions at both the national and regional levels and to bring more attention on the most problematic hot-spots.

On Tutuila, the main island of American Samoa, production wells in the most populated region (the Tafuna-Leone Plain) produce most of the island's drinking water. However, much of this water has been deemed unsafe to drink since 2009. Tutuila has three predominant anthropogenic non-point-groundwater-pollution sources of concern: on-site disposal systems (OSDS), agricultural chemicals, and pig manure. These sources are broadly distributed throughout the landscape and are located near many drinking-water wells. Water quality analyses show a link between elevated levels of total dissolved groundwater nitrogen (TN) and areas with high non-point-source pollution density, suggesting that TN can be used as a tracer of groundwater contamination from these sources. The modeling framework used in this study integrates land-use information, hydrological data, and water quality analyses with nitrogen loading and transport models. The approach utilizes a numerical groundwater flow model, a nitrogen-loading model, and a multi-species contaminant transport model. Nitrogen from each source is modeled as an independent component in order to trace the impact from individual land-use activities. Model results are calibrated and validated with dissolved groundwater TN concentrations and inorganic delta N-15 values, respectively. Results indicate that OSDS contribute significantly more TN to Tutuila's aquifers than other sources, and thus should be prioritized in future water-quality management efforts.																	1431-2174	1435-0157				DEC	2017	25	8					2419	2434		10.1007/s10040-017-1617-x								WOS:000415195900015

A highly specific Escherichia coil qPCR and its comparison with existing methods for environmental waters	WATER RESEARCH												The presence of Escherichia coil in environmental waters is considered as evidence of faecal contamination and is therefore commonly used as an indicator in both water quality and food safety analysis. The long period of time between sample collection and obtaining results from existing culture based methods means that contamination events may already impact public health by the time they are detected. The adoption of molecular based methods for E. coil could significantly reduce the time to detection. A new quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay was developed to detect the ybbW gene sequence, which was found to be 100% exclusive and inclusive (specific and sensitive) for E. coil and directly compared for its ability to quantify E. coil in environmental waters against colony counts, quantitative real-time NASBA (qNASBA) targeting clpB and qPCR targeting uidA. Of the 87 E. coil strains tested, 100% were found to be ybbW positive, 94.2% were culture positive, 100% were clpB positive and 98.9% were uidA positive. The qPCR assays had a linear range of quantification over several orders of magnitude, and had high amplification efficiencies when using single isolates as a template. This compared favourably with qNASBA which showed poor linearity and amplification efficiency. When the assays were applied to environmental water samples, qNASBA was unable to reliably quantify E. coil while both qPCR assays were capable of predicting E. coli concentrations in environmental waters. This study highlights the inability of qNASBA targeting mRNA to quantify E. coli in environmental waters, and presents the first E. coli qPCR assay with 100% target exclusivity. The application of a highly exclusive and inclusive qPCR assay has the potential to allow water quality managers to reliably and rapidly detect and quantify E. coli and therefore take appropriate measures to reduce the risk to public health posed by faecal contamination.

In the present study, the toxicity removal during wastewater treatment at seven municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) was investigated using an effect-based approach. A battery of eight bioassays was applied comprising of cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, endocrine disruption and fish embryo toxicity assays. Human cell-based CALUX assays, transgenic larval models and the fish embryo toxicity test were particularly sensitive to WWTP effluents. The results indicate that most effects were significantly reduced or completely removed during wastewater treatment (76-100%), while embryo toxicity, estrogenic activity and thyroid disruption were still detectable in the effluents suggesting that some harmful substances remain after treatment. The responsiveness of the bioassays was compared and the human cell-based CALUX assays showed highest responsiveness in the samples. Additionally, the fish embryo toxicity test and the transgenic larval models for endocrine disrupting effects showed high responsiveness at low sample concentrations in nearly all of the effluent samples. The results showed a similar effect pattern among all WWTPs investigated, indicating that the wastewater composition could be rather similar at different locations. There were no considerable differences in the toxicity removal efficiencies of the treatment plants and no correlation was observed with WWTP characteristics, such as process configuration or sludge age. This study demonstrated that a biotest battery comprising of multiple endpoints can serve as a powerful tool when assessing water quality or water treatment efficiency in a holistic manner. Rather than analyzing the concentrations of a few selected chemicals, bioassays can be used to complement traditional methods of monitoring in the future by assessing sum-parameter based effects, such as mixture effects, and tackling chemicals that are present at concentrations below chemical analytical detection limits.

Removal of selected emerging PPCP compounds using greater duckweed (Spirodela polyrhiza) based lab-scale free water constructed wetland	WATER RESEARCH												Greater duckweed (Spirodela polyrhiza) based lab-scale free water constructed wetland (CW) was employed for removing four emerging pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) (i.e. DEET, paracetamol, caffeine and triclosan). Orthogonal design was used to test the effect of light intensity, aeration, E.coli abundance and plant biomass on the target compounds. Synthetic wastewater contaminated with the target compounds at concentration of 25 mu g/L. was prepared, and both batch and continuous flow experiments were conducted. Up to 100% removals were achieved for paracetamol (PAR), caffeine (CAF) and tricolsan (TCS) while the highest removal for DEET was 32.2% in batch tests. Based on orthogonal Duncan analysis, high light intensity (240 mu molmm(-2)s(-1)), full aeration, high plant biomass (1.00 kg/m(2)) and high E.coli abundance (1.0 x 10(6) CFU/100 mL) favoured elimination of the PPCPs. Batch verification test achieved removals of 17.1%, 98.8%, 96.4% and 95.4% for DEET, PAR, CAF and TCS respectively. Continuous flow tests with CW only and CW followed by stabilization tank (CW-ST) were carried out. Final removals of the PPCP contaminants were 32.6%, 97.7%, 98.0% and 100% for DEET, PAR, CAF and TCS, respectively, by CW system alone, while 43.3%, 97.5%, 98.2% and 100%, respectively, were achieved by CW-ST system. By adding the ST tank, PPCP concentrations decreased significantly faster (p < 0.05) compared with continuous flow CW alone. In addition, after removing aerators during continuous flow CW experiments, the treatment systems presented good stability for the PPCP removals. CW-ST showed better chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC) removals (89.3%, 91.2%, respectively) than CW only (79.4%, 85.2%, respectively). However, poor DEET removal (<50%) and high E.coli abundance (up to 1.7 log increase) in the final treated water indicated further treatment processes may be required. Statistical analysis showed significant correlations (p < 0.05) between PPCPs and water quality parameters (e.g. COD, nitrate, phosphate), and between the four PPCP compounds for the continuous flow CW and CW-ST systems. Positive results encourage further test of Greater duckweed at pilot scale ON using real wastewater. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

A risk-based approach for developing standards for irrigation with reclaimed water	WATER RESEARCH												A generalised quantitative risk assessment (QRA) is developed to assess the potential harm to human health resulting from irrigation with reclaimed water. The QRA is conducted as a backward calculation starting from a pre-defined acceptable risk level at the receptor point (defined as an annual infection risk of 10(-4) for pathogens and by reference doses (RfD) for chemical hazards) and results in an estimate of the corresponding acceptable concentration levels of the given hazards in the effluent. In this way the QRA is designed to inform the level of water treatment required to achieve an acceptable risk level and help establish reclaimed water quality standards. The QRA considers the exposure of human receptors to microbial and chemical hazards in the effluent through various exposure pathways and routes depending on the specific irrigation scenario. By considering multiple pathways and routes, a number of key aspects relevant to estimating human exposure to recycled water can be accounted for, including irrigation and crop handling practices (e.g., non-edible vs edible, spray vs. drip, withholding time) and volumes consumed (directly vs indirectly). The QRA relies on a large number of inputs, many of which were found to be highly uncertain. A possibilistic approach, based on fuzzy set theory, was used to propagate the uncertain input values through the QRA model to estimate the possible range of hazard concentrations that are deemed acceptable/safe for reclaimed water irrigation. Two scenarios were considered: amenity irrigation and irrigation of ready-to-eat food crops, and calculations were carried out for six example hazards (norovirus, Cryptosporidium, cadmium, lead, PCB118 and naphthalene) and using UK-specific input values. The human health risks associated with using reclaimed water for amenity irrigation were overall deemed low, i.e. the calculated acceptable concentration levels for most of the selected hazards were generally far greater than levels typically measured in effluent from wastewater treatment plants; however the predicted acceptable concentration levels for norovirus and Cryptosporidium suggested that disinfection by UV may be required before use. It was found that stricter concentration standards were required for hazards that are more strongly bound to soil and/or are more toxic/infectious. It was also found that measures that reduce the amount of effluent directly ingested by the receptor would significantly reduce the risks (by up to 2 orders of magnitude for the two pathogens). The results for the food crop irrigation scenario showed that stricter concentration standards are required to ensure the effluent is safe to use. For pathogens, the dominant exposure route was found to be ingestion of effluent captured on the surface of the crops indicating that risks could be significantly reduced by restricting irrigation to the non-edible parts of the crop. The results also showed that the exposure to some organic compounds and heavy metals through plant uptake and attached soil particles could be high and possibly pose unacceptable risk to human health. For both scenarios, we show that the predicted acceptable concentration levels are associated with large uncertainty and discuss the implications this has for defining quality standards and how the uncertainty can be reduced.

Nutrient loading impacts on culturable E. coil and other heterotrophic bacteria fate in simulated stream mesocosms	WATER RESEARCH												Understanding fecal indicator bacteria persistence in aquatic environments is important when making management decisions to improve instream water quality. Routinely, bacteria fate and transport models that rely on published kinetic decay constants are used to inform such decision making but may not adequately represent instream conditions. The objective of this work was to evaluate bacterial responses to applied nutrient amendments and provide additional information regarding bacterial response to applied changes that can be incorporated into future modeling efforts. Re-created stream mesocosms were established in laboratory-based, repurposed algae raceways filled with water and sediment from a small, 3rd order Southeast Texas stream. Mesocosm treatments consisted of low (10x) or high (50x) nutrient doses above ambient water concentrations operated at low (0.032 m/s) or high (0.141 m/s) flow rates. Escherichia coli and heterotrophic bacterial concentrations were quantified in water and sediment over 22 days. No significant differences in kinetic constants were observed among E. coli in water or sediment, and only E. coli in sediment showed any growth response. Heterotrophic plate counts revealed a pronounced growth response in water and sediment within 24 h of nutrient addition but did not differ significantly from control mesocosms. Significant kinetic constant differences between E. coli and heterotrophic bacteria in water were identified (p < 0.01) but did not differ significantly in sediment (p > 0.48). Results indicate that nutrient addition does affect microbial numbers instream, but competition from heterotrophic bacteria may prevent an E. coli growth response. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Ozcan, Z; Kentel, E; Alp, E				Ozcan, Zeynep; Kentel, Elcin; Alp, Emre			Evaluation of the best management practices in a semi-arid region with high agricultural activity	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												The arid and semi-arid regions with water scarcity are vulnerable to several stressors such as urbanization, high water demand created by agricultural and industrial activities, point and non-point pollution sources, and climate change. Hence, proactive policies and sustainable water management strategies that are based on decision support systems are crucial in arid and semi-arid regions. Because of large expenses and implementation difficulties associated with the diffuse pollution abatement plans, many authorities are hesitant to initiate, especially those that may present a financial burden on population. Lake Mogan, a shallow lake, is located in a semi-arid region dominated by dry agricultural activities and has been in eutrophic state for the past 20 years. There has been several management alternatives suggested to improve the water quality in Lake Mogan and one of the alternative is the application of BMPs that include fertilizer management, conservation/no tillage, contouring, and terracing to reduce the amount of diffuse source pollutants. In this study, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) Model is applied to evaluate the effectiveness of agricultural best management practices (BMPs) in the Lake Mogan watershed located in a semi-arid region. The most effective BMP scenario was found as the one in which three individual BMP scenarios (30% fertilizer reduction, no tillage, and terracing) were combined. With this scenario average annual load reductions of 9.3%, 8.6%, 8.0%, and 11.1% were achieved in sediment, nitrate, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus, respectively. Even with the most effective BMP strategy, high levels of nutrient reduction will not be achieved since non-irrigated agriculture and intermittent low-flow streams accounts majority of the study area. The outcomes suggest integrated solutions should be developed to improve water quality in Lake Mogan. It is aimed that this study will aid decision makers to implement effective best management practices in watersheds showing similar characteristics (i.e. topographical, hydrologic processes, LULC (Land use land cover) characteristics, agricultural activities, meteorological etc.) with the study area.

J	Lee, YG; Jang, A				Lee, Yong-Gu; Jang, Am			Application of sensitive electrochemical sensing system for detecting bromate from disinfection process in desalination plant	DESALINATION												Chlorination is the most commonly used in disinfection to prevent from the bacterial growth in both intake and distribution pipelines or storage tanks. However, the disinfection treatment can result in an undesirable by-product, such a bromate (BrO3-), which is a suspected human carcinogen. Seawater has a high potential of BrO3- formation because of high bromide (Br-) concentration (around 65 mg/L) which can be transformed by chlorination in disinfection process. Therefore, the measurement or monitoring of BrO3- formation is necessary. This study aims to apply the sensitive amperometric sensing system for detecting BrO3- in free chlorine condition. A linear dynamic ranged from 60 to 200 nM of BrO3- even in 28 mu M free chlorine solution with a sensitivity of 108.8 mu A/mu M. The detection limit level of BrO3- was 38.6 nM and the limit of quantification value of BrO3- was 113.7 nM (at pH 7). This detection limit value was half of global guideline value for drinldng water. The proposed technique had no noticeable interference to the sensing of BrO3- over various potentially interfering agents and other chlorinated disinfection by-products. The data measured by multilayered sensor system was in a good agreement for detecting BrO3- with validated data measured by using a conventional UV-vis spectroscopic method. As a final demonstration, the proposed amperometric sensing system would significantly contribute to the on-site detection of BrO3- concentration from chlorinating disinfection process within drinking water treatment plants, including desalination, and water quality monitoring applications.																	0011-9164	1873-4464				DEC 1	2017	423						135	140		10.1016/j.desal.2017.09.011								WOS:000413389300013						
J	Su, H; Kang, WD; Xu, YJ; Wang, JD				Su, He; Kang, Weidong; Xu, Yuanjun; Wang, Jiading			Assessment of Groundwater Quality and Health Risk in the Oil and Gas Field of Dingbian County, Northwest China	EXPOSURE AND HEALTH												In order to determine the groundwater quality status and health risks caused by target pollutants in the oil and gas field of Dingbian County, 30 groundwater samples were collected and quantitative analyses of 20 parameters. Hydrogeochemical characteristics of groundwater was analysed using Durov diagram, statistical analysis, Gibbs diagram and correlation analysis. Entropy weighted water quality index evaluated groundwater quality. Health risk assessment model was used to evaluate the health risk to adults and children caused by target pollutants (NO3 (-), NH4 (+), NO2 (-), F-, Mn, Zn, Ba2+, As and Cr6+) through direct ingestion and dermal absorption. The results show that the groundwater is alkaline in the study area and the abundance of cations is Na+ > Mg2+ > Ca2+ > K+ and anions is SO4 (2-) > Cl- > HCO3 (-). All evaluation indicators except K+, NH4 (+), Zn and Ba2+ in groundwater exceed the permissible limits of drinking water. Gibbs diagrams display that evaporation crystallisation and rock weathering control the groundwater hydrochemical components. The study shows 53.4% of groundwater samples are not suitable for drinking in the study area. Total dissolved solids (TDS), Mg2+, Na+, SO4 (2-), Cl- and total hardness are the main contaminants which mainly come from industrial activities. The health risk assessment shows that the total risks of carcinogens (As and Cr6+) to adults and children are 4.20 x 10(-4) and 1.14 x 10(-3) per year, respectively, which are far higher than the International Commission on Radiologic Protection recommended maximum acceptable annual level (5.0 x 10(-6) per year).																	2451-9766	2451-9685				DEC	2017	9	4					227	242		10.1007/s12403-016-0234-6								WOS:000414200000001

Safe drinking water is one of the major prerequisites for a healthy life. The current study assessed the contamination of drinking water including physicochemical parameters (pH, TDS, EC, TH, Cl1-, NO3 (1-), PO4 (3-), SO4 (2-), Mn, Cd, Pb, Ni, Cr) and bacteriological contamination (Fecal coliform) in chromite mining-impacted areas of Pakistan. However, the main focus of the study was to identify the potential health risk of these parameters to the local people of the study area. Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (Perkin Elmer, AAS-PEA-700) was used to analyze the concentrations of potentially toxic metals. The concentrations of Cd, Pb, Ni, and Cr ranged from below detection limit (BDL)-7.20, BDL-14.4, BDL-78.3 and 0.20-69.0 and exceeded their respective limits in 31, 11, 17, and 36% samples of drinking water set by World Health Organization, while the concentration of Ni (63% samples) also exceeded the safe limit set by Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency. Furthermore, the chronic daily intake (CDI) and health risk index (HRI) of potentially toxic metals through consumption of drinking water were found in the order of Mn > Ni > Cr > Cd > Pb and Cd > Ni > Mn > Pb > Cr, respectively. The HRI values of selected toxic metals in mining-impacted sites were found within the safe limit (HRI < 1). The results showed that both geogenic and anthropogenic activities were the main sources of drinking water contamination in the study area.																	2451-9766	2451-9685				DEC	2017	9	4					275	287		10.1007/s12403-016-0240-8								WOS:000414200000005

Applying the HPT-GWS for Hydrostratigraphy, Water Quality and Aquifer Recharge Investigations	GROUND WATER MONITORING AND REMEDIATION												The primary objective of this study was to evaluate use of the hydraulic profiling tool-groundwater sampler (HPT-GWS) log data as an indicator of water quality (level of dissolved ionic species) in an alluvial aquifer. The HPT-GWS probe is designed for direct push advancement into unconsolidated formations. The system provides both injection pressure logs and electrical conductivity (EC) logs, and groundwater may be sampled at multiple depths as the probe is advanced (profiling). The combination of these three capabilities in one probe has not previously been available. During field work it was observed that when HPT corrected pressure (P-c) indicates a consistent aquifer unit then bulk formation EC can be used as an indicator of water quality. A high correlation coefficient (R-2 = 0.93) was observed between groundwater specific conductance and bulk formation EC in the sands and gravels of the alluvial aquifer studied. These results indicate that groundwater specific conductance is exerting a controlling influence on the bulk formation EC of the coarse-grained unit at this site, and probably many similar sites, consistent with Archie's Law. This simple relationship enables the use of the EC and P-c logs, with targeted water samples and a minimum of core samples, to rapidly assess groundwater quality over extended areas at high vertical resolution. This method was used to identify both a brine impacted zone at the base of the aquifer investigated and a groundwater recharge lens developing below storm water holding ponds in the upper portion of the same aquifer. Sample results for trace level, naturally occurring elements (As, Ba, U) further demonstrate the use of this system to sample for low level groundwater contamination.																	1069-3629	1745-6592				WIN	2017	37	1					78	91		10.1111/gwmr.12193								WOS:000395067500007

The role of land surface versus drainage network characteristics in controlling water quality and quantity in a small urban watershed	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The processes that control run-off quantity and quality in urban watersheds are complex and not well understood. Although impervious surface coverage has traditionally been used to examine altered hydrologic response in urban watersheds, several studies suggest that other elements of the urban landscape, particularly those associated with urban infrastructure and the drainage system, play an equally important role. The relative importance of impervious surfaces, stormwater ponds, expansion of the drainage network, and drainage network structures in controlling hydrologic response was examined in the subwatersheds of the Kromma Kill, an urban watershed located in Albany County, NY. In this study, geographic information systems was used to compute geospatial land surface and drainage network properties of 5 Kromma Kill subwatersheds. In these same subwatersheds, water quantity (rainfall and run-off) and quality (macroinvertebrates, nitrate, total nitrogen, dissolved oxygen, total dissolved solids, and nonpurgable organic carbon) parameters were measured. Strong and significant correlations were identified between land surface and drainage network properties and field observations. Causal relationships were then tested using the Environmental Protection Agency's Stormwater Management Model. Field and model analyses suggest that whereas percent imperviousness is a dominant control on water quality, drainage density and slope are equally important. However, for water quantity, whereas imperviousness is positively correlated with increased run-off volumes, drainage network properties and slope are the dominant controls on run-off volumes. Results have important implications for stormwater management plans, especially those aimed at reducing the effective impervious surface coverage of urban watersheds. Reducing the percentage of effective imperviousness in a watershed is not a one size fits all solution and can help to meet some management objectives, such as reducing nitrogen concentrations and improving water quality, but may not serve as the most effective, and therefore economical, solution for every management objective including reducing run-off volumes.																	0885-6087	1099-1085				NOV 30	2017	31	24					4384	4397		10.1002/hyp.11367								WOS:000416149500010						
J	Hartmann, A; Barbera, JA; Andreo, B				Hartmann, Andreas; Barbera, Juan Antonio; Andreo, Bartolome			On the value of water quality data and informative flow states in karst modelling	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												If properly applied, karst hydrological models are a valuable tool for karst water resource management. If they are able to reproduce the relevant flow and storage processes of a karst system, they can be used for prediction of water resource availability when climate or land use are expected to change. A common challenge to apply karst simulation models is the limited availability of observations to identify their model parameters. In this study, we quantify the value of information when water quality data (NO3- and SO42-) is used in addition to discharge observations to estimate the parameters of a process-based karst simulation model at a test site in southern Spain. We use a three-step procedure to (1) confine an initial sample of 500 000 model parameter sets by discharge and water quality observations, (2) identify alterations of model parameter distributions through the confinement, and (3) quantify the strength of the confinement for the model parameters. We repeat this procedure for flow states, for which the system discharge is controlled by the unsaturated zone, the saturated zone, and the entire time period including times when the spring is influenced by a nearby river. Our results indicate that NO3- provides the most information to identify the model parameters controlling soil and epikarst dynamics during the unsaturated flow state. During the saturated flow state, SO42- and discharge observations provide the best information to identify the model parameters related to groundwater processes. We found reduced parameter identifiability when the entire time period is used as the river influence disturbs parameter estimation. We finally show that most reliable simulations are obtained when a combination of discharge and water quality date is used for the combined unsaturated and saturated flow states.

J	Arnoux, M; Barbecot, F; Gibert-Brunet, E; Gibson, J; Noret, A				Arnoux, Marie; Barbecot, Florent; Gibert-Brunet, Elisabeth; Gibson, John; Noret, Aurelie			Impacts of changes in groundwater recharge on the isotopic composition and geochemistry of seasonally ice-covered lakes: insights for sustainable management	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Lakes are under increasing pressure due to widespread anthropogenic impacts related to rapid development and population growth. Accordingly, many lakes are currently undergoing a systematic decline in water quality. Recent studies have highlighted that global warming and the subsequent changes in water use may further exacerbate eutrophication in lakes. Lake evolution depends strongly on hydrologic balance, and therefore on groundwater connectivity. Groundwater also influences the sensitivity of lacustrine ecosystems to climate and environmental changes, and governs their resilience. Improved characterization of groundwater exchange with lakes is needed today for lake preservation, lake restoration, and sustainable management of lake water quality into the future. In this context, the aim of the present paper is to determine if the future evolution of the climate, the population, and the recharge could modify the geochemistry of lakes (mainly isotopic signature and quality via phosphorous load) and if the isotopic monitoring of lakes could be an efficient tool to highlight the variability of the water budget and quality. ' Small groundwater-connected lakes were chosen to simulate changes in water balance and water quality expected under future climate change scenarios, namely representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. Contemporary baseline conditions, including isotope mass balance and geochemical characteristics, were determined through an intensive field-based research program prior to the simulations. Results highlight that future lake geochemistry and isotopic composition trends will depend on four main parameters: lo-cation (and therefore climate conditions), lake catchment size (which impacts the intensity of the flux change), lake volume (which impacts the range of variation), and lake G index (i.e., the percentage of groundwater that makes up total lake inflows), the latter being the dominant control on water balance conditions, as revealed by the sensitivity of lake isotopic composition. Based on these model simulations, stable isotopes appear to be especially useful for detecting changes in recharge to lakes with a G index of between 50 and 80 %, but response is non-linear. Simulated monthly trends reveal that evolution of annual lake isotopic composition can be dampened by opposing monthly recharge fluctuations. It is also shown that changes in water quality in groundwater-connected lakes depend significantly on lake location and on the intensity of recharge change.

Consequently, these flows ignore the inter-annual flow variability that rules species with longer lifecycles and therefore disregard the long-term perspective of the riverine ecosystem. We analyzed the importance of considering riparian requirements for the long-term efficiency of environmental flows. For that analysis, we modeled the riparian vegetation development for a decade facing different environmental flows in two case studies. Next, we assessed the corresponding fish habitat availability of three common fish species in each of the resulting riparian landscape scenarios. Modeling results demonstrated that the environmental flows disregarding riparian vegetation requirements promoted riparian degradation, particularly vegetation encroachment. Such circumstance altered the hydraulic characteristics of the river channel where flow depths and velocities underwent local changes of up to 10 cm and 40 cm s(-1), respectively. Accordingly, after a decade of this flow regime, the available habitat area for the considered fish species experienced modifications of up to 110 % when compared to the natural habitat. In turn, environmental flows regarding riparian vegetation requirements were able to maintain riparian vegetation near natural standards, thereby preserving the hydraulic characteristics of the river channel and sustaining the fish habitat close to the natural condition. As a result, fish habitat availability never changed more than 17 % from the natural habitat.

Assessing the chemical contamination dynamics in a mixed land use stream system	WATER RESEARCH												Traditionally, the monitoring of streams for chemical and ecological status has been limited to surface water concentrations, where the dominant focus has been on general water quality and the risk for eutrophication. Mixed land use stream systems, comprising urban areas and agricultural production, are challenging to assess with multiple chemical stressors impacting stream corridors. New approaches are urgently needed for identifying relevant sources, pathways and potential impacts for implementation of suitable source management and remedial measures. We developed a method for risk assessing chemical stressors in these systems and applied the approach to a 16-km groundwater-fed stream corridor (Grindsted, Denmark). Three methods were combined: (i) in-stream contaminant mass discharge for source quantification, (ii) Toxic Units and (iii) environmental standards. An evaluation of the chemical quality of all three stream compartments stream water, hyporheic zone, streambed sediment made it possible to link chemical stressors to their respective sources and obtain new knowledge about source composition and origin. Moreover, toxic unit estimation and comparison to environmental standards revealed the stream water quality was substantially impaired by both geogenic and diffuse anthropogenic sources of metals along the entire corridor, while the streambed was less impacted. Quantification of the contaminant mass discharge originating from a former pharmaceutical factory revealed that several 100 legs of chlorinated ethenes and pharmaceutical compounds discharge into the stream every year. The strongly reduced redox conditions in the plume result in high concentrations of dissolved iron and additionally release arsenic, generating the complex contaminant mixture found in the narrow discharge zone. The fingerprint of the plume was observed in the stream several km downgradient, while nutrients, inorganics and pesticides played a minor role for the stream health. The results emphasize that future investigations should include multiple compounds and stream compartments, and highlight the need for holistic approaches when risk assessing these dynamic systems.

Stormwater management network effectiveness and implications for urban watershed function: A critical review	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Deleterious effects of urban stormwater are widely recognized. In several countries, regulations have been put into place to improve the conditions of receiving water bodies, but planning and engineering of stormwater control is typically carried out at smaller scales. Quantifying cumulative effectiveness of many stormwater control measures on a watershed scale is critical to understanding how small-scale practices translate to urban river health. We review 100 empirical and modelling studies of stormwater management effectiveness at the watershed scale in diverse physiographic settings. Effects of networks with stormwater control measures (SCMs) that promote infiltration and harvest have been more intensively studied than have detention-based SCM networks. Studies of peak flows and flow volumes are common, whereas baseflow, groundwater recharge, and evapotranspiration have received comparatively little attention. Export of nutrients and suspended sediments have been the primary water quality focus in the United States, whereas metals, particularly those associated with sediments, have received greater attention in Europe and Australia. Often, quantifying cumulative effects of stormwater management is complicated by needing to separate its signal from the signal of urbanization itself, innate watershed characteristics that lead to a range of hydrologic and water quality responses, and the varying functions of multiple types of SCMs. Biases in geographic distribution of study areas, and size and impervious surface cover of watersheds studied also limit our understanding of responses. We propose hysteretic trajectories for how watershed function responds to increasing imperviousness and stormwater management. Even where impervious area is treated with SCMs, watershed function may not be restored to its predevelopment condition because of the lack of treatment of all stormwater generated from impervious surfaces; non-additive effects of individual SCMs; and persistence of urban effects beyond impervious surfaces. In most cases, pollutant load decreases largely result from run-off reductions rather than lowered solute or particulate concentrations. Understanding interactions between natural and built landscapes, including stormwater management strategies, is critical for successfully managing detrimental impacts of stormwater at the watershed scale.

J	Hellwig, J; Stahl, K; Lange, J				Hellwig, Jost; Stahl, Kerstin; Lange, Jens			Patterns in the linkage of water quantity and quality during low-flows	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												This study investigates 72 catchments across the federal state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany, for changes in water quality during low-flow events. Data from the state's water quality monitoring network provided seven water quality parameters (water temperature, electrical conductivity, concentrations of chloride, sodium, sulfate, nitrate, and phosphate), which were statistically related to streamflow variability. Water temperature changes during low-flow showed seasonal dependence. Nitrate concentrations revealed high spatial heterogeneity with about one third of the stations showing decreasing values during low discharge. For most other parameters, concentrations increased during low-flow. Despite consistent trend directions, the magnitudes of changes with streamflow differed markedly across the state. Both multiple linear regression and a multiple analysis of variances were applied to explain these differences with the help of catchment characteristics. Results indicated that for sulfate and conductivity, geology of the catchments was the most important control, whereas for chloride, sodium, and nitrate, sewage treatment plants had the largest influence. For phosphate, no clear control could be identified. Independent from the applied method, land use was a less important control on river water quality during low-flow than geology or inflow from sewage treatment plants. These results show that the effects of diffuse and point sources, as well as those of natural and anthropogenic sources differ for different water quality parameters. Overall, a high diversity of potential water quality deterioration signals needs to be considered when the ecological status of rivers is to be protected during low-flow events.

J	Roberts, M; Hanley, N; Williams, S; Cresswell, W				Roberts, Michaela; Hanley, Nick; Williams, Sam; Cresswell, Will			Terrestrial degradation impacts on coral reef health: Evidence from the Caribbean	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Coral reefs are in decline worldwide. While coral reef managers are limited in their ability to tackle global challenges, such as ocean warming, managing local threats can increase the resilience of coral reefs to these global threats. One such local threat is high sediment inputs to coastal waters due to terrestrial over-grazing. Increases in terrestrial sediment input into coral reefs are associated with increased coral mortality, reduced growth rates, and changes in species composition, as well as alterations to fish communities. We used general linear models to investigate the link between vegetation ground cover and tree biomass index, within a dry-forest ecosystem, to coral cover, fish communities and visibility in the case study site of Bonaire, Caribbean Netherlands. We found a positive relationship between ground cover and coral cover below 10 m depth, and a negative relationship between tree biomass index and coral cover below 10 m. Greater ground cover is associated to sediment anchored through root systems, and higher surface complexity, slowing water flow, which would otherwise transport sediment. The negative relationship between tree biomass index and coral cover is unexpected, and may be a result of the deep roots associated with dry-forest trees, due to limited availability of water, which therefore do not anchor surface sediment, or contribute to surface complexity. Our analysis provides evidence that coral reef managers could improve reef health through engaging in terrestrial ecosystem protection, for example by taking steps to reduce grazing pressures, or in restoring degraded forest ecosystems.

Natural drivers are related primarily to the accentuated hydrodynamic processes, high rainfall and fluvial discharge. The anthropogenic driver is related to the lack of planning for beach development. These human pressures result in a reduction in the quality of the beaches through microbiological contamination, the accumulation of garbage on the sand and in the water, sewage outfalls, and overcrowding which, combined with the intense local hydrodynamics and the lack of planning of recreational activities (zoning, warning signs, lifeguard coverage) may increase the risk of accidents for beachgoers, such as drowning, and injuries caused by motorboats, jet skis and stingrays. Despite all the problems identified, no response whatsoever was observed from the local authorities. The results of the DPSIR analysis indicate an urgent need for the implementation of beach management plans to improve the conditions of the beaches and in particular their safety, as well as identifying the obligations of the local authorities responsible for the future development of the Amazon coast.

Assessment of drinking water quality at the tap using fluorescence spectroscopy	WATER RESEARCH												Treated drinking water may become contaminated while travelling in the distribution system on the way to consumers. Elevated dissolved organic matter (DOM) at the tap relative to the water leaving the treatment plant is a potential indicator of contamination, and can be measured sensitively, inexpensively and potentially on-line via fluorescence and absorbance spectroscopy. Detecting elevated DOM requires potential contamination events to be distinguished from natural fluctuations in the system, but how much natural variation to expect in a stable distribution system is unknown. In this study, relationships between DOM optical properties, microbial indicator organisms and trace elements were investigated for households connected to a biologically-stable drinking water distribution system. Across the network, humic-like fluorescence intensities showed limited variation (RSD = 3.5-4.4%), with half of measured variation explained by interactions with copper. After accounting for quenching by copper, fluorescence provided a very stable background signal (RSD < 2.2%) against which a similar to 2% infiltration of soil water would be detectable. Smaller infiltrations would be detectable in the case of contamination by sewage with a strong tryptophan-like fluorescence signal. These findings indicate that DOM fluorescence is a sensitive indicator of water quality changes in drinking water networks, as long as potential interferents are taken into account.

Control strategies for nitrous oxide emissions reduction on wastewater treatment plants operation	WATER RESEARCH												The present paper focused on reducing greenhouse gases emissions in wastewater treatment plants operation by application of suitable control strategies. Specifically, the objective is to reduce nitrous oxide emissions during the nitrification process. Incomplete nitrification in the aerobic tanks can lead to an accumulation of nitrite that triggers the nitrous oxide emissions. In order to avoid the peaks of nitrous oxide emissions, this paper proposes a cascade control configuration by manipulating the dissolved oxygen set-points in the aerobic tanks. This control strategy is combined with ammonia cascade control already applied in the literature. This is performed with the objective to take also into account effluent pollutants and operational costs. In addition, other greenhouse gases emissions sources are also evaluated. Results have been obtained by simulation, using a modified version of Benchmark Simulation Model no. 2, which takes into account greenhouse gases emissions. This is called Benchmark Simulation Model no. 2 Gas. The results show that the proposed control strategies are able to reduce by 29.86% of nitrous oxide emissions compared to the default control strategy, while maintaining a satisfactory tradeoff between water quality and costs.

J	Ahn, SR; Kim, SJ				Ahn, So Ra; Kim, Seong Joon			Assessment of integrated watershed health based on the natural environment, hydrology, water quality, and aquatic ecology	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Watershed health, including the natural environment, hydrology, water quality, and aquatic ecology, is assessed for the Han River basin (34 148 km(2)) in South Korea by using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The evaluation procedures follow those of the Healthy Watersheds Assessment by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Six components of the watershed landscape are examined to evaluate the watershed health (basin natural capacity): stream geomorphology, hydrology, water quality, aquatic habitat condition, and biological condition. In particular, the SWAT is applied to the study basin for the hydrology and water-quality components, including 237 sub-watersheds (within a standard watershed on the Korea Hydrologic Unit Map) along with three multipurpose dams, one hydroelectric dam, and three multifunction weirs. The SWAT is calibrated (2005-2009) and validated (2010-2014) by using each dam and weir operation, the flux-tower evapotranspiration, the time-domain reflectometry (TDR) soil moisture, and groundwater-level data for the hydrology assessment, and by using sediment, total phosphorus, and total nitrogen data for the water-quality assessment. The water balance, which considers the surface-groundwater interactions and variations in the stream-water quality, is quantified according to the sub-watershed-scale relationship between the watershed hydrologic cycle and stream-water quality. We assess the integrated watershed health according to the U.S. EPA evaluation process based on the vulnerability levels of the natural environment, water resources, water quality, and ecosystem components. The results indicate that the watershed's health declined during the most recent 10-year period of 2005-2014, as indicated by the worse results for the surface process metric and soil water dynamics compared to those of the 1995-2004 period. The integrated watershed health tended to decrease farther downstream within the watershed.

SWAT modeling of hydrology, sediment and nutrients from the Grand River, Ontario	WATER QUALITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF CANADA												The Grand River watershed (GRW) is an important agricultural area in Southern Ontario. Land use has been modified by various human endeavors, altering hydrology and increasing export of sediment and nutrients. The objective of this study was to predict spatial and temporal patterns of hydrology, and export of sediment and nutrients from the GRW to Lake Erie using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The Sequential Uncertainty FItting (SUFI2) program was used to calibrate and validate stream flow for years 2001-2010. Calibration and validation of the SWAT model for monthly stream flow at York indicated good model performance (R-2, NSE, and PBIAS = 0.64, 0.63 and 7.1 for calibration (2001-2005); =0.82, 0.74 and 0.2, for validation (2006-2010)). The model was applied to predict sediment and nutrient export from the GRW into Lake Erie. Predicted loading at Dunnville (near the mouth) was 2.3 x 10(5) tonnes y(-1) total suspended sediment, 7.9 x 10(3) tonnes y(-1) TN, and 2.3 x 10(2) tonnes y(-1) TP. This SWAT model can now be used to investigate the relative effects of best management practices, and to forecast effects of climate change, on sustainable water management, hydrology, and sediment and nutrient export to Lake Erie.																	1201-3080					NOV	2017	52	4					243	257		10.2166/wqrj.2017.014								WOS:000426183000002

This study investigated the feasibility of applying nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) as a complementary treatment after membrane bioreactor (MBR) treatment of source-separated urine. Experiments were conducted on a lab scale with a synthetic effluent containing natural organic matter representative of urine after MBR treatment. The performances of NF and RO in terms of productivity and water quality were compared. NF and RO could remove more than 95% of total organic carbon which is composed mainly of humic and fulvic acids. NF could only reduce the conductivity by less than 45% whereas RO removed more than 80% of ions which would make water reuse more feasible. A complete short-term fouling analysis by membrane autopsy was performed in order to understand the different contributions of organic and inorganic components on NF and RO fouling. The obtained results showed that NF was more prone to scaling as water rinsing and chemical cleaning were not fully effective in removing mineral deposits. RO seemed less prone to organic fouling and scaling than NF.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				NOV	2017	95						18	33		10.5004/dwt.2017.21441								WOS:000423703500003

Specifically, fuzzy regression analysis can supply useful information about the validity of measured quantities. This article examines the variation of certain quality characteristics of groundwater in boreholes using fuzzy methodology. Traditionally, classical correlation analysis was used to depict the relation between the dependent variable and the independent variables. Classical regression is considered to be probabilistic and has many uses but can be problematic: (a) if the data set is small, (b) if the error distribution is not normal, (c) if there is uncertainty between dependent and independent variables or if linearity acceptance is not proper. For the previous reasons fuzzy regression analysis is preferable. Water was sampled from these boreholes by Institute of Geology and Mineral Exploration from 2005 to 2008 and the concentration spread of Ca, K and Mg ions was examined. Using fuzzy regression, the range of these concentrations was calculated during the period under consideration with inclusion equations and results are presented in graphic form. All the measured values were taken into account in order to obtain an estimation of future measurement accuracy with a confidence level according to historical values and similar regional conditions.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				NOV	2017	95						45	50		10.5004/dwt.2017.21525								WOS:000423703500005

This study aimed at assessing the spatial distribution of water quality of 23 Rwandan rivers that drain into the Lake Kivu by using the National Sanitation Foundation Water Quality Index (NSFWQI) and the River Pollution Index (RPI). The study collected field data and analyzed the parameters of the NSFWQI and RPI including suspended solids, turbidity, biological oxygen demand, nitrate, temperature, total phosphorus, pH, fecal coliform and dissolved oxygen. For gathering details related to entities adjacent to rivers, land use and land cover, topography and rainfall have been analyzed. The results showed that good water quality (negligibly polluted) was located in areas dominated by forestland while bad and very bad (39%, 26%) classes of rivers (severely polluted) were influenced by the dominance of farmland. Moreover, 22% of rivers in medium class were equivalent to 26% moderately polluted due to the disturbance of other land use types and other factors such as slope and tropical rainfall.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				NOV	2017	95						118	127		10.5004/dwt.2017.21566								WOS:000423703500013

In addition to reverse osmosis (RO), recent publications indicate that nanofiltration (NF) is a promising technology to deal with fluoride removal from aqueous solutions. First of all, a characterization of commercial NF and RO membranes was performed in terms of hydraulic permeability (L-p and L'(p)) and contact angle (theta). Then, performances of the selected membranes on Cl-, NO3-, HCO3-, SO42- as well as F-rejection were determined within a laboratory study in simple salt. At 10 mg/L of concentration, pH = 6.7 and 10 bar, the rejections of fluoride with NF270, NF90 and BW30 were 63%, 91% and 97%, respectively. The influence of sulfate, chloride, nitrate and bicarbonate on fluoride rejection was also studied in binary mixtures with different concentration ratios (1/1, 1/2 and 2/1). Unlike the divalent anions, the results have shown that higher concentrations of monovalent anions affect positively fluoride rejection. Experimental data of fluoride rejection were modeled by using Spiegler-Kedem-Katchalsky model, first to confirm the experiment by calculating the non-linear parameter (chi(2)), and second to evaluate transfer mechanisms (convection and diffusion) of fluoride ions by estimating the phenomenological parameters of mass transfer (s and Ps) for the selected NF and RO membranes in simple and binary mixture. For NF membranes, a duality between both transfer mechanisms was recorded which was strongly affected by the feed composition.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				NOV	2017	95						162	169		10.5004/dwt.2017.21502								WOS:000423703500017

In this study, we examined the effects of fish stocking density on water quality and biomass yields in a recirculating aquaponic-membrane filtration system used for co-culturing tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and water spinach (Ipomoea aquatica). The system was composed of a fish tank, sludge tank with a filtration membrane, and hydroponic tank. Tilapia (average initial weight, 1.8 g) was examined at three densities: 450 (low), 600 (medium), and 750 (high) individuals per tank. The initial density of water spinach was 8.3 g m(-2). The experimental period with no water exchange lasted for 12 weeks. Our results revealed that the increasing density of tilapia correlated positively with the increasing weight gain of water spinach but negatively with the growth of tilapia. The average weight gains were 10.8, 8.3, and 4.0 g in the low-, medium-, and high-density groups, respectively. The levels of NH4+-N, NO2--N, NO3--N, orthophosphate, biochemical oxygen demand, total bacterial counts, and turbidity in the fish and plant tank effluents were significantly higher in the high-density group than in the low-density group. The total weight gains of plants were 1,204, 1,402, and 1,708 g in the low-, medium-, and high-density groups, respectively. These results indicated that membrane filtration combined with a hydroponic component maintained a suitable water quality in the system for the survival of fish. However, the highest fish biomass gained was observed in the medium-density group, and the highest plant yield was obtained in the high-density group.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				NOV	2017	96						22	32		10.5004/dwt.2017.20959								WOS:000423704600004

The former required qualified effluents for capable using in desired recycling purposes, and needed to demonstrate stability of the proposed system under extreme conditions. A mobile pilot plant composed of submerged microfiltration (sMF) and reverse osmosis (RO) membranes was applied to commit aforementioned issues in recycling BSE on site. Even an emergent shutdown caused by typhoon (shock chemical oxygen demand was more than three times, 210 m.L-1, of normal BSE, 85.7 mg.L-1), excellent water quality still fulfilled requirements for cooling water make-up or process water in petrochemical manufacturing. Stability of the integrated membrane system (IMS) was therefore proved, average flow rates of sMF and RO were, respectively, 10.40 +/- 0.29 and 4.47 +/- 0.41 L min(-1), as well as effective membrane fouling control was implemented. Economic attractive of the proposed IMS was presented by evaluating capital (CAPEX) and operational expenditures (OPEX) of the sMF-one pass RO (0.45 USD.m(-3) for OPEX and 0.28 USD.m(-3) for CAPEX) and further upgrading to sMF-two pass RO (0.52 and 0.32 USD.m(-3), respectively) for full-scale reclamation project.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				NOV	2017	96						45	54		10.5004/dwt.2017.21463								WOS:000423704600006

Optimization of filtration to relaxation mode using woven fiber microfiltration system for water and wastewater treatment	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												In this study, the fouling behavior of flat sheet woven fiber microfiltration (WFMF) system for water and wastewater treatment was investigated. In the first phase, WFMF system was operated for treating wastewater under filtration to relaxation mode (FRM) of 30(min)-10(min), 45(min)-15(min) and 60(min)-20(min) corresponding to 36, 24 and 18 cycles/d, operated at an average flux of 8 L/m(2)/h. Results revealed that 45(min)-15(min) was optimum FRM while variation in removal rate of COD, PO43--P and NH4+-N was 58%-71%, 21%-34% and 16%-30%, respectively. In the second phase, WFMF system was evaluated for water treatment having turbidity of 23-50 NTU, total suspended solids (TSS) 200-400 mg/L and fecal coliform (FC) 120 +/- 20 CFU/100 mL under optimized FRM. The removal rates of turbidity, TSS and FC were 64%-96%, 58%-85% and 2-3 log, respectively. Physical and chemical cleaning were applied separately on the membrane and it was found that pore blockage causing irreversible fouling can only be removed by chemical cleaning.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				NOV	2017	96						69	75		10.5004/dwt.2017.21277								WOS:000423704600009

To minimize damage from the effluent, its effect on the ecosystem should be figured out by predicting and monitoring through modeling as well as on-site investigation. This study used four steps of environmental impact assessment; pollutant source identification, analysis of the acceptor ecosystem, analysis of the links between source and acceptor, and mitigation suggestions. In each step of the assessment, pollution sources were identified and affected ecosystem was analyzed. Their correlation was also analyzed to propose efficient facility operation methods to reduce environmental impacts. On-site water quality survey and Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code modeling were also performed to predict and assess the environmental impacts of the effluent discharge to the Yeongil Bay region. The result showed that T-N and T-P in region near to the effluent outlet increased, resulting in rapid growth of chlorophyll-a, which might lead to a red tide.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				NOV	2017	96						201	210		10.5004/dwt.2017.21036								WOS:000423704600025

Stream behaviors can provide guidance for future problem in this basin. This study discusses on the development of stream classification system on tropical areas with statistical approval based on remote sensing, geographical information system, and river hydrographic survey based on Rosgen classification system. Pahang River Basin is the longest river in Peninsular Malaysia and the main channel to drain off water from the inundated area of Pahang Basin to the South China Sea. The environmental statistical techniques were used to identify the clustering development on the tropical river system using hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis (HACA), discriminant analysis (DA) and principal component analysis (PCA). The HACA results indicated that the main of Pahang tropical river system is classed into three main clusters namely the upstream reach, middle stream reach and downstream reach. The calibration and validation analyses proved the DA with 100% confident level. The PCA indicates three variables demonstrated significant correlations that are domination slope R-2 = 0.796, bankfull width-to-depth ratio R-2 = -0868, and sinuosity R-2 = 0.557, respectively. Model of stream classification system with future geomorphology process and problem expectations is produced where the first class considered in terrace and valley erosion zone, second class in a low terrace of land near the channels and sediment transports zone, and third class in valley deposition and floodplain zone. The results are important to local authorities as a decision support system using the river clustering model for Pahang River Basin.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				NOV	2017	96						237	254		10.5004/dwt.2017.21098								WOS:000423704600030						
J	Chang, YJ; Chang, IC; Yu, TY				Chang, Yu-Jie; Chang, I-Cheng; Yu, Tai-Yi			Spatiotemporal features and delineation of water quality control zones for Taipei Water Resources District with multivariate manners	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												This research adopts two methods of multivariate statistical analysis (MSA), principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA), to analyze the water quality parameters (WQPs) monitoring results for evaluating the dominant factors on the rivers water quality and the areas which should be protected carefully. The combination of PCA and CA provides a better technique to classify the water quality control zones. Although PCA is an effective tool to categorize the monitoring stations, it cannot conduct complex dimensional classification on all of the monitoring stations and parameters; whereas, CA can help to determine the correlations between different monitoring stations via the WQPs monitoring results and then provides a more reasonable classification numbers for further watershed management. In this research, 23 monitoring stations were classified into four water quality control zones by using PCA and CA methods. The results from PCA in various water quality control zones indicate that the amounts of total coliform (TC) can lead to various correlation with various WQPs based on the characteristics of regions and pollutant sources. By applying CA to further classify the WQPs of the monitoring station for midstream of Nanshi River, analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests found only the mean values of monitoring WQPs indices for TC and dissolved oxygen (DO) have significant differences. In terms of the water quality in this area, the wastewater from hot springs usages might cause 17% of the midstream of Nanshi River monitoring stations (Cluster A) to rise their TC values and slightly decrease both DO and pH values. In this region, TC is the WQPs indicator with the highest impact resulted from hot spring wastewater. Additionally, by applying PCA and CA, the correlation of WQPs and the effects that hot spring wastewater have on water quality can be further investigated.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				NOV	2017	96						255	266		10.5004/dwt.2017.20970								WOS:000423704600031						
J	Kwon, DY; Kim, JH				Kwon, Dae Young; Kim, Jun Ho			Study on the control of released manganese in residuals treatment processes of water treatment plant	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												Bank filtrate as an alternative for drinking water resource has a problem of high concentration of iron and manganese regardless of various advantages. The high concentration can be removed less than drinking water standard in the process of water treatment, but the removed iron and manganese are moved to residuals treatment processes as precipitation sludge or backwash water, which can make a problem if not a proper management. In order to solve this problem, this study has performed overall investigation on water quality of every process of residuals treatment, from which the relationship between the release and the process management has been figured out. This study also proposed a proper measure to control the released manganese. The investigation revealed that the release hardly occurred in exhaust resin because of high dissolved oxygen (DO) but it could happen in case of long residence more than 72 h. It also showed that the release constantly occurred in the thickener because of long residence of large amount of sludge. The iron release in the thicker was easily oxidized by DO during it raised to the upper. However, the released manganese was hardly oxidized and remained the released one even until it moved to the dewatering and returned to the thickener. As a result, it caused the significant deterioration of the residuals' quality. Aeration and pH adjustment with alkali dose were investigated in order to treat the released manganese. The alkali dose showed an optimum measure to remain the residuals quality below the standard.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				NOV	2017	96						267	275		10.5004/dwt.2017.20924								WOS:000423704600032

Of these, more recently, drugs and endocrine disrupters have called the attention of the scientific community due to their increasing exposure. The sources of contamination include cleaning and personal hygiene products, various classes of drugs, natural hormones and their by-products, as well as several substances applied to the production of plastics and resins, present in sewage, landfill leachate and industrial effluents.

These monitoring programs generate large database that aim to satisfy environmental licensing conditions, as well as the management of water resources. In order to generate information that would facilitate the management of water resources, this study aimed to evaluate the quality of Tibagi river water located in Parana State, Brazil, before the construction of the Maua hydroelectric power plant (HPP). Data from four of the eight stations described in the Limnological Conditions Monitoring Program of the Tibagi river described in the HPP's Basic Environmental Plan were analyzed. The selected data comprises the period between December 2009 and April 2012, before the HPP installation. In general, the retained factors demonstrated the anthropogenic influence on the water resources. Even with a small variation in the composition of the factor 1 in the monitored stations, this factor was especially characterized by the variables: total phosphorus, total solids, and fecal coliforms. The presence of fecal coliforms in the factor's composition is a common indicator of pollution from untreated domestic sewage. The same applies to total phosphorus, which, as well as the total solids, can also be related to the inappropriate land use in the vicinity.																	1413-4152	1809-4457				NOV-DEC	2017	22	6					1075	1083		10.1590/S1413-41522017163661								WOS:000419732000005

Among the main demands for improvement of these programs, there is a need to proof the provided ecosystem services. It is in this context that the present research was developed to evaluate the directives of water quality monitoring in watershed covered by PES and to assess the applicability of these to the watershed of the Couves Stream in Sao Jose dos Campos, Sao Paulo. For this applied research, besides the bibliographical research on the subject, a historical research in the documents of the Municipal Secretary of Environment and a monthly analysis of the water quality data provided by municipal utility were performed. From the results, it was verified that, at present, the Couves Stream waters do not meet the limits of Class 1 for the parameter Escherichia coli. At its various stages, PES demands differentiated monitoring conditions in relation to the number of sampling points and the frequency of analysis. Finally, even understanding the characterization of all parameters that compose the Water Quality Index (WQI) as essential, this study showed a minimum set of indicators for assessing the increases of water quality in watersheds covered by PES.																	1413-4152	1809-4457				NOV-DEC	2017	22	6					1141	1150		10.1590/S1413-41522017165072								WOS:000419732000011

To this end, several studies were used, including: Tacna Spatial Project (PET, Spanish acronym) National Water Authority (ANA, Spanish acronym), Local Water Authority (ALA, Spanish acronym), and the National Weather and Water Service (SENAMHI, Spanish acronym), among others. Three geomorphological units were identified: the Western Cordillera, Puna, and the Andes dissected flank with its own characteristics. In addition, the geological formations that affect the water quality of the Caplina Basin were identified based on the geological cartography. The sources with the greatest influence on water quality were determined. These included the Aruma and Paralocos geothermal springs which produce water with high contents of arsenic, lead, and sodium, in concentrations exceeding the Environmental Quality Standard (ECA, Spanish acronym), and high iron concentration in the water channel from the Barroso Chico spring to the Ancoma Creek. The relationships among the geology, climate, and hydrology were identified, which reflect changes in the concentrations of the elements in the water during seasons with low water levels versus those with high levels.

J	Yang, Y; Wu, JF; Wang, JG; Zhou, ZF				Yang, Yun; Wu, Jianfeng; Wang, Jinguo; Zhou, Zhifang			An Elitist Multiobjective Tabu Search for Optimal Design of Groundwater Remediation Systems	GROUNDWATER												This study presents a new multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA), the elitist multiobjective tabu search (EMOTS), and incorporates it with MODFLOW/MT3DMS to develop a groundwater simulation-optimization (SO) framework based on modular design for optimal design of groundwater remediation systems using pump-and-treat (PAT) technique. The most notable improvement of EMOTS over the original multiple objective tabu search (MOTS) lies in the elitist strategy, selection strategy, and neighborhood move rule. The elitist strategy is to maintain all nondominated solutions within later search process for better converging to the true Pareto front. The elitism-based selection operator is modified to choose two most remote solutions from current candidate list as seed solutions to increase the diversity of searching space. Moreover, neighborhood solutions are uniformly generated using the Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) in the bounded neighborhood space around each seed solution. To demonstrate the performance of the EMOTS, we consider a synthetic groundwater remediation example. Problem formulations consist of two objective functions with continuous decision variables of pumping rates while meeting water quality requirements. Especially, sensitivity analysis is evaluated through the synthetic case for determination of optimal combination of the heuristic parameters. Furthermore, the EMOTS is successfully applied to evaluate remediation options at the field site of the Massachusetts Military Reservation (MMR) in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. With both the hypothetical and the large-scale field remediation sites, the EMOTS-based SO framework is demonstrated to outperform the original MOTS in achieving the performance metrics of optimality and diversity of nondominated frontiers with desirable stability and robustness.																	0017-467X	1745-6584				NOV-DEC	2017	55	6					811	826		10.1111/gwat.12525								WOS:000419219600005	28493319

Borehole techniques have been widely used, but they are quite expensive, intrusive, and time consuming. The electrical resistivity method has proved very successful in groundwater assessment. This advanced technique uses the calculation of Dar-Zarrouk (D-Z) parameters, namely longitudinal unit conductance, transverse unit resistance, and longitudinal resistivity has been employed by using 50 vertical electrical sounding points to assess the groundwater and delineate the fresh-saline water interface over 1045 km(2) area of Khanewal in Southern Punjab of Pakistan. The x-y plots and maps of D-Z parameters were produced to establish a decipherable vision for the occurrence and distribution of different water-bearing formations of fresh-saline water aquifers through a complicated situation of intermixing of different resistivity ranges for fresh-saline water bodies. This technique is useful to reduce the ambiguity produced by the process of equivalence and suppression which cause intermixing in differentiating fresh, brackish, and saline aquifers during interpretation. The fresh-saline water interface is correlated very well with the previous studies of water quality analysis carried out in Khanewal area. The results suggest that the D-Z parameters are useful for demarcating different aquifer zones. The behavior and pattern of D-Z parameters with respect to occurrence and distribution of different water-bearing formations were effectively identified and delineated in the study area.																	0017-467X	1745-6584				NOV-DEC	2017	55	6					841	856		10.1111/gwat.12527								WOS:000419219600007	28498518

The reverse osmosis process has been selected to study since it typically uses less energy than thermal distillation. The aim of the robust design is to overcome the limitation of classical controllers in dealing with large parametric uncertainties, external disturbances, sensor noises, and unmodeled process dynamics. The analyzed desalination process is modeled as a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system with varying parameters. The control system is decoupled using a feed forward decoupling method to reduce the interactions between control channels. Both nominal and perturbed reverse osmosis systems have been analyzed using structured singular values for their stabilities and performances. Simulation results show that the system responses meet all the control requirements against various uncertainties. Finally the reduced order controller provides excellent robust performance, with achieving decoupling, disturbance attenuation, and noise rejection. It can help to reduce the membrane cleanings, increase the robustness against uncertainties, and lower the energy consumption for process monitoring.																	1061-4303	1554-7531				NOV 1	2017	89	11					1932	1941		10.2175/106143017X15054988926316								WOS:000418398500001	29080563

Development of Multiple Regression Models to Predict Sources of Fecal Pollution	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												This study assessed the usefulness of multivariate statistical tools to characterize watershed dynamics and prioritize streams for remediation. Three multiple regression models were developed using water quality data collected from Sinking Creek in the Watauga River watershed in Northeast Tennessee. Model 1 included all water quality parameters, model 2 included parameters identified by stepwise regression, and model 3 was developed using canonical discriminant analysis. Models were evaluated in seven creeks to determine if they correctly classified land use and level of fecal pollution. At the watershed level, the models were statistically significant (p < 0.001) but with low r(2) values (Model 1 r(2) = 0.02, Model 2 r(2) = 0.01, Model 3 r(2) = 0.35). Model 3 correctly classified land use in five of seven creeks. These results suggest this approach can be used to set priorities and identify pollution sources, but may be limited when applied across entire watersheds.																	1061-4303	1554-7531				NOV 1	2017	89	11					1961	1969		10.2175/106143017X14839994523901								WOS:000418398500004	28327258

Design of Remediation Actions for Nutrient Mitigation in the Hyporheic Zone	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Although hyporheic exchange has been shown to be of great importance for the overall water quality of streams, it is rarely considered quantitatively in stream remediation projects. A main driver of hyporheic exchange is the hydraulic head fluctuation along the streambed, which can be enhanced by modifications of the streambed topography. Here we present an analytical 2-D spectral subsurface flow model to estimate the hyporheic exchange associated with streambed topographies over a wide range of spatial scales; a model that was validated using tracer-test-results and measurements of hydraulic conductivity. Specifically, engineered steps in the stream were shown to induce a larger hyporheic exchange velocity and shorter hyporheic residence times compared to the observed topography in Tullstorps Brook, Sweden. Hyporheic properties were used to parameterize a longitudinal transport model that accounted for reactions in terms of first-order decay and instantaneous adsorption. Theoretical analyses of the mitigation effect for nitrate due to denitrification in the hyporheic zone show that there is a Damkohler number of the hyporheic zone, associated with several different stream geomorphologies, that optimizes nitrate mass removal on stream reach scale. This optimum can be limited by the available hydraulic head gradient given by the slope of the stream and the geological constraints of the streambed. The model illustrates the complex interactions between design strategies for nutrient mitigation, hyporheic flow patterns, and stream biogeochemistry and highlights the importance to diagnose a stream prior remediation, specifically to evaluate if remediation targets are transport or reaction controlled.

The need for high-fidelity hydrodynamic and water quality models within optimization schemes is driven by improved computational capabilities, increased requirements to meet specific points of compliance with greater resolution, and the need to optimize operations of not just single reservoirs but systems of reservoirs. This study describes an important advancement for computing hourly power generation schemes for a hydropower reservoir using high-fidelity models, surrogate modeling techniques, and optimization methods. The predictive power of the high-fidelity hydrodynamic and water quality model CE-QUAL-W2 is successfully emulated by an artificial neural network, then integrated into a genetic algorithm optimization approach to maximize hydropower generation subject to constraints on dam operations and water quality. This methodology is applied to a multipurpose reservoir near Nashville, Tennessee, USA. The model successfully reproduced high-fidelity reservoir information while enabling 6.8% and 6.6% increases in hydropower production value relative to actual operations for dissolved oxygen (DO) limits of 5 and 6 mg/L, respectively, while witnessing an expected decrease in power generation at more restrictive DO constraints. Exploration of simultaneous temperature and DO constraints revealed capability to address multiple water quality constraints at specified locations. The reduced computational requirements of the new modeling approach demonstrated an ability to provide decision support for reservoir operations scheduling while maintaining high-fidelity hydrodynamic and water quality information as part of the optimization decision support routines. Plain Language Summary Hydropower operations can influence water quality, including temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations both upstream and downstream of dams. Meanwhile, as energy demands increase it is important to improve the efficiency and capacity of renewable sources. A well-optimized hydropower system thus requires a fully integrated approach where environmental quality and energy production are achieved together. Currently, hydropower optimization subject to environmental constraints is limited by dimensionality, resolution, and computational expense of detailed hydrodynamic and water quality models. The need for integrating these models within optimization schemes is now driven by improved computational capabilities, requirements to meet specific points of compliance, and the need to optimize systems of reservoirs. This study describes an approach for computing hourly power generation schemes for a hydropower reservoir using high-fidelity models, surrogate modeling techniques, and optimization methods. Surrogate models, which emulate the predictions of complex models at much less computational expense, are integrated into an optimization routine that maximizes hydropower generation subject to dam operations and water quality constraints. For the case study, the method found potential increases in hydropower production value relative to actual operations while maintaining DO minimum concentrations, and produced an expected decrease in power generation at more restrictive DO limits.

The quality of surface water resources in Central America is usually low due to the presence of metals and other pollutants. The lack of analytical instrumentation to perform routine monitoring of water has encouraged the development of easy tools to facilitate the determination of heavy metals in waters in remote sites. In this study, we evaluated the use of different sorbents, such as Adsorbsia As600 (titanium dioxide), Iontosorb Oxin, 8-hydroxyquinoline bearing functional groups, and Duolite GT-73, with thiol functionality, for Cd, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Al extraction. It was found that both Adsorbsia As600 and Iontosorb Oxin allowed the adsorption of all metals, and the recovery was achieved using either HCl or ethylenediaminetetraacetic sodium salt (EDTA) solutions. Hence, Adsorbsia As600 was employed for in situ sampling in the metal contamination evaluation of water samples (from 15 wells and nine storage tanks) from the municipality of Torola, Mozaran, El Salvador. The developed procedure allowed all the metals in the samples to be detected, and Ni and Al were found to be above Salvadoran guidelines for drinking water quality.

J	Banik, BK; Alfonso, L; Di Cristo, C; Leopardi, A				Banik, Bijit K.; Alfonso, Leonardo; Di Cristo, Cristiana; Leopardi, Angelo			Greedy Algorithms for Sensor Location in Sewer Systems	WATER												Wastewater quality monitoring is receiving growing interest with the necessity of developing new strategies for controlling accidental and intentional illicit intrusions. In designing a monitoring network, a crucial aspect is represented by the sensors' location. In this study, a methodology for the optimal placement of wastewater monitoring sensors in sewer systems is presented. The sensor location is formulated as an optimization problem solved using greedy algorithms (GRs). The Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) was used to perform hydraulic and water-quality simulations. Six different procedures characterized by different fitness functions are presented and compared. The performances of the procedures are tested on a real sewer system, demonstrating the suitability of GRs for the sensor-placement problem. The results show a robustness of the methodology with respect to the detection concentration parameter, and they suggest that procedures with multiple objectives into a single fitness function give better results. A further comparison is performed using previously developed multi-objective procedures with multiple fitness functions solved using a genetic algorithm (GA), indicating better performances of the GR. The existing monitoring network, realized without the application of any sensor design, is always suboptimal.

Moreover, following the marine spatial planning principles, the effects of port structure changes on water quality must also be considered. To support the sustainable management of harbour waters, we calculated flushing time (FT) through the use of a numerical model within the Civitavecchia port under different scenarios. To assess the effects of the realization of new infrastructure that will significantly alter the port configuration in the coming years, we also developed the flushing efficiency index (FEI). The increase in the harbour basin size due to the embankment extension result in high values of FT, particularly in the inner part of the port, in accordance with the highest values of the enrichment factor of the trace metals found in the sediment. The deterioration of water quality is confirmed by negative FEI values. Otherwise, the index assumes positive values after the realization of a second entrance in the southern part of Civitavecchia port, highlighting a drastic improvement in harbour water renewal. This study provides a low-cost and predictive tool to correctly address environmentally sustainable management of port activities.

A key component of APEX application in Korea is simulating the water quality impacts of rice paddies because rice agriculture claims the largest cropland area in the country. In this study, a computational module called APEX-Paddy (National Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Wanju, Korea) is developed to simulate water quality with considering pertinent paddy management practices, such as puddling and flood irrigation management. Data collected at two experimental paddy sites in Korea were used to calibrate and validate the model. Results indicate that APEX-Paddy performs well in predicting runoff discharge rate and nitrogen yield while the original APEX highly overestimates runoff rates and nitrogen yields on large storm events. With APEX-Paddy, simulated and observed flow and mineral nitrogen yield (QN) are found to be highly correlated after calibration (Nash & Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) = 0.87 and Percent Bias (PBIAS) = -14.6% for flow; NSE = 0.68 and PBIAS = 2.1% for QN). Consequently, the APEX-Paddy showed a greater accuracy in flow and QN prediction than the original APEX modeling practice using the SCS-CN (Soil Conservation Service-Curve Number) method.																	2073-4441					NOV	2017	9	11							869	10.3390/w9110869								WOS:000416798300055						
J	Diaz-Alcaide, S; Martinez-Santos, P; Villarroya, F				Diaz-Alcaide, Silvia; Martinez-Santos, Pedro; Villarroya, Fermin			A Commune-Level Groundwater Potential Map for the Republic of Mali	WATER												Groundwater represents an essential resource in sub-Saharan Africa, where several hundred million people rely on aquifers for domestic supply. This paper presents a method to map groundwater potential in the Republic of Mali based on a spatially-distributed database of 26,040 boreholes. The database includes exhaustive information on key parameters such as borehole location, success rate of borehole production, depth, yield, static groundwater level or water quality. Representative variables were classified and interpreted jointly to develop a groundwater potential index for each of the 703 communes in Mali. This provides a methodological novelty because groundwater potential studies typically rely on indirect indicators such as lineaments, slope, soil moisture and landforms. Also, such large borehole databases have seldom been used to estimate groundwater potential. The highest indexes were obtained for the areas in and around the River Niger's Inner Delta, including southern Tombouctou and the central parts of the Segou and Mopti Regions. The lower Precambrian formations, which include the country's thoroughly populated southern plateau, had moderate scores. The lowest groundwater potential was found in the northern part of the Kayes and Koulikoro Regions, as well as in the entire region of Kidal. By providing results at the commune scale, these outcomes show that groundwater potential across the country's geological and hydrogeological units can be highly variable, and that local and regional-scale information may be useful for groundwater management purposes. These results are policy-relevant in a context of rapid change and population growth, where groundwater resources can be expected to be increasingly relied upon in the coming years.					martinez-santos, pedro/0000-0003-2014-4063												2073-4441					NOV	2017	9	11							839	10.3390/w9110839								WOS:000416798300025

The effects of environmental factors (rain depth, length of dry period between consecutive rain events, time since the beginning of the rainy season, roof type, wind speed, and wind direction) and air pollution parameters (O-3, SO2, NO2, NO, PM2.5, and PM2.5-10) on roof runoff quality were studied. Three roofs of three common types (concrete, steel sheets, and tiles) were constructed. Roof-generated runoff was collected over two rainy seasons (>50 rain events) and were analysed for presence of metals, chemical and physical constituents, and faecal coliforms (a total of 23 parameters). Rain depth and runoff volume from each roof were recorded for each rain event. Most parameters examined complied with the Israeli potable water regulations. A stepwise multivariate linear regression established a significant effect of roof type on runoff pollutant concentrations, especially for ones generated by the roof material itself (e.g., Ca from the concrete roof and Zn from roof tiles). A significant effect of various air pollutants on the quality of roof-runoff water was found, as explained by rain washing off pollutants that accumulated in the atmosphere during the antecedent dry period. Both O-3 and PM2.5-10 affected 17 quality parameters each. Rain depth affected only four out of the 23 water quality variables. In contrast, the length of the dry period between consecutive rain events was an important factor, affecting 12 roof-runoff quality variables.

The Zeolite-Anammox Treatment Process for Nitrogen Removal from WastewaterA Review	WATER												Water quality in San Francisco Bay has been adversely affected by nitrogen loading from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) discharging around the periphery of the Bay. While there is documented use of zeolites and anammox bacteria in removing ammonia and possibly nitrate during wastewater treatment, there is little information available about the combined process. Though relatively large, zeolite beds have a finite ammonium adsorption potential and require periodic re-generation depending on the wastewater nitrogen loading. Use of anammox bacteria reactors for wastewater treatment have shown that ammonium (and to some degree, nitrate) can be successfully removed from the wastewater, but the reactors require careful attention to loading rates and internal redox conditions. Generally, their application has been limited to treatment of high-ammonia strength wastewater at relatively warm temperatures. Moreover, few studies are available describing commercial or full-scale application of these reactors. We briefly review the literature considering use of zeolites or anammox bacteria in wastewater treatment to set the stage for description of an integrated zeolite-anammox process used to remove both ammonium and nitrate without substrate regeneration from mainstream WWTP effluent or anaerobic digester filtrate at ambient temperatures.																	2073-4441					NOV	2017	9	11							901	10.3390/w9110901								WOS:000416798300087						
J	Hua, RX; Zhang, YY				Hua, Ruixiang; Zhang, Yongyong			Assessment of Water Quality Improvements Using the Hydrodynamic Simulation Approach in Regulated Cascade Reservoirs: A Case Study of Drinking Water Sources of Shenzhen, China	WATER												Water quality safety is of critical importance in environmental improvement, particularly with respect to drinking water resources worldwide. As the main drinking water sources in Shenzhen, China, the cascade reservoirs comprising the Shiyan, Tiegang, and Xili Reservoirs are highly regulated and have experienced water quality deterioration in recent years. In this study, a three-dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model was established using the Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC) for the cascade reservoirs. The relationships between water quality and improvement measures were quantified and the main pollution sources for individual reservoirs were identified. Results showed that the hydrodynamic and water quality model well captured the spatial and temporal variations of water level, the permanganate concentration index (CODMn), and total nitrogen (TN), with high resolution in the cascade reservoirs. The correlation coefficients between simulations and observations were close to 1.00 for water levels, and over 0.50 for CODMn and TN concentrations. The most effective methods for water quality improvement were the reduction of the runoff load for TN and transferred water load for CODMn in the Shiyan Reservoir, reduction of the transferred water load in the Tiegang Reservoir, and an increase in transfer water volume, especially in the flood season, in the Xili Reservoir. Internal pollution sources also played an important role in water pollution, and thus sedimentation should be cleaned up regularly. This study is expected to provide scientific support for drinking water source protection and promote the application of hydrodynamic model in water quality management.

J	Macnamara, J; Derry, C				Macnamara, James; Derry, Chris			Pollution Removal Performance of Laboratory Simulations of Sydney's Street Stormwater Biofilters	WATER												The City of Sydney is constructing more than 21,000 square metres of street biofilter units (raingardens) in terms of their Decentralised Water Master Plan (DWMP), for improving the quality of stormwater runoff to Port Jackson, the Cooks River, and the historical Botany Bay. Recharge of the Botany Sand Beds aquifer, currently undergoing remediation by extraction of industrial chlorinated hydrocarbon pollutants, is also envisaged. To anticipate the pollution removal efficiency of field biofilter designs, laboratory soil-column simulations were developed by Western Sydney University partnered with the City. Synthetic stormwater containing stoichiometric amounts of high-solubility pollutant salts in deionised water was passed through 104 mm columns that were layered to simulate monophasic and biphasic field designs. Both designs met the City's improvement targets for total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP), with >65% median removal efficiency. Prolonged release of total suspended solids (SS) on startup emphasised the need for specifications and testing of proprietary fills. Median removal efficiency for selected heavy metal ecotoxicants was >75%. The researchers suggested that Zinc be added to the targets as proxy for metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and oils/greases co-generated during road use. Simulation results suggested that field units will play an important role in meeting regional stormwater improvement targets.

The logarithmic reduction rates for fecal coliforms (FC), Escherichia coli (EC) and intestinal enterococci (IE) were 2.84, 2.90 and 2.93. In the investigated period of time, the tested treatment plant released 4.3% of the total annual load flow volume as combined sewer overflow (CSO), that is, when the influent into the combined sewer exceeds the capacity of the treatment plant and coarsely cleaned wastewater arrives at the recipient. This CSO discharge increased the number of FIB significantly by 1.2 x 10(2) MPN/100 mL for EC, and by 1.8 x 10(1) MPN/100 mL for IE. For the Styrian part of the Mur River (1.6 million inhabitants), a calculation of FIB of all sewage treatment plants estimating the same ratio of CSO (4.3%) and a given mean flow rate (QM) results in a significant increase of the FIB load in the recipient: 3.8 x 10(3) MPN/100 mL for EC and 5.8 x 10(2) MPN/100 mL for IE. On the basis of these values the standards of water quality for recreational purposes cannot be met.

Non-Metropolitan Drinking Water Suppliers' Response to the Diagnostic Tool for Non-Technical Compliance in Limpopo, South Africa	WATER												Without the planning of non-technical issues, water treatment plants may face challenges in sustaining safe drinking water. Parameters such as the planning of financial resources, human resources, a lack of professional process controllers, poor working conditions, staff shortages and a lack of appropriate training of process controllers contribute to the underperformance of drinking water treatment plants. This study aimed at applying the Diagnostic Tool for Non-Technical Compliance to assess the compliance of small drinking water plants with management norms. Six water treatments (Vondo water scheme, Malamulele, Mutshedzi, Mutale regional water treatment plant, Tshedza and Tshedza package plant) were selected from the Vhembe district municipality of the Limpopo province in South Africa. From the abovementioned non-technical parameters, the results showed that during the first assessment period (August 2008 and June 2009) selected water treatment plants scored between 53% and 68% and fell under Class 2, indicating serious challenges requiring attention and improvement. During the second assessment period (November and December 2010), a slight improvement was observed as all plants scored between 72% and 80%, falling under the Class 2 category. Even after corrective actions and remeasurement, none of the plants met the compliance standards, which range from 90% to 100% to obtain the Class 1 compliance standard. The study recommended that tactical and strategic plans that clearly define the operational procedures, process controlling, financial planning, maintenance culture, emergency preparedness and regular monitoring and evaluation should be entrenched for the smooth running of the small water treatment plants. Furthermore, all water services providers and water services authorities should apply the diagnostic tools as developed, which provides guidance on a stepwise procedure on plant operations and management on a daily basis.																	2073-4441					NOV	2017	9	11							853	10.3390/w9110853								WOS:000416798300039

Effect of Water Quality Sampling Approaches on Nitrate Load Predictions of a Prominent Regression-Based Model	WATER												High frequency in-situ measurements of nitrate can greatly reduce uncertainty in nitrate flux estimates. Water quality databases maintained by various federal and state agencies often consist of pollutant concentration data obtained from periodic grab samples collected from gauged reaches of a stream. Regression models, such as the LOAD ESTimator (LOADEST), are frequently used to model variations in concentrations associated with changes in water discharge to provide integrated solute flux measurements. However, uncertainty in the relationships between nutrient concentration and flow may lead to errors in the corresponding flux estimates. In this study, a high frequency, in-situ measurement of nitrate concentration was implemented to ascertain uncertainty in the concentration/discharge relationship caused by nitrate hysteresis. It was found that observed nitrate hysteresis, as influenced by complex storm/watershed interactions, was not readily predictable. Therefore, it can lead to substantial nitrate flux uncertainty, based on periodic grab sample monitoring approaches. Scientists and engineers should take advantage of the proposed findings in future studies to enhance the quality of the associated decision making processes.

Impact of Hybrid Water Supply on the Centralised Water System	WATER												Traditional (technical) concepts to ensure a reliable water supply, a safe handling of wastewater and flood protection are increasingly criticised as outdated and unsustainable. These so-called centralised urban water systems are further maladapted to upcoming challenges because of their long lifespan in combination with their short-sighted planning and design. A combination of (existing) centralised and decentralised infrastructure is expected to be more reliable and sustainable. However, the impact of increasing implementation of decentralised technologies on the local technical performance in sewer or water supply networks and the interaction with the urban form has rarely been addressed in the literature. In this work, an approach which couples the UrbanBEATS model for the planning of decentralised strategies together with a water supply modelling approach is developed and applied to a demonstration case. With this novel approach, critical but also favourable areas for such implementations can be identified. For example, low density areas, which have high potential for rainwater harvesting, can result in local water quality problems in the supply network when further reducing usually low pipe velocities in these areas. On the contrary, in high demand areas (e.g., high density urban forms) there is less effect of rainwater harvesting due to the limited available space. In these high density areas, water efficiency measures result in the highest savings in water volume, but do not cause significant problems in the technical performance of the potable water supply network. For a more generalised and case-independent conclusion, further analyses are performed for semi-virtual benchmark networks to answer the question of an appropriate representation of the water distribution system in a computational model for such an analysis. Inappropriate hydraulic model assumptions and characteristics were identified for the stated problem, which have more impact on the assessments than the decentralised measures.

Along with ever increasing human activities, agricultural and domestic wastes have been directly discharged into river systems around the Watershed, which consequently poses a grave threat to the sustainable development of Xinjiang. Through statistical and spatial analysis, we have determined the relationships between land use/cover (LULC) and hydro-chemical characteristics during rainy and dry seasons in 2014. Spatial patterns of hydro-chemical characteristics as demonstrated by mineralization, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and SO42-, HCO3-, Cl-, Mg2+, Na+, Ca2+ and K+ concentrations were examined in 113 sites. Since hydro-chemical characteristics were affected by LULC patterns, this study delineated six zones to analyze the distribution characteristics of hydro-chemical parameters and its relationship with LULC patterns. The results showed that, except for the pH, all variables demonstrated significant spatial differences during dry and rainy seasons. In addition, the relationships between water quality and LULC patterns indicated that the farmland, forest-grassland, water body and salinized land all affected hydro-chemical characteristics during both rainy and dry seasons. Especially, decreased rainfall, irrigation, surface runoff, the area of lake, etc. largely led to the increase in ion content, which had great influence on hydro-chemical characteristics parameters in dry season. Furthermore, we established several stepwise linear multiple regressions models. The results showed that pH, mineralization and Ca2+ were defined by forest-grassland, while the Cl- and Mg2+ were defined by salinized land during the rainy season. The pH and Na+ were estimated based on farmland, whereas Cl- and Ca2+ were estimated based on forest-grassland during the dry season. In conclusion, this research on the relationships between the spatial distribution of hydro-chemical characteristics in Ebinur Lake Watershed and LULC patterns will be significant for the sustainable management of the arid regions in northwest China.																	2073-4441					NOV	2017	9	11							888	10.3390/w9110888								WOS:000416798300074

National assessments are particularly difficult as models must operate with both a very large spatial extent (the contiguous U.S.) while maintaining a level of granularity required to capture important small scale processes. In this research, we developed datasets to describe the hydrologic connectivity at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 12-digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC-12) level. Connectivity between 86,000 HUC-12s as provided by the Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) was evaluated and corrected. We also detailed a method to resolve the highly detailed National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) stream segments within each HUC-12 into vastly simplified representative channel schemes suitable for use in the recently developed Soil and Water Assessment Tool + (SWAT+) model. This representative channel approach strikes a balance between computational complexity and accurate representation of the hydrologic system. These data will be tested in the upcoming CEAP II national assessment. Until then, all the WBD corrections and NHDPlus representative channel data are provided via the web for other researchers to evaluate and utilize.

Previously, temporal analysis-based methods for single sensor stations have shown limited performance as they fail to consider spatial information. Besides, abundant historical data from multiple stations are still underexploited in causal relationship modelling. In this paper, a contamination event detection method is proposed, in which both temporal and spatial information from multi-stations in water distribution systems are used. The causal relationship between upstream and downstream stations is modelled by Bayesian Network, using the historical water quality data and hydraulic data. Then, the spatial abnormal probability for one station is obtained by comparing its current causal relationship with the established model. Meanwhile, temporal abnormal probability is obtained by conventional methods, such as an Autoregressive (AR) or threshold model for the same station. The integrated probability that is calculated employed temporal and spatial probabilities using Logistic Regression to determine the final detection result. The proposed method is tested over two networks and its detection performance is evaluated against results obtained from traditional methods using only temporal analysis. Results indicate that the proposed method shows higher accuracy due to its increased information from both temporal and spatial dimensions.																	2073-4441					NOV	2017	9	11							894	10.3390/w9110894								WOS:000416798300080

Terrestrial diatoms as tracers in catchment hydrology: a review	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER												Diatoms are remarkable organisms. They are present in almost all habitats containing water (e.g., lakes, streams, soils, bark) and rank among the most common algal groups in both freshwaters and marine ecosystems. The ubiquitous character of aquatic diatoms has triggered countless applications as environmental tracers for studies in water quality, paleoclimate reconstruction and sediment tracing. However, diatoms also occur in the terrestrial environment. It is this plethora of diatom life-forms that has recently triggered interest in their use as tracers of hydrological processes. The use of diatoms in catchment hydrology has been very limited. Part of the reason is that until recently, the taxonomy and ecology of terrestrial diatom assemblages were largely unknown. However, in the past decade, much work has been done to quantify terrestrial diatom reservoir size, dynamics, and potential depletion following precipitation events. Therefore, such terrestrial diatoms now hold promise for use in catchment hydrology-for tracing runoff flow sources and pathways across a wide range of spatial scales. Here we review the literature on terrestrial diatoms and describe the various sampling protocols that have been designed and tested for specific applications in hydrological processes research. We review and summarize the work on terrestrial diatom reservoir characterization, transport mechanisms and pathways to show how such diatom-based tracer work might be possible at the catchment scale for rainfall-runoff studies. Finally, we present a vision for future work that might take advantage of terrestrial diatoms in catchment hydrology and discuss the main challenges going forward. (C) 2017 The Authors.

The following results were obtained. (1) The total non-carcinogenic risk values of 14 surface water samples were all lower than 1, which indicates that these surface water samples will not pose non-carcinogenic risk. Drinking water intake is the main exposure pathway of non-carcinogenic risk. (2) Among the 15 phreatic groundwater wells monitored, the total non-carcinogen levels at 6 points exceeded safe levels for children, which indicates that the local groundwater is harmful to children's health. The order of contaminants contributing to this risk is NO3-N > Mn > Fe > NH4-N > NO2-N. (3) Among the 29 points of confined groundwater monitoring wells, 2 points showed total non-carcinogenic risk values exceeding safe levels for children, which indicates that the local groundwater is unsafe to children health. The order of contaminants contributing to non-carcinogenic risk is NO3-N > Mn > Fe > NH4-N > NO2-N.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				NOV	2017	76	22							UNSP 761	10.1007/s12665-017-7097-4								WOS:000416820300019

The other purposes of this study were to evaluate the physicochemical properties of the Maroon River water and assess the effects of each water quality parameter on the WQI values. Relationship between quality scale of hydrochemical parameters and the resulting WQI scores was determined employing linear regression analysis. Moreover, the suitability of water quality was evaluated for irrigation purposes using conventional indices, electrical conductivity (EC), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), and percent sodium (Na%). The monitoring stations were placed in high and very high categories according to the assessment of irrigation water quality with EC. Considering WQI, the upper (S1, S2, and S4) and lower (S3, S5, and S6) monitoring stations of the Maroon River distributed in category C3 (high salinity) and C4-C5 (very high salinity), respectively. The findings of WQI presented an increasing trend from upstream toward downstream in the Maroon River. The findings of the linear regression analysis showed no significant correlation between WQI scores with pH and SO42- concentrations even though the relationship is weak. These results suggest that pH and SO42- concentrations could be the secondary driving parameters behind the variations in WQI scores. It can be inferred that the Maroon River water is appropriate for irrigation based on Na% and SAR. However, it also exhibits high EC. Therefore, for mitigating the adverse impacts of polluted water authors recommend multidimensional management practices such as transferable discharge permit programs in the study area.

However, other factors of water quality such as the water age must be taken into account while forming DMAs. The current study uses genetic algorithm (GA) optimization methods to achieve the desired WDN segmentation conditions in terms of: (a) reducing the operating pressure, thus reducing the system's real losses; and (b) reducing the water age, thus improving the feeling of water freshness and preventing growth of disinfection byproducts. Techniques based on GA are a proven way to provide a very good solution to optimization problems. The solution is obtained using an objective function and setting boundary constraints. The formation of the objective functions is tested through Matlab's optimization toolbox. The logic of the objective functions' formulation for both the operating pressure and the water age optimization is recorded and analyzed. The method's application utilized a sample network model assisted by EPANET and Bentley's WaterGEMS software tools. The morphology of the DMAs is presented for each scenario, as well as the results of the network's segmentation according to the operating pressure and the water age.																	1464-7141	1465-1734				NOV	2017	19	6			SI		890	899		10.2166/hydro.2017.156								WOS:000416447000009

The present paper utilizes optimization methods to achieve desired segmentation conditions in terms of (a) operating pressure reduction, thus reducing the system's real water losses and (b) residual chlorine concentration reduction thus preventing disinfection byproducts' growth. Exploiting the numerous possibilities offered by the inter-connection of Matlab and EPANET software tools, an algorithm is developed in C++ language. The algorithm reads all significant data of a WDN as an output of EPANET. The first algorithm calculates the optimal allocation of a given number of closed isolation valves in terms of water losses' reduction, considering restrictions for network's proper operation. The second algorithm calculates the optimal formation of DMAs in terms of water quality improvement. Both algorithms can be applied in any WDN. The outcome is the optimal set of closed pipes that leads to the optimal formation of DMAs in a given network. The closing of pipes (by installing isolation valves) determines the optimal formation of DMAs. The basic concept of both algorithms and their application in a case study network's hydraulic model are presented.																	1464-7141	1465-1734				NOV	2017	19	6			SI		900	910		10.2166/hydro.2017.157								WOS:000416447000010

Hassen; Cherif, Semia			Identification of indispensable components for a better drinking water quality management: Tunis case of study	JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS												In order to reduce the number of operations for the assessment of potable water treatment, principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering are applied to large databases of raw and treated water of three treatment plants with various processes. It appears that the measurements can be divided into three clear groups, with a correlation higher than 0.8. The first contains salinity, conductivity, water hardness, calcium, magnesium and chlorides. The second includes turbidity and organic matter. The third includes pH and alkalinity. Despite the disparities in water quality and in all the cases, three parameters were sufficient to represent all the routine measurements: conductivity, turbidity and pH, which can represent the three principal components of the data. It can reduce by two-thirds of the measurement and analysis, dropping from 6,960 to 2,088 analysis annually. The analysis on the principal axes of the individuals, represented by raw and treated water from the three treatment plants, reveals that the quality of the raw water seems more important than the type of treatment process, in the resulting quality of treated water. These results could be generalized and easily adopted by other treatment plants whatever the process. They could offer substantial savings of time, chemicals, electricity and longevity of the devices.																	1464-7141	1465-1734				NOV	2017	19	6			SI		942	952		10.2166/hydro.2017.070								WOS:000416447000014

In this research first we developed a hydrological model (SWAT) to estimate recharge rates and its spatiotemporal distribution. Then, groundwater simulation of the basin was simulated and calibrated using MODFLOW 2000 and water quality was simulated and calibrated using MT3DMS. Afterwards, a multi-objective optimization model (MOPSO) and embed simulation models as tools to assess the objective function was carried out in order to produce a simulation-optimization model. Finally, a sustainability index to assess Pareto front's answers and three management scenarios (continuing previous operation, 30% increasing and reduction in previous operation) was developed. The results show that the majority of Pareto optimal answers have more sustainability index than a 30% reduction of operation with the best answer of 0.059. Relatively, the sustainability index of 30% reduction of operation is 0.05.																	1464-7141	1465-1734				NOV	2017	19	6			SI		973	992		10.2166/hydro.2017.007								WOS:000416447000016

In developing countries, the major source of antibiotic contamination in surface water is improper disposal of effluents from industries, hospitals and domestic waste water treatment plants. The antibiotic pollution combined with other environmental pollution factors exerts selective pressure on environmental microbes, driving evolution and resulting in the spread of antibiotic resistance in a local to global scale. Present study aimed to determine the proliferation of ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria in aquatic environment of a river which is heavily impacted by industrial effluents. Correlation analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of anthropogenic factors. Statistical analysis evaluated the effect of fluoroquinolones, heavy metals, total organic carbon and total nitrogen on the levels of resistant culture in samples from the natural settings.																	1747-6585	1747-6593				NOV	2017	31	4					456	462		10.1111/wej.12263								WOS:000416056200001

In Lebanon, we carried out experiments to assess the response of drip-irrigated table grapes grown under two water quality regimes (Freshwater (FW) and treated wastewater (TW) and two water levels (100% of evapotranspiration (ETc) and 75% of ETc). While in Jordan, we carried out experiments to assess the response of drip-irrigated fodder crops considering 4 irrigation levels (Q1: Rain fed; Q2: 80% of ETc; Q3: 100% of ETc; Q4: 120% of ETc) and three crop patterns (C1: Barley 100%; C2: Vetch 100%; C3: Mix 50% barley and 50% vetch). Based on the production and quality components, table grapes were successfully grown on plots that are supplied with TW. Fodder crops were successfully grown using TW with remarkable increase in biomass and grain yield production for the irrigated treatments.

Phytoplankton Production Characteristics in the Upper and Lower Pools of Volga Reservoir HPPs	WATER RESOURCES												Data of field observations of 1989-1991 were used to analyze the habitat conditions and the structural-functional characteristics of phytoplankton in near-dam reaches of Volga reservoirs. Averaged data show negative trends, manifesting themselves in a decline in the characteristics of phytoplankton development and production-destruction processes in the lower pools of HPPs against the background of a decrease in water temperature, water transparency, and dissolved oxygen content. Saprobity indices show water quality in near-dam reaches to correspond to beta-mesosaprobic zone and not to deteriorate in the lower pools, despite the decline in organic matter destruction. By the combination of abiotic characteristics and phytoplankton production indices, the upper and lower pools of Volga HPP reservoirs occupy close positions in the shortest network and fall in the clusters formed by stations in appropriate reservoirs.

Macrophytes as Indicators of the Ecological State of Small Rivers in Minsk Region	WATER RESOURCES												The ecological state of 18 small rivers in Minsk Region was for the first time estimated by jointly used macrophyte-based characteristics, including saprobity index, biological macrophyte index for rivers, and a scale of cenotic/supercenotic organization of aquatic and coastal-aquatic plants. Rivers with relatively safe ecological status were shown to dominate, while other rivers are in a safe and satisfactory state. The proposed approach to determining the ecological quality of watercourses is based on the calculation of a complex characteristic, i.e., an integral macrophyte index of small river ecological status; this index has been developed in the context of a classification scheme of surface water quality in the National Environmental Monitoring System of the Republic of Belarus.																	0097-8078	1608-344X				NOV	2017	44	6					840	848		10.1134/S0097807817060070								WOS:000417015800006

While several different systems have previously been used to study these lakes, no existing methodology adequately measures both the chemical and biotic parameters of these water bodies. Here, we present a novel Biotic Monitoring Yunnan Lakes (BMYL) index that provides a general assessment tool for ecological deterioration that is caused by organic pollution. Principal Component Analysis is used to analyze the occurrence of families of macroinvertebrates and chemical properties of the lakes. In brief, families of macroinvertebrates were given a score from 10 to 1 based on sensitivity to organic enrichment and eutrophication. Sampling at each lake yielded an Average Score per Lake (ASPL) which is calculated by dividing the total BMYL by the total number of scoring families. High ASPL values characterize a biologically intact lake containing relatively large numbers of high scoring taxa, while lower ASPL values denote a polluted lake that does not support many high scoring taxa. The results of the BMYL show a notably more accurate characterization of the long-term health of concerned aquatic ecosystems than studies that use abundance levels of species or a simple analysis of chemical parameter.																	0097-8078	1608-344X				NOV	2017	44	6					864	874		10.1134/S0097807817090020								WOS:000417015800008

Because available water resources are much lower in the dry season, both the design and operational settings are optimized to satisfy water-demand, water-quality, and pressure constraints, as well as efficiency indices under stringent conditions. Because of the heterogeneity of the multiple decision variables and the complicated way they interact through the multiple objectives (some complimentary and some conflicting), it is not possible to fully automate the simultaneous sectorization, rehabilitation, and operational optimization. Therefore, a multistage approach is used where engineering judgment and network graph simplification and visualization tools are used to find a good feasible solution that serves as a first guess for further optimization of sectors and operational settings, to achieve feasible solutions with better cost of implementation, demand similarity among DMAs, and better pressure uniformity in operations. A multiobjective agent swarm optimization framework is used to iteratively change the sectors at the boundaries. For the final configuration, sequential linear programming is used to find optimal valve and pump settings. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Geophysical characterisation of the groundwater-surface water interface	ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES												Interactions between groundwater (GW) and surface water (SW) have important implications for water quantity, water quality, and ecological health. The subsurface region proximal to SW bodies, the GW-SW interface, is crucial as it actively regulates the transfer of nutrients, contaminants, and water between GW systems and SW environments. However, geological, hydrological, and biogeochemical heterogeneity in the GW-SW interface makes it difficult to characterise with direct observations. Over the past two decades geophysics has been increasingly used to characterise spatial and temporal variability throughout the GW-SW interface. Geophysics is a powerful tool in evaluating structural heterogeneity, revealing zones of GW discharge, and monitoring hydrological processes. Geophysics should be used alongside traditional hydrological and biogeochemical methods to provide additional information about the subsurface. Further integration of commonly used geophysical techniques, and adoption of emerging techniques, has the potential to improve understanding of the properties and processes of the GW-SW interface, and ultimately the implications for water quality and environmental health.

Analytical estimation of annual runoff distribution in ungauged seasonally dry basins based on a first order Taylor expansion of the Fu's equation	ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES												The assessment of the mean annual runoff and its interannual variability in a basin is the first and fundamental task for several activities related to water resources management and water quality analysis. The scarcity of observed runoff data is a common problem worldwide so that the runoff estimation in ungauged basins is still an open question. In this context, the main aim of this work is to propose and test a simple tool able to estimate the probability distribution of the annual surface runoff in ungauged river basins in arid and semi-arid areas using a simplified Fu's parameterization of the Budyko's curve at regional scale. Starting from a method recently developed to derive the distribution of annual runoff, under the assumption of negligible inter-annual change in basin water storage, we here generalize the application to any catchment where the parameter of the Fu's curve is known. Specifically, we provide a closed-form expression of the annual runoff distribution as a function of the mean and standard deviation of annual rainfall and potential evapotranspiration, and the Fu's parameter. The proposed method is based on a first order Taylor expansion of the Fu's equation and allows calculating the probability density function of annual runoff in seasonally dry arid and semi-arid geographic context around the world by taking advantage of simple easy-to-find climatic data and the many studies with estimates of the Fu's parameter worldwide. The computational simplicity of the proposed tool makes it a valuable supporting tool in the field of water resources assessment for practitioners, regional agencies and authorities.

Direct groundwater discharge and vulnerability to hidden nutrient loads along the Great Lakes coast of the United States	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Direct groundwater discharge delivers nutrients from land and lakebed sediments to the Great Lakes, which impacts lake water quality. Broad spatial distributions of discharging groundwater are often difficult to measure directly. We present high resolution estimates of direct groundwater discharge across 43% of the Great Lakes coastline based on a water budget approach that uses hydroclimatic models and high-resolution hydrographic data available within the United States. We also integrate land use data to identify coastal areas vulnerable to high groundwater-borne nutrient loads. Estimated rates of direct groundwater discharge along the Great Lakes coast are highly variable, but generally are greatest for Lake Erie and Lake Michigan. Almost one-third of Lake Erie's United States coastline is vulnerable to groundwater sources of nutrients. To assess uncertainties and limitations in our vulnerability analysis, a vulnerable site along Lake Erie was selected for detailed field measurements of direct groundwater discharge rates and nutrient fluxes. Measured discharge rates were significantly lower than water budget-based estimates (354 +/- 25 m(3) y(-1) m(-1) compared to 588 +/- 181 m(3) y(-1) m(-1)). Dissolved phosphorous concentrations in the lakebed were elevated compared to onshore groundwater, while nitrate concentrations were lower, indicative of a highly reactive sediment-water interface. Some of the measured phosphorus may be locally sourced from desorption of legacy P or mineralization of organic matter in the lakebed, which our vulnerability framework does not include. Much of the land-derived nitrogen may be transformed along groundwater flow paths prior to discharge. While model-based estimates of direct groundwater discharge and vulnerability to nutrient loading are important for managing Great Lakes water quality, direct field observations remain essential for quantifying fluxes.

Specifically, a bespoke integrated model developed in previous studies has been modified in order to include the micropollutant assessment (namely, sulfamethoxazole - SMX). The model takes into account also the interactions between the three components of the system: sewer system (SS), wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and receiving water body (RWB). The analysis has been applied to an experimental catchment nearby Palermo (Italy): the Nocella catchment. Overall, five scenarios, each characterized by different uncertainty combinations of sub-systems (i.e., SS, WWTP and RWB), have been considered applying, for the sensitivity analysis, the Extended FAST method in order to select the key factors affecting the RWB quality and to design a reliable/useful experimental campaign. Results have demonstrated that sensitivity analysis is a powerful tool for increasing operator confidence in the modelling results. The approach adopted here can be used for blocking some non identifiable factors, thus wisely modifying the structure of the model and reducing the related uncertainty. The model factors related to the SS have been found to be the most relevant factors affecting the SMX modeling in the RWB when all model factors (scenario 1) or model factors of SS (scenarios 2 and 3) are varied. If the only factors related to the WWTP are changed (scenarios 4 and 5), the SMX concentration in the RWB is mainly influenced (till to 95% influence of the total variance for S-SMX,S-max) by the aerobic sorption coefficient. A progressive uncertainty reduction from the upstream to downstream was found for the soluble fraction of SMX in the RWB. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In a developing country like India where the subject of prediction in ungauged basins (PUB) is not prevalent, thirty-two catchments were specified in order to analyze continuous streamflow estimation. Spatial proximity (Inverse Distance Weighted, Kriging, and global mean), regression and physical similarity were the regionalization approaches implemented in conjunction with SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) for streamflow estimation in each catchment treated as ungauged in turn. Kriging and IDW were the two methods that produced superior results than other applied techniques in terms of Nash-Sutcliff Efficiency (NSE), RMSE-observations standard deviation ratio (RSR) Percentage bias (PBIAS) and Peak percent threshold statistics (PPTS). Physical similarity and regression approaches, which were based on catchment attributes exhibited better results than global mean approach. Sequential Uncertainty Fitting (SUFI-2) tool analyzed the uncertainty associated with regionalization techniques in terms of 95% prediction uncertainty (95PPU). The comparative assessment proposes that presence of well gauged catchments in proximity with the ungauged catchment is more beneficial than catchments having resemblance between them in terms of physiographic attributes for continuous streamflow prediction.

J	Han, DM; Currell, MJ; Cao, GL; Hall, B				Han, Dongmei; Currell, Matthew J.; Cao, Guoliang; Hall, Benjamin			Alterations to groundwater recharge due to anthropogenic landscape change	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The impacts of anthropogenic modifications to the landscape on groundwater recharge rates, locations, and mechanisms are reviewed. The two major categories of change examined are conversion of land for agriculture and urbanization, both of which have significant effects on groundwater recharge. Techniques for identifying and quantifying the changes in recharge due to these impacts are discussed. Land-clearing for agriculture and surface water transfer for irrigation have resulted in order of magnitude increases in recharge rates in many semi-arid regions worldwide, causing ongoing land and water salinization and water-logging problems. While increased recharge by irrigation return flow may alleviate shallow groundwater depletion in some settings, this is complicated by the effect of unsaturated zone thickening, which reduces the fraction of potential recharge becoming actual recharge, and may result in new water quality risks such as nitrate contamination. Expansion of urban and peri-urban land and their associated surface and sub-surface infrastructure results in complex water balance changes that re-distribute groundwater recharge locations, modify recharge mechanism(s) and result in variable impacts on recharge rates (e.g., overall net decrease, increase or minimal change) and quality. While changes to groundwater recharge resulting from conversion of land for agriculture are relatively well understood, less is documented about the changes resulting from urbanization, due to a paucity of data from field-based studies. Two case studies from Beijing, China and Melbourne Australia are examined, which highlight these impacts and demonstrate some potential methodological techniques for this topic.

Integrated planning for regional development planning and water resources management under uncertainty: A case study of Xining, China	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Economic restructuring, water resources management, population planning and environmental protection are subjects to inner uncertainties of a compound system with objectives which are competitive alternatives. Optimization model and water quality model are usually used to solve problems in a certain aspect. To overcome the uncertainty and coupling in reginal planning management, an interval fuzzy program combined with water quality model for regional planning and management has been developed to obtain the absolutely "optimal" solution in this study. The model is a hybrid methodology of interval parameter programming (IPP), fuzzy programing (FP), and a general one-dimensional water quality model. The method extends on the traditional interval parameter fuzzy programming method by integrating water quality model into the optimization framework. Meanwhile, as an abstract concept, water resources carrying capacity has been transformed into specific and calculable index. Besides, unlike many of the past studies about water resource management, population as a significant factor has been considered. The results suggested that the methodology was applicable for reflecting the complexities of the regional planning and management systems within the planning period. The government policy makers could establish effective industrial structure, water resources utilization patterns and population planning, and to better understand the tradeoffs among economic, water resources, population and environmental objectives.

Multi-effect air gap membrane distillation process for pesticide wastewater treatment	MEMBRANE WATER TREATMENT												A multi-effect air gap membrane distillation (ME-AGMD) module for pesticide wastewater treatment is studied with internal heat recovery, sensible heat of brine recovery, number of stages and the use of fresh feed as cooling water in a single module is implemented in this study. A flat sheet polytetrafluroethylene (PTFE) membrane was used in the 4-stage ME-AGMD module. The maximum value of permeate flux could reach 38.62 L/m(2)h at feed -coolant water temperature difference about 52 degrees C. The performance parameter of the module like, specific energy consumption and gain output ratio (GOR) was investigated for the module with and without heat recovery. Also, the module performance was characterized with respect to the separation efficiency of several important water quality parameters. The removal efficiency of the module was found to be >98.8% irrespective water quality parameters. During the experiment the membrane fouling was caused due to the deposition of the salt/crystal on the membrane surface. The membrane fouling was controlled by membrane module washing cycle 9 h and also by acidification of the feed water (pH=4) using 0.1M HCl solution.																	2005-8624	2092-7037				NOV	2017	8	6					529	541		10.12989/mwt.2017.8.6.529								WOS:000416093300002

The objective was to map the sources of AMD contamination, including discrete sources visible at the surface and diffuse inputs that were not readily apparent. This was achieved using geochemical sampling, in-stream and in-seep fluid electrical conductivity (EC) logging, and electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) of the subsurface. The low pH of the AMD-impacted water correlated to high fluid EC values that served as a target for the ERI. From ERI, we identified two likely sources of diffuse contamination entering the stream: (1) the subsurface extent of two seepage faces visible on the surface, and (2) rainfall runoff washing salts deposited on the streambank and in a tailings pile on the east bank of Lion Creek. Additionally, rainfall leaching through the tailings pile is a potential diffuse source of contamination if the subsurface beneath the tailings pile is hydraulically connected with the stream. In-stream fluid EC was lowest when stream discharge was highest in early summer and then increased throughout the summer as stream discharge decreased, indicating that the concentration of dissolved solids in the stream is largely controlled by mixing of groundwater and snowmelt. Total dissolved solids (TDS) load is greatest in early summer and displays a large diel signal. Identification of diffuse sources and variability in TDS load through time should allow for more targeted remediation options.

Thirty mine water samples were collected from opencast and underground mines, and concentrations of Al, As, Ba, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Se, and Zn were determined using ICP-MS. Spatial distribution maps were prepared using GIS software so that the quality of the mine water could be easily understood. Metal concentrations were higher in the pre-monsoon season than in the post-monsoon season, irrespective of location, but there were more significant seasonal variations in the opencast mine water than in the underground mine water. The concentrations of Al, Ba, Fe, Mn, and Ni exceeded the desirable as well as the permissible drinking water limits in both seasons. The quality of the surface water as well as the groundwater in the region may be adversely affected by the high metal concentrations in this mine water.

Evaluation of the Impact of Na-SO4 Dominated Ionic Strength on Effluent Water Quality in Bench-Scale Vertical Flow Bioreactors Using Spent Mushroom Compost	MINE WATER AND THE ENVIRONMENT												Passive treatment systems (PTSs) are frequently used to treat mine drainage that contains elevated concentrations of Fe, sulfate, and trace metals. Vertical flow bioreactors (VFBRs), often designed specifically to remove trace metals from mine drainage and retain them in an organic substrate, are a common PTS component. Many factors, including ionic strength, affect the performance of VFBR and their ability to remove trace metals. A paired-comparison study was performed in which two sets of columns were constructed, filled with an organic substrate, and fed synthetic mine water of differing ionic strengths, dominated by Na and sulfate, for 1 year. Elevated ionic strength significantly increased the rate of removal of Cd and Zn, and possibly Pb. Conversely, elevated ionic strength significantly decreased the rate of removal of Ni and Mn and even caused the eventual release of Mn from the substrate.

Integration of Hydraulic and Water Quality Modelling in Distribution Networks: EPANET-PMX	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Simulation models for water distribution networks are used routinely for many purposes. Some examples are planning, design, monitoring and control. However, under conditions of low pressure, the conventional models that employ demand-driven analysis often provide misleading results. On the other hand, almost all the models that employ pressure-driven analysis do not perform dynamic and/or water quality simulations seamlessly. Typically, they exclude key elements such as pumps, control devices and tanks. EPANET-PDX is a pressure-driven extension of the EPANET 2 simulation model that preserved the capabilities of EPANET 2 including water quality modelling. However, it cannot simulate multiple chemical substances at once. The single-species approach to water quality modelling is inefficient and somewhat unrealistic. The reason is that different chemical substances may co-exist in water distribution networks. This article proposes a fully integrated network analysis model (EPANET-PMX) (pressure-dependent multi-species extension) that addresses these weaknesses. The model performs both steady state and dynamic simulations. It is applicable to any network with various combinations of chemical reactions and reaction kinetics. Examples that demonstrate its effectiveness are included.																	0920-4741	1573-1650				NOV	2017	31	14					4485	4503		10.1007/s11269-017-1760-0								WOS:000412744400007						
J	Su, Y; Guan, DJ; Su, WC; Gao, WJ				Su Yin; Guan Dongjie; Su Weici; Gao Weijun			Integrated assessment and scenarios simulation of urban water security system in the southwest of China with system dynamics analysis	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The demand for global freshwater is growing, while global freshwater available for human use is limited within a certain time and space. Its security has significant impacts on both the socioeconomic system and ecological system. Recently, studies have focused on the urban water security system (UWSS) in terms of either water quantity or water quality. In this study, water resources, water environment, and water disaster issues in the UWSS were combined to establish an evaluation index system with system dynamics (SD) and geographic information systems (GIS). The GIS method performs qualitative analysis from the perspective of the spatial dimension; meanwhile, the SD method performs quantitative calculation about related water security problems from the perspective of the temporal dimension. We established a UWSS model for Guizhou province, China to analyze influencing factors, main driving factors, and system variation law, by using the SD method. We simulated the water security system from 2005 to 2025 under four scenarios (Guiyang scenario, Zunyi scenario, Bijie scenario and combined scenario). The results demonstrate that: (1) the severity of water security in cities is ranked as follows: three cities are secure in Guizhou province, four cities are in basic security and two cities are in a situation of insecurity from the spatial dimension of GIS through water security synthesis; and (2) the major driving factors of UWSS in Guizhou province include agricultural irrigation water demand, soil and water losses area, a ratio increase to the standard of water quality, and investment in environmental protection. A combined scenario is the best solution for UWSS by 2025 in Guizhou province under the four scenarios from the temporal dimension of SD. The results of this study provide a useful suggestion for the management of freshwater for the cities of Guizhou province in southwest China.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				NOV	2017	76	9					2255	2267		10.2166/wst.2017.333								WOS:000415638000001	29144284

The experimental results showed that the vortex wave flow state in the membrane module could be formed when the Reynolds number (Re) of liquid was adjusted between 450 and 1,050, and the membrane flux declined more slowly in the vortex wave flow state than those in the laminar flow state and turbulent flow state. The MBR system was used to treat domestic wastewater under the condition of vortex wave flow state for 30 days. The results showed that the removal efficiency for CODcr and NH3-N was 82% and 98% respectively, and the permeate quality met the requirement of 'Water quality standard for urban miscellaneous water consumption (GB/T 18920-2002)'. Analysis of the energy consumption of the MBR showed that the average energy consumption was 1.90 +/- 0.55 kWh/m(3) (permeate), which was only two thirds of conventional MBR energy consumption.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				NOV	2017	76	9					2465	2472		10.2166/wst.2017.400								WOS:000415638000021	29144304					
J	Chen, H; Zuo, QT; Zhang, YY				Chen, Hao; Zuo, Qi-ting; Zhang, Yong-yong			Preliminary results of water quality assessment using phytoplankton and physicochemical approaches in the Huai River Basin, China	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Water pollution has been a significant issue in the Huai River Basin (HRB) of China since the late 1970s. In July and December 2013, two field investigations were carried out at 10 sites along the main streams of the basin. The monitoring indices contained both physicochemical variables and the structure and composition of phytoplankton communities. The correlations between communities and physicochemical variables were analyzed using cluster analysis and redundancy analysis. Moreover, water quality was evaluated using the comprehensive nutrition state index (TLI) and Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H). Results indicated that more phytoplankton species were present in December than in July, but total density was less in December. Phytoplankton communities in the midstream of the Shaying River were affected by the same physicochemical factors throughout the year, but ammonia nitrogen and total phosphorus had the greatest influence on these sites in July and December, respectively. The water pollution status of the sampling sites was much greater in the Shaying River midstream than at other sites. TLI was more suitable than H for assessing water quality in the study area. These results provide valuable information for policy makers and stakeholders in water quality assessment, water ecosystem restoration, and sustainable basin management in the HRB.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				NOV	2017	76	9					2554	2564		10.2166/wst.2017.418								WOS:000415638000030	29144313					
J	Zhang, ZC				Zhang, Zhenchao			The flocculation mechanism and treatment of oily wastewater by flocculation	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												In the present study, the performance of compound flocculants composed of different concentrations of polyaluminum chloride (PAC) and cationic polyacrylamide (CPAM), the influencing mechanism of the flocculation process and the effects of temperature, settling time, and speed and time of stirring were investigated. The results show that the poor water quality with high concentrations of oil, suspended solids (SS) and polymer greatly increases the oily wastewater emulsion stability and the difficulty of the flocculation treatment process. The compound flocculant in oily wastewater treatment can achieve best results at optimum conditions of temperature 45 degrees C, settling time 60 min, and two stirring stages, 250 r.min(-1) for 3 min followed by 100 r.min(-1) for 7 min. At the PAC dosage of 80 mg.L-1 and the CPAM dosage of 0.8 mg.L-1, the turbidity of oily wastewater is reduced from 153.8 NTU to 11.2 NTU, and the turbidity removal rate reaches 92.69%. Through further measurements, oil content and SS content are less than 10 mg.L-1, which meets the requirement of the Daqing oilfield re-injection standard.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				NOV	2017	76	10					2630	2637		10.2166/wst.2017.414								WOS:000415999900006	29168702

In this study, water columns were collected at 22 sites in the littoral zone of Lake Taihu in 2014 to investigate the distribution and concentration of nutrients and the stable isotope signatures of POM, and their potential interrelation. Generally, mean concentration of nitrogen forms (NH4+-N) showed substantial variation, probably because they had received large amounts of wastewater from various local industrial enterprises. Source analysis by stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios showed that the main POM sources were phytoplankton. Contrasting correlations were obtained between delta N-15 and N concentrations in effluent river mouths when compared with influent river mouths. In effluent river mouths, there was a significant positive correlation between delta N-15 and nitrogen concentration (total nitrogen and ammonia-nitrogen), in contrast with the negative correlation in influent river mouths. According to these results, more factors should be taken into consideration when stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes of POM are used to assess the feeding relationship between consumers and prey, as well as the energy flow pathways that support the lake pelagic food webs.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				NOV	2017	76	10					2690	2697		10.2166/wst.2017.439								WOS:000415999900013	29168709					
J	Elci, A				Elci, Alper			Evaluation of nutrient retention in vegetated filter strips using the SWAT model	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Nutrient fluxes in stream basins need to be controlled to achieve good water quality status. In stream basins with intensive agricultural activities, nutrients predominantly come from diffuse sources. Therefore, best management practices (BMPs) are increasingly implemented to reduce nutrient input to streams. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of vegetated filter strip (VFS) application as an agricultural BMP. For this purpose, SWAT is chosen, a semi-distributed water quality assessment model that works at the watershed scale, and applied on the Nif stream basin, a small-sized basin in Western Turkey. The model is calibrated with an automated procedure against measured monthly discharge data. Nutrient loads for each sub-basin are estimated considering basin-wide data on chemical fertilizer and manure usage, population data for septic tank effluents and information about the land cover. Nutrient loads for 19 sub-basins are predicted on an annual basis. Average total nitrogen and total phosphorus loads are estimated as 47.85 t/yr and 13.36 t/yr for the entire basin. Results show that VFS application in one sub-basin offers limited retention of nutrients and that a selection of 20-m filter width is most effective from a cost-benefit perspective.

Nutrient modeling for a semi-intensive IMC pond: an MS-Excel approach	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Semi-intensive Indian Major Carp (IMC) culture was practised in polythene lined dugout ponds at the Aquacultural Farm of Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, West Bengal for 3 consecutive years at three different stocking densities (S. D), viz., 20,000, 35,000 and 50,000 numbers of fingerlings per hectare of water spread area. Fingerlings of Catla, Rohu and Mrigal were raised at a stocking ratio of 4:3:3. Total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) value along with other fishpond water quality parameters was monitored at 1 day intervals to ensure a good water ecosystem for a better fish growth. Water exchange was carried out before the TAN reached the critical limit. Field data on TAN obtained from the cultured fishponds stocked with three different stocking densities were used to study the dynamics of TAN. A developed model used to study the nutrient dynamics in shrimp pond was used to validate the observed data in the IMC pond ecosystem. Two years of observed TAN data were used to calibrate the spreadsheet model and the same model was validated using the third year observed data. The manual calibration based on the trial and error process of parameters adjustments was used and several simulations were performed by changing the model parameters. After adjustment of each parameter, the simulated and measured values of the water quality parameters were compared to judge the improvement in the model prediction. Forward finite difference discretization method was used in a MS-Excel spreadsheet to calibrate and validate the model for obtaining the TAN levels during the culture period. Observed data from the cultured fishponds of three different S. D were used to standardize 13 model parameters. The efficiency of the developed spreadsheet model was found to be more than 90% for the TAN estimation in the IMC cultured fishponds.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				NOV	2017	76	10					2858	2866		10.2166/wst.2017.458								WOS:000415999900030	29168726

Beneficiary households assessed the components of the intervention including its relevance and adequacy in improving understanding of water quality issues. Motivating and constraining factors to participation in the randomized experiment are also assessed. We also estimate the correlates of participation in the intervention. Social and economic benefits derived from the intervention based on perceptions are compared with impacts of the intervention using an instrumental variable approach. We found evidence that subjective analysis estimates of the effects of the intervention are higher than the objective analysis estimates. Households generally perceived the intervention to be relevant in improving their understanding of water quality issues. However, there are differing opinions based on random assignment into either child or adult treatment groups on most- and least-liked attributes of the intervention, and also motivating and constraining factors affecting participation in the intervention. The factors that statistically and significantly influenced participation in the intervention include educational attainment, ethnicity, religious denomination and marital status of the household heads, in addition to the location of residence.																	1366-7017					NOV	2017	19	6					1206	1224		10.2166/wp.2017.177								WOS:000415345400013

It could affect water quality and marine ecosystems due to pollutants and trace elements transported through groundwater. Relations between different characteristics of aquifers and SGD have been investigated extensively before, but the role of fractures in SGD still remains unknown. In order to better understand the mechanism of groundwater flow and solute transport through fractures in SGD, one-dimensional analytical solutions of groundwater hydraulic head and velocity through a synthetic horizontal fracture with periodic boundary conditions were derived using a Laplace transform technique. Then, numerical solutions of solute transport associated with the given groundwater velocity were developed using a finite-difference method. The results indicated that SGD associated with groundwater flow and solute transport was mainly controlled by sea level periodic fluctuations, which altered the hydraulic head and the hydraulic head gradient in the fracture. As a result, the velocity of groundwater flow associated with SGD also fluctuated periodically. We found that the pollutant concentration associated with SGD oscillated around a constant value, and could not reach a steady state. This was particularly true at locations close to the seashore. This finding of the role of fracture in SGD will assist pollution remediation and marine conservation in coastal regions.

Transport and potential attenuation of nitrogen in shallow groundwaters in the lower Rangitikei catchment, New Zealand	JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY												Intensive agricultural activities are generally associated with nitrogen leaching from agricultural soils, and this nitrogen has the potential to percolate and contaminate groundwater and surface waters. We assessed surface water and groundwater interactions, and nitrogen leaching and its potential attenuation in shallow groundwater in the lower Rangitikei River catchment (832 km(2)), New Zealand. We combined regional- and local-scale field surveys and experiments, nutrient budget modelling, and hydraulic and geochemical methods, to gain an insight into leaching, transformation and transport of nitrogen via groundwaters to the river in the study area. Concurrent river flow gaugings (in January 2015) and a piezometric map, developed from measured depths to groundwater in 110 bores (in October 2014), suggest groundwater discharges to the Rangitikei River in the upper parts of the study area, while there is groundwater recharge near the coast. The groundwater redox characterisation, based on sampling and analysis of 15 mostly shallow bores (< 30 m below ground level (bgl)), suggests groundwater across the lower Rangitikei catchment in general is under anoxic/reduced conditions. The groundwater typically has low dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations (< 1 mg/L), suggesting the subsurface environment is conducive to potential attenuation by 'denitrification' of NO3-N in groundwater. We further measured NO3-N attenuation in shallow groundwater piezometers (3-6 m bgl) using single-well push-pull tests. We found generally low levels (< 0.5 mg/L) of NO3-N in shallow groundwater piezometers (> 5 m bgl), despite being installed under intensive land uses, such as dairying and cropping. Our in-field push-pull tests showed NO3-N reduction at four shallow groundwater piezometers, with the rates of reduction varying from 0.04 mg N L-1 h(-1) to 1.57 mg N h(-1). This highlights the importance of a sound understanding of not only the sources, but also transport and transformation, or fate, of nutrients leached from farms, to mitigate the likely impacts of land use on water quality and ecosystem health in agricultural catchments.																	0169-7722	1873-6009				NOV	2017	206						55	66		10.1016/j.jconhyd.2017.10.002								WOS:000414891200006	29033220

Most local supply systems are developed and maintained by the local community and are in a poor condition. Based on a national strategy, this issue should be resolved with the construction of regional systems using artificial reservoirs. In this paper, case studies from three areas in Serbia are shown in order to offer the alternative to regional water supply with the development of autonomous groundwater supply systems in remote settlements, especially in cases when water supply from surface water inevitably leads to the deterioration in quality and quantity of resources. The research conducted included monitoring of regime parameters and conducting multiple chemical analyses in order to determine the stability of resources, both in the qualitative and quantitative sense, as well as other important factors for development of supply systems. It can be concluded that, if properly and continuously monitored and developed by public waterworks companies, those autonomous groundwater systems would be able to provide the required amount of quality resources for the water supply of remote settlements where necessary.																	0003-7214	1365-2087				NOV	2017	66	7					454	468		10.2166/aqua.2017.129								WOS:000414671500004

The input data included monitored riverine loads, point sources and land use categories from a total of 50 rivers/catchment areas. Two independent studies were conducted: the estimation of emission coefficients for the whole of Estonia and for a smaller study area near Tallinn. The results from both cases showed that drained peat soils were the highest diffuse source contributor in unit-area loads. The results show that the unit-area loads from drained peat soils were up to 2.3 times higher than from arable land. Moreover, a comparison of emission coefficients for the whole of Estonia and for the Tallinn catchment area indicated that coefficients can vary significantly between sources and single years. Additional detailed studies and monitoring are needed to support these conclusions.																	0003-7214	1365-2087				NOV	2017	66	7					469	480		10.2166/aqua.2017.036								WOS:000414671500005

Adopting measures such as developing common methodologies, tools and techniques addressing water quality and quantity issues, water losses and pricing policies is a top priority. Regarding the harmonization of procedures and legislative framework, the requirements of the Water Framework Directive 2000/60 are respected. An approach to face these challenges is being developed through the cooperation of several organizations and stakeholders involved in the implementation of the DRINKADRIA project. This paper discusses its specific objectives and outputs linked to: (a) promotion of sustainable provision of drinking water, by setting joint cross-border recommendations on drinking water resources management; (b) undertaking of methods and technologies, through the implementation of pilot actions; and (c) stimulating capacity building, through the exchange of know-how and the development of a regional network of water supply experts. A set of standardized protocols on the applicable management of water supply systems and resources in the Adriatic area is being developed and tested by the beneficiaries involved. The relevant pilot actions aim at improving water supply and water resources management.

Effectiveness of silver and copper infused ceramic drinking water filters in reducing microbiological contaminants	JOURNAL OF WATER SUPPLY RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY-AQUA												A series of bench-scale experiments were conducted on ceramic filters with various amounts of silver and/or copper nanoparticles fired-in during the manufacturing process. The experiments were designed to determine the efficacy of the filters on the removal of pathogens from drinking water. Escherichia coli and MS2 were employed as non-pathogenic surrogates for pathogenic organisms. Experiments were run on 23 ceramic filters - 10 replicates, one single filter, and two blanks - for approximately 10 days. Influent and effluent turbidity, E. coli, and MS2 concentrations were monitored regularly. Results showed that all ceramic filter configurations exceeded WHO standards for removal of bacteria under highly protective conditions, but few met these criteria for bacteriophage. The filters containing various concentrations of silver nanoparticles (25-100%) achieved an additional 2 log removal over the blank, copper, and mixed copper/silver filters for bacteria; however, it was difficult to determine the effect of nanoparticles on the removal of bacteriophage. A significant variation in effluent quality between filters of the same composition was observed, indicating the importance of variations in the manufacturing process on effluent water quality. Given the potential health risks of inadequate filtration, it is recommended that the quality control process be examined and upgraded.																	0003-7214	1365-2087				NOV	2017	66	7					528	536		10.2166/aqua.2017.028								WOS:000414671500010						
J	Gad, WA				Gad, Waseem A.			Bioremediation of pollutant-contaminated water	JOURNAL OF WATER SUPPLY RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY-AQUA												Raw water resources in Kafr El-Sheikh Governorate are affected by many contaminants particularly during the winter season and low demand period of the Nile River, in which water level decreases and organic matter increases resulting in decreased dissolved oxygen, and increased ammonia, nitrite and bacterial load in the water. In this study, physicochemical and microbiological characteristics of water samples taken seasonally from selected sampling sites on seven main canals in Kafr El-Sheikh Governorate were tested and studied to monitor nitrification process occurrence and study its effect on water quality. The main results of the study included turbidity, conductivity, ammonia, nitrite and nitrate and showed increased values during the winter season. Heavy metals levels showed that iron increased in winter and aluminum increased in spring, while copper increased in winter and spring seasons. Total bacterial count, total coliform and algal count increased in the winter season. Activity of ammonia oxidizing bacteria also increased markedly during the winter season which could be explained by increased ammonia concentration during the same period which enhanced nitrification process occurrence. This study proved that nitrification in environments which provide unfavorable conditions for autotrophic nitrifying bacteria may result from the activity of heterotrophic microorganisms; Bacillus amyloliquefaciens was isolated and identified to be involved.

The effect of rivers, streams, and canals on property values	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Rivers, streams, and canals support a variety of critical agricultural, industrial, transportation, ecological, and household uses. They also provide important aesthetic, recreational, and sociocultural benefits. This review paper synthesizes the evidence to date regarding the value of these linear water features as aesthetic and recreational resources to adjacent and nearby residents. Specifically, it summarizes 25 studies that have used the hedonic pricing method to calculate the effects of views of and proximity to rivers, streams, and canals on surrounding residential property values. The majority of studies indicated that significant positive property price effects are associated with river, stream, and canal view and proximity, though these effects appear less definitive in rural than urban settings. Implications of the body of evidence for planning, management, and development are discussed, and potential effects of climate change and diversion policies are highlighted. Improvements in measurement facilitated by advanced geographic information systems and rigorous spatially explicit regression techniques are noted.

J	Dollinger, J; Vinatier, F; Voltz, M; Dages, C; Bailly, JS				Dollinger, Jeanne; Vinatier, Fabrice; Voltz, Marc; Dages, Cecile; Bailly, Jean-Stephane			Impact of maintenance operations on the seasonal evolution of ditch properties and functions	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Ditch networks were traditionally designed to protect fields from soil erosion or control waterlogging. They are still frequently managed by either mowing, chemical weeding, dredging or burning to ensure their optimal hydraulic capacity. Ditches were recently reported also to improve water quality and sustain biodiversity. These ditch functions are related to specific ditch properties. By contrastingly modifying ditch properties, maintenance operations were supposed to regulate these functions. There is, therefore, a need to re-examine the design and maintenance strategies of ditches to optimize the whole range of ecosystem services that they provide. In this study, we address the innovator question of how maintenance operations affect the yearly evolution of ditch properties, and in turn, the panel of functions that ditches support. During one year, we monitored the vegetation, litter, soil properties, and ash cover of five ditches that were being unmanaged, dredged, mowed, burned, and chemically weeded, respectively, with timing and frequency as generally operated by farmers in the study area. We then used indicators to evaluate the effect that the evolution of these properties has on the ditch water conveyance, herbicide retention and biodiversity conservation functions. We found that the evolution of these properties significantly contrasted among the 5 maintenance strategies. All the maintenance operations cleared the vegetation, which improves the hydraulic capacity by up to 3 times. The optimal hydraulic capacity is maintained longer after chemical weeding and dredging, but these operations have negative impacts on the herbicide retention and biodiversity conservation functions. The litter and ash layers generated by mowing and burning, respectively, improve the herbicide retention by up to 45%. Our results confirm that maintenance can be an efficient tool for optimizing ditch functions. The choice of maintenance operation and timing are key to successfully optimizing most of the functions that ditches can support. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Nineteen water samples were collected in dry season and 15 water quality parameters including TSS, TDS, pH, DO, BOD, Cl-, F-, NO32-, NO2-, SO42-, Ca, Mg, K, Zn and Pb were measured. The univariate overview of water quality parameters are TSS 25.154 +/- 8.674 mg/l, TDS 840.400 +/- 311.081 mg/l, pH 7.574 +/- 0.256 pH unit, DO 4.544 +/- 0.933 mg/l, BOD 0.758 +/- 0.179 mg/l, Cl- 51.494 +/- 28.095 mg/l, F- 0.771 +/- 0.153 mg/l, NO32- 2.211 +/- 0.878 mg/l, NO2- 4.692 +/- 5.971 mg/l, SO42- 69.545 +/- 53.873 mg/l, Ca 48.458 +/- 22.690 mg/l, Mg 19.676 +/- 7.361 mg/l, K 12.874 +/- 11.382 mg/l, Zn 0.027 +/- 0.029 mg/l, Pb 0.096 +/- 0.154 mg/l. The water quality data were subjected to R-mode PCA which resulted in five major components. PC1 explains 28% of total variance and indicates the roadside and brick field dust settle down (TDS, TSS) in the nearby water body. PC2 explains 22.123% of total variance and indicates the agricultural influence (K, Ca, and NO2-). PC3 describes the contribution of nonpoint pollution from agricultural and soil erosion processes (SO42-, Cl-, and K). PC4 depicts heavy positively loaded by vehicle emission and diffusion from battery stores (Zn, Pb). PC5 depicts strong positive loading of BOD and strong negative loading of pH. Cluster analysis represents three major clusters for both water parameters and sampling sites. The site based on cluster showed similar grouping pattern of R-mode factor score map. The present work reveals a new scope to monitor the roadside water quality for future research in Bangladesh.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				NOV	2017	7	7					3511	3525		10.1007/s13201-017-0619-0								WOS:000413254300008

Sample collection, handling and processing followed the standard methods recommended by APHA and analyzed in quality assured laboratories using appropriate analytical methods and instrumental techniques. The results show that the quality parameters in all drinking water resources are within the permissible limits set by Omani and WHO standards; and the drinking water quality index is good or medium in quality based on NFS-WQI classification criteria, indicating their suitability for human consumption. There is an indication of the presence of high nitrate concentrations in some groundwater wells, which require more investigations and monitoring program to be conducted on regular basis to ensure good quality water supply for the residents in the mountain. The trilinear Piper diagram shows that most of the drinking water resources of the study area fall in the field of calcium and bicarbonate type with some magnesium bicarbonate type indicating that most of the major ions are natural in origin due to the geology of the region. This study is a first step towards providing indicators on groundwater quality of this fragile mountain ecosystem, which will be the basis for future planning decisions on corrective demand management measures to protect groundwater resources of Al Jabal Al Akhdar.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				NOV	2017	7	7					3539	3552		10.1007/s13201-017-0621-6								WOS:000413254300010						
J	Prasad, B; Maiti, D; Kumar, A				Prasad, Bably; Maiti, Deblina; Kumar, Adarsh			Ground water quality evaluation in the lean period of a mining township	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Groundwater of mining towns is very much affected due to mining activity. During mining of mineral from underground, huge quantity of ground water is pumped out to make mining possible. Groundwater samples have been collected from the 20 sampling sites of Dhanbad, a mining Township, in the lean period (summer) of the years 2011 and 2014. Four samples have been obtained from open well and 16 from hand pumps. Water quality parameters such as pH, total hardness, Ca hardness, Mg Hardness, chloride, sulphate, total dissolved solids, and heavy metals have been evaluated. The values of pH, total hardness, Ca hardness, Mg hardness, chloride, sulphate, and total dissolved solids have increased in 2014 as compared to 2011 which may be due to increase in mineral content in the lean period and decrease in the rate of recharge of aquifers in 2014. The concentration of heavy metals has decreased in 2014 as compared to 2011 which may be due to less leaching of heavy metals from the ground strata. From the overall study, it has been concluded that most of the water quality parameters of all the 20 groundwater samples in the year 2014 are not exceeding the acceptable concentration level, as mentioned in Indian drinking water specifications. Groundwater in the year 2014 has not shown any significant change in its quality as compared to the year 2011. In the incoming years, quality of groundwater will not show any drastic change unless and until any anthropogenic activity other than mining will affect it.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				NOV	2017	7	7					3553	3560		10.1007/s13201-017-0626-1								WOS:000413254300011

A method of groundwater quality assessment based on fuzzy network-CANFIS and geographic information system (GIS)	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The process of water quality testing is money/time-consuming, quite important and difficult stage for routine measurements. Therefore, use of models has become commonplace in simulating water quality. In this study, the coactive neuro-fuzzy inference system (CANFIS) was used to simulate groundwater quality. Further, geographic information system (GIS) was used as the pre-processor and post-processor tool to demonstrate spatial variation of groundwater quality. All important factors were quantified and groundwater quality index (GWQI) was developed. The proposed model was trained and validated by taking a case study of Mazandaran Plain located in northern part of Iran. The factors affecting groundwater quality were the input variables for the simulation, whereas GWQI index was the output. The developed model was validated to simulate groundwater quality. Network validation was performed via comparison between the estimated and actual GWQI values. In GIS, the study area was separated to raster format in the pixel dimensions of 1 km and also by incorporation of input data layers of the Fuzzy Network-CANFIS model; the geo-referenced layers of the effective factors in groundwater quality were earned. Therefore, numeric values of each pixel with geographical coordinates were entered to the Fuzzy Network-CANFIS model and thus simulation of groundwater quality was accessed in the study area. Finally, the simulated GWQI indices using the Fuzzy Network-CANFIS model were entered into GIS, and hence groundwater quality map (raster layer) based on the results of the network simulation was earned. The study's results confirm the high efficiency of incorporation of neuro-fuzzy techniques and GIS. It is also worth noting that the general quality of the groundwater in the most studied plain is fairly low.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				NOV	2017	7	7					3633	3647		10.1007/s13201-016-0508-y								WOS:000413254300018

Rama			Classification of heavy metal ions present in multi-frequency multi-electrode potable water data using evolutionary algorithm	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Access to potable water for the common people is one of the most challenging tasks in the present era. Contamination of drinking water has become a serious problem due to various anthropogenic and geogenic events. The paper demonstrates the application of evolutionary algorithms, viz., particle swan optimization and genetic algorithm to 24 water samples containing eight different heavy metal ions (Cd, Cu, Co, Pb, Zn, Ar, Cr and Ni) for the optimal estimation of electrode and frequency to classify the heavy metal ions. The work has been carried out on multi-variate data, viz., single electrode multi-frequency, single frequency multi-electrode and multi-frequency multi-electrode water samples. The electrodes used are platinum, gold, silver nanoparticles and glassy carbon electrodes. Various hazardous metal ions present in the water samples have been optimally classified and validated by the application of Davis Bouldin index. Such studies are useful in the segregation of hazardous heavy metal ions found in water resources, thereby quantifying the degree of water quality.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				NOV	2017	7	7					3679	3689		10.1007/s13201-016-0514-0								WOS:000413254300022

Engineering and environmental remediation scenarios due to leakage from the Gulf War oil spill using 3-D numerical contaminant modellings	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The transport groundwater modelling has been undertaken to assess potential remediation scenarios and provide an optimal remediation options for consideration. The purpose of the study was to allow 50 years of predictive remediation simulation time. The results depict the likely total petroleum hydrocarbon migration pattern in the area under the worst-case scenario. The remediation scenario simulations indicate that do nothing approach will likely not achieve the target water quality within 50 years. Similarly, complete source removal approach will also likely not achieve the target water quality within 50 years. Partial source removal could be expected to remove a significant portion of the contaminant mass, but would increase the rate of contaminant recharge in the short to medium term. The pump-treat-reinject simulation indicates that the option appears feasible and could achieve a reduction in the area of the 0.01 mg/L TPH contour area for both Raudhatain and Umm Al-Aish by 35 and 30%, respectively, within 50 years. The rate of improvement and the completion date would depend on a range of factors such as bore field arrangements, pumping rates, reinjection water quality and additional volumes being introduced and require further optimisation and field pilot trials.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				NOV	2017	7	7					3707	3718		10.1007/s13201-016-0517-x								WOS:000413254300024						
J	Ewaid, SH				Ewaid, Salam Hussein			Water quality evaluation of Al-Gharraf river by two water quality indices	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Water quality of Al-Gharraf river, the largest branch of Tigris River south of Iraq, was evaluated by the National Sanitation Foundation Water Quality Index (NFS WQI) and the Heavy Metal Pollution Index (HPI) depending on 13 physical, chemical, and biological parameters of water quality measured monthly at ten stations on the river during 2015. The NSF-WQI range obtained for the sampling sites was 61-70 indicating a medium water quality. The HPI value was 98.6 slightly below the critical value for drinking water of 100, and the water quality in the upstream stations is better than downstream due to decrease in water and the accumulation of contaminants along the river. This study explains the significance of applying the water quality indices that show the aggregate impact of ecological factors in charge of water pollution of surface water and which permits translation of the monitoring data to assist the decision makers.

J	Kim, CM; Parnichkun, M				Kim, Chan Moon; Parnichkun, Manukid			Prediction of settled water turbidity and optimal coagulant dosage in drinking water treatment plant using a hybrid model of k-means clustering and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Coagulation is an important process in drinking water treatment to attain acceptable treated water quality. However, the determination of coagulant dosage is still a challenging task for operators, because coagulation is nonlinear and complicated process. Feedback control to achieve the desired treated water quality is difficult due to lengthy process time. In this research, a hybrid of k-means clustering and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (k-means-ANFIS) is proposed for the settled water turbidity prediction and the optimal coagulant dosage determination using full-scale historical data. To build a well-adaptive model to different process states from influent water, raw water quality data are classified into four clusters according to its properties by a k-means clustering technique. The sub-models are developed individually on the basis of each clustered data set. Results reveal that the sub-models constructed by a hybrid k-means-ANFIS perform better than not only a single ANFIS model, but also seasonal models by artificial neural network (ANN). The finally completed model consisting of sub-models shows more accurate and consistent prediction ability than a single model of ANFIS and a single model of ANN based on all five evaluation indices. Therefore, the hybrid model of k-means-ANFIS can be employed as a robust tool for managing both treated water quality and production costs simultaneously.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				NOV	2017	7	7					3885	3902		10.1007/s13201-017-0541-5								WOS:000413254300040						
J	Unnisa, SA; Bi, SZ				Unnisa, Syeda Azeem; Bi, Shaik Zainab			Groundwater quality characterization around Jawaharnagar open dumpsite, Telangana State	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												In the present work groundwater samples were collected from ten different data points in and around Jawaharnagar municipal dumpsite, Telangana State Hyderabad city from May 2015 to May 2016 on monthly basis for groundwater quality characterization. Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) value was determined using correlation matrix to identify the highly correlated and interrelated water quality standards issued by Bureau of Indian Standard (IS-10500:2012). It is found that most of the groundwater samples are above acceptable limits and are not potable. The chemical analysis results revealed that pH range from 7.2 to 7.8, TA 222 to 427 mg/l, TDS 512 to 854 mg/l, TH 420 to 584 mg/l, Calcium 115 to 140 mg/l, Magnesium 55 to 115 mg/l, Chlorides 202 to 290 mg/l, Sulphates 170 to 250 mg/l, Nitrates 6.5 to 11.3 mg/l, and Fluoride 0.9 to 1.7 mg/l. All samples showed higher range of physicochemical parameters except nitrate content which was lower than permissible limit. Highly positive correlation was observed between pH-TH (r = 0.5063), TA-Cl- (r = 0.5896), TDS-SO4 (-) (r = 0.5125), Mg2+-NO3 (-) (r = 0.5543) and Cl--F- (r = 0.7786). The groundwater samples in and around Jawaharnagar municipal dumpsite implies that groundwater samples were contaminated by municipal leachate migration from open dumpsite. The results revealed that the systematic calculations of correlation coefficient between water parameters and regression analysis provide qualitative and rapid monitoring of groundwater quality.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				NOV	2017	7	7					3911	3918		10.1007/s13201-017-0544-2								WOS:000413254300042

Water quality assessment and hydrochemical characterization of Zamzam groundwater, Saudi Arabia	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												This study focuses on chemical and microbial analyses of 50 Zamzam water samples, Saudi Arabia. The soluble ions, trace elements, total colony counts, total coliform group, and E. coli were determined and compared with WHO standards. The obtained results indicated that the dissolved salts, soluble cations and anions, Pb, Cd, As, Zn, Cu, Ni, Co, Fe, Mn, Cr, PO4 (3-), NO2 (-), Br-, F-, NH4 (+), and Li+, were within permissible limits for all samples. Yet, 2% of waters contain NO3 (-) at slightly high concentration. The water quality index (WQI) reveals that 94% of the samples were excellent for drinking (class I). While the remaining was unsuitable due to total coliform group contamination "class (V)". Durov diagram suggest no clear facies and dominant water type can be noted. It indicates mixing processes of two or more different facies might be occurring in the groundwater system. All studied waters were undersaturated with respect to halite, gypsum, fluorite, and anhydrite. These minerals tend to dissolve and increase water salinity. A direct relationship between Zamzam water salinity and rainfall is recorded. The water salinity fluctuated between 4500 mg L-1 (year 1950) and 500 mg L-1 (year 2015) based on rainfall extent. The approach applied can be used to similar groundwater worldwide.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				NOV	2017	7	7					3985	3996		10.1007/s13201-017-0549-x								WOS:000413254300047

In order to accomplish these, groundwater sampling from 30 shallow and deep wells in the plain were carried out in July 2012. The water samples were analyzed for various physicochemical parameters such as pH, EC, Na+, Ca2+, K+, Mg2+, Cl-, CO3 (2-), HCO3 (-), SO4 (2-) and NO3 (-). Chadha's diagram demonstrates that most of the groundwaters belonged to the Na-Cl and mixed Ca-Mg-Cl hydrochemical facies. The concentrations of some major ions in groundwater are above the permissible limit for drinking and domestic purposes except for a few locations. The results of saturation index computation show that dissolution of gypsum, anhydrite, halite and silicate minerals occurs frequently across the study area, whereas the groundwater is supersaturated with regard to calcite and dolomite. Cross-plots show that weathering and dissolution of different rocks and minerals, ion exchange, reverse ion exchange and anthropogenic activities, especially agricultural activities, are effective in hydrogeochemistry of the study area.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				NOV	2017	7	7					3997	4011		10.1007/s13201-017-0550-4								WOS:000413254300048						
J	Sreedhar, Y; Nagaraju, A				Sreedhar, Y.; Nagaraju, A.			Groundwater quality around Tummalapalle area, Cuddapah District, Andhra Pradesh, India	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The suitability of groundwater for drinking and irrigation was assessed in Tummalapalle area. Forty groundwater samples were analysed for major cations, anions and other parameters such as pH, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids (TDS), total alkalinity and total hardness (TH). The parameters such as sodium adsorption ratio, adjusted sodium adsorption ratio (adj.SAR), per cent sodium, potential salinity, residual sodium carbonate, non-carbonate hardness, Kelly's ratio and permeability index were calculated for the evaluation of irrigation water quality. Groundwater chemistry was also analysed by statistical analysis, USSL, Wilcox, Doneen, Piper and Chadhas diagrams, to find out their suitability for irrigation. TDS and TH were used as main parameters to interpret the suitability of groundwater for drinking purpose. The correlation coefficient matrix between the hydrochemical parameters was carried out using Pearson's correlation to infer the possible water-rock interactions responsible for the variation of groundwater chemistry and this has been supported by Gibbs diagram. The results indicate that the groundwater in Tummalapalle area is alkaline in nature. Ca-Mg-HCO3 is the dominant hydrogeochemical facies. Water chemistry of the study area strongly reflects the dominance of weathering of rock-forming minerals such as bicarbonates and silicates. All parameters and diagrams suggest that the water samples of the study are good for irrigation, and the plots of TDS and TH suggest that 12.5% of the samples are good for human consumption.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				NOV	2017	7	7					4077	4089		10.1007/s13201-017-0564-y								WOS:000413254300054

Assessment of heavy metal contamination in the sediment of the River Ghaghara, a major tributary of the River Ganga in Northern India	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The present study includes a systematic analysis of sediment contamination by heavy metals of the River Ghaghara flowing through the Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in Indian Territory. To estimate the geochemical environment of the river, seven heavy metals, namely Co, Cu, Cr, Ni, Cd, Zn, and Pb were examined from the freshly deposited river bed sediment. All the sediment samples were collected on a seasonal basis for the assessment of fluctuation in 2014-2015 and after preparation samples were analyzed using standard procedure. Result showed that heavy metal concentration ranged between 11.37 and 18.42 mg/kg for Co, 2.76 and 11.74 mg/kg for Cu, 61.25 and 87.68 mg/kg for Cr, 15.29 and 25.59 mg/kg for Ni, 0.21 and 0.28 mg/kg for Cd, 13.26 and 17.59 mg/kg for Zn, 10.71 and 14.26 mg/kg for Pb in different season. Metal contamination factor indicates the anthropogenic input in the river sediment was in the range of (0.62-0.97) for Co, (0.04-0.26) for Cu, (0.68-0.97) for Cr, (0.22-0.38) for Ni, (0.70-0.93) for Cd, (0.14-0.19) for Zn, and (0.54-0.71) for Pb. The highest contamination degree of the sediment was noticed as 4.01 at Ayodhya and lowest as 3.16 at Katerniaghat. Geo-accumulation index was noted between (0 and 1) which showed that sediment was uncontaminated to moderately contaminated and may have adverse affects on freshwater ecology of the river. Pollution load index (PLI) was found highest at Chhapra which was 0.45 and lowest at Katerniaghat which was 0.35 and it indicates that the river sediment has a low level of contamination. Significant high correlation was observed between Co, Cu, and Zn, it suggests same source of contamination input is mainly due to human settlement and agriculture activity. Positive correlation between Zn, Co, Cu, Cr, and Ni indicated a natural origin of these elements in the river sediment. Cluster analysis suggests grouping of similar polluted sites. The strong similarity between Co, Zn, Pb, Ni, Cu, and Cd showed relationship of these metals come from the same origin, which is possibly from natural and anthropogenic input which was also confirmed by correlation analysis. Using the various pollution indicators it was found that the river bed sediment is less contaminated by toxic metals during the study but the sediment quality may degrade in the near future due to increasing anthropogenic inputs in the river basin, hence proper management strategies are required to control the direct dumping of wastewater in the river.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				NOV	2017	7	7					4133	4149		10.1007/s13201-017-0572-y								WOS:000413254300059						
J	Kumari, J; Paul, B				Kumari, Juli; Paul, Biswajit			Geochemical and environmental risk assessment of hazardous elements in river sediment	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The peninsular river Damodar is the life line of eastern India, facing critical pollution problems due to sewage, industrial waste disposal as well as coal mining along the river valley. Sediment samples were collected and analyzed for various geochemical phases of hazardous elements, and associated environmental risks were evaluated. This paper provides chemical fractionation of nine (Cd, Mn, Zn, Ni, Cu, Pb, Co, Cr, Fe) elements from river sediment by using Tessier five step sequential extraction method. The study was aimed (1) to understand dynamics and mobility of elements in different geochemical fractions; (2) to evaluate bioavailability and ecological risk of these elements by RAC; and (3) to identify contaminated and uncontaminated sites by using cluster analysis. The result of the study revealed maximum bioavailable fraction was that of Cd. Bioavailable elements in studied sediment followed the order Cd (23.76%) > Mn (14.19%) > Zn (13.54%) > Ni (12.82%) > Cu (7.12%) > Pb (7.05%) > Co (6.09%) > Fe (4.98%) > Cr (2.03%). Maximum % of the reducible fraction was found for Fe (14.38%) while in organic fraction Cu (11.25%) was maximum. Residual fraction dominates in all elements with a maximum percentage of 83.85% for Co. Risk assessment by RAC reveals that the river was under medium risk due to Cd, Mn, Zn and Ni while at low risk for rest of the elements. Cluster analysis shows that three sampling sites were highly contaminated, three were moderately contaminated and six were contaminated while only one site was uncontaminated.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				NOV	2017	76	21							731	10.1007/s12665-017-7073-z								WOS:000414335900010						
J	Sener, S; Karakus, M				Sener, Sehnaz; Karakus, Murat			Investigating water quality and arsenic contamination in drinking water resources in the Tavsanli District (Kutahya, Western Turkey)	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Arsenic is a natural component of the earth's crust, and it is transported into surface water and groundwater through the dissolution of rocks, minerals and ores. In addition, arsenic leaching processes contaminate water sources and this geogenic arsenic contamination causes significant water quality problems in many parts of the world. In this study, water quality, arsenic contamination and human health risks of drinking water resources in the Tavsanli District were determined and the origins were discussed. For this purpose, geological and hydrogeological properties were investigated. In situ measurements and chemical analyses were carried out on water samples taken from drinking water sources such as wells, springs and surface waters for hydrogeochemical studies. According to the obtained results, water resources are Ca-Mg-HCO3, Mg-HCO3 and Na-HCO3 type. Total As (AsT) concentration of the water samples sometimes exceeds the permissible limit given by the TSI-266 (Standards for drinking waters, Turkish Standards Institution, Ankara, 2005) and WHO (Guidelines for drinking-water quality, World Health Organization, Geneva, 2008) for drinking water. H3AsO30 and HAsO42- are dominant arsenic species in groundwater and surface water, respectively. Typically high total arsenic concentrations can be found in regions characterized by magmatic rocks. In addition, As concentrations in surface waters were found to be higher than in groundwater in the region, due to the anthropogenic influence of mining activities in the region.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				NOV	2017	76	21							750	10.1007/s12665-017-7101-z								WOS:000414335900028

This study developed an online analytical technique-high-performance liquid chromatography followed by photochemical reaction and chemiluminescence detection (HPLCPR-CL)-for determination of the concentration of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and three other N-nitrosamines. Its feasibility for near real-time analysis was evaluated by analyzing an ultrafiltration (UF)-treated wastewater before and after a pilotscale reverse osmosis (RO) treatment system. The online instrument with a method detection limit of 0.3-2.7 ng L-1 requires a direct injection (i.e., no sample pre-concentration) of only 20-200 mu L sample volume for the determination of N-nitrosamine concentrations every 20 min. NDMA concentrations in UF-treated wastewater were successfully monitored in a range of 50-200 ng L-1 over the course of 24 h. Likewise, NDMA concentrations in RO permeate ranged from 26-81 ng L-1 over the course of 48 h. The online monitor was capable of recording variations in N-nitrosamine concentration in RO permeate that occurred following changes in feedwater concentration and temperature. This study demonstrates the potential for online water quality assurance via direct measurement of trace levels of organic contaminants, which is highly relevant to the implementation of potable reuse.																	2053-1400	2053-1419				NOV 1	2017	3	6					1032	1036		10.1039/c7ew00296c								WOS:000413934800004

Peracetic acid disinfection kinetics for combined sewer overflows: indicator organisms, antibiotic resistance genes, and microbial community	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY												Combined sewer overflows (CSOs) degrade water quality and end-of-pipe treatment is one potential solution for retrofitting this outdated infrastructure. The goal of this research was to evaluate peracetic acid (PAA) as a disinfectant for CSOs using viability based molecular methods for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), indicator organism marker gene BacHum, and 16S rRNA genes. Simulated CSO effluent was prepared using 23-40% wastewater, representing the higher end of the range of wastewater concentrations reported in CSO effluent. PAA residual following disinfection was greatest for samples with the lowest initial COD. Treatment of simulated CSO effluent (23% wastewater) with 100 mg min L-1 PAA (5 mg L-1 PAA, 20 min) was needed to reduce viable cell sul1, tet(G), and BacHum (1.0 +/- 0.63-3.2 +/- 0.25- log) while 25 to 50 mg min L-1 PAA (5 mg L-1 PAA, 5-10 min) was needed to reduce viable cell loads (0.62 +/- 0.56-1.6 +/- 0.08log) in 40% wastewater from a different municipal treatment plant. Increasing contact time after the initial decrease in viable cell gene copies did not significantly improve treatment. A much greater applied Ct of 1200 mg min L-1 PAA (20 mg L-1 PAA, 60 min) was required for significant log reduction of 16S rRNA genes (3.29 +/- 0.13-log). No significant losses of mexB were observed during the study. Data were fitted to a Chick-Watson model and resulting inactivation constants for sul1 and tet(G) > BacHum > 16S rRNA. Amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene indicated the initial viable and total microbial communities were distinct and that treatment with PAA resulted in marked increases of the relative abundance of select phyla, particularly Clostridia which increased by 1-1.5 orders of magnitude. Results confirm that membrane disruption is a mechanism for PAA disinfection and further treatment is needed to reduce total ARGs in CSO effluent.																	2053-1400	2053-1419				NOV 1	2017	3	6					1061	1072		10.1039/c7ew00184c								WOS:000413934800008	29333272

Development and experimental validation of the composition and treatability of a new synthetic bathroom greywater (SynGrey)	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY												Bathroom greywater, including bathing and handwashing wastewater, can be reused for toilet flushing to reduce 35% of residential water demand. Despite these potential savings, greywater reuse is underutilized and the development of innovative treatment technologies is impeded by a lack of validated synthetic recipes to support laboratory-scale experimentation. The objective of this work was to develop and validate a new, representative synthetic bathroom greywater to enable reproducible and translatable treatment studies. A literature review compiled data from 49 real bathroom greywaters, which was used to set 20 water quality criteria for a synthetic recipe. A new synthetic greywater - SynGrey - was developed to match real bathroom greywater composition across all criteria and was found to be more representative of real greywater than existing recipes. SynGrey's validity was evaluated by comparing its treatability against a real bathroom greywater including via chlorination, aerobic biodegradation, adsorption, and coagulation. Total chlorine residuals were statistically similar between SynGrey and the real bathroom greywater, but doses were an order of magnitude higher than for drinking water. The readily biodegradable fraction of total chemical oxygen demand was about 40% for both greywaters. The dissolved organic carbon percent removal by activated carbon was similar between SynGrey and the real greywater (+/- 14%). Alum coagulation achieved comparable effluent turbidity, but SynGrey had a much more narrow dose curve, and coagulation achieved substantially greater total organic carbon removal from the real greywater. SynGrey represents a superior synthetic recipe for laboratory-scale experimentation to facilitate the evaluation, selection, and optimization of greywater reuse technologies.

J	Gailey, RM				Gailey, Robert M.			Inactive supply wells as conduits for flow and contaminant migration: conditions of occurrence and suggestions for management	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Water supply wells can act as conduits for vertical flow and contaminant migration between water-bearing strata under common hydrogeologic and well construction conditions. While recognized by some for decades, there is little published data on the magnitude of flows and extent of resulting water quality impacts. Consequently, the issue may not be acknowledged widely enough and the need for better management persists. This is especially true for unconsolidated alluvial groundwater basins that are hydrologically stressed by agricultural activities. Theoretical and practical considerations indicate that significant water volumes can migrate vertically through wells. The flow is often downward, with shallow groundwater, usually poorer in quality, migrating through conduit wells to degrade deeper water quality. Field data from locations in California, USA, are presented in combination with modeling results to illustrate both the prevalence of conditions conducive to intraborehole flow and the resulting impacts to water quality. Suggestions for management of planned wells include better enforcement of current regulations and more detailed consideration of hydrogeologic conditions during design and installation. A potentially greater management challenge is presented by the large number of existing wells. Monitoring for evidence of conduit flow and solute transport in areas of high well density is recommended to identify wells that pose greater risks to water quality. Conduit wells that are discovered may be addressed through approaches that include structural modification and changes in operations.																	1431-2174	1435-0157				NOV	2017	25	7					2163	2183		10.1007/s10040-017-1588-y								WOS:000413970900017

Measuring water quality from individual fractures in open wellbores using hydraulic isolation and the dissolved oxygen alteration method	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												This study describes a low-cost method for sampling individual fractures in open wellbores in crystalline bedrock utilizing naturally occurring flow conditions in the well. The method entails using the dissolved oxygen alteration method (DOAM) to identify transmissive fractures and vertical flow direction. After obtaining information about relative hydraulic gradients, flow direction in the well is modified using a single control pump to isolate fractures of interest for sampling. Additional dissolved oxygen, injected during the DOAM procedure, serves as a tracer to ensure the water quality in the sampling zone is characteristic of the fracture of interest by requiring a tracer-free zone prior to sampling. Sampling procedures are described conceptually for nine bedrock wells with varying flow conditions containing one, two, or three transmissive inflowing fractures. The method was demonstrated in two crystalline bedrock wells containing one and two transmissive inflowing fractures.																	1431-2174	1435-0157				NOV	2017	25	7					2199	2206		10.1007/s10040-017-1657-2								WOS:000413970900019						
J	Qiu, ZJ; Li, JS; Zhao, WX				Qiu, Zhenjie; Li, Jiusheng; Zhao, Weixia			Effects of lateral depth and irrigation level on nitrate and Escherichia coli leaching in the North China Plain for subsurface drip irrigation applying sewage effluent	IRRIGATION SCIENCE												Subsurface drip irrigation is a sound method to apply sewage effluent, but there is a risk of nitrate and pathogen leaching. Field experiments were conducted during the maize growing seasons of 2014 and 2015 in the North China Plain to investigate the effects of lateral depth, irrigation level, and water quality on the deep percolation and the nitrate (NO3-N) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) leaching under semi-humid conditions. The experiments were designed with three lateral depths of 0 cm (D1), 15 cm (D2), and 30 cm (D3) beneath the soil surface along with three irrigation levels of 70% (I1), 100% (I2), and 130% (I3) of crop evapotranspiration requirements. Secondary sewage effluent and groundwater were used as irrigation water. The results indicated that the intensive rainfall caused most of the deep percolation and NO3-N leaching during the maize growing seasons. A high irrigation level usually produced more deep percolation and NO3-N leaching, but no significant difference was found among the treatments. In general, the cumulative NO3-N leaching beyond the root zone increased as lateral depth increased. In addition, the lateral depth obviously influenced the distribution of E. coli in soil, and subsurface drip irrigation usually induced E. coli contamination deeper in the soil. With relatively high nitrate and E. coli concentration, sewage effluent irrigation significantly increased the risk of NO3-N leaching beyond the root zone in the 2014 season, but imposed an insignificant influence on the presence of E. coli in soil. Furthermore, no E. coli was detected in the leachate following an irrigation event with sewage effluent or a rainfall event during the both maize growing seasons. A dripline depth of 15 cm with deficit irrigation can be conductive to reducing NO3 leaching as well as avoiding sewage effluent contact contamination during the maize growing season in the semi-humid region of the North China Plain.																	0342-7188	1432-1319				NOV	2017	35	6					469	482		10.1007/s00271-017-0553-9								WOS:000412922600001

Forestry best management practices for erosion control in haul road ditches near stream crossings	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Poorly designed and maintained forest road stream crossings can directly link erosion sources to streams. Forestry best management practices (BMPs) provide techniques that are useful for preventing sedimentation associated with ditch erosion. However, few studies have quantified ditch BMP sediment reductions. Thus, our primary objective was to evaluate erosion control effectiveness due to ditch BMPs and secondarily to quantify ditch BMP implementation costs. Sixty ditch segments near stream crossings were reconstructed, and five ditch BMP treatments were applied using a completely randomized design resulting in 11 to 13 replications per treatment. Ditch BMP treatments were (1) bare ditch (Bare), (2) grass seed with lime fertilizer (Seed), (3) grass seed with lime fertilizer and erosion control mat (Mat), (4) rock check dams (Dam), and (5) completely rocked (Rock). Silt fence sediment traps and sediment pins were measured over one year to determine treatment effectiveness. Trapped sediment deposits indicated that median erosion rates were greatest for Dam (6.14 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) [2.74 tn ac(-1) yr(-1)]), followed by Bare (4.92 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) [2.19 tn ac(-1) yr(-1)]), Rock (1.73 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) [0.77 tn ac(-1) yr(-1)]), Seed (1.04 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) [0.46 tn ac(-1) y(-1)]), and Mat (0.82 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) [0.37 tn ac(-1) yr(-1)]). Results suggested that Mat treatments had significantly lower erosion rates than Bare and Dam, while Rock and Seed provided intermediate levels. Costs of BMP treatments were least expensive for Seed (US$6.10 approach(-1)), followed by Mat (US$21.33 approach(-1)), Dam (US$71.43 approach(-1)), and Rock (US$141.08 approach(-1)). Results suggest that erosion began to accelerate disproportionately when bare soil levels were between 30% and 50%; therefore, minimum soil cover of 50% is recommended for ditches.

J	Bunting, SW; Kundu, N; Ahmed, N				Bunting, Stuart W.; Kundu, Nitai; Ahmed, Nesar			Evaluating the contribution of diversified shrimp-rice agroecosystems in Bangladesh and West Bengal, India to social-ecological resilience	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Shrimp-rice farming practices in the coastal areas of Bangladesh and West Bengal, India are reviewed. It is apparent that this integrated aquaculture-agriculture system is stilted to environmental and hydrological conditions found in specific areas. Production strategies devised by farmers demonstrate that the diversified culture of shrimp with rice is technically feasible. Shrimp-rice agroecosystems exhibit several synergistic effects between systems components that result in efficient resource use and enhanced production, whilst avoiding negative environmental impacts. Integrated cropping enhances agro-biodiversity and reduces dependence on external inputs (agrochemicals, feed and fertiliser). Diversified shrimp-rice culture produces a valuable export crop, stimulating economic development and staple cereal, fish and vegetable crops that enhance human nutrition and food security. The contribution that diversified shrimp-rice agroecosystems make to social-ecological resilience is evaluated using the DPSIR (Driving forces, Pressures, State, Impacts, Responses) framework. Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) associated with prevailing practices are reviewed using the SWOT framework. We conclude, that with appropriate safeguards, diversified shrimp-rice agroecosystems could contribute to climate change adaptation and enhance production from land affected by salinization. Policy-support and practical action is needed to support and promote diversified shrimp-farming agroecosystems as they can contribute to social-ecological resilience in vulnerable coastal communities.

However, the hydraulics condition within PSR, which is an essential prerequisite of the water quality studies, still remains unclear. Consequently, the objective of this study is to analyze the hydraulic conditions within PSR by means of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach.

J	Mangadze, T; Wasserman, RJ; Dalu, T				Mangadze, Tinotenda; Wasserman, Ryan J.; Dalu, Tatenda			Use of Diatom Communities as Indicators of Conductivity and Ionic Composition in a Small Austral Temperate River System	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												The aim of this study was to determine if benthic diatoms can be used as effective and reliable indicators of ionic composition and conductivity in different stream order categories. Samples were collected on two occasions from 22 sampling sites within the Bloukrans River system, Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. The data collected were subjected to multivariate statistical technique, i. e. CCA, to determine environmental gradients along which the diatom species were distributed as well as to elucidate hypothesised differences in community structure per stream order. Significant differences between the two sampling periods were observed in dissolved oxygen, temperature, Na, B, Ca, Zn, Cu, Cr, K, Fe, phosphate, conductivity, salinity and nitrate, while significant stream order variation was observed for conductivity, salinity, Mg, Ca and sediment nitrates. Study sites were grouped into two broad categories (stream order 1 and 2/3 sites) based on CCA. As pollution increased, low to moderate pollution-tolerant species such as Fragilaria tenera, Cyclostephanos dubius and Gyrosigma acuminatum were replaced by high pollution-tolerant species such as Nitzschia palea, Gomphonema parvulum, Tryblionella apiculata, Diploneis vulgaris and Staurosira elliptica. This shows that diatom assemblages are appropriate indicators of ionic composition/conductivity and hydromorphological characteristics (e. g. stream size) of running waters. The results highlight the importance of creating regional calibration datasets which will make it possible to develop procedures to determine conductivity and ion concentration effects on biota.

J	Vithana, CL; Sullivan, LA; Shepherd, T				Vithana, Chamindra L.; Sullivan, Leigh A.; Shepherd, Troy			Effect of schwertmannite and jarosite on the formation of hypoxic blackwater during inundation of grass material	WATER RESEARCH												This study focused on understanding the effect of schwertmannite and jarosite, commonly found in floodplains containing acid sulfate soil materials, on the characteristics of the hypoxic blackwaters that can form when floodplain vegetation experiences prolonged inundation. The formation of these 'blackwaters' was simulated in the laboratory by inundating flood-intolerant pasture grass leaf material in both the presence of schwertmannite/jarosite (schwertmannite and jarosite treatments) minerals and their absence (control treatment) at 27.5 degrees C for 32 days. The presence of either schwertmannite or jarosite was able to decrease the concentrations of DOC, nutrients (e.g. NH3 and PO43-) and the biological oxygen demand (BOD) in the incubating water compared to the control treatment. Being fresh and labile, the pasture grass material liberated DOC immediately following inundation with a concomitant decrease in dissolved O-2 thereby resulting in anoxic and reducing conditions in the incubating water. With the onset of anoxic and reducing conditions, the biogeochemical cycling of DOC in schwertmannite and jarosite treatments might have proceeded via microbially mediated iron(III) and sulfate reduction and electron shuttling processes. Under anoxic, slightly acidic conditions, microbially mediated iron(III) reduction and subsequent dissolution of schwertmannite and jarosite were triggered by liberating Fe2+, SO42- and alkalinity to the incubating water. The resultant increase in pH led to SO42- reduction in schwertmannite, and the Fe2+ catalysed transformation of both schwertmannite and jarosite to goethite. Schwertmannite almost completely transformed to goethite within two weeks of incubation. Iron(III) in goethite (formed from schwertmannie transformation) was also reduced and likely proceeded via direct microbial reduction or via electron shuttling using the humic acids in the incubating water derived from pasture grass. These findings are highly useful in managing the coastal low lying acid sulfate soils landscapes which are subject to frequent flooding during wet seasons. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents a new turbidity forecasting methodology capable of aiding operational staff and enabling proactive management strategies. The turbidity forecasting methodology developed here is completely data-driven and does not require hydraulic or water quality network model that is expensive to build and maintain. The methodology is tested and verified on a real trunk main network with observed turbidity measurement data. Results obtained show that the methodology can detect if discolouration material is mobilised, estimate if sufficient turbidity will be generated to exceed a preselected threshold and approximate how long the material will take to reach the downstream meter. Classification based forecasts of turbidity can be reliably made up to 5 h ahead although at the expense of increased false alarm rates. The methodology presented here could be used as an early warning system that can enable a multitude of cost beneficial proactive management strategies to be implemented as an alternative to expensive trunk mains cleaning programs.

Linking terrestrial phosphorus inputs to riverine export across the United States	WATER RESEARCH												Humans have greatly accelerated phosphorus (P) flows from land to aquatic ecosystems, causing eutrophication, harmful algal blooms, and hypoxia. A variety of statistical and mechanistic models have been used to explore the relationship between P management on land and P losses to waterways, but our ability to predict P losses from watersheds often relies on small scale catchment studies, where detailed measurements can be made, or global scale models that that are often too coarse-scaled to be used directly in the management decision-making process. Here we constructed spatially explicit datasets of terrestrial P inputs and outputs across the conterminous U.S. (CONUS) for 2012. We use this dataset to improve understanding of P sources and balances at the national scale and to investigate whether well standardized input data at the continental scale can be used to improve predictions of hydrologic P export from watersheds across the U.S. We estimate that in 2012 agricultural lands received 0.19 Tg more P as fertilizer and confined manure than was harvested in major crops. Approximately 0.06 Tg P was lost to waterways as sewage and detergent nationally based on per capita loads in 2012. We compared two approaches for calculating non-agricultural P waste export to waterways, and found that estimates based on per capita P loads from sewage and detergent were 50% greater than Discharge Monitoring Report Pollutant Loading Tool. This suggests that the tool is likely underestimating P export in waste the CONUS scale. TP and DIP concentrations and TP yields were generally correlated more strongly with runoff than with P inputs or P balances, but even the relationships between runoff and P export were weak. Including P inputs as independent variables increased the predictive capacity of the best-fit models by at least 20%, but together inputs and runoff explained 40% of the variance in P concentration and 46-54% of the variance in P yield.

Sirajul			The public health significance of latrines discharging to groundwater used for drinking	WATER RESEARCH												Faecal contamination of groundwater from pit latrines is widely perceived as a major threat to the safety of drinking water for several billion people in rural and peri-urban areas worldwide. On the floodplains of the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta in Bangladesh, we constructed latrines and monitored piezometer nests monthly for two years. We detected faecal coliforms (FC) in 3.3-233% of samples at four sites. We differentiate a near-field, characterised by high concentrations and frequent, persistent and contiguous contamination in all directions, and a far-field characterised by rare, impersistent, discontinuous low-level detections in variable directions. Far-field FC concentrations at four sites exceeded 0 and 10 cfu/100 ml in 2.4-9.6% and 0.2-2.3% of sampling events respectively. The lesser contamination of in-situ groundwater compared to water at the point-of-collection from domestic wells, which itself is less contaminated than at the point-of-consumption, demonstrates the importance of recontamination in the well-pump system. We present a conceptual model comprising four sub-pathways: the latrine aquifer interface (near-field); groundwater flowing from latrine to well (far-field); the well-pump system; and post-collection handling and storage. Applying a hypothetical dose-response model suggests that 1-2% of the diarrhoeal disease burden from drinking water is derived from the aquifer, 29% from the well-pump system, and 70% from post-collection handling. The important implications are (i) that leakage from pit latrines is a minor contributor to faecal contamination of drinking water in alluvial deltaic terrains; (ii) fears of increased groundwater pollution should not constrain expanding latrine coverage, and (iii) that more attention should be given to reducing contamination around the well-head.

While beneficial, coagulation or ozonation alone is unable to both efficiently control membrane fouling and product water quality in many cases. Thus, in this study an emerging alternative of ferrous iron/peroxymonosulfate (Fe(II)/PMS), which can act as both an oxidant and a coagulant was employed prior to UF for treatment of natural surface water, and compared with conventional coagulation and ozonation. The results showed that the Fe(II)/PMS-UF system exhibited the best performance for dissolved organic carbon removal, likely due to the dual functions of coagulation and oxidation in the single process. The fluorescent and UV-absorbing organic components were more susceptible to ozonation than Fe(II)/PMS treatment. Fe(II)/PMS and ozonation pretreatments significantly increased the removal efficiency of atrazine, p-chloronitrobenzene and sulfamethazine by 12-76% and 50-94%, respectively, whereas coagulation exerted a minor influence. The Fe(II)/PMS pretreatment also showed the best performance for the reduction of both reversible and irreversible membrane fouling, and the performance was hardly affected by membrane pore size and surface hydrophobicity. In addition, the characterization of hydraulic irreversible organic foulants confirmed its effectiveness. These results demonstrate the potential advantages of applying Fe(II)/PMS as a pretreatment for UF to simultaneously control membrane fouling and improve the permeate quality. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Another common phenomenon at the terminus of pipelines is leakage, which is considered helpful by allowing seepage of low-quality drinking water resulting from long-term stagnation. In this study, the effect of laminar flow on alleviating water quality deterioration under different leakage conditions was investigated, and the potential thresholds of the flow rate, which can affect the iron release process, were discussed. Based on a galvanized pipe and ductile cast iron pipe pilot platform, which was established at the terminus of pipelines, this research was carried out by setting a series of leakage rate gradients to analyze the influence of different leakage flow rates on iron release, as well as the relationship with chemical and biological parameters. The results showed that the water quality parameters were obviously influenced by the change in flow velocity. Water quality was gradually improved with an increase in flow velocity, but its change regularity reflected a diversity under different flow rates (p < 0.05). The iron release was remarkably correlated to the redox potential, dissolved oxygen, pH, iron-oxidized bacteria and sulfate-reducing bacteria. The cumulative total iron release (r = 0.587, p < 0.05) and total iron release rate (r = 0.71, p < 0.022) were significantly influenced by the changes in flow velocity. In short, they tended first to increase and then to decrease with an increasing flow velocity with the threshold as approximately 40% of the critical laminar flow velocity (1.16 x 10(-3) m/s). For the pipes at the terminus of the drinking water distribution system, when the bulk water was at the critical laminar flow velocity, the concentration of total iron, the quantity and rate of total iron release remain relatively in an ideal and safe situation.

However, the accumulation and distribution of harbored elements and microbes in the different niches (loose deposits, PVC-U biofilm, and HDPE biofilm) and their corresponding potential contribution to water quality deterioration remain unknown. This precludes an in-depth understanding of water quality deterioration and the development of proactive management strategies. The present study quantitatively evaluated the distribution of elements, ATP, Aeromonas spp., and bacterial communities in distribution pipes (PVC-U, D = 110 mm, loose deposit and biofilm niches) and household connection pipes (HDPE, D = 32 mm, HDPE biofilm niches) at ten locations in an unchlorinated distribution system. The results show that loose deposits in PVC-U pipes, acting as sinks, constitute a hotspot (highest total amount per meter pipe) for elements, ATP, and target bacteria groups (e.g., Aeromonas spp., Mycobacterium spp., and Legionella spp.). When drinking water distribution system niches with harbored elements and microbes become sources in the event of disturbances, the highest quality deterioration potential (QDP) is that of HDPE biofilm; this can be attributed to its high surface-to-volume ratio. 16s rRNA analysis demonstrates that, at the genus level, the bacterial communities in the water, loose deposits, PVC-U biofilm, and HDPE biofilm were dominated, respectively, by Polaromorws spp. (2-23%), Nitrosipra spp. (1-47%), Flavobacterium spp. (1-36%), and Flavobacterium spp. (5-67%). The combined results of elemental composition and bacterial community analyses indicate that different dominant bio-chemical processes might occur within the different niches for example, iron arsenic oxidizing in loose deposits, bio-calumniation in PVC-U biofilm, and methane oxidizing in HDPE biofilm. The release of 20% loose deposits, 20% PVC-U biofilm and 10% HDPE biofilm will cause significant changes of water bacterial community. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Benthic cyanobacteria: A source of cylindrospermopsin and microcystin in Australian drinking water reservoirs	WATER RESEARCH												Cyanobacteria represent a health hazard worldwide due to their production of a range of highly potent toxins in diverse aquatic environments. While planktonic species have been the subject of many investigations in terms of risk assessment, little is known about benthic forms and their impact on water quality or human and animal health. This study aimed to purify isolates from environmental benthic biofilms sampled from three different drinking water reservoirs and to assess their toxin production by using the following methods: Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and quantitative PCR (qPCR). Microscopic observation of the isolates allowed the identification of various filamentous cyanobacterial genera: Anabaena (benthic form), Calothrix and Nostoc from the Nostocales and Geitlerinema, Leptolyngbya, Limnothrix, Lyngbya, Oxynema, Phormidium and Pseudanabaena representing non-heterocystous filamentous cyanobacteria. The Phormidium ambiguum strain AWQC-PHO021 was found to produce 739 ng/mg of dry weight (d/w) of cylindrospermopsin and 107 ng/mg (d/w) of deoxycylindrospermopsin. The Nostoc linckia strain AWQC-NOS001 produced 400 ng/mg (d/w) of a microcystin analogue. This is the first report of hepatotoxin production by benthic cyanobacteria in temperate Australian drinking water reservoirs. These findings indicate that water quality monitoring programs need to consider benthic cyanobacteria as a potential source of toxins. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The implications of drought and water conservation on the reuse of municipal wastewater: Recognizing impacts and identifying mitigation possibilities	WATER RESEARCH												As water agencies continue to investigate opportunities to increase resilience and local water supply reliability in the face of drought and rising water scarcity, water conservation strategies and the reuse of treated municipal wastewater are garnering significant attention and adoption. Yet a simple water balance thought experiment illustrates that drought, and the conservation strategies that are often enacted in response to it, both likely limit the role reuse may play in improving local water supply reliability. For instance, as a particular drought progresses and agencies enact water conservation measures to cope with drought, Influent flows likely decrease while influent pollution concentrations increase, particularly salinity, which adversely affects wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) costs and effluent quality and flow. Consequently, downstream uses of this effluent, whether to maintain streamflow and quality, groundwater recharge, or irrigation may be impacted. This is unfortunate since reuse is often heralded as a drought-proof mechanism to increase resilience. The objectives of this paper are two-fold. First, we illustrate using a case study from Southern California during its most recent drought how drought and water conservation strategies combine to reduce influent flow and quality and, subsequently, effluent flow and quality. Second, we use a recently developed regional water reuse decision support model (RWRM) to highlight cost-effective strategies that can be implemented to mitigate the impacts of drought on effluent water quality. While the solutions we identify cannot increase the flow of influent or effluent coming into or out of a treatment plant, they can improve the value of the remaining effluent in a cost-effective manner that takes into account the characteristics of its demand, whether it be for landscaping, golf courses, agricultural irrigation, or surface water augmentation.

Multiparametric monitoring of microbial faecal pollution reveals the dominance of human contamination along the whole Danube River	WATER RESEARCH												The microbial faecal pollution of rivers has wide-ranging impacts on a variety of human activities that rely on appropriate river water quality. Thus, detailed knowledge of the extent and origin of microbial faecal pollution is crucial for watershed management activities to maintain safe water use. In this study, the microbial faecal pollution levels were monitored by standard faecal indicator bacteria (SFIB) along a 2580 km stretch of the Danube, the world's most international river, as well as the Danube's most important tributaries. To track the origin of faecal pollution, host-associated Bacteroidetes genetic faecal marker qPCR assays for different host groups were applied in concert with. SFIB. The. spatial resolution analysis was followed by a time resolution analysis of faecal pollution patterns over 1 year at three selected sites. In this way, a comprehensive faecal pollution map of the total length of the Danube was created, combining substantiated information on both the extent and origin of microbial faecal pollution. Within the environmental data matrix for the river, microbial faecal pollution constituted an independent component and did not cluster with any other measured environmental parameters. Generally, midstream samples representatively depicted the microbial pollution levels at the respective river sites. However, at a few, somewhat unexpected sites, high pollution levels occurred in the lateral zones of the river while the midstream zone had good water quality. Human faecal pollution was demonstrated as the primary pollution source along the whole river, while animal faecal pollution was of minor importance. This study demonstrates that the application of host-associated genetic microbial source tracking markers in concert with the traditional concept of microbial faecal pollution monitoring based on SFIB significantly enhances the knowledge of the extent and origin of microbial faecal pollution patterns in large rivers. It constitutes a powerful tool to guide target-oriented water quality management in large river basins. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Pesticide fate on catchment scale: conceptual modelling of stream CSIA data	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Compound-specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) has proven beneficial in the characterization of contaminant degradation in groundwater, but it has never been used to assess pesticide transformation on catchment scale. This study presents concentration and carbon CSIA data of the herbicides S-metolachlor and acetochlor from three locations (plot, drain, and catchment outlets) in a 47 ha agricultural catchment (Bas-Rhin, France). Herbicide concentrations at the catchment outlet were highest (62 mu gL(-1)) in response to an intense rainfall event following herbicide application. Increasing delta C-13 values of S-metolachlor and acetochlor by more than 2% during the study period indicated herbicide degradation. To assist the interpretation of these data, discharge, concentrations, and delta C-13 values of S-metolachlor were modelled with a conceptual mathematical model using the transport formulation by travel-time distributions. Testing of different model setups supported the assumption that degradation half-lives (DT50) increase with increasing soil depth, which can be straightforwardly implemented in conceptual models using travel-time distributions. Moreover, model calibration yielded an estimate of a field-integrated isotopic enrichment factor as opposed to laboratory-based assessments of enrichment factors in closed systems. Thirdly, the Rayleigh equation commonly applied in groundwater studies was tested by our model for its potential to quantify degradation on catchment scale. It provided conservative estimates on the extent of degradation as occurred in stream samples. However, largely exceeding the simulated degradation within the entire catchment, these estimates were not representative of overall degradation on catchment scale. The conceptual modelling approach thus enabled us to upscale sample-based CSIA information on degradation to the catchment scale. Overall, this study demonstrates the benefit of combining monitoring and conceptual modelling of concentration and CSIA data and advocates the use of traveltime distributions for assessing pesticide fate and transport on catchment scale.					van der Velde, Ype/0000-0002-2183-2573; Lutz, Stefanie/0000-0001-9583-7337												1027-5606	1607-7938				OCT 18	2017	21	10					5243	5261		10.5194/hess-21-5243-2017								WOS:000413201600001

In the ZHZ, NaP1 zeolite was covered with hydrous zirconia, which existed as an amorphous phase. Experimental results in pond water indicated that ZHZ could efficiently remove soluble reactive phosphorus. The 28-day sediment incubation experiments showed that capping sediment with ZHZ resulted in a more efficient, rapid and sustained decrease in P concentration when compared with the traditional alum treatment method. Furthermore, ZHZ increased the sediment stability, resulting in. the lowest turbidity, total phosphorus and soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations in overlying water following artificially induced resuspension of sediment. Phosphorus fractionation of sediment showed that the dominant P form transferred from HCl-extractable P to residual P, and the most release-sensitive P (labile P and reductant reactive P) was decreased after ZHZ application. Overall, ZHZ is a highly effective P-immobilization material. ZHZ has high potential as a sediment capping material to control internal P loading in eutrophic water bodies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Chappell, NA; Jones, TD; Tych, W				Chappell, Nick A.; Jones, Timothy D.; Tych, Wlodek			Sampling frequency for water quality variables in streams: Systems analysis to quantify minimum monitoring rates	WATER RESEARCH												Insufficient temporal monitoring of water quality in streams or engineered drains alters the apparent shape of storm chemographs, resulting in shifted model parameterisations and changed interpretations of solute sources that have produced episodes of poor water quality. This so-called 'aliasing' phenomenon is poorly recognised in water research. Using advances in in-situ sensor technology it is now possible to monitor sufficiently frequently to avoid the onset of aliasing. A systems modelling procedure is presented allowing objective identification of sampling rates needed to avoid aliasing within strongly rainfall-driven chemical dynamics. In this study aliasing of storm chemograph shapes was quantified by changes in the time constant parameter (TC) of transfer functions. As a proportion of the original TC, the onset of aliasing varied between watersheds, ranging from 3.9-7.7 to 54-79 %TC (or 110-160 to 300 -600 min). However, a minimum monitoring rate could be identified for all datasets if the modelling results were presented in the form of a new statistic, Delta TC. For the eight H+, DOC and NO3-N datasets examined from a range of watershed settings, an empirically-derived threshold of 1.3(Delta TC) could be used to quantify minimum monitoring rates within sampling protocols to avoid artefacts in subsequent data analysis.

Design of waste stabilization pond systems: A review	WATER RESEARCH												A better design instruction for waste stabilization ponds is needed due to their growing application for wastewater purification, increasingly strict environmental regulations, and the fact that most of previous design manuals are outdated. To critically review model-based designs of typical pond treatment systems, this paper analyzed more than 150 articles, books, and reports from 1956 to 2016. The models developed in these publications ranged from simple rules and equations to more complex first-order and mechanistic models. From a case study on all four approaches, it appeared that rules of thumb is no longer a proper tool for pond designs due to its low design specification and very high output variability and uncertainty. On the other hand, at the beginning phase of design process or in case of low pressure over land and moderate water quality required, regression equations can be useful to form an idea for pond dimensions. More importantly, mechanistic models proved their capacity of generating more precise and comprehensive designs but still need to overcome their lack of calibration and validation, and overparameterization. In another case study, an essential but often overlooked role of uncertainty analysis in pond designs was investigated via a comparison between deterministic and uncertainty based approaches. Unlike applying a safety factor representing all uncertainty sources, probabilistic designs quantify the uncertainty of model outputs by including prior uncertainty of inputs and parameters, which generates more scientifically reliable outcomes for decision makers. Based on these findings, we advise engineers and designers to shift from the conventional approaches to more innovative and economic tools which are suitable for dealing with large variations of natural biological systems.

Effective removal of phosphate from aqueous solution using humic acid coated magnetite nanoparticles	WATER RESEARCH												Effective removal of excess phosphate from water is critical to counteract eutrophication and restore water quality. In this study, low cost, environmentally friendly humic acid coated magnetite nano particles (HA-MNP) were synthesized and applied for the remediation of phosphate from aqueous media. The HA-MNPs, characterized by FTIR, TEM and HAADF-STEM showed the extensive coating of humic acid on the magnetite surface. The magnetic nanoparticles with diameters of 7-12 nm could be easily separated from the reaction mixture by using a simple hand held magnet. Adsorption studies demonstrate the fast and effective separation of phosphate with maximum adsorption capacity of 28.9 mg/g at pH 6.6. The adsorption behavior follows the Freundlich isotherm suggesting the formation of nonuniform multilayers of phosphate on the heterogeneous surface of HA-MNP. The adsorption kinetic fits the pseudo-second order model well with rate constants of 0.206 +/- 0.003, 0.073 +/- 0.002 and 0.061 +/- 0.003 g mg(-1) min(-1) for phosphate (P) concentrations of 2, 5 and 10 mg/L respectively. The removal of phosphate was found higher at acidic and neutral pH compared to basic conditions. The nanoparticles exhibit good selectivity and adsorption efficiency for phosphate in presence of co-existing ions such as Cl-, SO42- and NO3- with some inhibition effect by CO32-. The effect of temperature on the adsorption reveals that the process is endothermic and spontaneous. HA-MNPs are promising, simple, environmentally friendly materials for the removal of phosphate from aqueous media. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This study generated microcosms that mimicked riverbank sediment resuspension into the water of a typical Mediterranean river as a consequence of heavy rainfall. The mobilization and inactivation of six fecal pollution indicators and microbial source tracking markers were evaluated. The T-90 values in the sediments were: 4 days for sorbitol-fermenting Bifidobacterium, 11 days for culturable E. coli, 36 days for bacteriophages infecting Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron strain GA17 and more than 42 days for qPCR-detected E. coli, somatic coliphages and sulfite-reducing clostridia spores. Bacteriophages and bacteria showed different resuspension and sedimentation patterns. The data obtained could be used in predictive models to assess the effects of climate change on surface water quality. Pathogen mobilization into the water column poses a risk for humans, animals and the natural environment, and breaches the One Health approach. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Development of a bioanalytical test battery for water quality monitoring: Fingerprinting identified micropollutants and their Contribution to effects in surface water	WATER RESEARCH												Surface waters can contain a diverse range of organic pollutants, including pesticides, pharmaceuticals and industrial compounds. While bioassays have been used for water quality monitoring, there is limited knowledge regarding the effects of individual micropollutants and their relationship to the overall mixture effect in water samples. In this study, a battery of in vitro bioassays based on human and fish cell lines and whole organism assays using bacteria, algae, daphnids and fish embryos was assembled for use in water quality monitoring. The selection of bioassays was guided by the principles of adverse outcome pathways in order to cover relevant steps in toxicity pathways known to be triggered by environmental water samples. The effects of 34 water pollutants, which were selected based on hazard quotients, available environmental quality standards and mode of action information, were fingerprinted in the bioassay test battery. There was a relatively good agreement between the experimental results and available literature effect data. The majority of the chemicals were active in the assays indicative of apical effects, while fewer chemicals had a response in the specific reporter gene assays, but these effects were typically triggered at lower concentrations. The single chemical effect data were used to improve published mixture toxicity modeling of water samples from the Danube River. While there was a slight increase in the fraction of the bioanalytical equivalents explained for the Danube River samples, for some endpoints less than 1% of the observed effect could be explained by the studied chemicals. The new mixture models essentially confirmed previous findings from many studies monitoring water quality using both chemical analysis and bioanalytical tools. In short, our results indicate that many more chemicals contribute to the biological effect than those that are typically quantified by chemical monitoring programs or those regulated by environmental quality standards. This study not only demonstrates the utility of fingerprinting single chemicals for an improved understanding of the biological effect of pollutants, but also highlights the need to apply bioassays for water quality monitoring in order to prevent underestimation of the overall biological effect.

An experimental study on the influence of water stagnation and temperature change on water quality in a full-scale domestic drinking water system	WATER RESEARCH												The drinking water quality changes during the transport through distribution systems. Domestic drinking water systems (DDWSs), which include the plumbing between the water meter and consumer's taps, are the most critical points in which water quality may be affected. In distribution networks, the drinking water temperature and water residence time are regarded as indicators of the drinking water quality. This paper describes an experimental research on the influence of stagnation time and temperature change on drinking water quality in a full-scale DDWS. Two sets of stagnation experiments, during winter and summer months, with various stagnation intervals (up to 168 h of stagnation) were carried out. Water and biofilms were sampled at two different taps, a kitchen and a shower tap. Results from this study indicate that temperature and water stagnation affect both chemical and microbial quality in DDWSs, whereas microbial parameters in stagnant water appear to be driven by the temperature of fresh water. Biofilm formed in the shower pipe contained more total and intact cells than the kitchen pipe biofilm. Alphaproteobacteria were found to dominate in the shower biofilm (78% of all Proteobacteria), while in the kitchen tap biofilm Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria were evenly distributed.

Modelling the transport and decay processes of microbial tracers in a macro-tidal estuary	WATER RESEARCH												The Loughor Estuary is a macro-tidal coastal basin, located along the Bristol Channel, in the South West of the U.K. The maximum spring tidal range in the estuary is up to 7.5 m, near Burry Port Harbour. This estuarine region can experience severe coastal flooding during high spring tides, including extreme flooding of the intertidal saltmarshes at Llanrhidian, as well as the lower industrial and residential areas at Llanelli and Gowerton. The water quality of this estuarine basin needs to comply with the designated standards for safe recreational bathing and shellfish harvesting industries. The waterbody however, potentially receives overloading of bacterial inputs that enter the estuarine system from both point and diffuse sources. Therefore, a microbial tracer study was carried out to get a better understanding of the faecal bacteria sources and to enable a hydro-environmental model to be refined and calibrated for both advection and dispersion transport. A two-dimensional hydro-environmental model has been refined and extended to predict the highest water level covering the intertidal floodplains of the Loughor Estuary. The validated hydrodynamic model for both water levels and currents, was included with the injected mass of microbial tracer, i.e. MS2 coliphage from upstream of the estuary, and modelled as a non-conservative tracer over several tidal cycles through the system. The calibration and validation of the transport and decay of microbial tracer was undertaken, by comparing the model results and the measured data at two different sampling locations. The refined model developed as a part of this study, was used to acquire a better understanding of the water quality processes and the potential sources of bacterial pollution in the estuary.

Health risks from exposure to untreated wastewater used for irrigation in the Mezquital Valley, Mexico: A 25-year update	WATER RESEARCH												Wastewater reuse for agriculture is common worldwide; wastewater treatment, however, is rare in many countries, leading to high potential for exposure to harmful pathogens. Mexico City, one of the largest producers of untreated wastewater for agricultural use worldwide, was the site of key epidemiologic studies conducted in the 1990s. We both reviewed the literature on and conducted a cross-sectional study of diarrheal risk and wastewater contamination to provide an updated assessment of health risks and to inform an upcoming update of the 2006 WHO guidelines on wastewater reuse. We surveyed communities in the Mezquital Valley that use wastewater for irrigation and communities that use well water to compare the prevalence of self-reported diarrheal disease in children under five years old. Wastewater, well water, household environmental samples, and stool samples were collected and analyzed. Communities exposed to wastewater had a higher one-week prevalence of diarrhea (10%) compared to unexposed communities (5%). This association remained in an adjusted modified Poisson regression model (PR = 2.31, 95% CI 1.00, 531), but not when limited to households engaged in agriculture. Water quality indicators document differences between irrigation water from the two community groups. These results are in agreement with 25 population studies identified by our review that were conducted since or not included in the 2006 WHO guidelines and show consistent negative impacts of wastewater exposure on health. While overall diarrheal prevalence has declined when compared to studies conducted over 25 years ago in the same region, the association of diarrheal disease and wastewater exposure has remained and possibly increased. With rising urbanization worldwide, attention to these risks and wastewater treatment is becoming increasingly important. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, quantifying LGD and its spatial patterns is challenging because of the large spatial extent of the aquiferlake interface and pronounced spatial variability. This is the first experimental study to specifically study these larger-scale patterns with sufficient spatial resolution to systematically investigate how landscape and local characteristics affect the spatial variability in LGD. We measured vertical temperature profiles around a 0.49 km(2) lake in northeastern Germany with a needle thermistor, which has the advantage of allowing for rapid (manual) measurements and thus, when used in a survey, high spatial coverage and resolution. Groundwater inflow rates were then estimated using the heat transport equation. These near-shore temperature profiles were complemented with sediment temperature measurements with a fibre-optic cable along six transects from shoreline to shoreline and radon measurements of lake water samples to qualitatively identify LGD patterns in the offshore part of the lake. As the hydrogeology of the catchment is sufficiently homogeneous (sandy sediments of a glacial outwash plain; no bedrock control) to avoid patterns being dominated by geological discontinuities, we were able to test the common assumptions that spatial patterns of LGD are mainly controlled by sediment characteristics and the groundwater flow field. We also tested the assumption that topographic gradients can be used as a proxy for gradients of the groundwater flow field. Thanks to the extensive data set, these tests could be carried out in a nested design, considering both small-and large-scale variability in LGD. We found that LGD was concentrated in the near-shore area, but along-shore variability was high, with specific regions of higher rates and higher spatial variability. Median inflow rates were 44 Lm(-2) d(-1) with maximum rates in certain locations going up to 169 Lm(-2) d(-1). Offshore LGD was negligible except for two local hotspots on steep steps in the lake bed topography. Large-scale groundwater inflow patterns were correlated with topography and the groundwater flow field, whereas small-scale patterns correlated with grain size distributions of the lake sediment. These findings confirm results and assumptions of theoretical and modelling studies more systematically than was previously possible with coarser sampling designs. However, we also found that a significant fraction of the variance in LGD could not be explained by these controls alone and that additional processes need to be considered. While regression models using these controls as explanatory variables had limited power to predict LGD rates, the results nevertheless encourage the use of topographic indices and sediment heterogeneity as an aid for targeted campaigns in future studies of groundwater discharge to lakes.

The influences of feed pH (3.0-10.0), feed total dissolved solids (TDS) (1182-5319 mg L-1) and feed dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (0.54-2.43 mg L-1) on the separating efficiencies of two different NF membranes (Thin-Film Composite (DL) and Polyamide (DK)) were investigated. In addition, long-term operation for 580 h was also conducted by the superior NF membrane to evaluate the performance stability and fouling potential after a number of subsequent cleaning cycles. Within the scope of the test, NF separating performance in terms of salt rejection showed different changing tendencies: V-shaped curve for pH, inverted V-shaped curve for TDS and linear curve for DOC. While in general, specific permeate flux was reduced in different degrees except for DK membrane with feed pH variation. The observed separating performance decline with operating time was mainly due to the scale formation on the NF membrane surface, which was rinsed effectively (FR1 = 97.80% and RR1 = 61.63%; FR2 = 95.40% and RR2 = 49.35%) by chemical cleaning, as certified by FESEM - EDX and AFM images.																	2214-7144					OCT	2017	19						147	155		10.1016/j.jwpe.2017.07.021								WOS:000431411100020

Study focus: The present study investigated the ability of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique in pointing the environmental effects of discharges from different activities. Major indicator parameters were extracted for water quality analysis of the Shahr Chai River located in Lake Urmia basin, Iran. The water quality parameters were measured monthly in six stream reaches and were affected by discharges from intensive recreational centers and rural and agricultural activities. New hydrological insights: The results showed that the NSFWQI and the WQI(min-p) could not distinguish between highly impacted stream reaches, while the calculated WQImin-c with two parameters including turbidity and fecal coliforms could meaningfully classify the sampling stations. These two parameters were selected based on results from correlation matrix. This study showed that calculation of the WQI(min-c) was an effective and easily applicable assessment method for different effluents' impacts on stream water quality. The PCA technique could justifiably show different landscape effects on river water quality whereby the river downstream was found to experience decreased water quality.																	2214-5818					OCT	2017	13						1	10		10.1016/j.ejrh.2017.07.002								WOS:000426117200001

Geospatial tools effectively estimate nonexceedance probabilities of daily streamflow at ungauged and intermittently gauged locations in Ohio	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: The state of Ohio in the United States, a humid, continental climate. Study focus: The estimation of nonexceedance probabilities of daily streamflows as an alternative means of establishing the relative magnitudes of streamflows associated with hydrologic and water-quality observations. New hydrological insights for the region: Several methods for estimating nonexceedance probabilities of daily mean streamflows are explored, including single-index methodologies (nearest-neighboring index) and geospatial tools (kriging and topological kriging). These methods were evaluated by conducting leave-one-out cross-validations based on analyses of nearly 7 years of daily streamflow data from 79 unregulated streamgages in Ohio and neighboring states. The pooled, ordinary kriging model, with a median Nash-Sutcliffe performance of 0.87, was superior to the single-site index methods, though there was some bias in the tails of the probability distribution. Incorporating network structure through topological kriging did not improve performance. The pooled, ordinary kriging model was applied to 118 locations without systematic streamgaging across Ohio where instantaneous streamflow measurements had been made concurrent with water-quality sampling on at least 3 separate days. Spearman rank correlations between estimated nonexceedance probabilities and measured streamflows were high, with a median value of 0.76. In consideration of application, the degree of regulation in a set of sample sites helped to specify the streamgages required to implement kriging approaches successfully.

Using a replicated BACIPS (Before-After-Control Impact Paired Series) design, we investigated 24 peatlands, all drained for forestry and subsequently restored, and 19 pristine control boreal peatlands with high temporal and spatial resolution data on hydro climate and pore water quality. In drained conditions, total nitrogen (N-tot), total phosphorus(P-tot), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in pore water were several-fold higher than observed at pristine control sites, highlighting the impacts of long-term drainage on pore water quality. In general, pore water DOC and Ntot decreased after restoration measures but still remained significantly higher than at pristine control sites, indicating long time lags in restoration effects. Different peatland classes and trophic levels (vegetation gradient) responded differently to restoration, primarily due to altered hydrology and varying acidity levels. Sites that were hydrologically overrestored (inundated) showed higher P-tot, N-tot, and DOC than well restored or insufficiently restored sites, indicating the need to optimize natural-like hydrological regimes when restoring peatlands drained for forestry. Rich fens (median pH 6.2-6.6) showed lower pore water P-tot, Ntot, and DOC than intermediate and poor peats (pH 4.0-4.6) both before and after restoration. Nutrients and DOC in pore water increased in the first year postrestoration but decreased thereafter. The most important variables related to pore water quality were trophic level, peatland class, water table level, and soil and air temperature.

Flow and Residence Times of Dynamic River Bank Storage and Sinuosity-Driven Hyporheic Exchange	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Hydrologic exchange fluxes (HEFs) vary significantly along river corridors due to spatiotemporal changes in discharge and geomorphology. This variability results in the emergence of biogeochemical hot-spots and hot-moments that ultimately control solute and energy transport and ecosystem services from the local to the watershed scales. In this work, we use a reduced-order model to gain mechanistic understanding of river bank storage and sinuosity-driven hyporheic exchange induced by transient river discharge. This is the first time that a systematic analysis of both processes is presented and serves as an initial step to propose parsimonious, physics-based models for better predictions of water quality at the large watershed scale. The effects of channel sinuosity, alluvial valley slope, hydraulic conductivity, and river stage forcing intensity and duration are encapsulated in dimensionless variables that can be easily estimated or constrained. We find that the importance of perturbations in the hyporheic zone's flux, residence times, and geometry is mainly explained by two-dimensionless variables representing the ratio of the hydraulic time constant of the aquifer and the duration of the event (Gamma(d)) and the importance of the ambient groundwater flow (Delta h*). Our model additionally shows that even systems with small sensitivity, resulting in small changes in the hyporheic zone extent, are characterized by highly variable exchange fluxes and residence times. These findings highlight the importance of including dynamic changes in hyporheic zones for typical HEF models such as the transient storage model.

Influence of flow rate variations on chemistry change of pumped Disi water to Amman/Jordan: a laboratory simulation approach	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												In order to monitor the change in the Disi water chemistry that is pumped from the Disi aquifer to Amman city along the 345 km pipeline, the changes in chemistry and surface precipitation of scale were investigated using simulated plumbing system. The influence of flow rate variation was investigated since Disi water usually pumped using different flow rates along the pipeline. Disi water was pumped through 20.0 m steel pipes at different flow rates (5, 10, 15, 25, and 35 L/min) with circulation time of 5 h for each run. Water quality parameters, for example, temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, calcium, magnesium, carbon dioxide, total alkalinity, and total hardness, were determined every hour using standard methods of analysis. The results showed that pipes that transport Disi water suffers from calcium carbonate scale deposition as the water is pumped with different flow rates. It was found that the scale deposition increased by increasing the flow rate and the surface roughness of the metal.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				OCT	2017	92						80	89		10.5004/dwt.2017.21442								WOS:000418408700009						
J	Salima, D; Belgacem, H				Salima, Djoudi; Belgacem, Houha			The hydrochemical characterization of the upper plains aquifers: case of the plain of F'kirina Ain-Beida, Northeastern Algeria	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												Groundwater is one of the main sources of drinking water supply for the population and crops irrigation in the F'kirina area, which is located in the northeastern part of Algeria, characterized by a semi-arid climate. This work aims to evaluate the hydrochemical characteristics of an aquifer located between carbonated formations and salt lake (Garaat Ettarf). Hydrochemical, multivariate statistical, and thermodynamics techniques were used to investigate the hydrochemical evolution within the aquifer. A total of 45 groundwater samples were collected from this area during May 2015 and analyzed for various physical and chemical parameters. The results indicate that this water is classified as Ca-HCO3 water types in carbonate outcrops as Ca-SO4 and Cl-Ca type in the Plio-Quaternary filling in the direction of the Sebkha. The hydrochemical study shows that the electrical conductivity of the water ranges from 220 to 6,700 mu S/cm. Chemical tracing had focused on the major elements and some traces to the process responsible for water mineralization acquisition. The intersection of the major elements with the chloride ion showed that the salinity of the water is due to water-rock interaction, cation exchanges and anthropogenic pollution. The principal component analysis reveals three factors that express 61.8% of the total variance in water quality datasets. The first factor is salinization, which shows strong associations between SO42-, Cl-, CE, M, TH, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+ and Na+. The second factor represents the opposition of two poles, freshwater to polluted water, the first is constituted of bicarbonates HCO3- reflecting freshwater that opposes polluted water caused by nitrate. The third factor is determined in its positive part by temperature and in its negative part by pH. It should be noted that aquifers waters are oversaturated with respect to calcite, dolomite and aragonite, but they are rather undersaturated with respect to halite, gypsum and anhydrite.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				OCT	2017	92						90	97		10.5004/dwt.2017.21507								WOS:000418408700010

Practicing the sewer mining (SM) approach, the feed of the unit was directly drained from the sewage network. Monitoring of system's performance was performed through a series of lab analyses and online measurements. According to the results, it is concluded that both MBR and RO effluent present very high quality characteristics. The RO effluent's quality in terms of organic content (0.9 mg/L BOD5 and not detectable total suspended solids), ammonium nitrogen (0.25 mg/L), turbidity (0.32 NTU), Escherichia coli (not detectable) and total coliforms (not detectable) could fully meet the water quality requirements for reclaimed water, as dictated by the Greek legislation. Furthermore, the application of SM practice through the implementation of an on-site compact treatment system consisting of a pretreatment unit followed by an MBR and a UV disinfection unit can reliably meet all the national and international criteria set for all types of non-potable wastewater reuse at a rather moderate cost. The addition of an RO unit is fully justified in the case of saline wastewater and/or in cases where strict limit values for heavy metals and micropollutants in the reclaimed water have been set.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				OCT	2017	91						2	11		10.5004/dwt.2017.20804								WOS:000418406400002

Under proper management conditions, significant improvements of the water quality for irrigation can take place as a result of concurrent physical, chemical and biological processes. Here, a multi-seasonal, WSR-based procedure has been proposed and simulated in terms of operational parameters in order to reduce the effects, particularly critical during the irrigation period, of the introduction of fresh effluents on the quality of stored water. Furthermore, an appropriate use of high-rate algal ponds has been suggested as an alternative to the nutrient removal phase in the wastewater treatment plant.

Willow clones used in EWS may significantly affect the performance of EWS; therefore, the clones with high biomass production and resilience to permanent flooding, increased nutrient concentrations, and salinity must be selected. In the presented study, a 27 m(2) pilot EWS was set up in November 2015, enabling the testing of three different willow clones of Salix alba (L.): indigenous white willow 'V 160' (S. alba) and two of its hybrids: 'V 052' (S. alba var. calva x S. alba) and 'V 093' (S. alba x S. alba var. vitellina) x S. alba. The stem height, diameter, and number of shoots per stump were measured weekly in the first year of growth on site, along with the water quality parameters and water levels in the test beds. There were no statistically significant differences in stem height and stem diameter between the three tested clones at the end of the vegetation season; however, the indigenous clone indicated better adaptability to conditions in EWS but somewhat lower biomass production in comparison with the hybrids. For all clones, the willows growing in the EWS outgrew the control willows, showing the positive effects of high water availability and wastewater on willow growth. Investigations in the following vegetation season will further evaluate the water demand and the biomass yield, estimate the efficiency of nutrient transfer from wastewater to wood biomass, and define the differences for the selected clones.

The selection criteria for the examined materials were based on their high efficiency during batch experiments, along with their low toxicity to human health, directly related to the respective regulation limits. Among zero-valent metals tested, only Fe-0 can completely remove Cr(VI), while the leached concentration of Fe and Zn overpasses the corresponding drinking water regulation limits. Iron sulphides can minimize Cr(VI) at sub-ppb level, yet leached Fe(II) concentration is substantially higher than the drinking water regulation limit of 0.2 mg/L. Similarly, SnS can minimize Cr(VI) at sub-ppb level, although leached Sn concentration overpasses the aesthetic limit for drinking water quality. Iron oxy-hydroxide proved effective for Cr(VI) removal at sub-ppb level, preserving simultaneously the water quality. However, its relatively low adsorption capacity (0.1 mg Cr(VI)/g FeOOH) is a significant drawback for full-scale implementation. Among the examined adsorbents only magnetite presented sufficient uptake capacity (4 mg Cr(VI)/g Fe3O4) at the breakthrough concentration of the upcoming regulation limit of 10 mu g/L, without downgrading water quality, and thus qualified for drinking water treatment.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				OCT	2017	91						293	299		10.5004/dwt.2017.20739								WOS:000418406400039

In this study, three household water purifiers that based on different principles were investigated in order to determine whether and under which conditions they can safeguard the microbial safety of drinking water. The water purifiers consisted of the following treatment trains: (i) activated carbon (AC), ultrafiltration (UF) and reverse osmosis, AC and UV irradiation; (ii) AC and UF, and (iii) AC, passive chlorine dosage and AC. They were examined in a two-phase challenge test using bacteria (Escherichia coli) and bacteriophages (MS2) in a laboratory environment. Under normal operation conditions filtering tap water, mean microbial reductions of 4-6 log(10) and 0-3 log(10) for E. coli and MS2 phages, respectively, were observed that therefore partly comply with WHO requirements. Reduction of protozoa (Cryptosporidium oocysts) was estimated based on size exclusion or chlorine exposure to be >= 2 log(10) (membrane-based size exclusion) and < 2 log(10) (chlorine-based disinfection), respectively. To further determine their applicability for filtering water sources with higher pollution load, tap water with increased loads of organic and suspended matter simulating turbid river water (which is beyond the intended use of the systems) was studied. Only the multi-stage treatment was able to remove organics and turbidity to >= 89%. Both tested membrane-based systems suffered from rapid and severe irreversible fouling when challenged with high turbidity whereas the chlorine-based system maintained the production rate, however, at the expenses of a lower physicochemical quality. Hence, none of the tested systems was able to produce water of satisfying physicochemical and microbial quality at sufficient quantities from raw water with turbid river water quality. Therefore, it is suggested introducing mandatory standardized testing protocols and certification of household water purifiers specifying the usage conditions.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				OCT	2017	91						311	319		10.5004/dwt.2017.20802								WOS:000418406400042

This study assessed the discharge of indicator bacteria, total coliform, Escherichia coli, intestinal enterococci and Clostridium perfringens, by flow-proportional sampling from 12 full-scale on-site treatment systems featuring biological treatment units (mainly sand filters) and alkaline filter beds for phosphorus treatment (P-filters). Correlations of effluent bacterial concentrations with pH, total and dissolved organic carbon, filter age and hydraulic load were evaluated. The bacterial concentrations in the effluents of the sand filters were considerable. The concentrations for excellent bathing water quality set in the EU bathing water directive, 200 and 500 colony forming units (cfu)/100 mL for intestinal enterococci and E. coli, respectively, were exceeded in three (intestinal enterococci) and one (E. coli) of the eight investigated sand filters. In one of the sand filters, effluent E. coli concentrations were high although no obvious malfunction of the filter was observed. In the effluent from the other investigated biological treatment units (a trickling fibre filter, two units with attached growth treatment and one aerated activated sludge technique), bacterial concentrations were very high (75,000 cfu/100 mL of Clostridium perfringens and 85,000 cfu per 100 mL of total coliform), possibly because of a shorter retention time of the wastewater in these facilities, missing aeration and little time between start-up and measurements. Three and four of the nine investigated P-filters exceeded excellent bathing water quality in coastal waters as stipulated by the EU bathing water directive in respect of E. coli and intestinal enterococci, respectively.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				OCT	2017	91						365	373		10.5004/dwt.2017.21416								WOS:000418406400047

Consideration of phytoplankton composition and water quality of Anamur (Dragon) Creek, Turkey	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT					13th IWA Specialized Conference on Small Water and Wastewater Systems (SWWS) together with the 5th IWA Specialized Conference on Resources-Oriented Sanitation (ROS)	SEP 14-17, 2016	Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sanitary Engn Lab, Athens, GREECE	IWA, Hellen Water Assoc	Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sanitary Engn Lab			In this study, water pollution of Anamur Creek, one of the water resources of Mersin (Turkey), was determined. For this purpose, phytoplankton composition and some physicochemical parameters in the surface water of Anamur Creek were investigated. Samples were collected at five sampling sites in the course of the stream in April and June 2010. Fifteen taxa were identified belonging to Bacillariophyta (11), Cryptophyta (1), Euglenozoa (1) and Miozoa (2) divisions. In terms of chlorophyll-a concentrations (4.04-26.23 mg/m(3)) the stream shows eutrophic characteristics. Anamur Creek is used for agriculture, fish farms and river sports. Nowadays, water has been started to be supplied from the Anamur Creek to the Gecitkoy Dam, located in Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, with the project which began in 2011 and completed in 2015. For this reason, designation of the usage areas and amounts of this creek's water again has an important role on its trophic status. It is required that Anamur Creek should be taken under protection for improving its water quality by relevant authorities. Artificial neural network analysis succeeds to envisage the significance importance of input data sets used to investigate and monitor the water quality in the designated study area. April data set showed that pH followed by temperature was exercised to descend the neural network classification parameters. Dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll-a concentration came in second in the significance order, while conductivity ranked the last. June data set showed that temperature was ranked the most important variable followed by the pH. Correspondingly to April data set, dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll-a concentration came in second in the significance order but with opposite importance due to temperature variation. Therefore, detailed studies on phytoplankton including physicochemical parameters have to be carried out for controlling the water quality in Anamur Creek.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				OCT	2017	91						386	394		10.5004/dwt.2017.20844								WOS:000418406400049

Strategic Evaluation Tool for Surface Water Quality Management Remedies in Drinking Water Catchments	WATER												Drinking water catchments (DWC) are under pressure from point and nonpoint source pollution due to the growing human activities. This worldwide challenge is causing number of adverse effects, such as degradation in water quality, ecosystem health, and other economic and social pressures. Different evaluation tools have been developed to achieve sustainable and healthy drinking water catchments. However, a holistic and strategic framework is still required to adequately consider the uncertainty associated with feasible management remedies of surface water quality in drinking water catchments. A strategic framework was developed to adequately consider the uncertainty associated with management remedies for surface water quality in drinking water catchments. A Fuzzy Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (FMCDA) approach was embedded into a strategic decision support framework to evaluate and rank water quality remediation options within a typical fixed budget constraint faced by bulk water providers. The evaluation framework consists of four core aspects; namely, water quality, environmental, economic and social, and number of associated quantitative and qualitative criteria and sub-criteria. Final remediation strategy ranking was achieved through the application of the Euclidean Distance by the In-center of Centroids (EDIC).

Consumption of water for irrigation, together with the discharge of agricultural non-point source pollution, is seriously affecting the water quality of Poyang Lake. This study assesses the application of integrated ecological restoration technology for agricultural non-point source pollution in the Ganfu Plain Area, which is an important agricultural production base in the Poyang Lake basin. The results indicated that the water-fertilizer comprehensive regulation mode for double-cropping rice provided water savings of 10.4% and increased rice yield by 6.5% per hectare. Furthermore, it reduced drainage water pollution by 20.4%, and emissions of ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N), total phosphorus (TP), and total nitrogen (TN) from rice paddy surfaces by 18.6%, 11.1%, 15.4%, and 16.0%, respectively. The eco-channel-pond wetland system effectively reduced TN and TP pollutant levels in rice paddy drainage water; the eco-channel reduced TN and TP by 9.3% and 14.0%, respectively; and the pond wetland system showed reductions of 8.6% and 22.9%, respectively. The three lines of defense purification technology, including rice field source control, eco-channel interception, and pond wetland purification, removed 29.9% of TN and 44.3% of TP.																	2073-4441					OCT	2017	9	10							745	10.3390/w9100745								WOS:000414707500022

Simulating Climate Change Induced Thermal Stress in Coldwater Fish Habitat Using SWAT Model	WATER												Climate studies have suggested that inland stream temperatures and average streamflows will increase over the next century in New England, thereby putting aquatic species sustained by coldwater habitats at risk. This study uses the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to simulate historical streamflow and stream temperatures within three forested, baseflow-driven watersheds in Rhode Island, USA followed by simulations of future climate scenarios for comparison. Low greenhouse gas emission scenarios are based on the 2007 International Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) B1 scenario and the high emissions are based on the SRES A1fi scenario. The output data are analyzed to identify daily occurrences where brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) are exposed to stressful events, defined herein as any day where Q25 or Q75 flows occur simultaneously with stream temperatures exceeding 21 degrees C. Results indicate that under both high- and low-emission greenhouse gas scenarios, coldwater fish species such as brook trout will be increasingly exposed to stressful events. The percent chance of stressful event occurrence increased by an average of 6.5% under low-emission scenarios and by 14.2% under high-emission scenarios relative to the historical simulations.																	2073-4441					OCT	2017	9	10							732	10.3390/w9100732								WOS:000414707500009

Investigating spatio-temporal variability of water resources is, therefore, a critical initial step for water-resource management. This paper is a first study on the evaluation of water-budget components of water resources in Istanbul using a high-resolution hydrological model. In this work, the water resources of Istanbul and surrounding watersheds were modeled using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), which is a continuous-time, semi-distributed, process-based model. The SWAT-CUP program was used for calibration/validation of the model with uncertainty analysis using the SUFI-2 algorithm over the period 1977-2013 at 25 gauge stations. The results reveal that the annual blue-water potential of Istanbul is 3.5 billion m(3), whereas the green-water flow and storage are 2.9 billion m(3) and 0.7 billion m(3), respectively. Watersheds located on the Asian side of the Istanbul megacity yield more blue-water resources compared to the European side, and constitute 75% of the total potential water resources. The model highlights the water potential of the city under current circumstances and gives an insight into its spatial distribution over the region. This study provides a strong basis for forthcoming studies concerning better water-resources management practices, climate change and water-quality studies, as well as other socio-economic scenario analyses in the region.

J	Hartog, N; Stuyfzand, PJ				Hartog, Niels; Stuyfzand, Pieter J.			Water Quality Considerations on the Rise as the Use of Managed Aquifer Recharge Systems Widens	WATER												Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) is a promising method of increasing water availability in water stressed areas by subsurface infiltration and storage, to overcome periods of drought, and to stabilize or even reverse salinization of coastal aquifers. Moreover, MAR could be a key technique in making alternative water resources available, such as reuse of communal effluents for agriculture, industry and even indirect potable reuse. As exemplified by the papers in this Special Issue, consideration of water quality plays a major role in developing the full potential for MAR application, ranging from the improvement of water quality to operational issues (e.g., well clogging) or sustainability concerns (e.g., infiltration of treated waste water). With the application of MAR expanding into a wider range of conditions, from deserts to urban and coastal areas, and purposes, from large scale strategic storage of desalinated water and the reuse of waste water, the importance of these considerations are on the rise. Addressing these appropriately will contribute to a greater understanding, operational reliability and acceptance of MAR applications, and lead to a range of engineered MAR systems that help increase their effectiveness to help secure the availability of water at the desired quality for the future.

However, the phosphorus (P) removal in BRC has been variable due to differences of soil properties in filter media. The objectives of this research were to identify and evaluate P accumulation in filter media and to quantify effluent P reduction in BRC. Each cell has a sand and fly ash media designed to remove phosphorous. Filter media were collected in 2014 across the cell surface and to a depth of 0.6 m to quantify the P accumulation. The mean total P (T-P) concentration increased over the seven years of operation, but the changes were not statistically significant. The average Mehlich-3 P (M3-P) and water-soluble P (WS-P) concentrations in the media profiles showed higher P accumulation in the top 0.15 m. The average M3-P and WS-P concentrations between 0.15 m to 0.30 m, and 0.30 m to 0.60 m were variable on all four BRCs media. The media with 5% fly ash significantly retained M3-P and WS-P over the top 0.15 m. Stormwater influent and effluent samples from three of the BRCs monitored over one year showed reductions in both P concentration (68% to 75%) and P mass (76% to 93%).																	2073-4441					OCT	2017	9	10							746	10.3390/w9100746								WOS:000414707500023

Investigation of Algal Biotoxin Removal during SWRO Desalination through a Materials Flow Analysis	WATER												The operation of seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) desalination facilities has become challenged by the increasing frequency and severity of harmful algal blooms (HABs). The efficiency of algal toxins removal during SWRO and pretreatment processes has critical human health implications. Therefore, a probabilistic materials flow analysis (pMFA) was developed to predict the removal of algal toxins in source water by various pretreatment configurations and operations during SWRO desalination. The results demonstrated that an appreciable quantity of toxins exists in the SWRO permeate (ng/L-mu g/L levels), the backwash of pretreatment, and final brine rejects (mu g/L-mg/L levels). Varying the pretreatment train configuration resulted in statistically significant differences in toxin removals, where higher removal efficiencies were evidenced in systems employing microfiltration/ultrafiltration (MF/UF) over granular media filtration (GMF). However, this performance depended on operational practices including coagulant addition and transmembrane pressures of MF/UF systems. Acute human health risks during lifetime exposure to algal toxins from ingestion of desalinated water were benign, with margins of safety ranging from 100 to 4000. This study highlights the importance of pretreatment steps during SWRO operation in the removal of algal toxins for managing marine HABs.

Besides the harmful algae blooms (HAB) and a severe prolonged drought, the bay has a strategic importancee.g., the eastern channel of the newly built water diversion will withdraw water from it (drinking water). This article presents the implementation of a three-dimensional (3D) numerical modelpioneering for the regionusing TELEMAC-3D. The aim was to investigate the 3D flows induced by moderate or extreme winds as well as by heating of the water surface. The findings showed that a windstorm increased the flow velocities (at least one order of magnitude, i.e., up to 10(-1)-10(-2) m/s) without altering significantly the circulation patterns; this occurred substantially for the heating scenario, which had, in contrast, a lower effect on velocities. In terms of the bay's management, the main implications are: (1) the withdrawals for drinking water and irrigation agriculture should stop working during windstorms and at least three days afterwards; (2) a heating of the water surface would likely increase the risk of development of HAB in the shallow areas, so that further assessments with a water quality module are needed to support advanced remediation measures; (3) the 3D model proves to be a necessary tool to identify high risk contamination areas e.g., for installation of new aquaculture systems.

J	Meng, XY; Wang, H				Meng, Xianyong; Wang, Hao			Significance of the China Meteorological Assimilation Driving Datasets for the SWAT Model (CMADS) of East Asia	WATER												The high degree of spatial variability in climate conditions, and a lack of meteorological data for East Asia, present challenges to conducting surface water research in the context of the hydrological cycle. In addition, East Asia is facing pressure from both water resource scarcity and water pollution. The consequences of water pollution have attracted public concern in recent years. The low frequency and difficulty of monitoring water quality present challenges to understanding the continuous spatial distributions of non-point source pollution mechanisms in East Asia. The China Meteorological Assimilation Driving Datasets for the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model (CMADS) was developed to provide high-resolution, high-quality meteorological data for use by the scientific community. Applying CMADS can significantly reduce the meteorological input uncertainty and improve the performance of non-point source pollution models, since water resources and non-point source pollution can be more accurately localised. In addition, researchers can make use of high-resolution time series data from CMADS to conduct spatial- and temporal-scale analyses of meteorological data. This Special Issue, Application of the China Meteorological Assimilation Driving Datasets for the SWAT Model (CMADS) in East Asia, provides a platform to introduce recent advances in the modelling of water quality and quantity in watersheds using CMADS and hydrological models, and underscores its application to a wide range of topics.

However, how much typical hydraulic conditions affect the mobilisation of discolouration material has yet to be thoroughly investigated. In this paper, results are presented from real turbidity and flow observations collected from three U.K. trunk main networks over a period of two years and 11 months. A methodology is presented that determines whether discolouration material has been mobilised by hydraulic forces and the origin of that material. The methodology found that the majority of turbidity observations over 1 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) could be linked to a preceding hydraulic force that exceeded an upstream pipe's hydraulically preconditioned state.

J	Tsai, LY; Chen, CF; Fan, CH; Lin, JY				Tsai, Lin-Yi; Chen, Chi-Feng; Fan, Chi-Hsuan; Lin, Jen-Yang			Using the HSPF and SWMM Models in a High Pervious Watershed and Estimating Their Parameter Sensitivity	WATER												Models are necessary tools for watershed management. However, applying watershed models is time consuming and requires technical knowledge, including model selection and validation. The objective of this study is to assess two commonly used watershed models and their parameter sensitivity to reduce model loadings and to gain a better understanding of the model performances. The Hydrological Simulation Program-Fortran (HSPF) model and Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) were applied to a mostly forested Taiwanese reservoir watershed with pollution from tea plantations. Statistical analysis showed that both models are suitable for the studied watershed, but the performances of the flow and water quality simulations are different. The mean flow simulated by SWMM was lower than the experimental observations. The HSPF model performed better, possibly because the soil in the study area is highly permeable and the HSPF model has more precise soil layer calculations. SWMM may underestimate the total phosphorous (TP) and suspended solid (SS) loads following small storm events in highly permeable watersheds. The Latin Hypercube-One factor At a Time (LH-OAT) method was used to determine the parameter sensitivity of the HSPF model and SWMM. In both of the models, the parameters related to infiltration and soil characteristics strongly affected the flow simulation, except when using the Horton infiltration method in the SWMM. Manning's roughness coefficient for pervious areas was more sensitive in SWMM than in the HSPF model because SWMM has fewer parameters.																	2073-4441					OCT	2017	9	10							780	10.3390/w9100780								WOS:000414707500057

However, an understanding of water-soil-vegetation dynamic interactions is needed to develop practical and effective solutions to sustain the globe's eco-environment and grassland agriculture, which depends on grasses, legumes, and other fodder or soil-building crops. This special issue is intended to be a platform for a discussion of the relevant scientific findings based on experimental and/or modeling studies. Its 12 peer-reviewed articles present data, novel analysis/modeling approaches, and convincing results of water-soil-vegetation interactions under historical and future climates. Two of the articles examine how lake/pond water quality is related to human activity and climate. Overall, these articles can serve as important references for future studies to further advance our understanding of how water, soil, and vegetation interactively affect the health and productivity of the Earth's ecosystem.

The aim is to identify environmental parameters governing spatial and temporal differences in phytoplankton density and composition. Physicochemical parameters, including nutrient concentrations, were determined in monthly surface water samples from 2015. The average concentration of key eutrophication indexes (i.e., total phosphorous (TP: 0.24 +/- 0.11 mgL(-1)), total nitrogen (TN: 2.96 +/- 1.60 mgL(-1)), and Chlorophyll a (Chl a: 38.5 +/- 11.5 mgm(-3))) substantially exceeded threshold values for eutrophic streams. Moreover, the eutrophication increased significantly downstream along the river reservoir as a consequence of an increasing fraction of agricultural and industrial land-use in the watershed. 103 phytoplankton species were identified, of which Chlorophyta was the dominated phylum (47 species), followed by Bacillariophyta (23 species) and Cyanophyta (18 species). No spatial difference in species distribution (ANOVA, p > 0.05) were found, while the temporal differences in species composition exhibited significant heterogeneity (ANOVA, p < 0.001). Phytoplankton abundance was highest in early summer (June and July), with maximum values increasing from 1.78 x 10(8) and 2.80 x 10(8) cellsL(-1) in upstream and middle reaches, respectively, to 4.18 x 10(8) cellsL(-1) furthest downstream. Cyanophyta, also known as Cyanobacteria and commonly referred to as blue-green algal, are known to constitute algae bloom in eutrophic systems. Common species are Microcystis marginata, Microcystis flos-aquae, and Oscillatoria sp. This was the dominant phyla during summer months, especially in the middle and lower reaches of the stream reservoir where it accounted for 88.9% of the phytoplankton community. Shannon weaver index (H') and Pielous's evenness index (J') were extremely low (1.91-2.43 for H' and 0.39-0.45 for J') in samples collected from the lower part of the stream during the period of algal bloom, indicating an imbalance in the phytoplankton communities. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) indicated that water temperature (WT) and possible pH, along with nitrate (NO3-N) and nitrite (NO2-N), were the most important explanatory parameters in regard to phytoplankton composition. This research provides an understanding of the role of physicochemical water quality parameters in governing algal blooms and phytoplankton composition in river reservoirs.																	2073-4441					OCT	2017	9	10							754	10.3390/w9100754								WOS:000414707500031

We present an overview of deep-well recharge applications which have taken place in the Netherlands over the last two decades. We present the purpose of each application, the issues which had to be resolved, the preventive measures which were taken to improve performance and the lessons learned from each experience. Examples are given of applications which aimed at the storage of water for drinking and other purposes such as irrigation, achieving environmental goals and disposal of wastewater. Applications aiming at drinking water production usually faced issues related to the quality of the abstracted water not meeting drinking water standards with respect to various elements, such as iron, manganese and arsenic. Storage of water in brackish aquifers was complicated by buoyancy effects making part of the recharged water irrecoverable. Recharge of water with the purpose of recovering declined groundwater tables and fighting seawater intrusion was hindered by clogging of the injection well while the disposal of wastewater was limited to aquifers of lower groundwater quality.																	1606-9749					OCT	2017	17	5					1201	1211		10.2166/ws.2017.032								WOS:000417944300001						
J	Zhang, J; Fu, YC; Shi, WL; Guo, WX				Zhang, Jian; Fu, Yi-Cheng; Shi, Wan-Li; Guo, Wen-Xian			A method for estimating watershed restoration feasibility under different treatment levels	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												The restoration of watershed health can be influenced by ecological, technical and socio-economic factors. The paper presents a conceptual framework and typology to assess watershed ecological restoration based on the properties and processes of sustainable watershed development. According to multiple life stages, habitat properties and existing legal frameworks and applicable valuation approaches, the bio-indicator that integrates natural, political and socio-economic dimensions is proposed. With existing assessment results and official web-pages as references, evaluation systems concerning human impacts on aquatic systems are set forth. Suitable aquatic bio-indicators can standardize the monitoring methodology with respect to water quality, organic pollutants and pesticides, generation time, migration ability, saprobic status, taxonomic composition and diversity. A large number of fish-based indexes have been developed to monitor and manage river ecosystems. Biophysical and statistical models are being used to identify influential stream variables that correlate with macroinvertebrate indices. A probabilistic fuzzy hybrid model to assess river water quality is proposed. The method and process of ecological risk assessment are provided based on adaptive management principles. The environmental sustainability index (ESI) is used to estimate the degree of environmental restoration sustainability with the emergy triangle as a reference.																	1606-9749					OCT	2017	17	5					1232	1240		10.2166/ws.2017.017								WOS:000417944300005

The treatment scheme was: (1) As(III) in contaminated water is oxidized by arsenite-oxidizing bacteria fixed in the sponges in the reactor; (2) Fe(II) naturally existing in the water is oxidized by dissolved oxygen; (3) Fe(III) is precipitated as iron hydroxide and As(V) is co-precipitated with the iron hydroxide; and finally (4) the co-precipitates are fixed in the sponges. This system could remove As from As-contaminated water on a small scale and at low cost. The results showed that, after using the DHS reactor, As and Fe concentrations in the treated water were lower than water quality standards for drinking water when Fe(II) concentration in the influent was lower than 10 mg/L and the Fe/As ratio was higher than 6.67-8.42, with dependence on the Fe concentration. Additionally, even if Fe concentration is higher than 10 mg/L, the treatment system is still applicable if the pH of the influent is higher than 7 or the retention time is longer than 2 h.																	1606-9749					OCT	2017	17	5					1249	1259		10.2166/ws.2017.025								WOS:000417944300007

Investigation of natural organic matter (NOM) character and its removal in a chlorinated and chloraminated system at Rand Water, South Africa	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												In its natural environment, natural organic matter (NOM) is not problematic. However, during water treatment NOM does affect water quality specifically during the disinfection step, where if NOM is present it reacts with disinfectants resulting in the formation of disinfection by-products. To emphasize the importance of NOM monitoring during potable water treatment this study aimed to characterize NOM and evaluate NOM removal by a conventional water treatment plant considering seasonal trends. NOM was characterized by making use of NOM polarity and specific ultraviolet absorbance. NOM removal was monitored with high-performance size exclusion chromatography, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and UV254 analyses. The polarity rapid assessment method indicated that the hydrophobic and hydrophilic NOM fractions within the surface water increased during a period of heavy rain when floods occurred, but conversely decreased during an average rain season. Although NOM character showed variability during the 5-year study period, seasonal relationship during high and low flow seasons between aromatic NOM and total trihalomethane (TTHM) formation was not evident. Aromatic NOM was not the only precursor to TTHM formation, which stresses the need to implement advanced NOM characterization techniques during NOM monitoring to study reactivity of the individual NOM fraction with the disinfectant used at the water treatment plant.

In this study, we conducted high-frequency, synchronous field observations of meteorology, hydrology, and water quality to determine the relationship between sediment release rate and wind speed in the central region of Lake Taihu. We combined these results with our previous findings from other regions to establish the temporal-spatial variation in sediment release patterns for this lake. We then calculated the annual total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) release fluxes. We constructed an environmental fluid dynamics code (EFDC) model; we then loaded the temporal-spatial variation parameters and simulated the effects on different TN and TP concentrations. Overall, the following results were observed: (1) the critical wind speed at which sediment was first suspended in the central region of the lake was 4 m/s, and the fitted curve of the sediment release rate and wind speed was r = 144.7x - 100 (R-2 = 0.851); and (2) the annual TN and TP release fluxes of Lake Taihu were approximately 3,086 and 740 tons, respectively. This research would provide a basis for decision-making regarding pollution control in this region.																	1606-9749					OCT	2017	17	5					1335	1346		10.2166/ws.2017.034								WOS:000417944300016

Evaluation of the potential impact of Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam and pumping scenarios on groundwater level in the Nile Delta aquifer	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												The main objective of this study is to evaluate the potential impact of Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) and pumping scenarios on groundwater level by a three- dimensional groundwater model of the Nile Delta using MODFLOW software. The Nile Delta has highly intensive irrigation canal networks that share yearly about 35.5 km(3) of water. In this study, an integrated three- dimensional groundwater model is built considering the actual condition of the irrigation canals and their recharges of the Nile Delta aquifer. The model was calibrated for estimating the vertical and hydraulic conductivity. The model was run for three scenarios: (1) reduction of water depth in canals, (2) increasing pumping discharge from the aquifer and (3) combination between the first and second scenarios. Results reveal that the effect of increasing the pumping discharge on groundwater level in the Nile Delta is more significant than decreasing the water depth of the canals network due to the fact of the existence of the upper clay layer which reduces the amount of water penetrating and reaching the groundwater in the aquifer. The last scenario presents the worst case as the average drawdown reached 1.26 m, 1.7 m and 1.35 m in the western, central and eastern parts of the Nile Delta respectively. The study results should be taken in account for studying the saltwater intrusion and climate change impacts on the Nile Delta region.

Statistical assessment of water quality of a Ramsar site wetland	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												This study was conducted to evaluate the wetland water quality (WWQ) over a period of 3 years and establish relationships between these qualities using Ramsar site Uchali Wetland, Pakistan (32 degrees 33'N, 72 degrees 01'E). WWQ data obtained were subjected to summary statistics, generalized linear model (glm), correlation, covariance and cluster analysis. The glm of the monthly mean water indices showed that the mean returned for pH (2.57) was not significant while means for others were significant (p< 0.05). The correlation analysis of the WWQ indices indicated that 56% of the pairing indices were inversely correlated while 44% were directly correlated and three piles of clusters of WWQ indices were distinct. The wetland water is not very safe for drinking but safe for other non- domestic uses since it contains fewer microbes and the water health model as arrived at in this study provides a management protocol for wetland water.

Hydrochemical characteristics and quality assessment of urban groundwater in Urmia City, NW Iran	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality and hydrochemical characteristics of urban groundwater in Urmia City, northwest of Iran. In order, 59 groundwater samples were collected and analyzed for various anions and cations. Result shows that, mineral weathering, ion exchange and anthropogenic activity are the main hydrochemical processes controlling urban groundwater chemistry. The evaluation of groundwater geochemistry in the flow path beneath the urban area shows that, due to land use changes, the hydrochemical change occurs predominantly in electrical conductivity (EC), Cl- and NO3. The EC is increased in the direction of groundwater flow and in the last decade in industrial areas. According to the groundwater quality index values, most of the samples fit into the good quality class and samples with poor quality are located in the old residential, parks and agricultural areas of the city. The calculation of the irrigation water quality indices (Na%, sodium adsorption ratio, permeability index, residual sodium carbonate), and industrial water quality indices (Ryznar stability index, Langelier saturation index, Larson- Skold, Puckorius scaling index) indicated that the quality of water for irrigation purposes could be classified in the excellent to permissible categories. However, as for the industrial uses, the results also revealed that most of the samples could be classified in the aggressive and very aggressive categories.																	1606-9749					OCT	2017	17	5					1410	1425		10.2166/ws.2017.039								WOS:000417944300023

Water as a weapon in ancient times: considerations of technical and ethical aspects	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												This paper addresses the issue of how water played a role in ancient conflicts, from the poisoning of water sources to flooding, to stop the advance of enemy armies. It deals with military actions quoted by several ancient Greek and Roman authors, who in some cases narrate these experiences first-hand. Although many abhorred such actions, they were considered tactical expedients to resort to, as cited by the war manuals of the time. The analysis starts from the 'manual' Strategemata of Sextus Julius Frontinus, in addition to other references left by historians and chroniclers of different periods. It continues with the evaluation of the impact of the intentional actions of water contamination described by the ancient authors, according to present toxicological and health knowledge.																	1606-9749					OCT	2017	17	5					1490	1498		10.2166/ws.2017.043								WOS:000417944300030

BTEX compounds in water - future trends and directions for water treatment	WATER SA												BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene) compounds are common water resource and potable water pollutants that are often left undetected and untreated by municipal treatment systems in spite of the negative repercussions associated with their ingestion. The US EPA has classified these pollutants as priority pollutant, yet they are persistently present in a variety of water resources. In this review paper, we highlight the sources and reported concentrations of BTEX compounds in water and explore historical remediation techniques that have been applied such as bioremediation and natural attenuation. We also highlight emerging possibilities and future directions for remediation techniques, such as nanotechnology-based materials and novel green materials (tannins) that can be applied to ensure removal of these compounds in water.

J	Lethea, L				Lethea, Lerato			Impact of water hardness on energy consumption of geyser heating elements	WATER SA												South Africa is an electricity-stressed country with a growing energy demand. Globally, hot water appliances are major consumers of electricity. Poor water quality for domestic purposes is a concern that may affect the efficiency of hot water appliances. Therefore, the Eskom Research, Testing, and Development Business Unit embarked on a study to examine total water hardness as a chemical parameter that may impact the power consumption of electrical geyser heating elements. An accelerated scaling method was developed to lime-scale the geyser heating elements for about 2 to 3 months. In addition, the geyser heating elements were tested with and without electronic descaler technology. The results showed that the accelerated scaling method developed for shortening the scaling time of geyser heating elements was successful. Furthermore, the results proved that scale formation of 1.5 kW and 3 kW geyser heating elements due to high total water hardness increased the power consumption by approximately 4% to 12%. This paper also presents energy-efficient electronic descaler technology as an alternative treatment of scaling for geyser heating elements.																	0378-4738	1816-7950				OCT	2017	43	4					614	625		10.4314/wsa.v43i4.09								WOS:000417004800009

The use of bioassays to assess the toxicity of sediment in an acid mine drainage impacted river in Gauteng (South Africa)	WATER SA												Sediment contamination may occur from various anthropogenic activities, such as mining-, agricultural- and industrial practices. Many of the contaminants arising from these activities enter the aquatic system and precipitate from the surrounding water, becoming bound to sediment particles. These bound contaminants may reach concentrations higher than in the overlying water. Although water quality may be acceptable, an aquatic system may still be at risk if the contaminated sediment were to be disturbed through flooding, bioturbation or changes in the water chemistry. These contaminants may then desorb into the water column and prove detrimental to life forms in contact and dependent on that water source. Sediment quality monitoring has been a widespread international initiative and has led to the development of sediment toxicity assessment methods. This study focused on sediment bioassays, namely, Phytotoxkit, Ostracodtoxkit F and the Diptera bioassay, in assessing sediment quality of the Tweelopiespruit-Rietspruit-Bloubankspruit river system in Gauteng, South Africa. This river is known to have been impacted by acid mine drainage (AMD) since late August, 2002. Exposure of river sediment from 7 sampling sites to these bioassays provided an eco-toxicological estimation of the acute toxicity and chronic toxicity emanating from the contaminated sediments. Physico-chemical analyses revealed higher levels of sediment contamination closer to the mine. The bioassays displayed a similar trend with greater sensitivities to sediments closer to the mine and lower sensitivities to the less contaminated sites further downstream. AMD was therefore the main driver for sediment contamination. Whilst not all contaminants were bioavailable, statistical analysis showed that there were significant correlations between the elevated contaminant concentrations closer to the mine and bioassay responses.																	0378-4738	1816-7950				OCT	2017	43	4					673	683		10.4314/wsa.v43i4.15								WOS:000417004800015

Biosensors for the detection of Escherichia coli	WATER SA												The supply of safe potable water, free from pathogens and chemicals, requires routine analyses and the application of several diagnostic techniques. Apart from being expensive, many of the detection methods require trained personnel and are often time-consuming. With drastic climate changes, severe droughts, increases in population and pollution of natural water systems, the need to develop ultrasensitive, low-cost and hand-held, point-of-use detection kits to monitor water quality is critical. Although Escherichia coli is still considered the best indicator of water quality, cell numbers may be below detection limits, or the cells may be non-culturable and thus only detected by DNA amplification. A number of different biosensors have been developed to detect viable, dead or non-culturable microbial cells and chemicals in water. This review discusses the differences in these biosensors and evaluates the application of microfluidics in the design of ultra-sensitive nano-biosensors.																	0378-4738	1816-7950				OCT	2017	43	4					707	721		10.4314/wsa.v43i4.17								WOS:000417004800017						
J	Khadim, FK; Su, HB; Xu, LN				Khadim, Fahad Khan; Su, Hongbo; Xu, Lina			A spatially weighted optimization model (SWOM) for salinity mapping in Florida Bay using Landsat images and in situ observations	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH												The surface water salinity of Florida Bay has been deteriorating due to anthropogenic interventions and natural disturbances for almost over a century, yet astoundingly, this issue perceiving limited exposure. Driven by this, this study developed a spatially weighted optimization model (SWOM) to predict the dry and wet season's surface water salinity in Florida Bay. The modeling was carried out using in situ salinity observations from United States Geological Survey (USGS) for 1998-2001 coupled with processed Landsat TM 5 images for corresponding dates. A mathematical optimization formulation was developed for the model, which was solved using a gradient-based optimization solver, following the clustering of the study area into a set of 3 km * 3 km grids. To train the model so as to infer optimum values of decision variables, the optimization process was simulated for each 3 km pixel using two-third randomly selected samples, which yielded acceptable R-squared values of 0.92 and 0.90 for dry and wet seasons and root mean squared error (RMSE) values of 1.8 and 1.73 parts per thousand (ppt) for dry and wet seasons, respectively. The validation of the model with the remaining one-third samples also provided good statistical correlation, as the R-squared values found were 0.91 (dry) and 0.89 (wet); and the validated RMSE values obtained were 1.92 ppt (dry) and 1.84 ppt (wet), providing strong inference of the model's consistency in estimating surface water salinity. Lastly, the model was applied to six different temporal cases (i.e., dry and wet seasons of 1996-97, 2004-05, and 2016). Upon application, the model provided reasonable accuracy except for showing errors in some regions for 2004-05. The surface water salinity mapping carried out using SWOM not only provided meaningful spatial and temporal variations of surface water salinity but also highlighted the wet season hypersaline peaks within the central Florida Bay region.

Field assessment of surface runoff, sediment yield and soil erosion in the opencast mines in Chirimiri area, Chhattisgarh, India	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH												Chirimiri Coal field is located in the Koriya district of Chhattisgarh state of India. It lies in the valley of the Hasdeo River and is spread over 125 km(2) area. Ever increasing problem of declining forest resources and water quality is a cause of concern particularly due to excessive soil erosion resulting in soil sediment deposition from the overburdened dump. Dwindling resources has compelled the policy makers to search for alternatives such as waste lands and mined areas to improve soil and water resources for use in agriculture and allied sectors while maintaining the local ecology and hydrology. Most Opencast mines release huge amount of mining wastes in the form of overburden dump (OBD) materials that are prone to soil erosion and also create problems of sedimentation and deteriorating water quality, affecting agriculture. Historical daily rainfall data for 21 years and daily surface runoff as estimated by SCS-Curve Number method were analysed. Sediment yield was estimated at lower end of erosion face of OBD and near drainage outlet of opencast mine. Assessment of soil erosion from OBD materials was made byRevised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) method and was compared with direct field measurements by placing plastic sheets in downstream portion of OBD. As a result monsoon rainfall constitutes 91.6 percent of the annual rainfall and surface runoff constitutes 31.7 percent of monsoon rainfall. The surface runoff was found to be 4133 m(3)/ha while the sediment yield of drainage effluent was negligible. The soil loss from OBD as estimated by the RUSLE method (62.7 t ha(-1) yr(-1)) was quite close (+13.2 percent) to the direct field measurement 54.44 t ha(-1). The sediment samples from OBD were found acidic in nature and exhibited low values of Electrical Conductivity (EC), Organic Content (OC), Water Holding Capacities (WHC), and Available Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P) and Potassium (K). For controlling soil erosion of OBD, mechanical and vegetative measures have been suggested along with installation of sediment traps inside and outside the mines. There is good scope to backfill the mines with the OBD in the form of well laid out terraces to support plantation. This can be eventually used for leguminous fodder/grass production.

J	Salomons, E; Skulovich, O; Ostfeld, A				Salomons, Elad; Skulovich, Olya; Ostfeld, Avi			Battle of Water Networks DMAs: Multistage Design Approach	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT												Looped water distribution system (WDS) re-partitioning to district metering areas (DMAs) gained popularity as an effective technique to manage the system and detect and reduce system leakages. However, to apply this method to real WDS, various system properties should be taken into account to ensure efficient water supply. The battle of water networks district meter areas (BWNDMA) is a challenging problem that requires the redesign of the E-Town city network in Colombia. The water utility is looking to repartition the network into manageable DMAs while supplying future demands, keeping minimum and maximum pressures, improving water quality, operating the network at uniform low pressures, balancing water sources, and meeting their seasonal production capabilities. The problem is stated as a rnultiobjective optimization problem with DMA partitioning being one of eight equal-weighted objectives. They may be reached by (1) closing, opening, or replacing existing pipes, (2) adding parallel pipes, (3) managing storage tanks, pressure valves, and flow-control valves, and (4) utilizing pumps in the dry season. With no known analytical methodology to optimize-such a large mixed-integer nonlinear problem, a major difficulty is to find a feasible solution; therefore, a multistage classic engineering approach was taken. First, source allocation and general design were carried out for the operational zones. Then, tank volumes were adjusted to meet their constraints. At this stage, DMAs were introduced to meet pressure regulations. Finally, detailed design and fine-tuning of the operations were carried out. This paper describes the taken procedures and obtained results for the redesign of the E-Town network. (c) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Within the mid-Columbia River system, there is currently a lack of specific solutions for predicting how coordinated operational decisions can mitigate the impacts of total dissolved gas (TDG) supersaturation while satisfying multiple additional policy and hydropower generation objectives. In this study, a reduced-order TDG uptake equation is developed that predicts tailrace TDG at seven hydropower facilities on the mid-Columbia River. The equation is incorporated into a general multiobjective river, reservoir, and hydropower optimization tool as a prioritized operating goal within a broader set of system-level objectives and constraints. A test case is presented to assess the response of TDG and hydropower generation when TDG supersaturation is optimized to remain under state water-quality standards. Satisfaction of TDG as an operating goal is highly dependent on whether constraints that limit TDG uptake are implemented at a higher priority than generation requests. According to the model, an opportunity exists to reduce TDG supersaturation and meet hydropower generation requirements by shifting spillway flows to different time periods. A coordinated effort between all project owners is required to implement systemwide optimized solutions that satisfy the operating policies of all stakeholders.

J	Lehtoranta, V; Kosenius, AK; Seppala, E				Lehtoranta, Virpi; Kosenius, Anna-Kaisa; Seppala, Elina			Watershed Management Benefits in a Hypothetical, Real Intention and Real Willingness to Pay Approach	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Despite growing knowledge of a disparity between stated and actual willingness to engage in pro-environmental behavior, little is known about the cognitive or attitudinal factors explaining the disparity. In the context of water quality improvement in a river basin, we address the disparity issue by applying two approaches: a typical valuation question with a hypothetical option of voluntary payment and a valuation question with a real option of voluntary payment. The latter treatment allows for further analysis of the respondents who committed to a real payment. We show empirical evidence on the psychological factors explaining the disparity between the treatments and its relationship with response uncertainty. The extent of learning from the survey about water management of the watershed increased the likelihood of stating the willingness to contribute, either with certainty or uncertainty. In turn, a previous contribution to the environmental issue, higher income, belief in the scenario, and responding to the hypothetical treatment increased the likelihood of stating certain willingness to contribute. Our findings indicate that the factors influencing the decision on the maximum payment differ between treatments. Cognitive factors, such as perceiving the valuation scenario as plausible, learning from the questionnaire, and in which mailing round the respondent completed the survey, only explained the stated amount for the willingness to pay in the treatment with a hypothetical option for voluntary payment. In the real option treatment, a higher stated willingness to pay was more likely if the respondent actually made the payment and had a higher household income.

J	Srinivas, R; Singh, AP; Sharma, R				Srinivas, R.; Singh, Ajit Pratap; Sharma, Rishikesh			A Scenario Based Impact Assessment of Trace Metals on Ecosystem of River Ganges Using Multivariate Analysis Coupled with Fuzzy Decision-Making Approach	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												The growing consciousness about the health risks associated with environmental pollutants has brought a major shift in global concern towards prevention of hazardous/trace metals discharge in water bodies. Majority of these trace metals gets accumulated in the body of aquatic lives, which are considered as potential indicators of hazardous content. This results in an ecological imbalance in the form of poisoning, diseases and even death of fish and other aquatic lives, and ultimately affect humans through food chain. Trace metals such as Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn originated from various industrial operations containing metallic solutions and agricultural practices, have been contributing significantly to cause aquatic pollution. The present study develops a novel approach of expressing sustainability of river's ecosystem based on health of the fish by coupling fuzzy sensitivity analysis into multivariate analysis. A systematic methodology has been developed by generating monoplot, two dimensional biplot and rotated component matrix (using 'Analyze it' and 'SPSS' software), which can simultaneously identify critical trace metals and their industrial sources, critical sampling stations, and adversely affected fish species along with their interrelationships. A case study of assessing the impact of trace metals on the aquatic life of river Ganges, India has also been presented to demonstrate effectiveness of the model. The clusters pertaining to various water quality parameters have been identified using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to determine actual sources of pollutants and their impact on aquatic life. The fuzzy sensitivity analysis reveals the cause-effect relationship of these critical parameters. The study suggests pollution control agencies to enforce appropriate regulations on the wastewater dischargers responsible for polluting river streams with a particular kind of trace metal(s).

J	Slaughter, AR				Slaughter, A. R.			Simulating Microbial Water Quality in Data-Scarce Catchments: an Update of the WQSAM Model to Simulate the Fate of Escherichia coli	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Faecal-derived microbial pollution of fresh surface waters is a global problem. Water quality models can play an important role in the management of microbial pollution; however, most existing models are too complex and require a large amount of observed data for calibration, thereby excluding their use in data-scarce catchments. The Water Quality Systems Assessment Model (WQSAM) is a water quality water model structured on the concept of requisite simplicity, thereby limiting the complexity and data requirements of the model. Here, microbial water quality simulation functionality was added to WQSAM, with the aim of assessing whether a simplified representation of processes affecting microbial water quality is sufficiently accurate for purposes of water resource management. Simulations of microbial water quality were based on the inputs and fate of an indicator organism, Escherichia coli. Non-point source inputs were modelled by assigning microbial water quality 'signatures' to incremental flow components, whereas a similar signature was assigned to point source inputs. The instream fate of E. coli was based on a first-order rate equation, moderated by salinity and water temperature. The model was validated by application to the upper to middle Crocodile River Catchment, Mpumalanga, South Africa, for historical conditions. Model simulations were obtained that were representative of the variability of observed temperature, salinity and microbial water quality data. The simulations of E. coli were found to be most sensitive to the decay rate k (0). It is argued here that the uncertainty in model results due to the use of a relatively simple model structure would be no more, or even less that that due to the application of a complex model to a catchment with insufficient observed data for adequate model calibration.																	0920-4741	1573-1650				OCT	2017	31	13					4239	4252		10.1007/s11269-017-1743-1								WOS:000411869000013

A hydrodynamic model was applied to simulate the transport and dispersion of fecal contaminants from CSO discharges and to quantify the impacts of climate and population changes on the water quality of the river used as a drinking water source in Quebec, Canada. The dispersion model was used to quantify Escherichia coli (E. coli) concentrations at drinking water intakes. Extreme flows during high and low water events were based on a frequency analysis in current and future climate scenarios. The increase of the number of discharges was quantified in current and future climate scenarios with regards to the frequency of overflows observed between 2009 and 2012. For future climate scenarios, effects of an increase of population were estimated according to current population growth statistics, independently of local changes in precipitation that are more difficult to predict than changes to regional scale hydrology. Under "business-as-usual" scenarios restricting increases in CSO discharge frequency, mean E. coli concentrations at downstream drinking water intakes are expected to increase by up to 87% depending on the future climate scenario and could lead to changes in drinking water treatment requirements for the worst case scenarios. The greatest uncertainties are related to future local discharge loads. Climate change adaptation with regards to drinking water quality must focus on characterizing the impacts of global change at a local scale. Source water protection planning must consider the impacts of climate and population change to avoid further degradation of water quality. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Arulbalaji, P; Gurugnanam, B				Arulbalaji, P.; Gurugnanam, B.			Groundwater quality assessment using geospatial and statistical tools in Salem District, Tamil Nadu, India	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The water quality study of Salem district, Tamil Nadu has been carried out to assess the water quality for domestic and irrigation purposes. For this purpose, 59 groundwater samples were collected and analyzed for pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), major anions (HCO3-, CO3-, F-, Cl-, NO2- + NO3-, and SO42-),major cations (Ca2+ Mg2+, Na+, and K+), alkalinity (ALK), and hardness (HAR). To assess the water quality, the following chemical parameters were calculated based on the analytical results, such as Piper plot, water quality index (WQI), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), magnesium hazard (MH), Kelly index (KI), and residual sodium carbonate (RSC). Wilcox diagram represents that 23% of the samples are excellent to good, 40% of the samples are good to permissible, 10% of the samples are permissible to doubtful, 24% of the samples are doubtful unsuitable, and only 3% of the samples are unsuitable for irrigation. SAR values shows that 52% of the samples indicate high-to-very high and low-to-medium alkali water. KI values indicate good quality (30%) and not suitable (70%) for irrigation purposes. RSC values indicate that 89% of samples are suitable for irrigation purposes. MH reveals that 17% suitable and 83% samples are not suitable for irrigation purposes and for domestic purposes the excellent (8%), good (48%), and poor (44%). The agricultural waste, fertilizer used, soil leaching, urban runoff, livestock waste, and sewages are the sources of poor water quality. Some samples are not suitable for irrigation purposes due to high salinity, hardness, and magnesium concentration. In general, the groundwater of the Salem district was polluted by agricultural activities, anthropogenic activities, ion exchange, and weathering.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				OCT	2017	7	6					2737	2751		10.1007/s13201-016-0501-5								WOS:000413256900010

The large number of data can lead to difficulties in the integration, interpretation, and representation of the results. Two multivariate statistical methods, hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and factor analysis (FA), were applied to evaluate their usefulness to classify and identify geochemical processes controlling groundwater geochemistry. Four statistically significant clusters were obtained from 30 sampling stations. This has resulted two important clusters viz., cluster 1 (pH, Si, CO3, Mg, SO4, Ca, K, HCO3, alkalinity, Na, Na + K, Cl, and hardness) and cluster 2 (EC and TDS) which are released to the study area from different sources. The application of different multivariate statistical techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA), assists in the interpretation of complex data matrices for a better understanding of water quality of a study area. From PCA, it is clear that the first factor (factor 1), accounted for 36.2% of the total variance, was high positive loading in EC, Mg, Cl, TDS, and hardness. Based on the PCA scores, four significant cluster groups of sampling locations were detected on the basis of similarity of their water quality.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				OCT	2017	7	6					2767	2777		10.1007/s13201-016-0504-2								WOS:000413256900012						
J	Nag, SK; Das, S				Nag, S. K.; Das, Shreya			Assessment of groundwater quality from Bankura I and II Blocks, Bankura District, West Bengal, India	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Hydrochemical evaluation of groundwater has been conducted in Bankura I and II Blocks to analyze and determining groundwater quality in the area. Thirty-six groundwater samples were analyzed for their physical and chemical properties using standard laboratory methods. The constituents have the following ranges in the water: pH 6.4-8.6, electrical conductivity 80-1900 mu S/cm, total hardness 30-730 mg/l, TDS 48-1001 mg/l, Ca2+ 4.2222.6 mg/l, Na+ 2.33-103.33 mg/l, Mg2+ 1.56115.36 mg/l, K+ 0.67-14 mg/l and Fe BDL-2.53 mg/l, HCO3- 48.8-1000.4 mg/l, Cl -5.6-459.86 mg/l and SO4- BDL-99.03 mg/l. Results also show that bicarbonate ions (HCO3-) dominate the other anions (Cl - and SO24-). Sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), soluble sodium percentage (SSP), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), magnesium adsorption ratio (MAR), total hardness (TH), and permeability index (PI) were calculated as derived parameters, to investigate the ionic toxicity. Concerned chemical parameters when plotted in the U. S. Salinity diagram indicate that waters are of C-1-S-1, C-2-S-1 and C-3-S-1 types, i.e., low salinity and low sodium which is good for irrigation. The values of Sodium Adsorption Ratio indicate that the groundwater of the area falls under the category of low sodium hazard. So, there is neither salinity nor toxicity problem of irrigation water, and hence the ground water can safely be used for long-term irrigation. The chemical parameters when plotted in Piper's trilinear diagram are found to concentrate in the central and west central part of the diamond-shaped field. Based on the analytical results, groundwater in the area is found to be generally fresh and hard to very hard. The abundance of the major ions is as follows: HCO3 > Cl > SO4 and Ca > Na > Mg > K > Fe. Results also show that bicarbonate ions (HCO3-) dominate the other anions (Cl- and SO42-). According to Gibbs diagrams samples fall in the rock dominance field and the chemical quality of groundwater is related to the lithology of the area. The alkaline earth elements (Ca and Mg) occur in greater abundance than alkaline elements (Na and K). A comparative study of our analytical results with the WHO standards of drinking water indicate that the present waters are also good for drinking purposes.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				OCT	2017	7	6					2787	2802		10.1007/s13201-017-0530-8								WOS:000413256900014						
J	Malik, RN; Hashmi, MZ				Malik, Riffat Naseem; Hashmi, Muhammad Zaffar			Multivariate statistical techniques for the evaluation of surface water quality of the Himalayan foothills streams, Pakistan	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Himalayan foothills streams, Pakistan play an important role in living water supply and irrigation of farmlands; thus, the water quality is closely related to public health. Multivariate techniques were applied to check spatial and seasonal trends, and metals contamination sources of the Himalayan foothills streams, Pakistan. Grab surface water samples were collected from different sites (5-15 cm water depth) in pre-washed polyethylene containers. Fast Sequential Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (Varian FSAA-240) was used to measure the metals concentration. Concentrations of Ni, Cu, and Mn were high in pre-monsoon season than the post-monsoon season. Cluster analysis identified impaired, moderately impaired and least impaired clusters based on water parameters. Discriminant function analysis indicated spatial variability in water was due to temperature, electrical conductivity, nitrates, iron and lead whereas seasonal variations were correlated with 16 physicochemical parameters. Factor analysis identified municipal and poultry waste, automobile activities, surface runoff, and soil weathering as major sources of contamination. Levels of Mn, Cr, Fe, Pb, Cd, Zn and alkalinity were above the WHO and USEPA standards for surface water. The results of present study will help to higher authorities for the management of the Himalayan foothills streams.

J	Mallick, J				Mallick, Javed			Hydrogeochemical characteristics and assessment of water quality in the Al-Saad Lake, Abha Saudi Arabia	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Hydrogeochemical characteristics and assessment of water quality investigations have been carried out at Abha, located in Saudi Arabia, where Al-Saad Lake represents a rare example of natural endorheic lake. The ecosystem within and around the Al-Saad Lake including catchment area is of great social, cultural, aesthetic, environmental and economic values to Abha. Sampling and experiments of lake water has been carried out with the aim of characterizing the main physico-chemical parameters, such as DO, EC, TDS, Mg2+, Ca2+, Na+, K+, SO42-, Cl-, HCO3, NO3- and F- concentration. The ordinary kriging (OK) method was used to produce the spatial patterns of water quality. The Result of DO (mean 5.38 mg/L) trend in Al-Saad Lake is not very encouraging as majority of the lake area is under DO stress or marginally above it. So, proper management strategies are needed to be formulated to protect flora and fauna of the lake. Furthermore, the chemical analysis results show the abundance of the major cations in the order Mg2+ > Ca2+ > Na+ > K+ whereas the abundance of anions are in the order SO42- > Cl->HCO3>NO3->F-. The result obtained in this investigation inferred that the cations in water i.e. sodium and iron are within the permissible limits but magnesium and potassium have exceeded the permissible limit. Whereas anions such as nitrate and fluoride are within the permissible range but chloride and sulphate have exceeded the permissible limits. The concentration of cation, magnesium (Mg) and potassium (K) in the lake water has exceeded the desirable range (30, 10 mg/L, respectively). This may be due to weathering and transported from rocks and particularly from sulphate deposits such as gypsum and anhydride and subsequently ends up in water. The concentration of anion, Sulphate (SO4) and chloride are above the desirable limit. The major source of bicarbonate are the carbonate rocks containing calcite (CaCO3) and dolomite (CaMg (CO3)(2)), Calcium (Ca) and Magnesium (Mg) can also be transported from Ca-silicates and Mg-silicates. The piper trilinear plot suggests the increase of Ca and SO4 contents is attributed to dissolution of gypsum and anhydrite, which are commonly found in the quaternary formations of watershed (wadi). Ion exchange, dissolution of calcite, semi-arid climate, alkaline condition and weathering are responsible for high concentration of ions exceeding the desirable limit of the study area.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				OCT	2017	7	6					2869	2882		10.1007/s13201-017-0553-1								WOS:000413256900020

Physicochemical parameters like temperature (Tem), potential hydrogen (pH), electrical conductivity (EC), turbidity (T), dissolved oxygen (DO), total hardness (TH), calcium (Ca), chloride (Cl), fluoride (F), sulphate (SO42-), magnesium (Mg), phosphate (PO43-), sodium (Na), potassium (K), nitrite (NO2), nitrate (NO3), total dissolved solids (TDS), total carbon (TC), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were analyzed using standard procedures. The values obtained were compared with the guidelines for drinking purpose suggested by the World Health Organization and Bureau of Indian Standard. The result shows the higher concentration of nitrite in all the location which is beyond the permissible limit. Eleven parameters were selected to derive the WQI for the estimation of water potential for five sampling sites. A relative weight was assigned to each parameter range from 1.46 to 4.09 based on its importance. The WQI values range from 64 to 77 indicating that the Loktak Lake water is not fit for drinking, including both human and animals, even though the people living inside the Lake are using it for drinking purposes. The implementation of WQI is necessary for proper management of the Loktak Lake and it will be a very helpful tool for the public and decision makers to evaluate the water quality of the Loktak Lake for sustainable management.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				OCT	2017	7	6					2907	2918		10.1007/s13201-017-0579-4								WOS:000413256900022

Prominence of seasonal water quality assessment in a tropical river using multivariate analysis: Kerala, India	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												An account of seasonal water quality variability has been taken as a proxy for the changes of environmental setting occurring in the catchment areas and helps to illustrate the ecological system processes associated with it. The present study in Meenachil River (L = 78 km, A = 1272 km 2) comprising of stations from upstream to downstream for pre monsoon (PRM), monsoon (MON) and post monsoon (POM). Ca2+ and SO42- show an erratic trend while extreme deviations were observed at S6 and S7 stations. Na+, K+, Cl-, DIC and DOC showed a similar trend in most stations, i. e. (PRM[POM[ MON). Significant rise of DIC and DOC at S7 during POM and PRM could explicate changes ensued in adjacent Vembanad lake system. Strong correlations of DIC and DOC for Na+, K+ and Cl-ions were noted in the study. HCA dendrogram reveals that ion chemistry in S6 and S7 was strictly controlled by neighbouring lake water dynamics. The results demonstrate high F1 variance of 73, 68 and 72% followed by F2 comprising of 17, 19 and 21% for PRM, MON and POM, respectively. General understanding into the autochthonous process associated within the river lake interfaced region was evident from the nutrient variability scenario.					/0000-0003-1217-3286												2190-5487	2190-5495				OCT	2017	7	6					2957	2966		10.1007/s13201-017-0595-4								WOS:000413256900026

The study aimed to examine the growth of romaine lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. var. Longifolia) in aquaponic system without the addition of artificial nutrient. The nutrient relies solely on wastewater of nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) cultivation circulated continuously on the aquaponic system. The results showed that tilapia weight reached 48.49 +/- 3.92 g of T3 (tilapia, romaine lettuce, and inoculated bacteria), followed by T2 (tilapia and romaine lettuce) and T1 (tilapia) of 47.80 +/- 1.97 and 45.89 +/- 1.10 g after 35 days of experiment. Tilapia best performance in terms of growth and production occurred at T3 of 3.96 +/- 0.44 g/day, 12.10 +/- 0.63 %/day, 96.11 +/- 1.44 % and 1.60 +/- 0.07 for GR, SGR, SR, and FCR, respectively. It is also indicated by better water quality characteristic in this treatment. Romaine lettuce harvests of T2 and T3 showed no significant difference, with the final weight of 61.87 +/- 5.59 and 57.74 +/- 4.35 g. Overall, the integration of tilapia fish farming and romaine lettuce is potentially a promising aquaponic system for sustainable fish and horticulture plant production.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				OCT	2017	7	6					3055	3063		10.1007/s13201-016-0418-z								WOS:000413256900034						
J	Bora, M; Goswami, DC				Bora, Minakshi; Goswami, Dulal C.			Water quality assessment in terms of water quality index (WQI): case study of the Kolong River, Assam, India	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The Kolong River of Nagaon district, Assam has been facing serious degradation leading to its current moribund condition due to a drastic human intervention in the form of an embankment put across it near its take-off point from the Brahmaputra River in the year 1964. The blockage of the river flow was adopted as a flood control measure to protect its riparian areas, especially the Nagaon town, from flood hazard. The river, once a blooming distributary of the mighty Brahmaputra, had high navigability and rich riparian biodiversity with a well established agriculturally productive watershed. However, the present status of Kolong River is highly wretched as a consequence of the post-dam effects thus leaving it as stagnant pools of polluted water with negligible socio-economic and ecological value. The Central Pollution Control Board, in one of its report has placed the Kolong River among 275 most polluted rivers of India. Thus, this study is conducted to analyze the seasonal water quality status of the Kolong River in terms of water quality index (WQI). The WQI scores shows very poor to unsuitable quality of water samples in almost all the seven sampling sites along the Kolong River. The water quality is found to be most deteriorated during monsoon season with an average WQI value of 122.47 as compared to pre-monsoon and post-monsoon season having average WQI value of 85.73 and 80.75, respectively. Out of the seven sampling sites, Hatimura site (S1) and Nagaon Town site (S4) are observed to be the most polluted sites.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				OCT	2017	7	6					3125	3135		10.1007/s13201-016-0451-y								WOS:000413256900041

The aim of this study was to determine the groundwater suitability for drinking use based on heavy metal concentration and the associated human exposure risk in an intensively irrigated part of the Cauvery river basin, Tamil Nadu, India. Sixteen heavy metals analysed were in the order of dominance of chromium < zinc < copper < cadmium < cobalt < iron < aluminium < nickel < titanium < zirconium < boron < silver < manganese < lead < lithium < silicon in groundwater. Chromium and zinc were within permissible limits of the Bureau of Indian Standards for drinking water quality, and silver, lead and nickel were above limits in all the groundwater samples. In less than 50 % of the groundwater samples, aluminium, boron, cadmium, copper, iron and manganese exceeded their individual permissible limits. Heavy metal pollution index based on 11 heavy metals indicated that groundwater quality of this area is poor-to-unsuitable. Non-carcinogenic risk for humans due to ingestion of groundwater through drinking water pathway was very high for infants, children and adults. Silver, lead, nickel, cadmium and manganese largely contributed to the health hazard. Sources of heavy metals were identified to be geological and from human activities, i.e., application of fertilizers in agricultural fields, seawater intrusion due to intensive pumping for agriculture and wastewater from industries. Groundwater and surface water in this area pose large threat due to high levels of heavy metals, and it is necessary to avoid this water for drinking due to potential risk of health hazard. This study also demonstrated the application of HPI and human exposure hazard index to study the groundwater quality based on heavy metals' concentration.

J	Kaur, T; Bhardwaj, R; Arora, S				Kaur, Tajinder; Bhardwaj, Renu; Arora, Saroj			Assessment of groundwater quality for drinking and irrigation purposes using hydrochemical studies in Malwa region, southwestern part of Punjab, India	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Deterioration of groundwater quality due to anthropogenic activities is increasing at an alarming rate in most parts of the Punjab, but limited work has been carried out on groundwater quality and monitoring. This paper highlights the groundwater quality and compares its suitability for drinking and irrigation purpose in Malwa region, a southwestern part of Punjab. The Malwa region makes up the most cultivated area of Punjab with high consumption of pesticides and fertilizers. Twenty-four water samples representing groundwater sources were collected and analyzed for almost all major cations, anions and other physicochemical parameters. Analytical results of physicochemical analysis showed majority of the samples above the permissible limits of the Indian standards. The groundwater of the study area was very hard and the relative abundance of major cations and anions was Na+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > K+ and HCO3- > SO42- > Cl-. Fluoride content was higher than permissible limit in 75 % of the samples. The mean concentration of arsenic in groundwater was 9.37 and 11.01lg/L during summer and winter season, respectively. The parameters like sodium adsorption ratio and sodium percentage (Na%) revealed good quality of groundwater for irrigation purposes, whereas magnesium ratio and corrosivity ratio values showed that water is not suitable for agriculture and domestic use. The dominant hydrochemical facies of groundwater was Ca-Mg-HCO3 and Ca-Mg-SO4-Cl. Chloro alkaline indices 1 and 2 indicated that reverse ion exchange is dominant in the region. The samples fall in rock dominance and evaporation dominance fields as indicated by Gibbs diagram. The saturation index shows that all the water samples were supersaturated with respect to carbonate minerals. This work thus concludes that groundwater in the study area is chemically unsuitable for domestic and agricultural uses. It is recommended to carry out a continuous water quality monitoring program and development of effective management practices for utilization of water resources.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				OCT	2017	7	6					3301	3316		10.1007/s13201-016-0476-2								WOS:000413256900056						
J	Kamble, BS; Saxena, PR				Kamble, B. Soujanya; Saxena, Praveen Raj			Environmental impact of municipal dumpsite leachate on ground-water quality in Jawaharnagar, Rangareddy, Telangana, India	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The aim of the present work was to study the impact of dumpsite leachate on ground-water quality of Jawaharnagar village. Leachate and ground-water samples were investigated for various physico-chemical parameters viz., pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), total hardness (TH), calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+), sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl-), carbonates (CO32-), bicarbonates (HCO3-), nitrates (NO3-), and sulphates (SO42-) during dry and wet seasons in 2015 and were reported. The groundwater was hard to very hard in nature, and the concentrations of total dissolved solids, chlorides, and nitrates were found to be exceeding the permissible levels of WHO drinking water quality standards. Piper plots revealed that the dominant hydrochemical facies of the groundwater were of calcium chloride (CaCl2) type and alkaline earths (Ca2+ and Mg2+) exceed the alkali (Na+ and SO42-), while the strong acids (Cl -and SO42-) exceed the weak acids (CO32- and HCO3-). According to USSL diagram, all the ground-water samples belong to high salinity and low-sodium type (C3S1). Overall, the groundwater samples collected around the dumpsite were found to be polluted and are unfit for human consumption but can be used for irrigation purpose with heavy drainage and irrigation patterns to control the salinity.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				OCT	2017	7	6					3333	3343		10.1007/s13201-016-0480-6								WOS:000413256900059

The present study showed that values of temperature (T), electrical conductivity (EC), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), chloride, phosphate, sulfate, fecal coliform, Streptococcus, Salmonella spp., and Enterococci were significantly higher in the dry season compared to samples taken in the wet season. Concurrently, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), turbidity, suspended matter (SM), NH4+ presented values significantly lower in dry season than surveys in rainy season. The following parameters BOD5, COD, SO42-, Cl-, SM, Salmonella spp. did not meet the Tunisian standard NT 106 for surface water quality. Analysis of pollutant concentrations via PCA showed that the two first components accounted for 87.34 and 93.17% of the total variance for dry and rainy season sampling, respectively. The first component included T, pH, EC, SM, SO42-, Cl-, NH4+, turbidity, COD, BOD, PO43-, Enterococci, fecal coliform and streptococcus, Salmonella spp., and total bacteria. The second included DO and NO3-. Cluster analysis identified the five sampling sites into three groups in the rainy and dry season based on seasonal differences and various pollution levels caused by physicochemical and bacteriological properties. The results suggest that future monitoring can include fewer sampling sites, and stratified random sampling plans can save time and resources.

Future Scenarios Modeling of Urban Stormwater Management Response to Impacts of Climate Change and Urbanization	CLEAN-SOIL AIR WATER												Future scenarios modeling is used to investigate the effectiveness of the urban stormwater infrastructure and its response to potential future changes. The changes of urban stormwater, both in-flow quantity and water quality, in response to climate change and urbanization are examined and tested in two highly developed urban catchments using the US Environmental Protection Agency's Storm Water Management Model. Similar responses are observed in the two catchments, despite their differences in size and land use. Flow quantity and water quality appears to be more sensitive to urbanization factors than to climatic change. With respect to factors attributable to urbanization, urban intensification (land use plus population density) has more of an effect than land-use changes alone. Low-impact development, as a key adaptation measure, could be effective in mitigating the adverse impacts of future changes on urban stormwater. The methodology developed in this study may be useful for urban stormwater planning and testing such plans against future urbanization and climate change scenarios.																	1863-0650	1863-0669				OCT	2017	45	10							1700111	10.1002/clen.201700111								WOS:000412916700006

The authors made a great effort measuring 21 water quality indicators for the surface waters from 14 monitoring and sampling stations selected in the Coruh River Basin (northeastern Turkey) during a period from June 2014 to May 2015. Unfortunately, various mistakes, e.g., several misevaluated water quality indicators and a number of mistyped parts, as well as incomplete evaluation were identified with respect to the surface water quality in the Coruh River Basin, northeastern Turkey. Moreover, Bilgin and Konanc (Environ Earth Sci 75: 1029, 2016) considered the Turkish Water Pollution Control Regulation (TWPCR 2004), which was repealed as of 30.11.2012, and the Council Directive 75/440/EEC (1975), which was repealed as of 22.12.2007, to evaluate the surface water quality in the Coruh River Basin, northeastern Turkey. The mistakes were corrected, and the surface water quality was reevaluated with reference to the Turkish Regulation being in force.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				OCT	2017	76	20							700	10.1007/s12665-017-6984-z								WOS:000413674900003

Hydrogeological modelling of these data can be implemented with physically based models (i.e. MODFLOW, MT3D.). Other approaches that are simpler to implement may be a good substitute for these numerical approaches. This is the case of probabilistic approaches and especially the statistical approach neural networks. The proposed method (coupling GIS/ANN) is especially suitable for the problem of large-scale and long-term simulation. It has been applied in the spatial prediction of nitrates in the chalk aquifer in Bethune (North of France). This confined chalk aquifer in its northern part provides natural denitrification and ensures a good drinking water quality, while in its southern part this aquifer is facing a high level of nitrate concentrations far above the European Nitrates Directive standard. A good groundwater management of this ecosystems service is therefore of great importance for regional water management. Thus, the spatial distribution of nitrate concentration obtained by GIS/ANN coupling model was compared with the results obtained from the numerical modelling (MT3D) and validated by the real measurements. ANN modelling seems to be more realistic than MT3D modelling both for 2003 and 2004. This is true for both of the nitrate concentrations and their difference. So, ANN modelling's spatially distributed difference with observed data ranges from - 3.67 to + 1.24 mg/l in 2003 and - 10.8 to + 6.51 mg/l in 2004, whereas for the MT3D model, this difference ranges from - 11.5 to + 17.9 mg/l in 2003 and - 9.91 to + 16.9 mg/l in 2004. The satisfactory results of the ANN model allowed to launch prospective simulations for 2025 under two groundwater recharge scenarios: a deficit year (150 mm/year) and a rainy year (500 mm/year) show an expansion of the exploitable zone ([NO3-] < 50 mg/L) in the case of a rainy year. The results demonstrate the potential of ANN modelling of spatially distributed hydrogeological data for groundwater management of nitrate pollution. From a groundwater management point of view, the GIS/ANN modelling represents an alternative data analysis to obtain fast results using a less tedious method whose results are satisfactory.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				OCT	2017	76	19							649	10.1007/s12665-017-6990-1								WOS:000412736700005

Findings on water quality in Upper Mustang (Nepal) from a preliminary geochemical and geological survey	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The major ion and trace element chemistry of water samples, including springs, rivers and irrigation ditches, collected during a survey on August 2016 in the Upper Mustang region of the Mustang District of Dhawalagiri Zone (Nepal) has been investigated. The Upper Mustang region, a cold desert, represents a hot-spot for climate change: indeed, violent hailstorms and rainstorms have been recently observed, consequently exposing land to erosion. Results of this study indicate that waters in the region belong to the Ca-HCO3, Ca-Mg-Cl-SO4 and Na-K-Cl-types, reflecting different hydrochemical regimes. Uranium is widespread in waters, with concentrations up to 19 mu g/L recorded in a potable water supply. Locally, anoxic conditions affect uranium mobility due to the low solubility of U(IV) minerals. Highly toxic thallium was detected in a thermal spring at an elevated concentration (45 mu g/L Tl). The association of thallium with high concentrations of iron suggests that these elements are derived from pyrite oxidation. Detectable levels of thallium were also measured in the water of an irrigation ditch. Lithium concentrations ranged from 7 mu g/L to 12 mg/L in the thermal water and showed a strong association with chloride ions. Arsenic concentrations up to 4.7 mu g/L were measured in tributaries of the Kali Gandaki river. The data provide evidence that solutes in water have originated from an array of input sources, including carbonate dissolution, the dissolution of soluble salts, silicate weathering and localized sulfide oxidation. In particular, chemical weathering of granitic rocks is likely the primary source for metals and metalloids in waters. Since the erosion rate is a factor affecting lithological weathering, highintensity rainfalls due to climate change are expected to influence the release and fate of potentially harmful elements in the in the Upper Mustang Valley.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				OCT	2017	76	19							651	10.1007/s12665-017-6991-0								WOS:000412736700007

Water in Central Asia: an integrated assessment for science-based management	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Central Asia contains one of the largest internal drainage basins in the world, and its continental location results in limited availability of both surface and groundwater. Since the twentieth century, water resources of the region have been exploited beyond sustainable levels. From small Mongolian headwater streams to the mighty Aral Sea, surface waters have been partially desiccated. Demands from the agricultural, energy and raw material sectors as well as population growth have not only increased water abstractions, but also left a diverse and strong pollution footprint on rivers, lakes and groundwater bodies. Such changes in water quantity and quality have not only led to a degradation of aquatic and riparian ecosystems, but also they have placed the region's socioeconomic development at risk. Because of the complexity of Central Asia's water problems, integrated assessment and management approaches are required. Despite some shortcomings in practical implementation, the widespread adoption of the Integrated Water Resources Management and water-food-energy nexus approaches may be keys to a more sustainable future. This thematic issue aims to provide documentation of the current state of scientific knowledge, ranging from hydrological research to water quality investigations, and offers an assessment of ecosystems and the services provided by them. Reviews and case studies on different management options conclude the thematic issue by providing insights into field-tested solutions for the region's water challenges.

Experimental investigation of fine sediment deposition using particle image velocimetry	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												In order to create natural and healthy water ecosystems, the impact of hydrological processes in ponds must be identified. Pond structure may affect water quality in many ways. The present study provides a novel insight into some of the hydrological processes as well as how to employ retentions to enhance storm water detention and manage discharge. In this research, particle image velocimetry is utilized to study the two-dimensional collecting efficiency of fine sediments by retention structures with a range of hydraulic features. To examine the hydrodynamic behavior of water mixed with fine particles, a sediment basin was designed. Fluorescent polymer particles (1-50 mu m) were subsequently added to this fluid mix. This study demonstrates that gravitational force increases fine particle settlement by over 50% at greater depths. The optimum collecting efficiency of sediments at the water surface was found to be around 80%. It was also determined that flow rate and particle size are directly correlated and that inlets and outlets at higher levels impede fine particle dispersion in the water column. For these reasons, it seems that adjusting the hydraulic parameters may diminish siltation.

Spatial distribution maps of nitrate pollution for groundwater in the study area were created using a geographical information system (GIS), and the potential for contamination in the entire plain was determined. Seasonal variations of nitrate concentrations in groundwater were assessed by sampling during spring, summer, autumn, and winter in the period April 2012 to January 2013. The groundwater samples were analyzed for nitrate (NO3). The results obtained were evaluated using a number of national and international standards and classifications. Seasonal average concentration distribution maps were established for nitrate to determine the extent and severity of contamination by this parameter in groundwater in the region. The monitoring indicated that nitrate concentrations in only two wells exceeded the recommended drinking water limit and that groundwater beneath the basin is currently suitable for irrigation.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				OCT	2017	76	20							698	10.1007/s12665-017-7044-4								WOS:000413674900001

A continuous consumption of polluted water as drinking water or for culinary purposes is by no means a minor hazard for people's health that must be studied. This research presents a new methodology for the spatial analysis of health risk rate from intake of nitratepolluted groundwater. The method is illustrated through its application to a water quality sampling campaign performed in the south of Spain in 2003. The probability risk model used by the US Environmental Protection Agency has been applied, considering a residential intake framework and three representative population age groups (10, 40 and 65 years). The method was based upon coupling Monte Carlo simulations and geostatistics, which allowed mapping of the health risk coefficient (RC). The maps obtained were interpreted in the framework of water resources management and user's health protection (municipalities). The results showed waterborne health risk caused by nitrate-polluted water is moderately low for the region. The observed risk was larger for the elderly and children, although no significant differences were found among the three age groups (RC average values of 95th percentile for age of 0.37, 0.33 and 0.37, respectively). Significant risk values of RC[ 1 were obtained for 10 % of the surface in the NW site of the study area, where the municipalities with the highest contamination thresholds are located (agricultural activity). Nitrate concentration and intake rate stood out as the main explanatory variables of the RC.

Twenty-nine borehole water samples were collected in the dry season (July/August 2012) and another 27 samples from the same localities in the wet season (March 2013) from the study area. The samples were analysed for trace elements arsenic (As), cadmium(Cd), chromium(Cr), selenium (Se), and lead (Pb) using the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry technique. The average concentrations of As, Cd, Cr, Se, and Pb were 11.3, 0.3, 33.1, 7.1, and 6.0 lg/L in the dry season and 11.0, 0.3, 28.3, 4.2, and 6.6 mu lg/L in the wet season, respectively. There was evidence of seasonal fluctuations in concentrations of all analysed elements except for As, though Cd and Pb displayed low concentrations (<0.2 and <6.0 mu g/L, respectively) in almost all sampled boreholes. Se and Cr concentrations slightly exceed the South African National Standard permissible limits for safe drinking water in few boreholes. A total of four boreholes exceeded the water quality guideline for As with two of these boreholes containing five times more As than the prescribed limit. The spatial distribution patterns of elevated As closely correlate with the underlying geology. The findings of this investigation have important implications for human health of the communities drinking from the affected boreholes.																	0269-4042	1573-2983				OCT	2017	39	5					1201	1219		10.1007/s10653-016-9887-0								WOS:000413749200017	27744552					
J	Rajib, A; Merwade, V				Rajib, Adnan; Merwade, Venkatesh			Hydrologic response to future land use change in the Upper Mississippi River Basin by the end of 21st century	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												This study demonstrates the spatial variation in hydrologic processes across the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB) by the end of 21st century, by ingesting FOREcasting Scenarios (FORE-SCE) of Land-use Change projections into a physics-based hydrologic model-Soil and Water Assessment Tool. The model is created for UMRB (440,000 km(2)), using the National Landcover Database of year 2001 and climate data of 1991-2010. Considering 1991-2010 as the baseline reference period, FORE-SCE projections of year 2091 under three scenarios (A1B, A2, and B1 from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) are separately assimilated into the calibrated model, whereas climate input is kept the same as in the baseline. Modeling results suggest an increase of 0.5% and 3.5% in the average annual streamflow at the basin outlet (Grafton, Illinois) during 2081-2100, respectively, for A1B and A2, whereas for B1, streamflow would decrease by 1.5%. Under the "worst case" A2 scenario, 6% and 133% increase, respectively, in agricultural and urban areas with 30% depletion of forest and grassland would result into 70% increase in surface runoff, 20% decrease in soil moisture, and 4% decrease in evapotranspiration in certain parts of the basin. Conversion of cropland, forest, or grassland to perennial hay/pasture areas would lower surface runoff by 25% especially in the central region, whereas persistent forest cover in the northern region would cause up to 7% increase in evapotranspiration. The ecosystem in the lower half of UMRB is likely to become adverse, as dictated by a composite water-energy balance indicator. Future land use change extents and resultant hydrologic responses are found significantly different under A2, A1B, and B1 scenarios, which resonates the need for multi-scenario ensemble assessments towards characterizing a probable future. The spatial variation of hydrologic processes as shown here helps to identify potential "hot spots," giving ways to adopt more effective policy alternatives at regional level.

The balance between oxygen supply and consuming in the water body is significantly influenced by physical and chemical parameters. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the performance of multiple linear regression (MLR), back propagation neural network (BPNN), and support vector machine (SVM) for the prediction of DO concentration based on multiple water quality parameters. The data set included 969 samples collected from rivers in China and the 16 predicted variables involved physical factors, nutrients, organic substances, and metal ions, which would affect the DO concentrations directly or indirectly by influencing the water-air exchange, the growth of water plants, and the lives of aquatic animals. The models optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm were calibrated and tested, with nearly 80% and 20% data, respectively. The results showed that the PSO-BPNN and PSO-SVM had better predicted performances than linear regression methods. All of the evaluated criteria, including coefficient of determination, mean squared error, and absolute relative errors suggested that the PSO-SVM model was superior to the MLR and PSO-BPNN for DO prediction in the rivers of China with limited knowledge of other information.																	1998-9563	2224-7955				OCT	2017	48	5					1214	1225		10.2166/nh.2016.149								WOS:000412412500004

Here, a new semi-analytical saturated-unsaturated flow and transport model is coupled to a kinetic sorption algorithm to assess the impact of changes in the subsurface permeability architecture and flow rate on sorption characteristics. The model outputs reveal the pronounced effect of the rate of vertical decline in K-s on the frequency of occurrence and spatial distribution of subsurface sorption as well as the timing and rate of sorbing contaminants discharged into stream. Sorption potential is weakened with infiltration rate. The impact of infiltration rate on the decline in sorption potential becomes more accentuated as the degree of subsurface vertical heterogeneity in saturated hydraulic conductivity increases. Porosity pattern also impacts sorption characteristics; but its effects highly depend upon the degree of vertical heterogeneity in Ks. The results and methodology presented in this paper have potential implications for assessing water quality in integrated groundwater-surface water systems as well as designing remediation systems.																	1998-9563	2224-7955				OCT	2017	48	5					1226	1239		10.2166/nh.2016.170								WOS:000412412500005

In this study, the impact of climate change and land-use change on the presence of faecal indicator bacteria in freshwater was evaluated, through the use of a recently-developed catchment-scale pathogen model. The River Conwy in Wales has been used as a case-study, because of the large presence of livestock in the catchment and the importance of the shellfish harvesting activities in its estuary. The INCA-Pathogens catchment model has been calibrated through the use of a Monte Carlo -based technique, based on faecal indicator bacteria measurements, and then driven by an ensemble of climate projections obtained from the HadRM3-PPE model (Future Flow Climate) plus four land-use scenarios (current land use, managed ecosystem, abandonment and agricultural intensification). The results show that climate change is not expected to have a very large impact on average river flow, although it might alter its seasonality. The abundance of faecal indicator bacteria is expected to decrease in response to climate change, especially during the summer months, due to reduced precipitation, causing reduced runoff, and increased temperature, which enhances the bacterial die-off processes. Land-use change can also have a potentially large impact on pathogens. The "managed ecosystems" scenario proposed in this study can cause a reduction of 15% in average water faecal indicator bacteria and up to 30% in the 90th percentile of water faecal indicator bacteria, mainly due to the conversion of pasture land into grassland and the expansion of forest land. This study provides an example of how to assess the impacts of human interventions on the landscape, and what may be the extent of their effects, for other catchments where the human use of the natural resources in the uplands can jeopardise the use of natural resources downstream.

A Bayesian-based multilevel factorial analysis method for analyzing parameter uncertainty of hydrological model	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												In this study, a Bayesian-based multilevel factorial analysis (BMFA) method is developed to assess parameter uncertainties and their effects on hydrological model responses. In BMFA, Differential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis (DREAM) algorithm is employed to approximate the posterior distributions of model parameters with Bayesian inference; factorial analysis (FA) technique is used for measuring the specific variations of hydrological responses in terms of posterior distributions to investigate the individual and interactive effects of parameters on model outputs. BMFA is then applied to a case study of the Jinghe River watershed in the Loess Plateau of China to display its validity and applicability. The uncertainties of four sensitive parameters, including soil conservation service runoff curve number to moisture condition II (CN2), soil hydraulic conductivity (SOL_K), plant available water capacity (SOL_AWC), and soil depth (SOL_Z), are investigated. Results reveal that (i) CN2 has positive effect on peak flow, implying that the concentrated rainfall during rainy season can cause infiltration-excess surface flow, which is an considerable contributor to peak flow in this watershed; (ii) SOL_K has positive effect on average flow, implying that the widely distributed cambisols can lead to medium percolation capacity; (iii) the interaction between SOLAWC and SOL_Z has noticeable effect on the peak flow and their effects are dependent upon each other, which discloses that soil depth can significant influence the processes of plant uptake of soil water in this watershed. Based on the above findings, the significant parameters and the relationship among uncertain parameters can be specified, such that hydrological model's capability for simulating/predicting water resources of the Jinghe River watershed can be improved.

Retention performance of green roofs in representative climates worldwide	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The ongoing process of global urbanization contributes to an increase in stormwater runoff from impervious surfaces, threatening also water quality. Green roofs have been proved to be innovative stormwater management measures to partially restore natural states, enhancing interception, infiltration and evapotranspiration fluxes. The amount of water that is retained within green roofs depends not only on their depth, but also on the climate, which drives the stochastic soil moisture dynamic. In this context, a simple tool for assessing performance of green roofs worldwide in terms of retained water is still missing and highly desirable for practical assessments. The aim of this work is to explore retention performance of green roofs as a function of their depth and in different climate regimes. Two soil depths are investigated, one representing the intensive configuration and another representing the extensive one. The role of the climate in driving water retention has been represented by rainfall and potential evapotranspiration dynamics. A simple conceptual weather generator has been implemented and used for stochastic simulation of daily rainfall and potential evapotranspiration. Stochastic forcing is used as an input of a simple conceptual hydrological model for estimating long-term water partitioning between rainfall, runoff and actual evapotranspiration. Coupling the stochastic weather generator with the conceptual hydrological model, we assessed the amount of rainfall diverted into evapotranspiration for different combinations of annual rainfall and potential evapotranspiration in five representative climatic regimes. Results quantified the capabilities of green roofs in retaining rainfall and consequently in reducing discharges into sewer systems at an annual time scale. The role of substrate depth has been recognized to be crucial in determining green roofs retention performance, which in general increase from extensive to intensive settings. Looking at the role of climatic conditions, namely annual rainfall, potential evapotranspiration and their seasonality cycles, we found that they drive green roofs retention performance, which are the maxima when rainfall and temperature are in phase. Finally, we provide design charts for a first approximation of possible hydrological benefits deriving from the implementation of intensive or extensive green roofs in different world areas. As an example, 25 big cities have been indicated as benchmark case studies. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												This study aimed to evaluate the influence of sub-daily precipitation time steps on model performance and hydrological components by applying the Green and Ampt infiltration method using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Precipitation was measured at a resolution of 0.1mm and aggregated to 5-, 15-, 30-, and 60-min time steps. Daily discharge data over a 10-year period were used to calibrate and validate the model. Following a global sensitivity analysis, relevant parameters were optimized through an automatic calibration procedure using SWAT-CUP for each time step. Daily performance statistics were almost equal among all four time steps (NSE approximate to 0.47). Discharge mainly consisted of groundwater flow (55%) and tile flow (42%), in reasonable proportions for the investigated catchment. In conclusion, model outputs were almost identical, showing simulations responded nearly independently of the chosen precipitation time step. This held true for (1) the selection of sensitive parameters, (2) performance statistics, (3) the shape of the hydrographs, and (4) flow components. However, a scenario analysis revealed that the precipitation time step becomes important when saturated hydraulic conductivities are low and curve numbers are high. The study suggests that there is no need in using precipitation time steps <1h for lowland catchments dominated by soils with a low surface runoff potential if daily flow values are being considered.

However, these ubiquitous assets, valued at approximately $600,000 per km(2) in a representative suburban watershed, are ideal candidates to aid in reversing such cycles of channel degradation because improving their functionality would not necessarily require property acquisition or heavy construction. The objective of this research was to develop a simple, cost-effective device that could be installed in detention basin outlets to reduce the erosive power of the relatively frequent storm events (similar to < two-year recurrence) and provide a passive bypass to maintain flood control performance during infrequent storms (such as the 100-year recurrence). Results from a pilot installation show that the Detain H2O device reduced the cumulative sediment transport capacity of the preretrofit condition by greater than 40%, and contributed to reduced flashiness and prolonged baseflows in receiving streams. When scaling the strategy across a watershed, these results suggest that potential gains in water quality and stream channel stability could be achieved at costs that are orders of magnitude less than comparable benefits from newly constructed stormwater control measures.																	1093-474X	1752-1688				OCT	2017	53	5					1032	1047		10.1111/1752-1688.12548								WOS:000412132000005

Modeling Watershed-Scale Impacts of Stormwater Management with Traditional versus Low Impact Development Design	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Stormwater runoff and associated pollutants from urban areas in the greater Chesapeake Bay Watershed (CBW) impair local streams and downstream ecosystems, despite urbanized land comprising only 7% of the CBW area. More recently, stormwater best management practices (BMPs) have been implemented in a low impact development (LID) manner to treat stormwater runoff closer to its source. This approach included the development of a novel BMP model to compare traditional and LID design, pioneering the use of comprehensively digitized storm sewer infrastructure and BMP design connectivity with spatial patterns in a geographic information system at the watershed scale. The goal was to compare total watershed pollutant removal efficiency in two study watersheds with differing spatial patterns of BMP design (traditional and LID), by quantifying the improved water quality benefit of LID BMP design. An estimate of uncertainty was included in the modeling framework by using ranges for BMP pollutant removal efficiencies that were based on the literature. Our model, using Monte Carlo analysis, predicted that the LID watershed removed approximately 78kg more nitrogen, 3kg more phosphorus, and 1,592kg more sediment per square kilometer as compared with the traditional watershed on an annual basis. Our research provides planners a valuable model to prioritize watersheds for BMP design based on model results or in optimizing BMP selection.																	1093-474X	1752-1688				OCT	2017	53	5					1081	1094		10.1111/1752-1688.12559								WOS:000412132000008

Designing and Implementing a Network for Sensing Water Quality and Hydrology across Mountain to Urban Transitions	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Water resources are increasingly impacted by growing human populations, land use, and climate changes, and complex interactions among biophysical processes. In an effort to better understand these factors in semiarid northern Utah, United States, we created a real-time observatory consisting of sensors deployed at aquatic and terrestrial stations to monitor water quality, water inputs, and outputs along mountain to urban gradients. The Gradients Along Mountain to Urban Transitions (GAMUT) monitoring network spans three watersheds with similar climates and streams fed by mountain winter-derived precipitation, but that differ in urbanization level, land use, and biophysical characteristics. The aquatic monitoring stations in the GAMUT network include sensors to measure chemical (dissolved oxygen, specific conductance, pH, nitrate, and dissolved organic matter), physical (stage, temperature, and turbidity), and biological components (chlorophyll-a and phycocyanin). We present the logistics of designing, implementing, and maintaining the network; quality assurance and control of numerous, large datasets; and data acquisition, dissemination, and visualization. Data from GAMUT reveal spatial differences in water quality due to urbanization and built infrastructure; capture rapid temporal changes in water quality due to anthropogenic activity; and identify changes in biological structure, each of which are demonstrated via case study datasets.																	1093-474X	1752-1688				OCT	2017	53	5					1095	1120		10.1111/1752-1688.12557								WOS:000412132000009

As a result, most models are calibrated and, if possible, validated using limited measured data. However, little research has been done to determine the impact of length of available calibration data on model parameterization and performance. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of length of calibration data (LCD) on parameterization and performance of the Agricultural Policy Environmental eXtender model for predicting daily, monthly, and annual streamflow. Long-term (1984-2015) measured daily streamflow data from Rock Creek watershed, an agricultural watershed in northern Ohio, were used for this study. Data were divided into five Short (5-year), two Medium (15-year), and one Long (25-year) streamflow calibration data scenarios. All LCD scenarios were calibrated and validated at three time steps: daily, monthly, and annual. Results showed LCD affected the ability of the model to accurately capture temporal variability in simulated streamflow. However, overall average streamflow, water budgets, and crop yields were simulated reasonably well for all LCD scenarios.																	1093-474X	1752-1688				OCT	2017	53	5					1164	1177		10.1111/1752-1688.12564								WOS:000412132000013

Lessons from Virginia Water Quality Trading Programs	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Governmental agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and agricultural organizations promote water quality trading programs as an innovative policy to engage agricultural producers in conservation activities. Cost analyses suggest regulated sources can reduce compliance costs by purchasing agricultural nonpoint source credits. Yet, such point-nonpoint trades are rare. This article assesses the demand for agricultural nonpoint sources in well-developed nutrient trading programs in Virginia for industrial and municipal wastewater treatment plants, municipal stormwater programs, and land developers. Evidence suggests nutrient trading programs in Virginia will not stimulate investments in pollutant reduction practices on working agricultural lands. The lack of demand for agricultural nonpoint source credits can be attributed to a substantial degree to the design features and incentives present in multiple overlapping regulatory programs. The legal setting that dampens regulated source demand for nonpoint source credits in Virginia is broadly representative of conditions found elsewhere in the United States.																	1093-474X	1752-1688				OCT	2017	53	5					1178	1194		10.1111/1752-1688.12565								WOS:000412132000014

Water Quality Signals from Rural Land Use and Exurbanization in a Mountain Landscape: What's Clear and What's Confounded?	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												In mountainous landscapes with high climatic and geomorphic variability, how do rural land uses and exurbanization alter hydrology and water quality? We evaluated effects of rural land use and exurbanization on streamflows, suspended sediment concentrations and loads, specific conductance, and summer water temperatures in 12 streams and rivers within the Upper Little Tennessee River basin in the southern Appalachian Mountains. Eleven streams featured low levels of development (>61% forest cover) but differed in land use patterning, basin size, annual precipitation, and watershed morphology. One urban stream, located within the largest town in the basin, provided the high development comparative endpoint. Even low levels of rural development and exurbanization were associated with substantial increases in suspended sediment concentrations, sediment loads, and summer stream temperature daily maxima and diurnal variation. Observed summer temperature increases were much larger than would be expected due to global climate change over the next century. Specific conductance was idiosyncratic among the smaller streams. These water quality changes were not accompanied by streamflow changes that were discernible amid the high natural variation in precipitation and geomorphology. The water quality findings suggest the need for applying the best management practices, including riparian buffers, to even low levels of rural development.																	1093-474X	1752-1688				OCT	2017	53	5					1212	1228		10.1111/1752-1688.12567								WOS:000412132000016

Unfortunately, there are few publicly available data sources at the local level and even fewer at the national scale. In this research, randomly selected points within agricultural lands were examined for selected conservation practices using Google Earth aerial imagery by a team of interpreters. In total, 13,530 points had field boundaries digitized, and were subsequently examined and classified. The presence of terraces, grassed waterways, contour farming, center pivot irrigation, strip cropping, ponds, riparian vegetation, filter strips, and land cover were noted. Subjectivity among interpreters was evaluated using duplicate samples and was found to be similar to image misclassification rates in other research. Conservation practice adoption rates for selected major river basins compared favorably with data collected by the Conservation Effects Assessment Project. The frequency of occurrence of each conservation practice was summarized and presented by ecoregion. To facilitate future research, point level data and software source code developed in this research are available via the web at . Aerial imagery was found to be a powerful, inexpensive, and easily accessible tool to assess large-scale conservation practice implementation for certain conservation practices.

Development of recreational water spray ground design regulations in New York State, an engineering approach	JOURNAL OF WATER AND HEALTH												The New York State Department of Health developed regulations for the design and operation of spray grounds to address the potential for recreational water illnesses associated with this type of venue. The water treatment component of the new regulation was based on a first-principles approach to address the unique challenges of spray grounds. The regulation departs from traditional recreational water treatment methods by requiring a novel filtration approach and the installation of UV disinfection. The water treatment system was also required to incorporate automatic control systems to ensure the water quality is maintained with a minimum of operator involvement. The treatment process specifications were based on pathogen and contaminant loadings that are likely to be encountered at spray grounds. The regulation was finalized in 2007, giving New York State a reliable means of protecting the health of spray ground patrons.																	1477-8920					OCT	2017	15	5					718	728		10.2166/wh.2017.032								WOS:000413113900005	29040075

The purpose of this study was to explore techniques for describing microbial water quality in rural drinking water wells, based on spatiotemporal analysis, time series analysis and relative risk mapping. Tests results for Escherichia coli and coliforms from private and small public well water samples, collected between 2004 and 2012 in Alberta, Canada, were used for the analysis. Overall, 14.6 and 1.5% of the wells were total coliform and E. coli-positive, respectively. Private well samples were more often total coliform or E. coli-positive compared with untreated public well samples. Using relative risk mapping we were able to identify areas of higher risk for bacterial contamination of groundwater in the province not previously identified. Incorporation of time series analysis demonstrated peak contamination occurring for E. coli in July and a later peak for total coliforms in September, suggesting a temporal dissociation between these indicators in terms of groundwater quality, and highlighting the potential need to increase monitoring during certain periods of the year.

Impacts of the Mississippi River spillway opening on faecal coliform concentration in Lake Pontchartrain	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												This study focuses on explaining the role of the periodic opening of the Bonnet Carre Spillway on the faecal coliform levels in Lake Pontchartrain. Water quality data were collected by the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation to analyse the faecal coliform bacteria levels, turbidity, salinity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen in the lake water. The results show that the faecal coliform concentrations were lower during the spillway opening than the preceding and subsequent months. Statistical analysis shows the dilution effect, characterized by an effective reduction in faecal coliform concentrations due to increase in water turbidity, coupled with decrease in water salinity and dissolved oxygen because of spillway opening. It is also indicated that the combine effect of more than one factor produces a significantly greater reduction in the faecal coliform than each factor acting independently. Periodic spikes in faecal coliform concentrations were observed at sampling points located near the outlets of streams and drainage canals with high settlement densities. A positive correlation (r=0.78467) was found between the average faecal coliform counts and average monthly precipitations, highlighting the role of precipitation run-offs. The results of this study indicate that the spillway opening contributed to a reduction in the faecal coliform concentration in the lake's surface water during the studied periods.																	1535-1459	1535-1467				OCT	2017	33	8					1327	1335		10.1002/rra.3179								WOS:000412518100010

Quantifying streambank movement and topography using unmanned aircraft system photogrammetry with comparison to terrestrial laser scanning	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Streambank movement is an integral part of geomorphic changes along river corridors and affects a range of physical, ecological, and socio-economic systems including aquatic habitat, water quality, and infrastructure. Various methods have been used to quantify streambank erosion, including bank pins, ground surveys, lidar, and analytical models, however, due to high-cost or labour intensive fieldwork these are typically feasible or appropriate only for site-specific studies. Advancements in unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and photogrammetry provide opportunities for more rapid and economical quantification of streambank erosion and deposition at variable scales. This work assesses the performance of UAS-based photogrammetry for capturing topography of streambank surfaces and quantifying bank movement. UAS data are compared to terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) and GPS surveying from streambank sites located in Vermont that featured a variety of bank conditions and vegetation. Cross-sectional analysis of data from UAS and TLS revealed that the UAS reliably captured the bank surface within 0.2m of TLS and GPS surveys across all sites during leaf-off conditions. Mean error between UAS and TLS was only 0.11m in early spring conditions. Dense summer vegetation resulted in decreased accuracy and was a limiting factor in the ability of the UAS to capture the ground surface. At areas with observed bank movement, the change in cross-sectional area estimated using UAS data compared reliably to TLS survey for net cross-sectional changes greater than 3.5m(2), given a 10% error tolerance. At locations with smaller changes, error increased due to the effect of vegetation, georeferencing, and overhanging bank profiles. UAS-based photogrammetry shows significant promise for capturing bank topography and movement at fine resolutions in a flexible and efficient manner.

Initially, for step change, modified-Pettitt test is applied in two ways. First, using the corrected and unbiased trend-free-pre-whitening (TFPWcu) approach. Second, using a new approach in which time series is modelled by intervention analysis for modified Pettitt test. Subsequently, for monotonic trends, Mann-Kendall (MK) and six approaches of modified Mann-Kendall (MMK) test are applied to NCDC data for period 1901-2012 and its sub-periods. Approaches of MMK include pre-whitening (PW), trend-free-pre-whitening (TFPW), TFPWcu, two Variance Correction Approaches (VCAs) based on empirical formula (VCA:CF1) and Monte-Carlo-Simulations (VCA:CF2) and long term persistence (MK-LTP). A single change point is identified in 1970 for annual and monsoon rainfall from original and modified-Pettitt's test using TFPWcu, while time series modelling approach has not exhibited any change point. Process shift in rainfall series is also studied using CUSUM and multiple change points are identified using Segment-Neighbourhood method. Outcomes of MMK show that TFPWcu is able to efficiently limit the effect of autocorrelation and may be preferred over PW and TFPW. The VCA:CF2 is not dependent on whole autocorrelation structure and corrects variance of all data series using lag-1 autocorrelation and may be preferred over VCA:CF1. MK-LTP considers long term persistence and it has exhibited presence of weaker trends than exhibited by other approaches. VCA:CF2 and MK-LTP are used to study trends of rainfall in Dehradun.																	1436-3240	1436-3259				OCT	2017	31	8					2075	2096		10.1007/s00477-016-1347-y								WOS:000413233000012

A Modeling System for Monitoring Water Quality in Lagoons	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Regular monitoring of key water quality parameters is important for assessing the hydrological status of a lagoon and its management activities. In this study, a new cost-effective technique based on the geoecological information-modeling system (GIMS) is implemented employing the combined use of simulation experiments and in-field observations to investigate the problem of optimizing water quality monitoring of a lagoon. The GIMS is accompanied by 39 elements selected in 8 management systems and 31 functional elements, which are described in detail. It is shown that the combined use of model and field observations allows reliable recording of lagoon water quality and optimization of the monitoring regime. Finally, simulation experiments are presented, demonstrating the fidelity of the proposed modeling system to optimize water quality control through regular in-field measurements and simulations.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				OCT	2017	228	10							397	10.1007/s11270-017-3581-4								WOS:000413334900022

Evaluation of Water Quality for Sustainable Agriculture in Bangladesh	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Sustainable groundwater quality has become a major concern for the agro-based country like Bangladesh. Integrated approaches of various irrigation water quality indices and geostatistical modeling were applied to evaluate the suitability and for spatial mapping of groundwater quality of Faridpur District in central Bangladesh. The irrigation water quality index (IWQI) revealed that majority of the samples were suitable for irrigation. Similar outcomes were recorded from other indices including Na%, sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), residual sodium bicarbonate (RSBC), total hardness (TH), Kelley's ratio (KR), and magnesium adsorption ratio (MAR). Classifications based on Wilcox diagram and permeability index (PI) plot indicated a similar conclusion wherein almost all the samples were safe for agricultural uses without posing considerable effect on the soil fertility and overall crop yield. Principal component analysis (PCA) grouped the major cations and anions into three principal components including dissolution of calcite minerals, leaching of silicate sediments, and ion exchange process. Spatial mapping of IWQI identified that groundwater in the northern side of Faridpur region were more suitable for irrigational uses relative to central and southern side, possibly due to gradients of domestic discharges and agricultural activates from north to south side. These findings would provide useful information to water distributors, managers, and decision makers for taking adaptive measures in irrigation water quality management systems.

During snowmelt or precipitation events, water runoff carries nutrients into nearby streams and impairs the water quality. There is a need, therefore, to identify improved management of manure application in the soils. This study was conducted to assess water quality impacts associated following manure application during winter months when soil is completely covered with snow. The study site included three watersheds, named south (SW), east (CW), and north (NW) managed with a corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean (Glycine max L.) rotation located in South Dakota. The SW and NW were used as treatment, and CW as the control watershed. The treatments included manure application on the upper half of the SW and lower half of the NW, and CW received no manure application. This study showed that manure improved soil properties including infiltration rate and organic matter. Nitrogen and phosphorus losses in the surface runoff were higher from NW compared to that of SW. The CW had similar nutrient losses compared to the NW with slight differences. It can be concluded that maintaining a setback distance can help in improving the environmental quality as well as managing the agricultural wastes during the winter months.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				OCT	2017	228	10							389	10.1007/s11270-017-3572-5								WOS:000413334900015

The aim of this paper was the assessment of the ecological status of water quality and calculating water pollution index (WPI) of the Danube River in Serbia. For all surface waters, the WFD requires "good ecological status," i.e., low level changes of the natural state that occur as a result of human activities by 2015. The assessment was based on the data obtained from ten hydrological measuring stations on the Danube River in Serbia for 2014. It was ascertained that the ecological status of the Danube River water quality was class III, corresponding to "moderate ecological status" and deviating from the required "good ecological status." According to the calculated WPI = 1.352, the water pollution of the Danube River in Serbia was characterized as moderately polluted and corresponded to class III of surface water. The ecosystem approach clearly indicated that the concentration of physico-chemical parameters of the watercourse deviated from the target values. Therefore, there is an urgent need to take some measures to prevent pollution and improve the water quality of the Danube River as an integral part of the environment in Serbia.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				OCT	2017	228	10							380	10.1007/s11270-017-3551-x								WOS:000413334900004

Analysis of mine water from four decommissioned pits in south-western Ghana - implications for remediation programmes for mine closure	WATER POLICY												Research into water quality status of accumulated water in decommissioned pits is a grey area in Ghana and could be of significant benefit in the effectiveness of remediation of pits after mining. Water sampled from four decommissioned pits in Amansie West District were analysed for their water quality status. Seasonal variations of physico-chemical parameters for determining water quality were reported as well as their average values. In general, the ion concentrations varied from season to season but were within World Health Organization (WHO) maximum permissible limits (MPL) with the exception of boron. Similar observation was made for heavy metals/trace elements analysed, with the exception of As and Fe. Seasonal and average concentrations of As were higher than the WHO MPL. Similarly, the mid-season concentration of Fe recorded from a water sample collected from one pit was higher than WHO limits. Turbidity levels were significantly higher in two pits. The studies revealed that some parameters for water quality determination were above WHO acceptable limits for potable water, an indication that the effect of mining on water quality from water bodies investigated persisted after mine closure. Hence remediation programmes should be broadened to include effective reclamation of mine water accumulated in pits during mine closure.																	1366-7017					OCT	2017	19	5					957	977		10.2166/wp.2017.123								WOS:000412832300009

Optimization of hydrometric monitoring network in urban drainage systems using information theory	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Regular and continuous monitoring of urban runoff in both quality and quantity aspects is of great importance for controlling and managing surface runoff. Due to the considerable costs of establishing new gauges, optimization of the monitoring network is essential. This research proposes an approach for site selection of new discharge stations in urban areas, based on entropy theory in conjunction with multi-objective optimization tools and numerical models. The modeling framework provides an optimal trade-off between the maximum possible information content and the minimum shared information among stations. This approach was applied to the main surface-water collection system in Tehran to determine new optimal monitoring points under the cost considerations. Experimental results on this drainage network show that the obtained cost-effective designs noticeably outperform the consulting engineers' proposal in terms of both information contents and shared information. The research also determined the highly frequent sites at the Pareto front which might be important for decision makers to give a priority for gauge installation on those locations of the network.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				OCT	2017	76	7					1603	1613		10.2166/wst.2017.226								WOS:000412778000002	28991778

To illustrate the applicability of ANFIS method, the upstream catchment of Feitsui Reservoir in Taiwan is chosen as the case study area. The appropriate input variables used to develop the ANFIS models are determined based on the t-test. The results obtained by ANFIS are compared with those by multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural networks (ANNs). Simulated results show that the identified ANFIS model is superior to the traditional MLR and nonlinear ANNs models in terms of the performance evaluated by the Pearson coefficient of correlation, the root mean square error, the mean absolute percentage, and the mean absolute error. These results indicate that ANFIS models are more suitable than ANNs or MLR models to predict the nonlinear relationship within the variables caused by the complexity of aquatic systems and to produce the best fit of the measured BOD concentrations. ANFIS can be seen as a powerful predictive alternative to traditional water quality modeling techniques and extended to other areas to improve the understanding of river pollution trends.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				OCT	2017	76	7					1739	1753		10.2166/wst.2017.359								WOS:000412778000014	28991790

We found that organic matter is the main pollution source of Yitong River and its tributaries. A black-odor evaluation model that can describe the pollution of the Yitong River water system was developed, and this model has the parameters I = 0.21 [CODCr] + 0.18 [DO] - 0.36[NH3-N] + 0.91. The model performance was satisfactory with a black-odor defining accuracy of 69%. Moreover, we found that CODCr, NH3-N, and DO are the influential factors of the Yitong River black-odor water body and that their threshold values when the water body transitioned to black odor were 109.2, 1.90, and 7.50 mg.L-1, respectively. We found that most of the Yitong River was polluted by six heavy metals, namely, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn. We used the Nemerow method to calculate the heavy metal pollution degree of each sampling point and found that 60% of the points were seriously polluted. Furthermore, we drew the heavy metal pollution distribution map of the Yitong River. Finally, we proposed an effective measure called new-type multistep constructed wetland to improve the water quality of Yitong River.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				OCT	2017	76	8					2051	2064		10.2166/wst.2017.372								WOS:000413666500011	29068335

To that end, nine water quality parameters [pH, turbidity (TURB), temperature (T), dissolved oxygen (DO), nitrate (NO3), total solids (TS), phosphate (PO4), biological oxygen demand (BOD5), and fecal coliforms (FC)] were analyzed at eight selected stations. According to the proposed classification for water quality indices (higher value (0-100), better water quality), the Wetland water quality was classified as the mean values of the three indices for the three sampled years, as follows: NSFWQI(a) (13.72, 12.81, 12.07); NSFWQI(m) (63.049, 52.388, 49.108); and OWQI (26.867, 14.477, 15.53). The values of NSFWQI(a), NSFWQI(m), and OWQI for the western stations were better than for the other stations in the region over the 29-year span of investigation; however, the remainders of the stations' values were very poor. Because wastewaters discharged from industrial and agricultural areas are more concentrated in the eastern part of the Anzali Wetland, the eastern stations of the Wetland showed lower water quality compared to the central and western stations. The water of the Anzali Wetland has different quality classes according to the aggregation methods employed. It is concluded that when evaluating water quality of aquatic ecosystems, several indices should be used to obtain more comprehensive results.

Previous research in Indiana and Ohio has shown that two-stage ditches offer the potential to reduce sediment load and extend the interaction time between water, bench vegetation, and bench soil allowing larger uptake of nutrients by the vegetation and increasing the denitrification rates. A two-stage ditch was constructed that drains an area of approximately 267 ha of farmland used for corn and soybean production. Discharge, nitrate-N (NO3), total phosphorus (TP), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and total suspended sediment (TSS) were monitored in the two-stage ditch and a control reach immediately upstream. The two-stage ditch was found to significantly decrease TP, SRP and TSS concentrations and loads. Although the two stage ditch decreased NO3 concentrations significantly, it did not have a significant impact on NO3 loads. More specifically, the two-stage ditch reduced the loads of TP by 40%, SRP by 11% and TSS by 22-40% depending on the stage of vegetation establishment on its floodplain benches, compared to an increase in load of 78%, 2% and 1%, respectively in the control reach.

Dissolved organic carbon loading from the field to watershed scale in tile-drained landscapes	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Subsurface tile drains influence watershed fluxes of nitrogen, phosphorus, and pesticides, but few studies have examined the role of subsurface tile drains and drainage water management practices on watershed dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export. The objective of this study was therefore to quantify the contribution of subsurface tile drains to watershed DOC export and to evaluate the effect of drainage water management of DOC concentrations and loads in tile-drained fields. Discharge and DOC concentration were measured at the outlet of an agricultural headwater watershed (3.9 km(2)) in Ohio, USA and all of the subsurface tile drains (6 total) within the watershed over an 8-year period. Results showed that DOC concentration in both subsurface tile drains and stream water were highly variable (0.1-44.4 mg L-1), with mean DOC concentrations ranging from 5.7 to 8.2 mg L-1. Intra-annual variability in subsurface tile drain and watershed hydrology yielded seasonal differences in DOC loading. Over the study period, 81.7% and 92.4% of watershed and subsurface tile drain DOC loading, respectively, occurred during 20% of the time, typically during winter and spring high flow events. Mean annual DOC loading from the drainage network was 19.6 kg ha(-1), while mean annual DOC loading at the watershed outlet was 43.9 kg ha(-1). On average, subsurface tile drainage comprised 33% of monthly watershed DOC export (<1-82%). Implementing drainage water management at one of the subsurface tile drains decreased discharge (179 mm; 22%) and DOC loading (6.8 kg ha(-1); 26%) compared to an adjacent free draining subsurface tile drain. Findings from this study demonstrate the utility of simultaneously monitoring solute fluxes from both field and watershed scales, and indicate that subsurface tile drains are a significant source of DOC to headwater agricultural streams. Further, results suggest that drainage water management can significantly decrease DOC losses from tile-drained fields.

In this study, the impacts of land use change from cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) to perennial grasses in the Double Mountain Fork Brazos watershed in the Texas High Plains were assessed using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). While switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) was assumed to replace cotton in irrigated areas, dryland cotton was replaced by Miscanthus x giganteus under the hypothetical land use change scenarios. Climate change impacts were assessed based on the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate projections of 19 General Circulation Models (GCMs) under two Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) emission scenarios of RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 during two 30-year periods of middle (2040-2069) and end (2070-2099) of the 21st century. Median irrigation water use of cotton was simulated to decrease by 41%-61% in the future when compared to historic (1994-2009) period based on projections by 19 GCMs. Under the future climate change scenarios, when compared to cotton, median annual irrigation water use by switchgrass reduced by 62%-89%. Simulated future median total nitrogen load decreased by 30%-40% under perennial grasses when compared to future cotton land use. The median irrigated switchgrass yield decreased by 16%-28%, but the median dryland Miscanthus yield increased by 32%-38% under the future climate change scenarios. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Using C-13 isotopic analysis to assess soil carbon pools associated with tile drainage management during drier and wetter growing seasons	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Controlled tile drainage (CTD) is an agricultural management practice with well-documented water quality and agronomic benefits. However, due to field water drainage abatement effects, the practice could potentially impact soil respiration. The delta C-13 of soil gas samples were analyzed from silt loam CTD and uncontrolled tile drained (UTD) fields cropped with corn, soybean, and forage to test whether CTD affects total soil respiration (RT) through altering residue decomposition and/or gas transport. We also examined whether CTD imparted an over tile (OT) and between tile (BT) locational effect on RT. All gas samples are from bulk rhizosphere and microbial sources; except for the forage crop measurements which included plants growing inside the sampling chamber collars. The mean values of delta C-13 for RT were not statistically different (p > 0.05) between four of the five CTD and UTD field pairs. Neither were the means of delta C-13 of RT different (p > 0.05) between OT and BT locations in four of the five CTD fields. The generalized lack of statistical differences in delta C-13 of RT observed, may have resulted from the drier and wetter seasonal conditions muting drainage management effects on surface soil water contents. The results could be used to help refine the carbon footprint of tile drainage management practices. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

This study aims at assessing the dynamics of hydrological processes and nitrate loads within inland valleys that are experiencing different land uses. To achieve this goal, an HRU-based interface (ArcSWAT2012) and a grid-based setup (SWATgrid) of the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model were applied to three headwater inland valley watersheds located in the commune of Djougou in central Benin that are characterized by different proportions of cultivated area. Satisfactory model performance was obtained from the calibration and validation of daily discharges with the values of R-2 and NSE mostly higher than 0.5, but not for nitrate loads. The annual water balance reveals that more than 60% of precipitation water is lost to evapotranspiration at all sites, amounting to 868 mm in Kounga, 741 mm in Tossahou, and 645 mm in Kpandouga. Percolation (302 mm) is important in the Kpandouga watershed which is dominated by natural vegetation at 99.7%, whereas surface runoff (105 mm) and lateral flow (92 mm) are the highest in the Kounga watershed having the highest proportion of agricultural land use (14%). In all the studied watersheds, nitrate loads are very low (not exceeding 4000 KgN per year) due to the low fertilizer application rates, and the water quality is not threatened if a standard threshold of 10 mg/I NO3-N is applied. The results achieved in this study show that SWAT can successfully be used in spatial,planning for sustainable agricultural development with limited environmental impact on water resources in inland valley landscapes.

The organic matter (OM) composition is known to significantly influence biofilm formation, but few studies on this subject have been reported. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) allows direct monitoring of biofilm development on the membrane surface without the need for membrane autopsy. The purposes of the present study are 1) to quantify biofouling formation on a membrane surface using OCT; 2) to monitor the temporal variation of OM composition during membrane formation; and 3) to investigate the variation of OM composition. Substantial variations in thickness was observed from OCT images. It demonstrates that biovolume quantified from a single 2D cross-sectional image could result in inaccurate quantification. Here, we quantified foulants on the membrane surface using 3D images and validated the results using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). As well, variations in the OM composition driven by bacterial activity were observed by fluorescence excitation emission matrix analysis and size exclusion chromatography. The biovolume estimated by the OCT system was 103.7 mu m(3)/mu m(2). CLSM demonstrated that 10% of the foulants on the membrane surface was composed of live and dead bacteria.																	0011-9164	1873-4464				OCT 1	2017	419						125	132		10.1016/j.desal.2017.06.002								WOS:000410017800013

In this study, a novel screening method for the molecular detection of Enterococcus spp. by loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is described. A set of six specific LAMP primers was designed to amplify a diagnostic fragment of the Enterococcus 23S rRNA gene, which is present in several enterococcal species targeted by quantitative PCR (qPCR), which is the standard technique recommended by the US Environmental Protection Agency. Sensitivity and specificity tests were performed using a set of 30 Enterococcus and non-target bacterial reference strains. It is shown that LAMP is equally sensitive and even more specific than the qPCR assay. A dilution series of Enterococcus faeons DNA revealed that the LAMP method can reliably detect 130 DNA target copies per reaction within 45 min. Additionally, enterococci isolated from Austrian surface waterbodies, as well as a set of DNA extracts from environmental waters, were tested. Contingency analysis demonstrated a highly significant correlation between the results of the developed LAMP assay and the reference qPCR method. Furthermore, a simple staining procedure with a fluorescence dye demonstrated the identification of amplified products by eye. In conclusion, this method is an important component for the efficient screening and testing of water samples in low-resource settings lacking sophisticated laboratory equipment and highly trained personnel, requiring only a simple heating block.

Two pilot-scale ozonation reactors (4-5 m(3) h(-1)), a 4-chamber reactor and a tubular reactor, were investigated by either conventional ozonation and/or the advanced oxidation process (AOP) O-3/H2O2. The effects of selected operational parameters, such as ozone dose (0.5-3 mg L-1) and H2O2 dose (O-3:H2O2 = 1:3-3:1 (mass ratio)), and selected water quality parameters, such as pH (6.5-8.5) and initial bromide concentration (15 200 Lig L-1), on micropollutant abatement and bromate formation were investigated. Under the studied conditions, compounds with high second-order rate constants k03>104 M-1 s(-1) for their reaction with ozone were well abated (>90%) even for the lowest ozone dose of 0.5 mg L-1. Conversely, the abatement efficiency of sucralose, which only reacts with hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH), varied between 19 and 90%. Generally, the abatement efficiency increased with higher ozone doses and higher pH and lower bromide concentrations. H2O2 addition accelerated the ozone conversion to "OH, which enables a faster abatement of ozone-resistant micropollutants. Interestingly, the abatement of micropollutants decreased with higher bromide concentrations during conventional ozonation due to competitive ozone-consuming reactions, except for lamotrigine. due to the suspected reaction of HOBr/ORC with the primary amine moieties. In addition to the abatement of micropollutants, the evolution of the two main transformation products (TPs) of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) and tramadol (TRA), chlorothiazide (CTZ) and tramadol N oxide (TRA-NOX), respectively, was assessed by chemical analysis and kinetic modeling. Both selected TPs were quickly formed initially to reach a maximum concentration followed by a decrease of their concentrations for longer contact times. For the studied conditions, the TP's concentrations at the outlet of the reactors ranged from 0 to 61% of the initial parent compound concentration, CTZ being a more persistent TP against further oxidation than TRA-NOX. Finally, it was demonstrated in both reactors that the formation of bromate (BrOi), a potentially carcinogenic oxidation by-product, could be controlled by H2O2 addition with a general improvement on micropollutant abatement. Post-treatment by granular activated carbon (GAC) filtration enabled the reduction of micropollutants and TPs concentrations but no changes in bromate were observed. The combined algae assay showed that water quality was				McArdell, Christa/R-9710-2017	McArdell, Christa/0000-0002-5251-7541												0043-1354					OCT 1	2017	122						234	245		10.1016/j.watres.2017.05.018								WOS:000407404300024	28601791

High pesticide loadings can potentially result in polluted stream water. The objective of this study was to determine the pesticide loadings and concentrations of three typical pesticides (atrazine, oxadiazon, and isoprothiolane) in river water from a middle high latitude agricultural watershed in northern China. During this study, we evaluated the watershed pesticide loss patterns for two crop types over three decades. For this purpose, we integrated data from field investigations, laboratory experiments, and modeling simulations involving a distributed hydrological solute transport model (Soil and Water Assessment Tool, SWAT). SWAT was employed to compare the temporal spatial fate and behaviors of atrazine, oxadiazon, and isoprothiolane from 1990 to 2014 in a watershed area amounting to 141.5 km(2). The results showed that the three pesticides could be detected at different locations throughout the watershed, and isoprothiolane was detected at the maximum value of 1.082 mu g/L in surface runoff of paddy land. The temporal trend for the yearly loading of atrazine decreased slightly over time, but the trends for oxadiazon and isoprothiolane increased markedly over an 18-year analysis period. In regard to the pesticide concentrations in water, atrazine was associated with the largest value of nearly 1.4 mu g/L. July and August were the found to be prime periods for pesticide loss from paddy land, and the biggest monthly loss of atrazine from dryland appeared in June. Under similar usage conditions, isoprothiolane loading from paddy fields ranked as the largest one among the three types of pesticides and reached up to 17 g/ha. Limited monitoring data were useful for validating the model, which yielded valuable temporal-spatial data on the fate of pesticides in this watershed. With the expansion of paddy rice cultivation, risks for pesticide contamination of water bodies will increase. The results of this study should be valuable for future exposure and risk assessments aimed at protecting the environment and human health. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Winton, RS; River, M				Winton, R. Scott; River, Mark			The biogeochemical implications of massive gull flocks at landfills	WATER RESEARCH												Gulls have long been observed concentrating in flocks of tens to hundreds of thousands at the anthropogenic food sources provided by landfills. Yet, the biogeochemical implications of the landfill gull phenomenon have been largely ignored. This study has two goals: 1) to understand the magnitude and geographic extent of landfill gulls in North America, and 2) to quantify the amount of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) transported from landfills to gull roosting sites in order to understand their potential impacts on water quality and methane (CH4) emission. We synthesized and mapped data from the eBird Citizen Science database and found that 1.4 million gulls have been documented at landfills throughout North America, though the actual population is probably greater than 5 million. Using a carnivorous bird transport model we estimate that these gulls transport 39,000 to 139,000 kg of P and 240,000 to 858,000 kg of N y(-1) to neighboring water bodies and avoid roughly 1.1 to 3.9 Tg y(-1) of landfill CH4 emissions. The avoided CH4 emission mitigation is insignificant in the context of gross landfill emissions, but the transported nutrients may be relevant to water quality management at local and continental scales. For example, at the Jordan Lake reservoir in North Carolina, a flock of 49,000 Ring billed Gulls (Larus delawarensis) annually deposits landfill feces containing 1070 kg P, an amount equivalent to approximately half of total maximum daily load reduction targets and worth roughly $2.2 million USD in nutrient credits. We estimate that continent-wide gull impacts are worth at least $100 million in nutrient offset credits. We conclude that mega-flocks of landfill gulls are common and widespread, and that their capacity to transport nutrients may be contributing to the eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems and water supplies.

Information on the abundance and distribution of cyanobacteria is fundamental to support risk assessment and management activities. In the present study, an approach based on Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis was used to estimate the concentrations of chlorophyll a (Chla) and the cyanobacterial biomarker pigment phycocyanin (PC) using data from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in Lake Chaohu (China's fifth largest freshwater lake). The approach was developed and tested using fourteen years (2000-2014) of MODIS images, which showed significant spatial and temporal variability of the PC:Chla ratio, an indicator of cyanobacterial dominance. The results had unbiased RMS uncertainties of <60% for Chla ranging between 10 and 300 mu g/L, and unbiased RMS uncertainties of <65% for PC between 10 and 500 mu g/L. Further analysis showed the importance of nutrient and climate conditions for this dominance. Low TN:TP ratios (<29:1) and elevated temperatures were found to influence the seasonal shift of phytoplankton community. The resultant MODIS Chla and PC products were then used for cyanobacterial risk mapping with a decision tree classification model. The resulting Water Quality Decision Matrix (WQDM) was designed to assist authorities in the identification of possible intake areas, as well as specific months when higher frequency monitoring and more intense water treatment would be required if the location of the present intake area remained the same. Remote sensing cyanobacterial risk mapping provides a new tool for reservoir and lake management programs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Cd is a typical heavy metal leached from farmland that is related to phosphate fertilizers and carries serious environmental risk. The spatial-vertical pattern of Cd in soil and the vertical trend of Cd in the river sediment core were analyzed, which showed the migration and accumulation of Cd in the watershed. To prevent watershed Cd loss, biochar was employed, and leaching experiments were conducted to investigate the Cd loss from soil depending on the initial concentration. Four rainfall intensities, 1.25 mm/ h, 2.50 mmih, 5.00 mm/h, and 10.00 mm/h, were used to simulate typical rainfall scenarios for the study area. Biochar was prepared from corn straw after pretreatment with ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (ADP) and pyrolysis at 400 degrees C under anoxic conditions. To identify the effects of biochar amendment on Cd migration, the biochar was mixed with soil for 90 days at concentrations of 0%, 0.5%, 1.0%, 3.0%, and 5.0% soil by weight. The results showed that the Cd leaching load increased as the initial load and rainfall intensity increased and that eluviation caused surface Cd to diffuse to the deep soils. The biochar application caused more of the heavy metals to be immobilized in the amended soil rather than transported into the waterbody. The sorption efficiency of the biochar for Cd increased as the addition level increased to 3%, which showed better performance than the 5% addition level under some initial concentration and rainfall conditions. The research indicated that biochar is a potential material to prevent diffuse heavy metal pollution and that a lower addition makes the application more feasible. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Hydrological controls on DOC: nitrate resource stoichiometry in a lowland, agricultural catchment, southern UK	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The role that hydrology plays in governing the interactions between dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen in rivers draining lowland, agricultural landscapes is currently poorly understood. In light of the potential changes to the production and delivery of DOC and nitrate to rivers arising from climate change and land use management, there is a pressing need to improve our understanding of hydrological controls on DOC and nitrate dynamics in such catchments. We measured DOC and nitrate concentrations in river water of six reaches of the lowland river Hampshire Avon (Wiltshire, southern UK) in order to quantify the relationship between BFI (BFI) and DOC: nitrate molar ratios across contrasting geologies (Chalk, Greensand, and clay). We found a significant positive relationship between nitrate and BFI (p < 0.0001), and a significant negative relationship between DOC and BFI (p < 0.0001), resulting in a non-linear negative correlation between DOC: nitrate molar ratio and BFI. In the Hampshire Avon, headwater reaches which are underlain by clay and characterized by a more flashy hydrological regime are associated with DOC: nitrate ratios > 5 throughout the year, whilst groundwater-dominated reaches underlain by Chalk, with a high BFI have DOC: nitrate ratios in surface waters that are an order of magnitude lower (< 0.5). Our analysis also reveals significant seasonal variations in DOC: nitrate transport and highlights critical periods of nitrate export (e.g. winter in sub-catchments underlain by Chalk and Greensand, and autumn in drained, clay sub-catchments) when DOC: nitrate molar ratios are low, suggesting low potential for in-stream uptake of inorganic forms of nitrogen. Consequently, our study emphasizes the tight relationship between DOC and nitrate availability in agricultural catchments, and further reveals that this relationship is controlled to a great extent by the hydrological setting.

Headwater stream length dynamics across four physiographic provinces of the Appalachian Highlands	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Understanding patterns of expansion, contraction, and disconnection of headwater stream length in diverse settings is invaluable for the effective management of water resources as well as for informing research in the hydrology, ecology, and biogeochemistry of temporary streams. More accurate mapping of the stream network and quantitative measures of flow duration in the vast headwater regions facilitate implementation of water quality regulation and other policies to protect waterways. We determined the length and connectivity of the wet stream and geomorphic channel network in 3 forested catchments (<75ha) in each of 4 physiographic provinces of the Appalachian Highlands: the New England, Appalachian Plateau, Valley and Ridge, and Blue Ridge. We mapped wet stream length 7 times at each catchment to characterize flow conditions between exceedance probabilities of <5% and >90% of the mean daily discharge. Stream network dynamics reflected geologic controls at both regional and local scales. Wet stream length was most variable at two Valley and Ridge catchments on a shale scarp slope and changed the least in the Blue Ridge. The density and source area of flow origins differed between the crystalline and sedimentary physiographic provinces, as the Appalachian Plateau and Valley and Ridge had fewer origins with much larger contributing areas than New England and the Blue Ridge. However, the length and surface connectivity of the wet stream depended on local lithology, geologic structure, and the distribution of surficial deposits such as boulders, glacially derived material, and colluival debris or sediment valley fills. Several proxies indicate the magnitude of stream length dynamics, including bankfull channel width, network connectivity, the base flow index, and the ratio of geomorphic channel to wet stream length. Consideration of geologic characteristics at multiple spatial scales is imperative for future investigations of flow intermittency in headwaters.

Transcriptomic approach for assessment of the impact on microalga and macrophyte of in-situ exposure in river sites contaminated by chlor-alkali plant effluents	WATER RESEARCH												Water quality degradation is a worldwide problem, but risk evaluation of chronic pollution in-situ is still a challenge. The present study aimed to evaluate the potential of transcriptomic analyses in representative aquatic primary producers to assess the impact of environmental pollution in-situ: the microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and the macrophyte Elodea nuttallii were exposed 2 h in the Babeni Reservoir of the Olt River impacted by chlor-alkali plant effluent release resulting in increased concentrations of Hg and NaCl in receiving water. The response at the transcriptomic level was strong, resulting in up to 5485, and 8700 dysregulated genes (DG) for the microalga and for the macrophyte exposed in the most contaminated site, respectively. Transcriptomic response was congruent with the concentrations of Hg and NaCl in the water of the impacted reservoir. Genes involved in development, energy metabolism, lipid metabolism, nutrition, and RedOx homeostasis were dysregulated during in-situ exposure of both organisms. In addition, genes involved in the cell motility of C. reinhardtii and development of the cell wall of E. nuttallii were affected. DG were in line with adverse outcome pathways and transcriptomic studies reported after exposure to high concentrations of Hg and NaCl under controlled conditions in the laboratory. Transcriptomic response provided a sensitive measurement of the exposure as well as hints on the tolerance mechanisms of environmental pollution, and is thus promising as an early-warning tool to assess water quality degradation.

Seabed gallery intakes: Investigation of the water pretreatment effectiveness of the active layer using a long-term column experiment	WATER RESEARCH												Seabed gallery intake systems used for seawater reverse osmosis facilities employ the same principle of water treatment as slow sand filtration in freshwater systems. An investigation concerning the effectiveness of the active layer (top layer) in improving raw water quality was conducted by using a long-term bench-scale columns experiment. Two different media types, silica and carbonate sand, were tested in 1 m columns to evaluate the effectiveness of media type in terms of algae, bacteria, Natural Organic Matter (NOM) and Transparent Exopolymer Particles (TEP) removal over a period of 620 days. Nearly all algae in the silica sand column, 87% (sigma = 0.04) of the bacteria, 59% (sigma = 0.11) of the biopolymer fraction of NOM, 59% (sigma = 0.16) of particulate and 32% (sigma = 0.25) of colloidal TEP were removed during the last 330 days of the experiment. Total removal was observed in the carbonate sand column for algal concentration, while the bacterial removal was lower at 74% (sigma = 0.08). Removal of biopolymers, particulate and colloidal TEP were higher in the carbonate column during the last 330 days with 72% (sigma = 0.15), 66% (sigma =0.08) and 36% (sigma = 0.12) removed for these organics respectively. Removal of these key organics through the 1 m thick column, representing the active layer, will likely reduce the rate of biofouling, reduce chemical usage and minimize operating cost in SWRO systems. The data show that the media will require several months at the beginning of operation to reach equilibrium so that high organic removal rates can be achieved. No development of a "schmutzdecke" layer occurred. The experimental results suggest that unlike freshwater slow sand filtration wherein most water treatment occurs in the upper 10 cm, in seawater systems treatment occurs throughout the full active layer depth of 1 m. The results of this study will help in designing and operating seabed gallery intake systems in varied geological conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Evaluation of methods to sample fecal indicator bacteria in foreshore sand and pore water at freshwater beaches	WATER RESEARCH												Fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) are known to accumulate in foreshore beach sand and pore water (referred to as foreshore reservoir) where they act as a non-point source for contaminating adjacent surface waters. While guidelines exist for sampling surface waters at recreational beaches, there is no widely-accepted method to collect sand/sediment or pore water samples for FIB enumeration. The effect of different sampling strategies in quantifying the abundance of FIB in the foreshore reservoir is unclear. Sampling was conducted at six freshwater beaches with different sand types to evaluate sampling methods for characterizing the abundance of E. coli in the foreshore reservoir as well as the partitioning of E. coli between different components in the foreshore reservoir (pore water, saturated sand, unsaturated sand). Methods were evaluated for collection of pore water (drive point, shovel, and careful excavation), unsaturated sand (top 1 cm, top 5 cm), and saturated sand (sediment core, shovel, and careful excavation). Ankle-depth surface water samples were also collected for comparison. Pore water sampled with a shovel resulted in the highest observed E. coli concentrations (only statistically significant at fine sand beaches) and lowest variability compared to other sampling methods. Collection of the top 1 cm of unsaturated sand resulted in higher and more variable concentrations than the top 5 cm of sand. There were no statistical differences in E. coli concentrations when using different methods to sample the saturated sand. Overall, the unsaturated sand had the highest amount of E. coli when compared to saturated sand and pore water (considered on a bulk volumetric basis). The findings presented will help determine the appropriate sampling strategy for characterizing FIB abundance in the foreshore reservoir as a means of predicting its potential impact on nearshore surface water quality and public health risk.

However, the development of reliable WQMS is fatally constrained by severe contamination and biofouling of sensors due to the hostile analytical environment of wastewaters, especially raw sewages, that challenges the limit of existing sensing technologies. In this work, we report a technological solution to enable the development of WQMS for real-time abnormal event detection with high reliability and practicality. A vectored high flow hydrodynamic self-cleaning approach and a dual-sensor self-diagnostic concept are adopted for WQMS to effectively encounter vital sensor failing issues caused by contamination and biofouling and ensure the integrity of sensing data. The performance of the WQMS has been evaluated over a 3-year trial period at different sewage catchment sites across three Australian states. It has demonstrated that the developed WQMS is capable of continuously operating in raw sewage for a prolonged period up to 24 months without maintenance and failure, signifying the high reliability and practicality. The demonstrated WQMS capability to reliably acquire real-time wastewater quality information leaps forward the development of effective wastewater source management system. The reported self-cleaning and self-diagnostic concepts should be applicable to other online water quality monitoring systems, opening a new way to encounter the common reliability and stability issues caused by sensor contamination and biofouling.

Incidence of gastrointestinal illness following wet weather recreational exposures: Harmonization of quantitative microbial risk assessment with an epidemiologic investigation of surfers	WATER RESEARCH												We modeled the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) illness associated with recreational exposures to marine water following storm events in San Diego County, California. We estimated GI illness risks via quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) techniques by consolidating site specific pathogen monitoring data of stormwater, site specific dilution estimates, literature-based water ingestion data, and literature based pathogen dose-response and morbidity information. Our water quality results indicated that human sources of contamination contribute viral and bacterial pathogens to streams draining an urban watershed during wet weather that then enter the ocean and affect nearshore water quality. We evaluated a series of approaches to account for uncertainty in the norovirus dose-response model selection and compared our model results to those from a concurrently conducted epidemiological study that provided empirical estimates for illness risk following ocean exposure. The preferred norovirus dose-response approach yielded median risk estimates for water recreation-associated illness (15 GI illnesses per 1000 recreation events) that closely matched the reported epidemiological results (12 excess GI illnesses per 1000 wet weather recreation events). The results are consistent with norovirus, or other pathogens associated with norovirus, as an important cause of gastrointestinal illness among surfers in this setting. This study demonstrates the applicability of QMRA for recreational water risk estimation, even under wet weather conditions and describes a process that might be useful in developing site-specific water quality criteria in this and other locations.

In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was applied to model streamflow, sediment, and pesticide diuron loading in the San Joaquinwatershed, a major contributing area to the elevated pesticide levels in the downstream Delta. The Sequential Uncertainty Fitting version 2 (SUFI-2) algorithm was employed to perform calibration and uncertainty analysis. A combination of performance measures (PMs) and standardized performance evaluation criteria (PEC) was applied to evaluate model performance, while prediction uncertainty was quantified by 95% prediction uncertainty band (95PPU). Results showed that streamflow simulation was at least "satisfactory" at most stations, with more than 50% of the observed data bracketed by the 95PPU. Sediment simulation was rated as at least "satisfactory" based on two PMs, and diuron simulation was judged as "good" by all PMs. The 95PPU of sediment and diuron bracketed about 40% and 30% of the observed data, respectively. Significant correlations were observed between the diuron loads, and precipitation, streamflow, and the current and antecedent pesticide use. Results also showed that the majority (>70%) of agricultural diuron was transported during winter months, when direct exposure of biocontrol agents to diuron runoff is limited. However, exposure in the dry season could be a concern because diuron is relatively persistent in aquatic system. This study not only provides valuable information for the development of biological weed control plan in the Delta, but also serves as a foundation for the continued research on calibration, evaluation, and uncertainty analysisof spatially distributed, physically based hydrologic models.

F.; Besner, Marie-Claude; Prevost, Michele			Predicting Water Quality Impact After District Metered Area Implementation in a Full-Scale Drinking Water Distribution System	JOURNAL AMERICAN WATER WORKS ASSOCIATION												Pressure management using district metered areas (DMAs) can reduce leakage and break frequencies and extend the service life of pipes in drinking water networks. Valves must be closed, creating DMAs, resulting in hydraulic changes and increasing the number of dead ends. A field study of five pilot DMAs was conducted using an enhanced sampling program. Water quality was measured at different locations inside and outside DMA boundaries before and after implementation. Overall water quality did not change following DMA implementation. However, water quality (chlorine residuals, turbidity, and metals) was degraded at locations with elevated water residence times such as created dead ends, sites outside DMA boundaries, and extremities. An approach based on the combination of hydraulic modeling and water quality was developed to predict trihalomethane concentrations in the DMA using measurements only from an inlet site. Utilities can use a combination of hydraulic modeling and targeted monitoring to predict water quality changes after DMA implementation.																	2164-4535					SEP	2017	109	9					E363	E380		10.5942/jawwa.2017.109.0099								WOS:000422943100001						
J	Alfredo, KA; Russo, TA				Alfredo, Katherine A.; Russo, Tess A.			Urban, agricultural, and environmental protection practices for sustainable water quality	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER												Sustainable water management often emphasizes water resource quantity, with focus on availability and use practices. However, only a subset of the available water may be usable when also considering water quality. Water quality management is examined within three broad sectors-urban, agriculture, and environmental systems-to investigate how water quality sustainability (WQS) is defined by each and across the three sectors. The definitions determined for both urban and agricultural WQS mention downstream human and ecosystem use; however, regulatory policy does not always support these definitions. This challenge of managing water quality locally and downstream, coupled with interactions across multiple sectors, has led to a fragmented approach to water quality management. Legislation typically divides water quality management into compartments without considering the entire system. Within the United States, there is an uneven distribution of responsibility regarding water quality protection, and notable policies which counteract efforts to improve water quality. The review suggests that despite a growing intention to use a single system approach where water is considered as a limited resource that must supply all competing interests, one does not yet exist and is even hindered by current policies and regulations. Recent policy is signaling a shift toward increasing interagency coordination; however, the basic definitions of WQS remain disconnected across sectors. It is the conclusion of this review that sustainable water quality is not currently practiced in the United States.

In this study, totally, 270 samples were taken and analyzed for evaluating the amount of outcome nitrate. The results showed that the trend of removing nitrate decreased in terms of increasing the passing water volume and loading rate in both systems. While the altitude of ion-exchange column increased due to the up-flow, the removal efficiency of nitrate increased continuously. In the down-flow resin, the efficiency of the system was gradually reduced while increasing the height of resin up to 60 cm; whereas the system efficiency increased at the resin height of 60-90 cm. The efficiency of both ion-exchange systems were affected as a result of the some factors including volume of passing water, resin height, and loading rate at high, medium, and low levels, respectively. Overall, to achieve the sufficient water quality, it is required to consider the height of resin and amount of passing water volume to reach the cost and effectiveness of the system.					fazlzadeh, mehdi/0000-0001-9512-6025												1944-3994	1944-3986				SEP	2017	89						127	135		10.5004/dwt.2017.20942								WOS:000415823400014

One cave species, macroinvertebrates, represents a heterogeneous group of animal taxa which is in constant danger of extinction, principally due to anthropogenic activities. Macroinvertebrates have been widely used as bioindicators of the quality of biogeographic zones, ecosystems, and protected areas, as well as to determine protected species. The Boca del Rio Cave is located in the biogeographic transition zone in Mexico's Neotropical region, and is home to a large enclave of different biotic elements. Twenty-nine organisms were collected and grouped into 19 families based on their morphological and physiological characteristics. The coefficient of taxonomic work (CTW) indicates that the taxonomic level family is the most consistent for all of the organisms collected. The Coenagronidae family was the most abundant in the study. The BMWP, ASPT, and SCI biotic index scores indicate that the water in the Boca del Rio Cave is slightly contaminated, while the Family Biotic Index (FBI) indicates poor water quality with very substantial organic pollution. The diversity of macroinvertebrate families confirms that the Boca del Rio Cave serves as an important refuge for fauna in the transition zone located in Mexico's Nearctic biogeographic region. This report represents the first study to use bioindicators to analyze the water quality of a cave system, and contributes to the inventories of macroinvertebrate cave fauna.																	0187-8336	2007-2422				SEP-OCT	2017	8	5					5	17		10.24850/j-tyca-2017-05-01								WOS:000416180300001

Two samplings were conducted and their physicochemical and microbiological parameters were measured in order to obtain a pattern sample and a problem sample. The pollution level in the section of the basin studied was evaluated based on the water quality index (ICA, Spanish acronym), the National Sanitation Foundation Index (NSFI), and the Dinius Index. A comparative analysis of the indices demonstrated significant river deterioration from the burning of tires around the basin. The quality ranged from average to very poor, requiring treatment for human consumption and even specific treatment processes to remove hazardous pollutants such as phenolic compounds and heavy metals. In addition, the values of most of the parameters exceeded the acceptable limits established by Colombia's environmental regulations on water for human and domestic use, preservation of wildlife, and livestock and agriculture. The results of this study indicate that the water's physiochemical properties were greatly affected by the products that were generated by burning tires.																	0187-8336	2007-2422				SEP-OCT	2017	8	5					39	55		10.24850/j-tyca-2017-05-03								WOS:000416180300003

In Mexico, shrimp represents a significant source of the income generated by aquaculture. Since the success of shrimp farming depends on good water quality, its monitoring is essential. This work presents a new computational model to assess the water quality of large shrimp ponds (Litopenaeus vannamei). An artificial neural network (ANN) was used to create a water quality index, with which a mathematical relationship can be established between the dynamics of environmental parameters and different water quality conditions (excellent, good, average, and poor). Four parameters that were important for the habitat were selected: temperature, dissolved oxygen, salinity, and pH. The results show that the proposed model performs well and efficiently, as compared to other evaluation models used for this purpose. The evaluations demonstrate that ANN is a good option for evaluating and detecting optimal and undesirable conditions, contributing to good water management for this type of farming.																	0187-8336	2007-2422				SEP-OCT	2017	8	5					71	89		10.24850/j-tyca-2017-05-05								WOS:000416180300005

The present paper uses Arima (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) to predict influent and effluent water quality in a constructed wetland, as well as its pollutant removal efficiency. The wetland is located on the campus of the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana in Bogota, Colombia. Arima prediction values were based on time series obtained with UV-Vis spectrometry probes. These predictions were found to be adequate for the first 12 hours of the water quality time series for the three data sets analyzed: influent, effluent, and efficiency. Overall, none of the data had prediction errors over 15%. In separate analyses of the relative predictive errors in influent and effluent values, they were found to be less significant for UV wavelengths than for the visible range (Vis). In addition, the variability in this type of error was less for the UV range than for the Vis range, which indicates that Arima is a suitable prediction method for analyzing pollutants that fall in the UV range.																	0187-8336	2007-2422				SEP-OCT	2017	8	5					127	139		10.24850/j-tyca-2017-05-09								WOS:000416180300009

This is especially true for Beijing, where groundwater is an important source for urban water supply. In this study, statistical methods, including descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, principal component analysis, and Piper-Tri-linear diagram, were used in analyzing the temporal and spatial variations of the hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater based on monitored data from the southern plain of Beijing, China. Results indicated consistent changes of groundwater's hydrochemical characteristics in different aquifers in the study area. The percentage of HCO3- in total anion increased significantly in the groundwater, and hydrochemical water type evolved gradually from Ca-Mg-Cl-SO4 based to Ca-Mg-HCO3 based from period 2005-2007 to period 2013-2015. In shallow groundwater, the concentration of Na+, Ca2+, SO42-, HCO3-, and total dissolved solids (TDS) increased from period 2005-2007 to period 2013-2015, and the greatest change came from HCO3-, rising from 428.93 to 528.96 mgL(-1). The changes of main ionic concentrations in the deep groundwater were consistent with those in the shallow groundwater for both periods. However, the variations in deep groundwater were less than those in shallow groundwater. The temporal and spatial variations of hydrochemical characteristics reflect the groundwater quality in the study area. This study could facilitate decision-making process on the protection of groundwater resources to ensure its sustainable utilization.																	2305-7068					SEP	2017	5	3					235	248										WOS:000415044100003

Regarding water quantity management, many advances have occurred since the approval of the Brazilian Water Resources Policy in 1997. The competences and responsibilities of each entity of the system are defined in the relevant legislation. Regarding water quality management, however, there is a large number of applicable regulations and competent institutions to act in the supervision and regulation of the matter. Due to this range of information, the need to systematize and synthesize the legal/institutional framework is configured. For this finality, this work proposes to associate the institutional systematization matrix methodology with the environmental monitoring instruments already practiced in Ceara, Brazil. It is hoped that this association will allow the visualization of potentially polluting sources, relevant regulations and competent institutions. The methodology was applied to the Castanhao Reservoir, in the State of Ceara, Brazil. With this methodology, it was possible to identify that 50% of pollutant sources are generated by public entities (Companhia de Agua e Esgoto do Ceara CAGECE; Servico Autonomo de Agua e Esgoto - SAAE; or city halls) and the other 50% correspond to individuals or legal entities. This means that control actions over public entities could solve an important part of the hydrographic basin pollution. Regulatory agencies and the independent environment entities can contribute to reduce pollution sources.																	1413-4152	1809-4457				SEP-OCT	2017	22	5					877	887		10.1590/S1413-41522017160289								WOS:000413736100007

The data depicted that calcium and bicarbonates were dominating among the cations and anions. The results indicate the trend of cation dominance as Ca2+ > Na+>Mg2+ > K+, whereas anion dominance was in the order of HCO3- > Cl- > SO42-. Ratio of calcium to magnesium indicated the dissolution of Ca2+ from CaCO3, which results in an increased levels of Ca2+ in the groundwater. Interpretation of Piper Trilinear plot understands the various geochemical processes affecting the groundwater quality and shows groundwater was dominated by Ca-HCO3 type. The pH was recorded in the slightly alkalinity range 7.2-7.8 and was showing positive correlation with HCO3-. The chloro-alkaline indices revealed 86% of the sources exchange by a type of base-exchange reactions, rest by cation-anion exchange. Gibbs diagram revealed groundwater sources fall in the category of rock dominance. The concentration of the nitrogen compounds was in the progression of NO3-N > NH4- N > NO2-N, and the PO4- fluctuated from 0.12 to 0.22 mg/L. Moreover, corrosivity ratio indicated that water from the majority of sources (71%) is safe to supply using pipes without any corrosive effects, while 29% of sources are corrosive in nature and need non-corrosive pipes for transporting and lifting of groundwater. The results revealed, groundwater samples were within permissible limits as prescribed by International and National standards, for drinking purposes. The State government and NGO's can show their interest in utilizing such water resources to overcome the shortage of drinking water in a sustainable way for the daily consumption of the people living in the vicinity of Jhelum River.

Quantifying the impact of community-scale flood mitigation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION												Federal, State, and local governments, non-governmental organizations, and independent local community organizations spend billions of dollars on watershed management activities. The goals of watershed management projects may span a wide spectrum including, but limited to flood reduction, soil erosion reduction, water quality improvement or protection, and/or increase source of wood fiber for fuel or construction material. Accomplishing these goals is commonly done through revegetation campaigns, construction of small-scale hydraulic works, contour terracing, and urban development planning, among others. An ongoing challenge for these agencies, along with local stakeholders is to understand the various individual and combined impacts of different mitigation measures. The methodology and models developed and applied herein provide important tools for examining the feasibility of construction and the likely impacts of gabion dams and vegetation coverage applications (e.g., hillside and channel revegetation campaigns) in steep mountainous areas upstream of populated areas. The purpose of this investigation is to quantify the impact of changes in the size and location of the gabion dams and of changes in vegetation coverage in the Ravine Millet watershed near Port-au-Price, Haiti. This environment frequently experiences strong convective precipitation events, often the result of hurricane passage over the region. Intensity-Duration-Frequency curves were developed with available data, which were then used to develop design storms associated with different return period frequencies. Hourly satellite-derived precipitation was used to identify the shape and duration of various return period storm events. This investigation then applies some commonly available hydrologic and hydraulic models and various concomitant tools used to construct those models, along with a Kinematic Routing Model to assess the impact of various mitigation strategies. Storm events with multiple peaks of similar magnitude interact with channel geometry and other hydraulic characteristics and may result in peak delay or reduce the time of arrival and may increase or decrease the magnitude of flood peaks. Results indicate that hillslope revegetation impacts to flood peak and the time or arrival of flood peaks at the watershed outlet are limited to relatively low return period storms. Results also indicate that channel vegetation can reduce the peak discharge and significantly delay the arrival of flood peaks. The combined impacts of gabion dams and channel vegetation are highly non-linear, and depend on the shape and duration of storm peaks.																	2212-4209					SEP	2017	24						189	208		10.1016/j.ijdrr.2017.06.001								WOS:000413936100022

Together with known empirical relations, the model comprises a new formulation for resuspension due to fish activity. Experiments on erosion of natural sediments in the annular flume at Aachen University are used for model calibration. Empirical coefficients were evaluated with genetic algorithms to achieve the best agreement between the model results and the experimental data. The presented model shows sufficient flexibility to account for various sediment properties, including different sediment sources, natural and artificial contaminants, presence or absence of aquatic organisms, and results in an average coefficient of determination, R-2 = 90.5% between the model results and the experimental data. Model validation allows it to be assumed that different contaminants affect bed properties differently. Fish activity plays an essential role in correct resuspension prediction. Further sediment erosion experiments with carefully chosen conditions will allow a more comprehensive model evaluation. The presented model is intended to serve as a building block in the development of a hydraulic-sediment-biota model within the W-3-Hydro: Water Quality Event Detection for Urban Water Security and Urban Water Management Based on Hydrotoxicological Investigations project that aims to improve the knowledge concerning bioavailability, transport, fate, and effects of contaminants on the aquatic environment.

J	Islam, N; Rodriguez, MJ; Farahat, A; Sadiq, R				Islam, Nilufar; Rodriguez, Manuel J.; Farahat, Ashraf; Sadiq, Rehan			Minimizing the impacts of contaminant intrusion in small water distribution networks through booster chlorination optimization	STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT												Contaminant intrusion in a water distribution network (DN) has three basic pre-conditions: source of contaminant (e.g., leaky sewer), a pathway (e.g., water main leaks), and a driving force (e.g., negative pressure). The impact of intrusion can be catastrophic if residual disinfectant (chlorine) is not present. To avoid microbiological water quality failure, higher levels of secondary chlorination doses can be a possible solution, but they can produce disinfectant by-products which lead to taste and odour complaints. This study presents a methodology to identify potential intrusion points in a DN and optimize booster chlorination based on trade-offs among microbiological risk, chemical risk and life-cycle cost for booster chlorination. A point-scoring scheme was developed to identify the potential intrusion points within a DN. It utilized factors such as pollutant source (e.g., sewer characteristics), pollution pathway (water main diameter, length, age, and surrounding soil properties, etc.), consequence of contamination (e.g., population, and land use), and operational factors (e.g., water pressure) integrated through a geographical information system using advanced ArcMap 10 operations. The contaminant intrusion was modelled for E. Coli O156: H7 (a microbiological indicator) using the EPANET-MSX programmer's toolkit. The quantitative microbial risk assessment and chemical (human health) risk assessment frameworks were adapted to estimate risk potentials. Booster chlorination locations and dosages were selected using a multi-objective genetic algorithm. The methodology was illustrated through a case study on a portion of a municipal DN.																	1436-3240	1436-3259				SEP	2017	31	7			SI		1759	1775		10.1007/s00477-017-1440-x								WOS:000412457300015

However, sediment management such as flushing is needed to maintain storage capacity. Climate change is expected to increase sediment loads, but potential effects on their quality are scarcely known. In this context, sediment contamination by trace elements (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, and Zn) and organics (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons PAHs, Polychlorinated Biphenyls PCBs and C > 12 hydrocarbons) was analyzed in 20 reservoirs located in Italian Central Alps. A strong As and a moderate Cd, Hg and Pb enrichment was emphasized by I-geo, with potential ecotoxicological risk according to Probable Effect Concentration quotients. Sedimentation rate, granulometry, total organic carbon (TOC) and altitude resulted as the main drivers governing pollutant concentrations in sediments. According to climate change models, expected increase of rainfall erosivity will enhance soil erosion and consequently the sediment flow to reservoirs, potentially increasing coarse grain fractions and thus potentially diluting pollutants. Conversely, increased weathering may enhance metal fluxes to reservoirs. Increased vegetation cover will potentially result in higher TOC concentrations, which may contrast contaminant bioavailability and thus toxicity. Our results may provide elements for a proper management of contaminated sediments in a climate change scenario aiming at preserving water quality and ecosystem functioning.

This study attempted to create a model of ecological swale with on-line subsurface conveyance system with InfoWorks SD. The new technique has been used Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) model to describe overland flow routing and Soil Conservation Service Method (SCS) used to model infiltration or subsurface flow. The modeling technique has been proven successful, as the predicted and observed closely match each other, with a mean error of 4.58 to 7.32%. The calibrated model then used to determine the ratio of the flow exchange between the surface and subsurface drainage system. Results from the model showed that the runoff ratio exchange between the surface and subsurface is 60 to 90%.

The method takes into account nonlinearity and hysteresis effects during storm events, and hydrological conditions variability. High-frequency records of total P and reactive P originating from four contrasting European agricultural catchments in terms of P loads were used to test the method. The models were calibrated on weekly grab sampling data combined with 10 storms surveyed subhourly per year (weekly+ survey) and then used to reconstruct P concentrations during all storm events for computing annual loads. For total P, results showed that this modeling approach allowed the estimation of annual loads with limited uncertainties (approximate to -10%+/- 15%), more reliable than estimations based on simple linear regressions using turbidity, based on interpolated weekly+ data without storm event reconstruction, or on discharge weighted calculations from weekly series or monthly series. For reactive P, load uncertainties based on the nonlinear model were similar to uncertainties based on storm event reconstruction using simple linear regression (approximate to 20%+/- 30%), and remained lower than uncertainties obtained without storm reconstruction on weekly or monthly series, but larger than uncertainties based on interpolated weekly+ data (approximate to -15%+/- 20%). These empirical models showed we could estimate reliable P exports from noncontinuous P time series when using continuous proxies, and this could potentially be very useful for completing time-series data sets in high-frequency surveys, even over extended periods. Plain Language Abstract Phosphorus (P) loads transported by rivers and streams have to be estimated reliably, but this is a difficult task because P loads can be transported during very short period of time, like during storm events, and most P surveys are executed with low sampling frequencies. Because continuous surveys of P are costly, we tested a modeling approach using commonly used low-cost continuous records of turbidity and discharge as surrogate variables. This had to take into account nonlinear relationships and the fact that the relationship between P and turbidity or discharge is different during a rising phase or a descending phase. The model we developed estimates P concentration variations during storm events and provides continuous time series of P. From the model estimations, total annual loads of P could be predicted with low uncertainty ranges when using turbidity as a surrogate variable, showing its ability at estimating phosphorus exports values closer to the reality. The soluble reactive form was however less reliably predicted by discharge records, but our method could still be improved.

Calibration of a modified temperature-light intensity logger for quantifying water electrical conductivity	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The Stream Temperature, Intermittency, and Conductivity (STIC) electrical conductivity (EC) logger as presented by Chapin et al. (2014) serves as an inexpensive (similar to 50 USD) means to assess relative EC in freshwater environments. This communication demonstrates the calibration of the STIC logger for quantifying EC, and provides examples from a month long field deployment in the High Arctic. Calibration models followed multiple nonlinear regression and produced calibration curves with high coefficient of determination values (R-2=0.995-0.998; n=5). Percent error of mean predicted specific conductance at 25 degrees C (SpC) to known SpC ranged in magnitude from -0.6% to 13% (mean=-1.4%), and mean absolute percent error (MAPE) ranged from 2.1% to 13% (mean=5.3%). Across all tested loggers we found good accuracy and precision, with both error metrics increasing with increasing SpC values. During 10, month-long field deployments, there were no logger failures and full data recovery was achieved. Point SpC measurements at the location of STIC loggers recorded via a more expensive commercial electrical conductivity logger followed similar trends to STIC SpC records, with 1:1.05 and 1:1.08 relationships between the STIC and commercial logger SpC values. These results demonstrate that STIC loggers calibrated to quantify EC are an economical means to increase the spatiotemporal resolution of water quality investigations.																	0043-1397	1944-7973				SEP	2017	53	9					8120	8126		10.1002/2017WR020634								WOS:000413484200035						
J	Isazadeh, M; Biazar, SM; Ashrafzadeh, A				Isazadeh, Mohammad; Biazar, Seyed Mostafa; Ashrafzadeh, Afshin			Support vector machines and feed-forward neural networks for spatial modeling of groundwater qualitative parameters	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The present study attempts to model the spatial variability of three groundwater qualitative parameters in Guilan Province, northern Iran, using artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector machines (SVMs). Data collected from 140 observation wells for the years 2002-2014 were used. Five variables, X and Y coordinates of the observation well, distance of the observation well from the shoreline, areal average 6-month rainfall depth, and groundwater level at the day of water quality sampling, were considered as primary input variables. In addition, nine qualitative variables were also considered as auxiliary input variables. Electrical conductivity (EC), sodium concentration (Na+),and sulfate concentration (SO42-) of the groundwater in the region were estimated using ANNs and SVMs with different input combinations. The results showed that both ANNs and SVMs work well when the only primary input variable is the well location. The ANN yielded an RMSE of 1.03 mEq/l for SO42-, 1.05 mEq/l for Na+, and 203.17 mu S/cm for EC, using the X and Y coordinates of the observation wells in the study area. In the case of SVM, these values were, respectively, 0.87, 0.87, and 176.68. Considering the auxiliary input variables (pH, EC, and the concentrations of Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, SO42-, and HCO3-) resulted in a significant decrease in the RMSE of both ANNs (0.22, 0.30, and 33.04) and SVMs (0.26, 0.34, and 36.23). Comparing these RMSE values with those of cokriging interpolation technique (0.59, 0.98, and 177.59) indicated that ANNs and SVMs produced more accurate estimates of the three qualitative parameters. The relative importance of auxiliary input variables was also determined using Gamma test. The output uncertainty of ANNs and SVMs were determined using p-factor and d-factor. The results showed that SVMs have less uncertainty than ANNs.

The role of alluvial aquifer sediments in attenuating a dissolved arsenic plume	JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY												In a crude-oil-contaminated sandy aquifer at the Bemidji site in northern Minnesota, biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons has resulted in release of naturally occurring As to groundwater under Fe-reducing conditions. This study used chemical extractions of aquifer sediments collected in 1993 and 2011-2014 to evaluate the relationship between Fe and As in different redox zones (oxic, methanogenic, Fe-reducing, anoxic-suboxic transition) of the contaminated aquifer over a twenty-year period. Results show that 1) the aquifer has the capacity to naturally attenuate the plume of dissolved As, primarily through sorption; 2) Fe and As are linearly correlated in sediment across all redox zones, and a regression analysis between Fe and As reasonably predicted As concentrations in sediment from 1993 using only Fe concentrations; 3) an As-rich "iron curtain," associated with the anoxic-suboxic transition zone, migrated 30 m downgradient between 1993 and 2013 as a result of the hydrocarbon plume evolution; and 4) silt lenses in the aquifer preferentially sequester dissolved As, though As is remobilized into groundwater from sediment after reducing conditions are established. Using results of this study coupled with historical data, we develop a conceptual model which summarizes the natural attenuation of As and Fe over time and space that can be applied to other sites that experience As mobilization due to an influx of bioavailable organic matter.

J	Chen, L; Sun, C; Wang, GB; Xie, H; Shen, ZY				Chen, Lei; Sun, Cheng; Wang, Guobo; Xie, Hui; Shen, Zhenyao			Event-based nonpoint source pollution prediction in a scarce data catchment	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Quantifying the rainfall-runoff-pollutant (R-R-P) process is key to regulating non-point source (NPS) pollution; however, the impacts of scarce measured data on R-R-P simulations have not yet been reported. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive study of scarce data that addressed both rainfall-runoff and runoff-pollutant processes, whereby the impacts of data scarcity on two commonly used methods, including Unit Hydrograph (UH) and Loads Estimator (LOADEST), were quantified. A case study was performed in a typical small catchment of the Three Gorges Reservoir Region (TGRR) of China. Based on our results, the classification of rainfall patterns should be carried out first when analyzing modeling results. Compared to data based on a missing rate and a missing location, key information generates more impacts on the simulated flow and NPS loads. When the scarcity rate exceeds a certain threshold (20% in this study), measured data scarcity level has clear impacts on the model's accuracy. As the model of total nitrogen (TN) always performs better under different data scarcity conditions, researchers are encouraged to pay more attention to continuous the monitoring of total phosphorus (TP) for better NPS-TP predictions. The results of this study serve as baseline information for hydrologic forecasting and for the further control of NPS pollutants. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Evaluation of wetland implementation strategies on phosphorus reduction at a watershed scale	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Excessive nutrient use in agricultural practices is a major cause of water quality degradation around the world, which results in eutrophication of the freshwater systems. Among the nutrients, phosphorus enrichment has recently drawn considerable attention due to major environmental issues such as Lake Erie and Chesapeake Bay eutrophication. One approach for mitigating the impacts of excessive nutrients on water resources is the implementation of wetlands. However, proper site selection for wetland implementation is the key for effective water quality management at the watershed scale, which is the goal of this study. In this regard, three conventional and two pseudo-random targeting methods were considered. A watershed model called the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was coupled with another model called System for Urban Stormwater Treatment and Analysis IntegratioN (SUSTAIN) to simulate the impacts of wetland implementation scenarios in the Saginaw River watershed, located in Michigan. The inter-group similarities of the targeting strategies were investigated and it was shown that the level of similarity increases as the target area increases (0.54-0.86). In general, the conventional targeting method based on phosphorus load generated per unit area at the subwatershed scale had the highest average reduction among all the scenarios (44.46 t/year). However, when considering the total area of implemented wetlands, the conventional method based on long-term impacts of wetland implementation showed the highest amount of phosphorus reduction (36.44 t/year).

Stormwater infiltration and the 'urban karst' - A review	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The covering of native soils with impervious surfaces (e.g. roofs, roads, and pavement) prevents infiltration of rainfall into the ground, resulting in increased surface runoff and decreased groundwater recharge. When this excess water is managed using stormwater drainage systems, flow and water quality regimes of urban streams are severely altered, leading to the degradation of their ecosystems. Urban streams restoration requires alternative approaches towards stormwater management, which aim to restore the flow regime towards pre-development conditions. The practice of stormwater infiltration achieved using a range of stormwater source-control measures (SCM5) is central to restoring baseflow. Despite this, little is known about what happens to the infiltrated water. Current knowledge about the impact of stormwater infiltration on flow regimes was reviewed. Infiltration systems were found to be efficient at attenuating high-flow hydrology (reducing peak magnitudes and frequencies) at a range of scales (parcel, streetscape, catchment). Several modelling studies predict a positive impact of stormwater infiltration on baseflow, and empirical evidence is emerging, but the fate of infiltrated stormwater remains unclear. It is not known how infiltrated water travels along the subsurface pathways that characterise the urban environment, in particular the 'urban karst', which results from networks of human-made subsurface pathways, e.g. stormwater and sanitary sewer pipes and associated high permeability trenches. Seepage of groundwater into and around such pipes is possible, meaning some infiltrated stormwater could travel along artificial pathways. The catchment-scale ability of infiltration systems to restore groundwater recharge and base flow is thus ambiguous. Further understanding of the fate of infiltrated stormwater is required to ensure infiltration systems deliver optimal outcomes for waterway flow regimes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Hosseini, M; Kerachian, R				Hosseini, Marjan; Kerachian, Reza			A data fusion-based methodology for optimal redesign of groundwater monitoring networks	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												In this paper, a new data fusion-based methodology is presented for spatio-temporal (S-T) redesigning of Groundwater Level Monitoring Networks (GLMNs). The kriged maps of three different criteria (i.e. marginal entropy of water table levels, estimation error variances of mean values of water table levels, and estimation values of long-term changes in water level) are combined for determining monitoring sub-areas of high and low priorities in order to consider different spatial patterns for each sub-area. The best spatial sampling scheme is selected by applying a new method, in which a regular hexagonal gridding pattern and the Thiessen polygon approach are respectively utilized in sub-areas of high and low monitoring priorities. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and a S-T kriging models are used to simulate water level fluctuations. To improve the accuracy of the predictions, results of the ANN and S-T kriging models are combined using a data fusion technique. The concept of Value of Information (VOI) is utilized to determine two stations with maximum information values in both sub-areas with high and low monitoring priorities. The observed groundwater level data of these two stations are considered for the power of trend detection, estimating periodic fluctuations and mean values of the stationary components, which are used for determining non-uniform sampling frequencies for sub-areas. The proposed methodology is applied to the Dehgolan plain in northwestern Iran. The results show that a new sampling configuration with 35 and 7 monitoring stations and sampling intervals of 20 and 32 days, respectively in sub-areas with high and low monitoring priorities, leads to a more efficient monitoring network than the existing one containing 52 monitoring stations and monthly temporal sampling.

J	Qi, SQ; Hou, DY; Luo, J				Qi, Shengqi; Hou, Deyi; Luo, Jian			Optimization of groundwater sampling approach under various hydrogeological conditions using a numerical simulation model	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												This study presents a numerical model based on field data to simulate groundwater flow in both the aquifer and the well-bore for the low-flow sampling method and the well-volume sampling method. The numerical model was calibrated to match well with field drawdown, and calculated flow regime in the well was used to predict the variation of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration during the purging period. The model was then used to analyze sampling representativeness and sampling time. Site characteristics, such as aquifer hydraulic conductivity, and sampling choices, such as purging rate and screen length, were found to be significant determinants of sampling representativeness and required sampling time. Results demonstrated that: (1) DO was the most useful water quality indicator in ensuring groundwater sampling representativeness in comparison with turbidity, pH, specific conductance, oxidation reduction potential (ORP) and temperature; (2) it is not necessary to maintain a drawdown of less than 0.1 m when conducting low flow purging. However, a high purging rate in a low permeability aquifer may result in a dramatic decrease in sampling representativeness after an initial peak; (3) the presence of a short screen length may result in greater drawdown and a longer sampling time for low-flow purging. Overall, the present study suggests that this new numerical model is suitable for describing groundwater flow during the sampling process, and can be used to optimize sampling strategies under various hydrogeological conditions.

Coupling fine particle and bedload transport in gravel-bedded streams	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Fine particles in the silt- and clay-size range are important determinants of surface water quality. Since fine particle loading rates are not unique functions of stream discharge this limits the utility of the available models for water quality assessment. Data from 38 minimally developed watersheds within the United States Geological Survey stream gauging network in California, USA reveal three lines of evidence that fine particle release is coupled with bedload transport. First, there is a transition in fine particle loading rate as a function of discharge for gravel-bedded sediments that does not appear when the sediment bed is composed of sand, cobbles, boulders, or bedrock. Second, the discharge at the transition in the loading rate is correlated with the initiation of gravel mobilization. Third, high frequency particle concentration and discharge data are dominated by clockwise hysteresis where rising limb discharges generally have higher concentrations than falling limb discharges. These three observations across multiple watersheds lead to a conceptual model that fine particles accumulate within the sediment bed at discharges less than the transition and then the gravel bed fluidizes with fine particle release at discharges above the transition discharge. While these observations were individually recognized in the literature, this analysis provides a consistent conceptual model based on the coupling of fine particle dynamics with filtration at low discharges and gravel bed fluidization at higher discharges.

J	Zhang, YY; Gao, Y; Yu, Q				Zhang, Yongyong; Gao, Yang; Yu, Qiang			Diffuse nitrogen loss simulation and impact assessment of stereoscopic agriculture pattern by integrated water system model and consideration of multiple existence forms	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Agricultural nitrogen loss becomes an increasingly important source of water quality deterioration and eutrophication, even threatens water safety for humanity. Nitrogen dynamic mechanism is still too complicated to be well captured at watershed scale due to its multiple existence forms and instability, disturbance of agricultural management practices. Stereoscopic agriculture is a novel agricultural planting pattern to efficiently use local natural resources (e.g., water, land, sunshine, heat and fertilizer). It is widely promoted as a high yield system and can obtain considerable economic benefits, particularly in China. However, its environmental quality implication is not clear. In our study, Qianyanzhou station is famous for its stereoscopic agriculture pattern of Southern China, and an experimental watershed was selected as our study area. Regional characteristics of runoff and nitrogen losses were simulated by an integrated water system model (HEQM) with multi-objective calibration, and multiple agriculture practices were assessed to find the effective approach for the reduction of diffuse nitrogen losses. Results showed that daily variations of runoff and nitrogen forms were well reproduced throughout watershed, i.e., satisfactory performances for ammonium and nitrate nitrogen (NH4-N and NO3-N) loads, good performances for runoff and organic nitrogen (ON) load, and very good performance for total nitrogen (TN) load. The average loss coefficient was 62.74 kg/ha for NH4-N, 0.98 kg/ha for NO3-N, 0.0004 kg/ha for ON and 63.80 kg/ha for TN. The dominating form of nitrogen losses was NH4-N due to the applied fertilizers, and the most dramatic zones aggregated in the middle and downstream regions covered by paddy and orange orchard. In order to control diffuse nitrogen losses, the most effective practices for Qianyanzhou stereoscopic agriculture pattern were to reduce farmland planting scale in the valley by afforestation, particularly for orchard in the downstream regions, followed by fertilizer application optimization.

In the proposed approach, we use the spatially lumped catchment model StreamGEM to predict daily stream flow and nitrate concentration (mg L-1 NO3-N) in four contrasting mesoscale headwater catchments based on four years of daily rainfall, potential evapotranspiration, and stream flow measurements, and monthly or daily nitrate concentrations. Posterior model parameter distributions were estimated using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling code DREAMzs and a log likelihood function assuming heteroscedastic, t-distributed residuals. Despite high uncertainty in some model parameters, the flow and nitrate calibration data was well reproduced across all catchments (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency against Log transformed data, NSL, in the range 0.62-0.83 for daily flow and 0.17-0.88 for nitrate concentration). The slight increase in the size of the residuals for a separate validation period was considered acceptable (NSL in the range 0.60-0.89 for daily flow and 0.10-0.74 for nitrate concentration, excluding one data set with limited validation data). Proportions of flow and nitrate discharge attributed to near-surface, fast seasonal groundwater and slow deeper groundwater were consistent with expectations based on catchment geology. The results for the Weida Stream in Thuringia, Germany, usingmonthly as opposed to daily nitrate data were, for all intents and purposes, identical, suggesting that four years of monthly nitrate sampling provides sufficient information for calibration of the StreamGEM model and prediction of catchment dynamics. This study highlights the remarkable effectiveness of process based, spatially lumped modelling with commonly available monthly stream sample data, to elucidate high resolution catchment function, when appropriate calibration methods are used that correctly handle the inherent uncertainties.

A study of the effect of water quality-related variables on some age-related diseases adjusted for other well-known risk factors: a multivariate multilevel study	JOURNAL OF WATER SANITATION AND HYGIENE FOR DEVELOPMENT												Mortality rates of some diseases are affected by water quality. This research examines the roles of two factors related to water quality, namely the quality of drinking water termed 'water' and the quality of sanitation termed 'sanitation'. Two age-related diseases, cardiovascular disease and diabetes (CDD) and chronic respiratory conditions (CRC) are considered while adjusting for personal health issues, environmental and geographical factors. The dataset consists of worldwide mortality rates of adults for the mentioned diseases in 195 countries. These countries are clustered within continents geographically and literature shows the importance of considering the geographical effect of a continent. Furthermore, the two diseases were highly related to each other. Accordingly, the multivariate multilevel model was fitted to the dataset. The results indicated that when the usage of improved drinking water sources and sanitation facilities decreases, the chance of mortality from the two diseases increases. Furthermore, the difference in the risk of the diseases was statistically significant between the continents. It showed that North America and Europe had a lower risk of having CDD and CRC compared to Asia and Oceania. Therefore, the results revealed that the factors 'water' and 'sanitation' play important roles for this macro geographical variation of CDD and CRC.																	2043-9083					SEP	2017	7	3					416	425		10.2166/washdev.2017.118								WOS:000411250500008

The impact of low-flow season on source drinking water quality, Rosetta branch, Egypt	JOURNAL OF WATER SANITATION AND HYGIENE FOR DEVELOPMENT												The present work was conducted to document the problems raised regarding low-flow in the Rosetta branch, Egypt and to develop management options to protect drinking water sources. The water quality was monitored during low-flow periods at four drinking water intakes. Results showed an increase in electric conductivity (EC), ammonium(NH4), nitrite (NO2), phosphate (PO4), and total organic carbon (TOC) during the low-flow period. EC ranges from 454 to 1,062 mu S/cm and the mean value is 744. Ammonium ranges from 0.38 to 18.5 mg/L and the mean value is 5.45. NO2, PO4, and TOC have mean values of 0.73, 1.85, and 6.71 mg/L, respectively. Statistical evaluation revealed the association of NH4, EC, and PO4 that are good indicators for the load of wastewater. High ammonium often refers to a bad situation regarding oxygen while high nitrite indicates the first oxidation for wastewater through microbiological processes. The low-flow action has a serious impact on drinking water source. A high content of ammonium has delayed coagulation, enhanced algae growth, and prevented the breakpoint being reached during chlorination processes. Potential management options to deal with water scarcity and low-flow, meanwhile reducing the contaminant load in the source drinking water were proposed.																	2043-9083					SEP	2017	7	3					477	484		10.2166/washdev.2017.158								WOS:000411250500014

A total of 72 water samples were sampled in triplicate from the water pans for microbial analyses, membrane filtration technique was used in assaying for microbial counts of total coliforms, E. coli, F. streptococcus and Salmonella species in water samples. The results show that there was a significant spatial variation in F. streptococcus amongst the protected and the unprotected water pan sampled sites (p = 0.008), and there was a statistically temporal significant difference (p = 0.001) for total coliforms and Salmonella species during the dry seasons, respectively. Given the prevalence of the selected diseases causing pathogens in water above the WHO drinking water quality guidelines, households are advised to treat the water before use.																	2043-9083					SEP	2017	7	3					485	494		10.2166/washdev.2017.258								WOS:000411250500015

S.; Faustino, Maria Amparo F.; Almeida, Adelaide			Photodynamic Action against Wastewater Microorganisms and Chemical Pollutants: An Effective Approach with Low Environmental Impact	WATER												Wastewater (WW) from urban and industrial activities is often contaminated with microorganisms and chemical pollutants. To reduce the concentration of microorganisms in WW to levels comparable to those found in natural waters, the sewage effluent is usually subjected to disinfection with chlorine, ozone, or ultraviolet light, which may lead to the formation of toxic products and contribute to the selection of resistant genes. Moreover, the changing patterns of infectious diseases and the emerging of multidrug resistant microbial strains entail the development of new technologies for WW decontamination. Microbial photodynamic inactivation (PDI) with photosensitizers, oxygen, and visible light has demonstrated to be effective in the inactivation of microorganisms via photogeneration of reactive oxygen species able to induce microbial damage at the external structures level. The promising results of PDI suggest that this principle can be applied to WW treatment to inactivate microorganisms but also to photodegrade chemical pollutants. The aim of this study was to assess the applicability of PDI for the microbial and chemical decontamination of secondarily treated WW. To evaluate the efficiency of bacterial inactivation in WW, experiments were done in both phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and filtered WW with the bioluminescent Escherichia coli, using small and large volumes of WW. The potential of PDI to inactivate the native bacteria (E. coli and Enterococcus) present in WW was tested and assays without the adding of bacteria to the WW were performed. It was also tested if the same PDI protocol was able to induce phototransformation of phenol. The cationic porphyrin 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(1-methylpyridinium-4-yl)porphyrin tetra-iodide (Tetra-Py+-Me) was shown to be effective against both bacterial groups representing both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria used as microbiological parameters to instigate water quality and even showing the power to photooxidate organic compounds. As the photosensitizer when immobilized on solid matrixes can be easily removed, recovered, and reused, an effective, less-expensive, easy-applicable, and environmentally friendly technology can be applied to treat WW, inactivating microorganisms and degrading chemical contaminants at the same time.

The Spatially Explicit Load Enrichment Calculation Tool (SELECT) was developed to estimate bacterially contaminated water bodies based on spatial factors such as land use, soil, and population density. SELECT was originally automated using Visual Basics for Applications (VBA), which is no longer supported by the current version of ArcGIS. The aim of this research was to develop a new SELECT interface, pySELECT, using the Python programming language and to incorporate a rainfall-runoff E. coli transport module to simulate E. coli loads resulting from urban sources, such as dogs and on-site wastewater treatment systems. The pySELECT tool was applied to Lavon Lake, a semi urban study watershed in Northeast Texas. The highest potential E. coli loads were in the areas closest to the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, and the highest transported loads were located downstream from those identified hotspots or where the most runoff was generated. Watershed managers can use pySELECT to develop best management practices on the specific areas and fecal sources that contribute fecal contamination into a waterbody.

Assessing Thermally Stressful Events in a Rhode Island Coldwater Fish Habitat Using the SWAT Model	WATER												It has become increasingly important to recognize historical water quality trends so that the future impacts of climate change may be better understood. Climate studies have suggested that inland stream temperatures and average streamflow will increase over the next century in New England, thereby putting aquatic species sustained by coldwater habitats at risk. In this study we evaluated two different approaches for modeling historical streamflow and stream temperature in a Rhode Island, USA, watershed with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), using (i) original SWAT and (ii) SWAT plus a hydroclimatological model component that considers both hydrological inputs and air temperature. Based on daily calibration results with six years of measured streamflow and four years of stream temperature data, we examined occurrences of stressful conditions for brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) using the hydroclimatological model. SWAT with the hydroclimatological component improved modestly during calibration (NSE of 0.93, R-2 of 0.95) compared to the original SWAT (NSE of 0.83, R-2 of 0.93). Between 1980-2009, the number of stressful events, a moment in time where high or low flows occur simultaneously with stream temperatures exceeding 21 degrees C, increased by 55% and average streamflow increased by 60%. This study supports using the hydroclimatological SWAT component and provides an example method for assessing stressful conditions in southern New England's coldwater habitats.

In parallel with change in water resource characteristics generated by physical, environmental and socio-economic challenges such as: (1) uncertainties about climate change (flooding and drought) including seasonal and regional variation in precipitation; (2) significant increase in water use caused by rapid urbanization and population growth in industrialized urban areas; (3) inadequate water pricing mechanism which covers only around 80% of the production cost and makes it harder to maintain water systems; and (4) recursive water quality degradation and conflicts over water rights between regions resulting from non-point source pollution in highland versus lowland areas, Korean water policies have been developed through diverse reforms over 100 years. Nevertheless, new challenges for sustainable water management are continuously emerging. To meet those challenges we provide two ideas: (i) provider-gets-principle (payment for ecosystem services) of cost-benefit sharing among stakeholders who benefit from water use; and (ii) water pricing applying full-cost pricing-principle internalizing environmental externalities caused by the intensive water use. Funds secured from the application of those methods would facilitate: (1) support for upstream (rural) low income householders suffering from economic restrictions; (2) improvement in water facilities; and (3) efficient water use and demand management in South Korea's water sectors. We expect that this paper can examine the lessons relevant to challenges that South Korea faces and offer some implications on the formulation of new integration and further reforms of the institutions, laws and organizations responsible for managing water resources in South Korea.

We monitored ten small (4 to 38 ha) tile-drained catchments in Czechia for three to five years (2012 to 2016). The discharge was measured continuously; a regular 14-day scheme of water quality monitoring was accompanied with event sampling provided by automatic samplers in 20 to 120 min intervals. A new semi-automated algorithm was developed for the identification of runoff events (RE) based on discharge and water temperature changes. We then quantified the share of RE on the total runoff and the N and P losses, and we compared six methods for nutrient load estimation on an annual and monthly basis. The results showed considerable differences among the monitored sites, seasons, and applied methods. The share of RE on N loads was on average 5% to 30% of the total annual load, whereas for P (dissolved and total), the share of RE was on average 10% to 80% on the total annual load. The most precise method for nutrient load estimation included the RE. The methods based on point monitoring of the discharge and water quality underestimated the loads of N by 10% to 20% and of P by 30% to 80%. The acquired findings are crucial for the improvement of nutrient load assessment in tile-drained catchments, as well as for the design of various mitigation measures on tile-drained agricultural land.

Using visual methods, interpretation of water condition and pollution issues can be intuitive and easy to understand. In this paper, we present a map to represent the spatial and temporal variation of water quality change in the Yangtze River during the period from 2006 to 2015. The calendar view was developed to explore the water quality condition and water pollutants for sections of the Yangtze River. A "W" construction was proposed to arrange the weekly water quality data in a continuous logic, and qualitative colors were designed to identify the change in major pollutants throughout the period. This map provides a promising visual analytical approach to investigate the water quality status and reveal the spatial and temporal patterns of water quality change in the Yangtze River.																	2073-4441					SEP	2017	9	9							708	10.3390/w9090708								WOS:000411567200081						
J	Jiang, LP; Fang, X; Chen, G				Jiang, Liping; Fang, Xing; Chen, Gang			Refuge Lake Reclassification in 620 Minnesota Cisco Lakes under Future Climate Scenarios	WATER												Cisco (Coregonus artedi) is the most common coldwater stenothermal fish in Minnesota lakes. Water temperature (T) and dissolved oxygen (DO) in lakes are important controls of fish growth and reproduction and likely change with future climate warming. Built upon a previous study, this study uses a modified method to identify which of 620 cisco lakes in Minnesota can still support cisco populations under future climate and therefore be classified as cisco refuge lakes. The previous study used oxythermal stress parameter TDO3, the temperature at DO of 3 mg/L, simulated only from deep virtual lakes to classify 620 cisco lakes. Using four categories of virtual but representative cisco lakes in modified method, a one-dimensional water quality model MINLAKE2012 was used to simulate daily T and DO profiles in 82 virtual lakes under the past (1961-2008) and two future climate scenarios. A multiyear average of 31-day largest TDO3 over variable benchmark (VB) periods, AvgATDO3(VB), was calculated from simulated T and DO profiles using FishHabitat2013. Contour plots of AvgATDO3(VB) for four categories of virtual lakes were then developed to reclassify 620 cisco lakes into Tier 1 (AvgATDO3(VB) <11 degrees C) or Tier 2 refuge lakes, and Tier 3 non-refuge lakes (AvgATDO3(VB) > 17 degrees C). About 20% of 620 cisco lakes are projected to be refuge lakes under future climate scenarios, which is a more accurate projection (improving the prediction accuracy by similar to 6.5% from the previous study) since AvgATDO3(VB) was found to vary by lake categories.

Combined Coagulation and Ultrafiltration Process to Counteract Increasing NOM in Brown Surface Water	WATER												Membrane hybrid processes-coagulation coupled with ultrafiltration (UF)-have become a common method to comply with the legal, chemical, and microbiological requirements for drinking water. The main advantages of integrating coagulation with membrane filtration are the enhanced removal of natural organic matter (NOM) and reduced membrane fouling. With in-line coagulation, coagulants are patched into the feed stream directly prior to the membrane process, without removing the coagulated solids. Compared with conventional coagulation/sedimentation, in-line coagulation/membrane reduces the treatment time and footprint. Coagulant dosing could be challenging in raw water of varying quality; however, with relatively stable specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA), dosing can be controlled. Recent studies indicate that UV absorbance correlates well with humic substances (HS), the major fraction to be removed during coagulation. This paper describes and evaluates a 30-month UF pilot trial on the surface water of Lake Neden (Sweden), providing drinking water to 60,000 residents. In this study, automatic coagulant dosing based on online measurement was successfully applied. Online sensor data were used to identify the current optimal aluminium coagulation conditions (0.5-0.7 mg L-1) and the potential boundaries (0.9-1.2 mg L-1) for efficient future (2040) NOM removal. The potential increase in NOM could affect the Al dose and drinking water quality significantly within 20 years, should the current trends in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) prevail. UV absorbance, the freshness index, and liquid chromatography-organic carbon detection (LC-OCD) measurements were used to optimise the process. Careful cross-calibration of raw and filtered samples is recommended when using online sensor data for process optimisation, even in low-turbidity water (formazin nephelometric unit (FNU) < 5).																	2073-4441					SEP	2017	9	9							697	10.3390/w9090697								WOS:000411567200070

Water intake from a river and a neighboring urban area led to eutrophication and a strong cyanobacterial water bloom. Both the water intake and recreation were threatened due to the possible influence of cyanobacterial toxins. The lake was subjected to three sustainable restoration methods: aeration of sediment-water; iron addition to precipitate P, and; biomanipulation. The goal of our study was to determine the changes in the taxonomic composition of phytoplankton and chemical water variables during restoration measures. A comparison of the data obtained during this research with the pre-restoration data showed that, as a result of the treatments orthophosphates decreased, rarely exceeding 0.06 mg P.L-1, and cyanobacterial water blooms disappeared. Cyanobacteria were found in the lake but they were not abundant. Chrysophytes and diatoms were the most abundant in springtime of each year. Green algae, desmids and chrysophytes were particularly abundant in summer, while cryptophytes predominated in autumn. Algae from all these groups do not pose a threat to either recreation or water intake. The deep chlorophyll maximum occurring in summer at a depth of 5 m as a result of restoration confirms the lower trophic status of the lake, alluding to mesotrophic conditions.

To resolve the issues, the Chinese government launched a sponge city construction program in 2015. While the sponge city construction initiative is drawing attention and is spreading fast nationwide, some challenges and risks remain. This study surveyed progress of all 30 pilot sponge cities and identified a broad array of challenges from technical, physical, regulatory, and financial, to community and institutional. The most dominant challenges involve uncertainties and risks. To resolve the issues, this study also identified various opportunities to improve China's sponge city construction program. Based on the results, recommendations are proposed including urging local governments to adopt sponge city regulations and permits to alleviate water quality and urban pluvial flooding issues, fully measuring and accounting for economic and environmental benefits, embracing regional flexibility and results-oriented approaches, and focusing on a wider range of funding resources to finance the sponge city program. Coordination among other government agencies is critical, and this is true at all level of governments. Only through greater coordination, education, and broader funding could the sponge city program be advanced meaningfully and sustainably.																	2073-4441					SEP	2017	9	9							594	10.3390/w9090594								WOS:000411567200001

Exploring the dynamics in the associated factors is essential for water pollution management and control. GIS interpolation, principal component analysis (PCA) and multivariate statistical techniques were used to identify the main pollution sources in different areas of Honghu Lake. The results indicate that the spatial distribution of the concentrations of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphate (TP), ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N), and permanganate index (CODMn) have similar characteristics and that their values gradually increased from south to north during the three seasons in Honghu Lake. The major influencing factors of water quality varied across the different areas and seasons. The relatively high concentrations of TN and TP, which might limit the growth of submerged aquatic plants, were mainly caused by anthropogenic factors. Our work suggests that spatial analyses combined with PCA are useful for investigating the factors that influence water quality and submerged aquatic plant biomass in different areas of a lake. These findings provide sound information for the future water quality management of the lake or even the entire lake basin.																	2073-4441					SEP	2017	9	9							707	10.3390/w9090707								WOS:000411567200080

Adapting the Relaxed Tanks-in-Series Model for Stormwater Wetland Water Quality Performance	WATER												Across the globe, water quality standards have been implemented to protect receiving waters from stormwater pollution, motivating regulators (and consequently designers) to develop tools to predict the performance of stormwater control measures such as constructed stormwater wetlands (CSWs). The goal of this study was to determine how well the relaxed tanks-in-series (P-k-C*) model described the performance of CSWs in North Carolina. Storm events monitored at 10 CSWs in North Carolina were used for calibrating the model, and statistical evaluations concluded the model could adequately predict the performance for all pollutants except organic nitrogen. Nash-Sutcliff calibration/validation values were determined to be 0.72/0.78, 0.78/0.74, 0.91/0.87, 0.72/0.62, 0.88/0.73, and 0.91/0.63 for total nitrogen, total ammoniacal nitrogen, oxidized nitrogen, organic nitrogen, total phosphorus, and total suspended solids, respectively. Sensitivity analysis revealed only one calibration parameter with strong sensitivity, the Arrhenius coefficient (temperature dependent model coefficient). With this model, CSWs can be optimized to treat watershed-specific influent concentrations to meet effluent targets. In general, the current design technique used in North Carolina and many other locations (a first flush volume detention method) oversizes CSWs for water quality vis-a-vis the method herein, suggesting improved designs for water quality may be possible through scientifically-informed methods.																	2073-4441					SEP	2017	9	9							691	10.3390/w9090691								WOS:000411567200064						
J	Nam, G; Choi, YH; Lee, N; Ahn, JW				Nam, Gnu; Choi, Young-Hoon; Lee, Namju; Ahn, Ji Whan			Effect by Alkaline Flocculation of Algae and Phosphorous from Water Using a Calcined Waste Oyster Shell	WATER												Alkaline flocculation has been considered as a potential candidate to remove algae and eutrophic substances from water. A number of researches using low-cost and environmentally friendly methods have been suggested to optimize removal efficiency. In this study, a calcium-containing waste oyster shell, as an environmentally friendly substance, has been used to treat phosphorous, a eutrophic substance, and to remove algae from the fresh water simultaneously. The X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) analysis showed that CaO was a major phase in a raw oyster shell, which played an important role for flocculation of phosphorous as well as algae. In order to eliminate the algae or phosphorous effectively, oyster shell was calcined at 1000 degrees C and hydrated in water. The slurry of hydrated calcined oyster shell, from 5 g/L to 12.5 g/L, was utilized in this experiment, where the experimental results were compared with that of dolomite. A series of experimental investigations, such as pH and turbidity changes using the water quality analyzer and UV-Visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), demonstrated that the algae were efficiently removed. In addition, total phosphorous (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) analyses at different amounts of slurries of the hydrated calcined oyster shell showed that almost all the phosphorous was removed at 7.5 g/L of hydrated oyster shell, but due to the high solubility of nitrogen compounds, no obvious effect for the removal of nitrogen was observed. Furthermore, powder X-ray diffractions (PXRD) showed that Ca(OH)(2) compounds were transformed to the phosphate compound, suggesting that the oyster shell caused flocculation by chemically forming with phosphorous ions.																	2073-4441					SEP	2017	9	9							661	10.3390/w9090661								WOS:000411567200034

The development of Watershed Protection Plans and Total Maximum Daily Loads require systematic monitoring of waterbodies. In this study, optimum water quality monitoring networks were selected to assess E. coli loads in the Guadalupe River and San Antonio River basins. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) was applied to select monitoring stations using the mean annual E. coli flux from the Spatially Referenced Regression Model on Watershed Attributes (SPARROW). The objectives of the GA were to minimize the number of monitoring stations, include large values of the mean annual E. coli flux, and minimize uncertainty of the flux estimations. Constraints related to the monitoring of critical locations were included in a multi-objective optimization problem. The SPARROW model was applied to the optimized GA solution sets, which were compared using the objective values and statistical indices. The best GA-generated alternative set adequately represented the San Antonio River basin, in good agreement with a previous study conducted using only SPARROW. The application of the GA ensured the inclusion of the monitoring stations with large values of E. coli flux, which reflected high-risk areas within the watershed.

To explore the influences of sediments on the water quality of reservoirs, the spatial distribution, adsorption/release characteristics, and environment influence of sediment pollutants should be analyzed. In this paper, the spatial distributions of phosphorus (P) and P fractions in the Biliuhe reservoir (river valley reservoirs) sediments were investigated. The adsorption and release characteristics of sediments P were studied in the experiment, while its environmental influence was analyzed too. The results indicate that the concentration of P in sediments was higher at the dam and the Zhongling site, while lower at other entrances of the reservoir and the smallest in the water-level fluctuating zone. Total Phosphorus (TP) varied from 355.46 to 764.57 mg/kg. Inorganic Phosphorus (IP) was the main form of TP in sediments, making up a proportion of 56-75%, while the correlation coefficient of P bound to Al, Fe, and Mn oxides was 0.922. Hydroxide (Fe/Al-P) was the main form of IP, which accounted for 46-83% with a correlation coefficient of 0.888. The maximum adsorption capacity calculated by Langmuir model was between 714.29 and 3333.33 mg/kg. The adsorption efficiency obtained by the Freundlich model was within the range of 0.40-1.42, which indicated that P adsorption was more difficult in the water-level fluctuating zone. The critical adsorption and release concentration range was 0.1-0.2 mg/L for the majority of the sampling points. The amount of P released in 24 h (the initial concentration of TP in the overlying water was 0 mg/L) accounted for 1.15-4.16% of TP in sediments, which was higher than the average concentration in the reservoir. It is concluded that the sediment is the potential pollution source. The relationship between the change of environmental factors and the release of sediment contaminants should be considered in the future.																	2073-4441					SEP	2017	9	9							724	10.3390/w9090724								WOS:000411567200096						
J	Wu, YF; Dai, HL; Wu, JY				Wu, Yifeng; Dai, Hongliang; Wu, Jianyong			Comparative Study on Influences of Bank Slope Ecological Revetments on Water Quality Purification Pretreating Low-Polluted Waters	WATER												To improve aquatic environmental quality and maintain channel stability against soil erosion, ecological bank slope revetments for surface water bodies were developed using a combination of prefabricated porous concrete spheres and vegetation methods, and a model set-up consisting of two equal-sized ditches with different types of bank slope revetments was constructed to evaluate the purification effects of ecological and hard revetments on water quality. The slope of one ditch was embanked with ecological revetments as an experimental treatment, while the other was embanked with hard revetments as a control. Pollutant removal from the ecological bank revetment ditch was significantly better in terms of the overall removal efficiencies of the chemical oxygen demand of manganese (CODMn), ammonia, total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP), with two-to four-fold greater removal compared with that from hard slope revetments under the same operational conditions. Nutrient pollutants, including ammonia, TN, and TP had higher removal efficiencies than that for CODMn in both experimental ditches. The dependence of the first-order rate constant (k(20)) and temperature coefficient (theta) obtained from the Arrhenius equation indicated that the removal efficiencies for ammonia, TN, and TP were higher with greater rate constants (k(20)) in the experimental ditch. In the ecological revetment ditch, the k(20) values for CODMn, ammonia, TN, and TP were 0.054, 0.378, 0.222, and 0.266 respectively, around three-fold the values observed in the hard revetment ditch, but there was no obvious difference in theta values between the two ditches. The k(20) values of TN and TP in both ditches showed significant positive correlations with seasonal shifts, as the removal of nutrient pollutants is highly sensitive to water temperatures.																	2073-4441					SEP	2017	9	9							636	10.3390/w9090636								WOS:000411567200010						
J	Zhu, SL; Zhang, ZL; Liu, XB				Zhu, Senlin; Zhang, Zhonglong; Liu, Xiaobo			Enhanced Two Dimensional Hydrodynamic and Water Quality Model (CE-QUAL-W2) for Simulating Mercury Transport and Cycling in Water Bodies	WATER												CE-QUAL-W2 (W2) is a widely-used two-dimensional, laterally averaged, longitudinal/vertical, hydrodynamic and water quality model. This model was modified and enhanced to include a mercury (Hg) simulation module for simulating Hg transport and cycling in water bodies. The Hg simulation module in W2 is able to model the physical and biochemical processes including adsorption and desorption of Hg species on multi-solids, settling and resuspension, sediment burial of adsorbed Hg, diffusive exchange between water column and sediment layer, volatilization, and biogeochemical transformations among Hg species. This paper describes the Hg simulation module, W2 model validation and its application to the Xiaxi River, China, a historical Hg contaminated water body. The W2 model was evaluated using the Xiaxi River data collected in 2007 and 2008. Model results show that W2 was able to predict the total Hg and methylmercury concentrations observed for the Xiaxi River. The Xiaxi River W2 model also provides a foundation for the future investigations of Hg contamination in the Xiaxi River. This application demonstrated the W2 model capability in predicting complex transport and cycling of Hg species in water bodies.																	2073-4441					SEP	2017	9	9							643	10.3390/w9090643								WOS:000411567200017

A transition describes the pathway from an initial to a final planning stage including the structural and functional changes on the infrastructure over time. A methodology is presented where consecutive WDSs under changing conditions are automatically created, simulated and then analyzed at specific points in time during a transition process of several decades. Consequential WDS analyses include (a) uncertain network structure, (b) temporal and spatial demand variation and (c) network displacement. With the proposed approach, it is possible to identify robust WDS structures and critical points in time for which sufficient hydraulic and water quality requirements cannot be ensured to the customers. The approach is applied to a case study, where a WDS transition of epic dimensions is currently taking place due to a city relocation. The resulting necessity of its WDS transition is modelled with automatically created planning options for consecutive years of the transition process. For the investigated case study, we tested a traditional "doing-all-at-the-end" approach, where necessary pipe upgrades are performed at the last stages of the transition process. Results show that the sole design of the desired final-stage WDS is insufficient. Owing to the drastic network deconstruction and the stepwise "loss of capacity", critical pipes must be redesigned at earlier stages to maintain acceptable service levels for most of the investigated future scenarios.

Characterising urban zinc generation to identify surface pollutant hotspots in a low intensity rainfall climate	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Characterising stormwater runoff quality provides useful insights into the dynamics of pollutant generation and wash off rates. These can be used to prioritise stormwater management strategies. This study examined the effects of a low intensity rainfall climate on zinc contributions from different impermeable urban surface types. First flush (FF) and steady state samples were collected from seven different surfaces for characterisation, and the data were also used to calibrate an event-based pollutant load model to predict individual 'hotspot' surfaces across the catchment. Unpainted galvanised roofs generated very high concentrations of zinc, primarily in the more biologically available dissolved form. An older, unpainted galvanised roof had FF concentrations averaging 32,338 mu g/L, while the new unpainted roof averaged 4,782 mu g/L. Roads and carparks also had elevated zinc, but FF concentrations averaged only 822-1,584 mu g/L. Modelling and mapping expected zinc loads from individual impermeable surfaces across the catchment identified specific commercial roof surfaces to be targeted for zinc management. The results validate a policy strategy to replace old galvanised roof materials and avoid unpainted galvanised roofing in future urban development for better urban water quality outcomes. In the interim, readily-implemented treatment options are required to help mitigate chronic zinc impacts on receiving waterways.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				SEP	2017	76	6					1370	1377		10.2166/wst.2017.306								WOS:000411845600009	28953463					
J	Chounlamany, V; Tanchuling, MA; Inoue, T				Chounlamany, Vanseng; Antonia Tanchuling, Maria; Inoue, Takanobu			Spatial and temporal variation of water quality of a segment of Marikina River using multivariate statistical methods	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Payatas landfill in Quezon City, Philippines, releases leachate to the Marikina River through a creek. Multivariate statistical techniques were applied to study temporal and spatial variations in water quality of a segment of the Marikina River. The data set included 12 physico-chemical parameters for five monitoring stations over a year. Cluster analysis grouped the monitoring stations into four clusters and identified January-May as dry season and June-September as wet season. Principal components analysis showed that three latent factors are responsible for the data set explaining 83% of its total variance. The chemical oxygen demand, biochemical oxygen demand, total dissolved solids, Cl- and PO43- are influenced by anthropogenic impact/eutrophication pollution from point sources. Total suspended solids, turbidity and SO42- are influenced by rain and soil erosion. The highest state of pollution is at the Payatas creek outfall from March to May, whereas at downstream stations it is in May. The current study indicates that the river monitoring requires only four stations, nine water quality parameters and testing over three specific months of the year. The findings of this study imply that Payatas landfill requires a proper leachate collection and treatment system to reduce its impact on the Marikina River.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				SEP	2017	76	6					1510	1522		10.2166/wst.2017.279								WOS:000411845600023	28953477					
J	Herojeet, R; Rishi, MS; Lata, R; Dolma, K				Herojeet, Rajkumar; Rishi, Madhuri S.; Lata, Renu; Dolma, Konchok			Quality characterization and pollution source identification of surface water using multivariate statistical techniques, Nalagarh Valley, Himachal Pradesh, India	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Sirsa River flows through the central part of the Nalagarh valley, belongs to the rapid industrial belt of Baddi, Barotiwala and Nalagarh (BBN). The appraisal of surface water quality to ascertain its utility in such ecologically sensitive areas is need of the hour. The present study envisages the application of multivariate analysis, water utility class and conventional graphical representation to reveal the hidden factor responsible for deterioration of water quality and determine the hydrochemical facies and its evolution processes of water types in Nalagarh valley, India. The quality assessment is made by estimating pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), total hardness, major ions (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO3-, Cl-, SO42-, NO3- and PO43-), dissolved oxygen (DO), biological oxygen demand (BOD) and total coliform (TC) to determine its suitability for drinking and domestic purposes. The parameters like pH, TDS, TH, Ca2+, HCO3-, Cl-, SO42-, NO3- are within the desirable limit as per Bureau of Indian Standards (Indian Standard Drinking Water Specification (Second Edition) IS:10500. Indian Standard Institute, New Delhi, pp 1-18, 2012). Mg2+, Na+ and K+ ions for pre monsoon and EC during pre and post monsoon at few sites and approx 40% samples of BOD and TC for both seasons exceeds the permissible limits indicate organic contamination from human activities. Water quality classification for designated use indicates that maximum surface water samples are not suitable for drinking water source without conventional treatment. The result of piper trillinear and Chadha's diagram classified majority of surface water samples for both seasons fall in the fields of Ca2+-Mg2+-HCO3- water type indicating temporary hardness. PCA and CA reveal that the surface water chemistry is influenced by natural factors such as weathering of minerals, ion exchange processes and anthropogenic factors. Thus, the present paper illustrates the importance of multivariate techniques for reliable quality characterization of surface water quality to develop effective pollution reduction strategies and maintain a fine balance between the industrialization and ecological integrity.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				SEP	2017	7	5					2137	2156		10.1007/s13201-017-0600-y								WOS:000411096700004						
J	Singaraja, C				Singaraja, C.			Relevance of water quality index for groundwater quality evaluation: Thoothukudi District, Tamil Nadu, India	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The present hydrogeochemical study was confined to the Thoothukudi District in Tamilnadu, India. A total of 100 representative water samples were collected during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon and analyzed for the major cations (sodium, calcium, magnesium and potassium) and anions (chloride, sulfate, bicarbonate, fluoride and nitrate) along with various physical and chemical parameters (pH, total dissolved salts and electrical conductivity). Water quality index rating was calculated to quantify the overall water quality for human consumption. The PRM samples exhibit poor quality in greater percentage when compared with POM due to dilution of ions and agricultural impact. The overlay of WQI with chloride and EC corresponds to the same locations indicating the poor quality of groundwater in the study area. Sodium (Na %), sodium absorption ratio (SAR), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), residual sodium bicarbonate, permeability index (PI), magnesium hazards (MH), Kelly's ratio (KR), potential salinity (PS) and Puri's salt index (PSI) and domestic quality parameters such as total hardness (TH), temporary, permanent hardness and corrosivity ratio (CR) were calculated. The majority of the samples were not suitable for drinking, irrigation and domestic purposes in the study area. In this study, the analysis of salinization/freshening processes was carried out through binary diagrams such as of mole ratios of SO42-/Cl- and Cl-/EC that clearly classify the sources of seawater intrusion and salt-pan contamination. Spatial diagram BEX was used to find whether the aquifer was in the salinization region or in the freshening encroachment region.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				SEP	2017	7	5					2157	2173		10.1007/s13201-017-0594-5								WOS:000411096700005

Since the rivers pass through the cities, industrial and agricultural centers, these have been considered as place to dispose the sewages. This issue is more important when the river is one of the main sources of water supplying for drinking, agricultural and industrial utilizations. The goal of the present study was assessing the physicochemical characteristics of the Tireh River water. The Tireh River is the main river in the Karkheh catchment in the Iran. To this end, 14 sampling stations for measuring the physicochemical properties of Tireh River along the two main cities (Borujerd and Dorud) were measured. The results showed that (except SO4) Mg, Ca and other anions and cations have concentrations under WHO standard limitation. Almost all samples have suitable conditions for drinking with regard to the WHO standard and in comparison with agricultural standard (FAO Standard), and the potential of water is suitable for irrigation purposes. According to Wilcox diagram, 78 % of samples were at the C3-S1 and 21.5 % were at C2-S1 classes. The piper diagram shows that most of samples are bicarbonate and calcic facies.

The study was done for 105 days of culture period in zero water exchange. All of the organic loaded in the culture tanks identified comes from the shrimp feces, uneaten fed, and the decomposed macro- and microorganisms died in the culture tanks. All of the microscopic organisms in the biofloc were identified using Advance microscopes Nikon 80i. From the present study, there were abundances and high varieties of phytoplankton, zooplankton, protozoa, nematodes and algae species identified as aggregates together in the flocs accumulation. All of these microscopic organisms identified implemented the symbiotic process together for food supply, become the algae grazer, act as natural water stabilizer in regulating the nutrients in culture tank and serve as decomposer for dead organic matter in the water environment. Heterotrophic bacteria identified from Pseudomonas and Aeromonas family consumed the organic matter loaded at the bottom of culture tank and converted items through chemical process as useful protein food to be consumed back by the shrimp. Overall it can be concluded that the biofloc organisms identified really contributed as natural bioremediation agents in zero water exchange culture system to ensure the water quality in the optimal condition until the end of culture period.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				SEP	2017	7	5					2437	2446		10.1007/s13201-016-0421-4								WOS:000411096700029

Groundwater quality assessment using geoelectrical and geochemical approaches: case study of Abi area, southeastern Nigeria	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The electrical resistivity technique which involved the Schlumberger depth sounding method and geochemical analyses of water samples collected from boreholes was used to investigate the suitability of groundwater aquifers in Abi for drinking and irrigation purposes. Fifty randomly located electrical resistivity data were collected, modeled, and interpreted after calibration with lithologic logs. Ten borehole water samples were collected and analysed to determine anion, cation concentrations and some physical and chemical parameters, such as water colour, temperature, total dissolved solids, and electrical conductivity. The results show that the lithostratigraphy of the study area is composed of sands, sandstones (fractured, consolidated and loosed), siltstones, shales (compacted and fractured) of the Asu River Group, Eze-Aku Formation which comprises the aquifer units, and the Nkporo Shale Formation. The aquifer conduits are known to be rich in silicate minerals, and the groundwater samples in some locations show a significant amount of Ca2+,Mg2+, and Na2+. These cations balanced the consumption of H+ during the hydrolytic alteration of silicate minerals. The geochemical analysis of groundwater samples revealed dominant calcium-magnesium-carbonatebicarbonate water facies. Irrigation water quality parameters, such as sodium absorption ratio, percentage of sodium, and permeability index, were calculated based on the physico-chemical analyses. The groundwater quality was observed to be influenced by the interaction of some geologic processes but was classified to be good to excellent, indicating its suitability for domestic and irrigation purposes.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				SEP	2017	7	5					2463	2478		10.1007/s13201-016-0439-7								WOS:000411096700031

Evaluation of water quality and hydrogeochemistry of surface and groundwater, Tiruvallur District, Tamil Nadu, India	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Water quality of Tiruvallur Taluk of Tiruvallur district, Tamil Nadu, India has been analysed to assess its suitability in relation to domestic and agricultural uses. Thirty water samples, including 8 surface water (S), 22 groundwater samples [15 shallow ground waters (SW) and 7 deep ground waters (DW)], were collected to assess the various physico-chemical parameters such as Temperature, pH, Electrical conductivity (EC), Total dissolved solids (TDS), cations (Ca, Mg, Na, K), anions (CO3, HCO3, Cl, SO4, NO3, PO4) and trace elements (Fe, Mn, Zn). Various irrigation water quality diagrams and parameters such as United states salinity laboratory (USSL), Wilcox, sodium absorption ratio (SAR), sodium percentage (Na %), Residual sodium carbonate (RSC), Residual Sodium Bicarbonate (RSBC) and Kelley's ratio revealed that most of the water samples are suitable for irrigation. Langelier Saturation Index (LSI) values suggest that the water is slightly corrosive and non-scale forming in nature. Gibbs plot suggests that the study area is dominated by evaporation and rock-water dominance process. Piper plot indicates the chemical composition of water, chiefly controlled by dissolution and mixing of irrigation return flow.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				SEP	2017	7	5					2533	2544		10.1007/s13201-016-0447-7								WOS:000411096700037						
J	Xavier, MLM; Janzen, JG				Machado Xavier, Manoel Lucas; Janzen, Johannes Gerson			Effects of inlet momentum and orientation on the hydraulic performance of water storage tanks	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The influence of inlet momentum and inlet orientation on hydraulic performance of cylindrical water process tanks were investigated using a factorial design strategy. The hydraulic performance of the tanks was assessed with a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model, which calculated the flow fields and the residence time distribution (RTD). RTDs were used to quantify the tanks hydraulic performance using hydraulic indexes that represent short-circuiting, mixing, and moment. These indexes were later associated with the effluent fraction of disinfectant (inlet and outlet disinfectant ratio). For small depth-to-diameter ratios, the inlet orientation and the inlet momentum were the most important factors regarding the hydraulic indexes and the effluent fraction of disinfectant, respectively. A poor correlation was obtained between the hydraulic indexes and the effluent fraction of disinfectant, indicating that they are not good predictors for water quality. For large depth-to-diameter ratios, the inlet orientation had the most significant effect on both the hydraulic indexes and effluent fraction of disinfectant. The short-circuiting and mixing indexes presented a good correlation with water quality for this case.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				SEP	2017	7	5					2545	2557		10.1007/s13201-016-0449-5								WOS:000411096700038

Bacteriological quality of drinking water in the Atebubu-Amantin District of the Brong-Ahafo Region of Ghana	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The study was carried out to determine the bacteriological safety of water in hand-dug wells in the Atebubu-Amantin District of the Brong-Ahafo Region in Ghana. A total of 60 samples were collected from ten hand dug wells and analysed for total coliform (TC), faecal coliform (FC), E. coli (EC), Salmonella spp. (SP) and Enterococcus spp. (ES). Data was collected in both the rainy and the dry seasons. The results obtained showed that water from all the wells in the study area did not meet the World Health Organisation guideline and Ghana standard for drinking water of zero (0) coliform forming unit (cfu) per 100 ml for TC, FC, EC, SP and ES, respectively. Contamination was found to be high in the wells during the wet season as compared to the dry season. Wells (A1 to A5) which were close to septic tanks had high bacteria counts in both seasons. The total coliform counts ranged from 2.98 to 5.93 log cfu/100 ml in the wet season and 3.10-5.03 log cfu/100 ml in the dry season. There was drastic reduction of faecal coliform count from a range of 2.78-4.55 log cfu/100 ml in the wet season to 1.70-3.51 log cfu/100 ml in the dry season. The high bacteria count in wells A1 to A5 could be attributed to the closeness of the wells to the septic tank, and contaminant transport through the saturated underground zones. It is recommended that the water should be treated properly before drinking.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				SEP	2017	7	5					2571	2576		10.1007/s13201-016-0457-5								WOS:000411096700040

Multivariate statistical evaluation of heavy metals in the surface water sources of Jia Bharali river basin, North Brahmaputra plain, India	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The aim of this study was to assess the quality of surfacewater sources in the Jia Bharali river basin and adjoining areas of the Himalayan foothills with respect to heavy elements viz. (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn) by hydrochemical and multivariate statistical techniques, such as cluster analysis (CA) and principal component analysis (PCA). This study presents the first ever systematic analysis on toxic elements of water samples collected from 35 different surface water sources in both the dry and wet seasons for a duration of 2 hydrological years (2009-2011). Varimax factors extracted by principal component analysis indicates anthropogenic (domestic and agricultural run-off) and geogenic influences on the trace elements. Hierarchical cluster analysis grouped 35 surfacewater sources into three statistically significant clusters based on the similarity of water quality characteristics. This study illustrates the usefulness of multivariate statistical techniques for analysis and interpretation of complex data sets, and in water quality assessment, identification of pollution sources/factors and understanding temporal/spatial variations in water quality for effective surfacewater quality management.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				SEP	2017	7	5					2577	2586		10.1007/s13201-016-0453-9								WOS:000411096700041

Impact of extreme climate events on water supply sustainability in Egypt: case studies in Alexandria region and Upper Egypt	JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE												Water resources in Egypt have become stressed due to changes in climate patterns. Egypt is characterized by two seasons, a mild, wet winter and a hot, dry summer. In recent years, many areas have become vulnerable to the impact of extreme climate events. The impact of these events on water supplies has become more pronounced. This study states that there is a tangible impact of extreme climate events upon both water resources quality and water supplies. The Nile river water turbidity was investigated as an operational indicator for the water treatment plants (WTPs). The results illustrated that an unprecedented increase in average turbidity of raw water in Upper Egypt (from 4 up to 110 NTU) led to a cut in water supplies for up to 100 hours in some areas. While in Alexandria the turbidity did affect WTP operation efficiency, safe water could still be produced. Cuts in water supply would have an impact on hygiene and make people prone to use unsafe water sources. These consequences stimulate water supply bodies to develop action plans to mitigate and/or avoid such potential impacts on public health. This study suggests proposed steps to develop an appropriate plan to face such extreme events.																	2040-2244					SEP	2017	8	3					484	494		10.2166/wcc.2017.111								WOS:000410849900009

Effect of Land Cover Changes on the Sediment and Water Quality Characteristics of Brays Bayou Watershed	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Rapid increase in impervious surfaces due to urbanization often intensifies the frequency of flooding which in turn increases runoff of environmental pollutants. The Brays Bayouwatershed (BBW) is a heavily urbanized and densely populated watershed located mostly in Harris County, TX. The objectives of our study are (1) to analyze and interpret the spatial and temporal land use and land cover changes in BBW and (2) to determine nutrient, heavy metal, and bacterial contamination in the Brays Bayou. Water and sediment samples were collected from selected sampling locations along the Brays Bayou and analyzed for various nutrient and metal concentrations. Bacterial analysis was conducted to enumerate the fecal coliform bacteria in water samples. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite images sampled from over three decades (19802010) for the BBW study area were processed and analyzed for land use and land cover changes. Our remote sensing analysis revealed that the BBW lost about 28.4% (9463 acres) vegetation during the period of 1984 to 2010. The loss in vegetative areas resulted in increased impervious surface areas. In sediment samples, increasing trends for Al, Cu, Fe, Pb, and Zn were observed towards the downstream of Brays Bayou. Lead concentrations were found at the highest concentration (70 mg/kg) in certain Brays Bayou sampling locations. Escherichia coli concentrations decreased towards the downstream of Brays Bayou and were found below 200 maximum probable numbers/100 ml. Integration of remote sensing along with the chemical and biological analysis helped to understand the impact of land cover changes on the bayou water quality.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				SEP	2017	228	9							336	10.1007/s11270-017-3538-7								WOS:000410827400019

Water Quality and Toxicological Impact Assessment Using the Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans Bioassay in a Long-Term Intensive Agricultural Area	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Due to intensive agricultural activities to meet the growing needs for food, large volumes of water are consumed and an increasing amount of agrochemicals are released into the environment threatening the aquatic ecosystem. In order to ensure a sustainable agricultural management, it is crucial to develop an integrated water assessment plan that includes not only water quantity and quality but also toxicological assessments. The Pergamino River basin (province of Buenos Aires, Argentina) was selected as a representative case of study to monitor and assess the impact of both the long-term intensification of soybean production and fast-growing urban development on surface and ground-water sources. Physicochemical analyses and a Water Quality Index were determined and showed that water quality falls into the marginal category, compromising the irrigation purposes and threatening aquatic life. Glyphosate and aminomethylphosphonic acid were detected at least once in all sites. Caenorhabditis elegans toxic bioassays were performed and a toxicological ranking was developed. This analysis proved to be useful to detect toxicity even when water parameters met regulatory requirements and water quality seemed to be satisfactory. This research constitutes a valuable model to be replicated in other river basins that have been impacted by intensive agriculture and growing urban development in order to assess water quality conditions and ensure sound water resources management.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				SEP	2017	228	9							333	10.1007/s11270-017-3512-4								WOS:000410827400016

In order to control weeds in the plantations and increase productivity, the mixing of different herbicides during spraying operations is commonplace. This practice is unregulated, and the impact on water quality and nontarget tropical species is poorly understood. In the present work, exposure and recovery assays were used to evaluate antioxidant enzyme activity and histopathological alterations in the liver of tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) following exposure to mixtures of the herbicides widely used in sugarcane crops: ametryn (AMT), tebuthiuron (TBUT), diuron (DIU), and hexazinone (HZN). The greatest biochemical changes were observed for the mixture (DIU+HZN)+AMT+TBUT at the highest concentration tested (1/10 96hLC50). This mixture caused a significant increase (p < 0.01) of approximately 82% in GST activity after 14 days of exposure. For three of the mixtures evaluated, GST and CAT could be considered potential biochemical biomarkers of exposure to the herbicide mixtures due to the frequency, intensity, and statistical significance of alterations in the assimilation phase. Although morphological changes were evident in the hepatic tissue, severe damage was only noted in a few samples, and there were no statistically significant differences, relative to the control. The results of hepatic lesion recovery assays suggested that the most sensitive individuals affected by the xenobiotics were unable to achieve full recovery. It is anticipated that the data obtained may assist in the selection of biomarkers for monitoring purposes, as well as in reinforcing standards of conduct in the use of agrochemical mixtures in agriculture.

J	Olofsson, B; Rasul, H; Lundmark, A				Olofsson, Bo; Rasul, Hedi; Lundmark, Annika			Spread of Water-Borne Pollutants at Traffic Accidents on Roads	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Traffic accidents sometimes lead to the spread of hazardous compounds to the environment. Accidental spills of hazardous compounds on roads in the vicinity of vulnerable objects such as water supplies pose a serious threat to water quality and have to be assessed. This study compared three different assessment methods, electrical resistivity measurements, analytical flow calculations, and 1D and 2D dynamic flow modeling, to describe rapid transport processes in the road shoulder and roadside verge after a major spill. The infiltration and flow paths of water-borne substances were described during simulated discharge of pollutants on different road types. Full-scale tracer tests using sodium chloride were carried out at nine different road locations in Sweden. Analysis of grain size distribution and infiltrometer tests were carried out at the road shoulder and verges. The pathways and travel times were traced using resistivity measurements and 3D inverse modeling. The resistivity measurements were compared to analytical flow calculations and 1D and 2D dynamic modeling. All measurement sites were highly heterogeneous, which caused preferential flow. Vertical flow velocities of 1.4-8.6 x 10(-4) m/s were measured. The results of the analytical calculations and flow modeling were of the same order of magnitude. The measurements showed that almost all infiltration goes directly into the road embankment, hence the composition and structure of the built-up road must be considered. The non-destructive resistivity measurements and 3D modeling provided useful information for clarifying the infiltration and flow pattern of water-borne compounds from road runoff.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				SEP	2017	228	9							323	10.1007/s11270-017-3477-3								WOS:000410827400006	28845063

Influences of Coal Ash Leachates and Emergent Macrophytes on Water Quality in Wetland Microcosms	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												The storage of coal combustion residue (CCR) in surface water impoundments may have an impact on nearby water quality and aquatic ecosystems. CCR contains leachable trace elements that can enter nearby waters through spills and monitored discharge. It is important, therefore, to understand their environmental fate in affected systems. This experiment examined trace element leachability into freshwater from fly ash (FA), the most common form of CCR. The effects on water quality of FA derived from both high and low sulfur coal sources as well as the influences of two different emergent macrophytes, Juncus effusus and Eleocharis quadrangulata, were evaluated in wetland microcosms. FA leachate dosings increased water electric conductivity (EC), altered pH, and, most notably, elevated the concentrations of boron (B), molybdenum (Mo), and manganese (Mn). The presence of either macrophyte species helped reduce elevated EC, and B, Mo, and Mn concentrations over time, relative to microcosms containing no plants. B and Mo appeared to bioaccumulate in the plant tissue from the water when elevated by FA dosing, while Mn was not higher in plants dosed with FA leachates. The results of this study indicate that emergent macrophytes could help ameliorate downstream water contamination from CCR storage facilities and could potentially be utilized in wetland filtration systems to treat CCR wastewater before discharge. Additionally, measuring elevated B and Mo in aquatic plants may have potential as a monitoring tool for downstream CCR contamination.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				SEP	2017	228	9							344	10.1007/s11270-017-3520-4								WOS:000410827400027

WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Salt applied to roads for de-icing can persist for decades in watersheds, and understanding rates of salt accumulation and export is important for anticipating the magnitude and duration of its environmental impacts. Salt removal is affected by storm frequency and intensity, both of which are projected to change as a result of anthropogenic climate change. To examine the potential outcomes of changing storm regimes on rates of salt export from watersheds, we studied chloride concentrations in baseflow and surface runoff in 5 years of streamflow data (taken at 20-min intervals) in a headwater tributary of the Hudson River. Baseflow, with chloride concentrations of 200-230 mg/L year-round, dominated streamflow, except during and after large storms, and accounted for about 90% of chloride export from the watershed. Extreme precipitation events (e.g., tropical storms) increased salt export mainly by increasing baseflow discharge, which remained elevated long after storms ended. While intense events accomplished more salt export per storm, they did not produce disproportionately higher export per volume of precipitation, compared to smaller rain events. Chloride export in a wet year was almost twice that in a dry year, despite less than a doubling of rainfall. Under future climate conditions, if winter precipitation shifts toward a higher proportion of rainfall, or summers experience a greater frequency of tropical storms, then long-term residence time of road salt in watersheds may be shorter than previously anticipated. Conversely, if climate becomes drier, with increased evapotranspiration, reduced infiltration and baseflow discharge may prolong salt storage, which could exacerbate biotic stresses from high chloride concentrations in streams.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				SEP	2017	228	9							362	10.1007/s11270-017-3455-9								WOS:000410827400045

Combined Use of Caffeine and Turbidity to Evaluate the Impact of CSOs on River Water Quality	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Several studies have demonstrated that the most effective way to control eutrophication is to reduce phosphorus input at the scale. Water quality monitoring programs need to separately evaluate the different polluting sources to provide a suitable estimate of their relative contributions and thus accurately prioritize possible restoration actions. Urban area cases, where a portion of untreated wastewater is often discharged directly into receiving surface waters by combined sewer overflows (CSOs) during rain events, remain unsolved. In this context, an urban watershed located in Northern Italy with 60 CSOs has been chosen as a case study, and four rainy events have been hourly monitored. The proposed monitoring program consists of the combined use of caffeine and turbidity to estimate the volume and phosphorus load spilled into the river from the CSOs, respectively. Caffeine proved to be a suitablemolecule to quantify the volume of wastewater discharged into water bodies, based on a per capita caffeine load of 10.8 mg inhab(-1) d(-1), estimated in the present work. This research showed that, on average, more than half of the total phosphorus loads transported by the river is due to the CSO discharges (56.5%). The knowledge of the prevailing responsibility of the CSO discharges for the Lambro River quality allows prioritizing effective restoration actions.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				SEP	2017	228	9							330	10.1007/s11270-017-3505-3								WOS:000410827400013						
J	Zhang, J; Hua, P; Krebs, P				Zhang, Jin; Hua, Pei; Krebs, Peter			The Influence of Surface Pavement on the Distribution of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) in Urban Watershed	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												The presence of urban surface pollutants washed off by stormwater is a growing concern due to their adverse effects on receiving water quality. The stormwater quality mitigation strategies, therefore, should be based on the knowledge of the distribution and source apportionment of pollutants on urban surfaces. This study showcases the distribution of particulate-associated PAHs as a function of surface characteristic. Samples were obtained from six sites in the city of Dresden, Germany, using a wet vacuum sample-taking method. Both surface load (mg/m(2)) and solid-phase concentration (mg/g) of PAHs were determined. Results show that the highest surface load of Sigma 16(PAHs) was found at a natural stone-paved pedestrian path with 34.5 mu g/m(2). By contrast, the highest solidphase concentration occurred at a high traffic load road with 36 mg/kg. Through a combined qualitative diagnostic ratio and quantitative principal component analysis with stepwise multiple linear regression (PCA-MLR) source apportionment, two significant contributors to PAH at vehicular roads were primarily identified as pyrogenic and petrogenic sources; 81.6% of the PAH burden was ascribed to pyrogenic sources including vehicle emission, coal, and wood combustions; 18.4% was attributed to petrogenic sources, such as spilled engine oil and vehicular tire debris. To minimize the adverse influence of surface sediments adsorbed PAHs to the receiving waters via stormwater runoff, a surface pavement-based city street sweeping strategy could be planned and optimized to remove hazardous materials from the impervious urban surfaces.

Characterising the dynamics of surface water-groundwater interactions in intermittent and ephemeral streams using streambed thermal signatures	ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES												Ephemeral and intermittent flow in dryland stream channels infiltrates into sediments, replenishes groundwater resources and underpins riparian ecosystems. However, the spatiotemporal complexity of the transitory flow processes that occur beneath such stream channels are poorly observed and understood. We develop a new approach to characterise the dynamics of surface water-groundwater interactions in dryland streams using pairs of temperature records measured at different depths within the streambed. The approach exploits the fact that the downward propagation of the diel temperature fluctuation from the surface depends on the sediment thermal diffusivity. This is controlled by time-varying fractions of air and water contained in streambed sediments causing a contrast in thermal properties. We demonstrate the usefulness of this method with multi-level temperature and pressure records of a flow event acquired using 12 streambed arrays deployed along a similar to 12 km dryland channel section. Thermal signatures clearly indicate the presence of water and characterise the vertical flow component as well as the occurrence of horizontal hyporheic flow. We jointly interpret thermal signatures as well as surface and groundwater levels to distinguish four different hydrological regimes: [A] dry channel, [B] surface run-off, [C] pool-riffle sequence, and [D] isolated pools. The occurrence and duration of the regimes depends on the rate at which the infiltrated water redistributes in the subsurface which, in turn, is controlled by the hydraulic properties of the variably saturated sediment. Our results have significant implications for understanding how transitory flows recharge alluvial sediments, influence water quality and underpin dryland ecosystems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Organic sediment pulses impact rivers across multiple levels of ecological organization	ECOHYDROLOGY												Sedimentation is a pervasive environmental pressure affecting rivers globally. Headwaters draining catchments rich in organic soils (i.e., peat) are particularly vulnerable to enhanced sedimentation caused by land management and environmental change, yet many of the ecological consequences of peat deposition are poorly understood. We conducted a before-after-control-impact experiment in two rivers draining blanket peatland in Northern England to test the effect of sediment inputs on water quality, macroinvertebrate drift, macroinvertebrate community structure, and ecosystem metabolism. Sediment addition increased concentrations of dissolved organic carbon, total oxidised nitrogen and suspended sediment concentration in rivers, and intensified the total drift of macroinvertebrates particularly at night. By contrast, the abundance and richness of benthic macroinvertebrates were unaffected, except for declines in Coleoptera abundance in one river. The gross primary production of both rivers was strongly suppressed as the benthos was smothered by sediment. Community respiration also declined, albeit by different extents in the two rivers. Our experiment revealed that short-term pulses of organic sediment in rivers can have broad effects on water quality and biota, from influences on the dispersal of individual organisms to the modification of ecosystem processes. Organic sediments therefore warrant further examination, to include longer observation periods and more sites. It is particularly important to clarify the extent to which impacts extend from peatland streams into larger rivers downstream. Such studies are necessary to inform global management efforts to restore the integrity of river ecosystems under a range of water and biodiversity policy mechanisms.

The aim of this study was to verify the presence of emerging pollutants in the IguaScu River, from source to mouth, such as: pharmaceuticals, including acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), salicylic acid, ketoprofen (KET), naproxen (NAP), gemfibrozil and fenofibrate; female sex hormones, including estradiol (E1), ethinylestradiol (EET) and estrone (E2); UV filters, including 4-methylbenzylidene camphor and octylmethoxycinnamate; and caffeine (CAF). The extracted pollutants were purified using solid phase extraction and then analyzed by liquid chromatography with diode array detection and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. All analyzed compounds were detected in at least one site in one sample. The analysis revealed maximum concentrations of 27.0 mu g L-1 CAF, 5.17 mu g L-1 ASA, 0.34 mu g L-1 NAP, 0.62 mu g L-1 KET, 1.42 mu g L-1 E1, 1.48 mu g L-1 EET, and 0.94 mu g L-1 E2. The results indicated that IguaScu river water is contaminated with emerging pollutants and nutrients and that this may be due to domestic sewage and water from tributary rivers mixing with IguaScu river water. Statistical analysis demonstrated that the study of emerging environmental contaminants is a useful tool to determine if contamination is due to domestic sewage input once traditional physical, chemical and spectroscopic analyses have been insufficient to prove an anthropogenic influence.

Phosphorus fertilization, soil stratification, and potential water quality impacts	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Water quality experts have suggested that no-till induces phosphorus (P) stratification, which may exacerbate soluble P (SP) runoff from agricultural fields, contributing to eutrophication. Conservationists have been concerned about increased SP loading to Lake Erie, which has been partially blamed on adoption of no-till and the concomitant P stratification of no-till soils. This study was conducted to provide better insight into. the potential link between P stratification from no-till soils and P losses via runoff with the objective of exploring P fertilization strategies on P stratification and P runoff from a corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean (Glycine max L.) rotation. Plots were established with nine treatments, including unfertilized, diammonium phosphate (DAP) applications, monoammonium phosphate (MAP) applications, surface applied, injecting fertilizer or tilling fertilizer in, and the use of cover crops. Fertilizer applications were made at 24.4 kg P ha(-1) (21.8 lb P ac(-1)) every other year or at 9.6 kg P ha(-1) (8.7 lb P ac(-1)) every year. Disking, which was intended to minimize P stratification, resulted in the greatest stratification, with significantly higher water SP and Mehlich 3 I) in the 0 to 5 cm (0 to 2 in) soil layer compared to the other treatments. There were no differences in SP or total P (TP) runoff from rainfall simulations between fertilizer source (MAP versus DAP) or fertilizer rate (annual versus biennial). The highest SP concentrations observed were from DAP applied to cover crops at the high application rate (24.4 kg P ha(-1) applied every other year). This may suggest cover crops are. not the ideal practice to decrease SP losses from agricultural fields. Incorporation of fertilizer reduced SP but increased erosion and could potentially increase TP loss. Injecting liquid fertilizer (polyphosphate [Poly]) at the time of planting resulted in lower SP and TP loads than surface applied fertilizers. We encourage other researchers to confirm these results at the field-to-watershed scale to ensure there are not unintended consequences of adopting this fertilization strategy. Further, fertilizer dealers, crop consultants, and farmers sholild be encouraged to consider liquid fertilizer applications 8 one option to minimize P losses.																	0022-4561	1941-3300				SEP-OCT	2017	72	5					417	424		10.2489/jswc.72.5.417								WOS:000410019500004

Delivering on the potential of formal farmer networks: Insights from Indiana	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Several formal farmer networks have emerged throughout the midwestern United States to address issues of nitrogen (N) runoff and eutrophication. The goal of this study was to determine the effectiveness of these formal fanner networks through an evaluation of two networks in Indiana. The research was guided by two main questions: (1) Are farmers who participate in the networks actually implementing better nutrient management practices? (2) Are participating farmers spreading their knowledge of better nutrient management practices to other farmers outside the formal networks? Interviews with select network members were conducted in early 2014, and a mail survey of all network members was conducted in the summer of 2014. Survey results were compared to the results of a statewide Indiana Nutrient Management Survey conducted during the winter of 2014. The results show that network farmers vary significantly from nonnetwork farmers in multiple ways. Network farmers have more positive attitudes toward water quality, perceive water pollution as a more severe problem, and utilize more conservation practices than nonnetwork farmers. Network farmers also vary in demographic characteristics. Length of time in the network is positively associated with reporting a change in N management practices. Diffusion of nutrient management practices outside the networks seems very limited. The findings point to ways that formal farmer networks can be improved. One recommendation is to diversify the participants and include more farmers who have not already adopted conservation practices. Another recommendation is to increase the number of group meetings during the year. One meeting is insufficient to build the trust and rapport necessary for farmers to accept and adopt the technologies being shared by others. Finally, outreach should focus on economic arguments for improved N management.																	0022-4561	1941-3300				SEP-OCT	2017	72	5					463	470		10.2489/jswc.72.5463								WOS:000410019500008

Determining the number of measurements required to estimate crop residue cover by different methods	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Crop residue left after harvest plays an important role in controlling against soil erosion and in increasing soil organic matter content of agricultural soils. Crop residue management is a practice of great importance in southwestern Ontario, where soil management practices have an effect on Great Lakes water quality. The use of remote sensing data to measure and monitor crop residue can be fast and efficient. However, remote sensing based studies need calibration and validation using field observations. The objective of this study was to determine the optimal number of ground-truthing field measurements (i.e., digital photographs) required to estimate residue levels. To do so, we compared the residue estimates derived from digital photographs with those derived from the standard line-transect method. Residue was measured from 18 fields located in southern Ontario, and data collected included percentage of crop residue using line-transect and photographic grid methods. Results were analyzed using linear regression, correlation tests, ANOVA, and means tests. Analyses were also conducted to retrospectively determine the minimum number of line transects or digital photos required to estimate crop residue cover at specified levels of power. Results showed that (1) percentage of crop residue estimates derived from using digital photographs were strongly correlated (r = 0.91, p < 0.001, R-2 = 0.83, and n = 90) to those derived from using line transects; (2) counting 50 to 100 points per digital photograph was sufficient to accurately estimate the percentage of residue cover; and (3) there was greater variability in the results for soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) than for corn (Zea mays L.), with the highest variability for medium-level soybean residue. Overall, the digital photograph method to estimate percentage of residue was found to be a suitable alternative to the line-transect method, which is more time consuming and labor intensive. Determining the optimal numbers of measurements to estimate crop residue cover is important to those wishing to use digital photo capture methods to record, archive, and measure residue for remote sensing calibration and validation or for handheld mobile device applications.																	0022-4561	1941-3300				SEP-OCT	2017	72	5					471	479		10.2489/jswc.72.5471								WOS:000410019500009

Sedimentation in a small lake following conversion of bottomland forest to row cropping	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Areas of native bottomland hardwood forest in the lower Red River basin in Louisiana were cleared for row cropping around 1970. Erosion and sediment deposition in channels and lakes presumably, increased, affecting hydrologic connectivity and lake ecosystems: Sediment deposited in a representative small lake after land conversion was determined in 2000 from the distribution of cesium (Cs-137) with depth. Sediment consisted of low-density clay deposited above dense silt loam. Organic carbon (C) and Cs-137 profiles had lower and upper concentration maxima. The lower maxima established the circa 1970 lakebed at <= 0.9 m (3 ft) above the morphological discontinuity and from 2.1 to 1.3 m (6.9 to 4.3 ft) below the 2000 lakebed at positions midlake and halfway to the bank, respectively. The upper maxima were likely due to progressive land conversion around the lake, coupled with increasing clay content of sediment upwards to the 2000 lakebed. A quiescent settling model was used to estimate the composition of runoff water necessary to produce the depth, texture, and density of sediment above the lower Cs-137 maxima. The Annualized Agricultural Nonpoint Source water quality model was calibrated to match this composition, and sediment accumulation under alternative management scenarios was calculated. Compared to conventional-till. (CT) soybeans (Glycine max L.) for 30 years, CT with cover crop (CC), no-till (NT), NT with CC management, and forest might have reduced sedimentation in the lake by about 20%, 40%, 60%, and 98%, slowing changes in light penetration, temperature, turbidity, and chemistry that affect the lake ecosystem.																	0022-4561	1941-3300				SEP-OCT	2017	72	5					530	538		10.2489/jswc.72.5.530								WOS:000410019500014

The applied MST tools combined microbial analyses and molecular tests to detect and define the source(s) and dominant origin(s) of faecal water contamination. Faecal indicator bacteria Escherichia coli and host-specific Bacteroidales 16 s rRNA gene markers have been employed. The study revealed that the newly developed contribution profiling of faecal origin derived from the Bacteroidales DNA could quantitatively distinguish between human and non-human pollution origins. Further, the outcomes of the MST test have been compared with the results of both physicochemical analyses and tests of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs). A strong positive correlation was discovered between the human marker and PPCPs. Gabapentin was the most frequently detected compound and it showed the uppermost positive correlation with the human marker. The study demonstrated that the NBTS performs satisfactorily with the removal of E. coli but not PPCPs. Interestingly, the presence of PPCPs in the water samples was not correlated with high concentrations of E. coli. Neither has the latter an apparent correlation with the human marker.

Adapted optimization model for planning regional wastewater systems: case study	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Wastewater systems are of crucial importance to the promotion of sustainable development. Through an integrated planning approach, the costs can be minimized and the resulting benefits maximized. A planning approach at regional level exploits the economies of scale, while achieving a better environmental performance. In this paper we set out a decision support approach for the planning of regional wastewater systems. Optimization models are used, aimed at finding optimal configurations for the location, type and size of the system's infrastructure: sewers, pump stations, and wastewater treatment plants. Solutions are evaluated in terms of the cost of installing, operating and maintaining the infrastructure, and the water quality in the river that receives the treated wastewater. The river water quality varies in accordance with the effluent discharges, and is assessed using environmental parameters. The models are solved with a simulated annealing algorithm complemented by a local improvement procedure. Its application is illustrated through a case study in the Una river basin region, in Brazil.

Urban nutrient loadings are expected to increase and become more variable under climate change (CC). In this study, a water quality simulation model (SWMM), land cover data layers, and mathematical programming models were used to compare costs of abating nutrient loads under CC in the Difficult Run Watershed located in Fairfax County, Virginia. Predicted costs of abating mean total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and total suspended sediment (TSS) loadings under current climate conditions were compared with those for CC under certainty with a Cost Minimization Model and under uncertainty with a Safety First Model. Total nitrogen loadings abatement had the highest cost followed by TP and TSS abatement in that order. Costs of controlling TP and TSS increased with CC, whereas there was little change in TN control costs. Introducing uncertainty of loadings caused control costs to increase substantially for all three pollutants. The preferred pollutant control strategy was urban stream restoration. Policy makers seeking to meet water quality goals over a multiyear horizon should consider frontloading supplemental best management practices (BMPs) to offset the changes in nutrient loadings predicted for CC.

An experimental facility was designed which is a scale model of an existing supply zone serving similar to 100,000 customers. The facility was designed for (1) investigating transport of water qualities and potential contaminations; (2) providing a fast and flexible testing ground for networks of real-time water quality and quantity sensors prior to installment in live distribution networks; and (3) training and demonstration purposes. A scale analysis was used to investigate the possibilities including in a single facility the processes turbulence, turbulent diffusion, particle transport mode, and shear stress in a way that represents the real-life network environment, and to determine the facility's spatial and temporal dimensions. Using hydraulic modeling, it was verified that the main flow patterns in the facility are representative for the real-life network. The final design includes a 4 x 8 m model, transparent PVC pipes, and a decentralized fast control system that includes 28 demand and 4 supply locations to simulate complex flow patterns. The setup is currently being prepared for experimentation. This paper describes the theoretical background and the design and construction process.

Reducing the phosphorous load to downstream areas can be of great importance for aquatic habitats associated with recipient waters, as well as for the overall health of coastal and estuary areas. This study demonstrates a combined operation of a network of reservoirs with the objectives of hydropower production and improvement of water quality in downstream areas using a multiobjective approach and incorporating the transport of phosphorous in the watershed. A genetic optimization method was used to determine the trade-off between power production and mitigation of phosphorous discharge in the reservoir network of the Dalalven River, Sweden. The phosphorous export can be reduced (-5%) with a limited loss of power production (-4.3%), but further reduction is associated with a significant loss in total power production. The trade-off between the two objectives is determined using Pareto diagrams and examined for varying particulate conditions.

Evaluation of sludge handling using acidification and sequential aluminum coagulant recovery: case study of El-Sheikh Zayed WTP	JOURNAL OF WATER SUPPLY RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY-AQUA												Huge amounts of water treatment sludge are wasted annually in Egypt. One common practice of sludge handling is to discharge into waterways or by disposal after drying into landfills. Currently, there is a critical need for sustainable solutions that provide environmental protection as well as benefits for water producers. Coagulant recovery is not new but is still a good solution for sludge handling and reduction of operational costs. This work aims at completing the picture on coagulant recovery from alum sludge in El-Sheikh Zayed water treatment plant (ESZ-WTP) by acidification using hydrochloric acid. This study also investigates the effect of sequential recovery on the efficiency of the coagulant and treated water quality. Sludge characterization was done through determination of metals' concentration and composition, water content and organic matter concentration. The influence of acid concentration, sludge mass, acid/sludge mass ratio, mixing speed, temperature, and mixing time on aluminum leaching was studied. At optimum values of these parameters, 82.4% aluminum recovery was obtained. In addition, repeated recoveries were carried out at laboratory scale using raw water from ESZ-WTP. Our research revealed that recovered coagulant can be used for three times' recoveries as the trihalomethanes remain within acceptable limits.

In this cross-sectional study, 879 samples were taken to evaluate the water quality characteristics during 12 months (2013-2014). Five indices, Langelier, Ryznar, Puckorius, Larson-Skold, and Aggressiveness, were programmed in Microsoft Excel. The results illustrated that the values of the Langelier saturation index, Ryznar stability index, Puckorius scaling index, Larson ratio, and Aggressiveness index were 0.33 (+/- 0.17), 7.36 (+/- 0.37), 7.4 (+/- 0.6), 2.1 (+/- 1.4), and 12.03 (+/- 0.18), respectively. According to the Ryznar index (RSI), the index for the water resources of Torbat city was 6.99 and RSI for the central part of Gonabad was 6.4 (consolidation grade). The average pH in the studied water wells was 8.03. The amounts of turbidity, calcium, magnesium, nitrate, and fluoride in the study areas have favorable and acceptable conditions. However, the values of sulfate, total dissolved solids, and chloride in a few cities were higher than the standards. Comparison of five stability indices demonstrated that water in some parts of the study area is corrosive. Based on the results, selecting the best method to prevent the corrosion process is required.																	0003-7214	1365-2087				SEP	2017	66	6					416	425		10.2166/aqua.2017.128								WOS:000408792400006

Assessment of the environmental quality of two urbanized lotic systems using multiple indicators	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Urbanization impacts ecosystems through loss and fragmentation of habitat, loss of diversity, increase in runoff, and contaminant discharges, and the invasion of exotic species. Potrero de los Funes Village (San Luis, Argentina) is experiencing not only a population increase during summer months due to tourism but also an accelerated growth of its permanent population. In order to evaluate the potential effects of urbanization, the environmental quality of Potrero de los Funes River and Las Chacras Stream was assessed, using physical-chemical and biological indicators. Macroinvertebrates, through the application of the Biotic Index for San Luis Sierras (BISLS), anuran amphibian richness and relative abundance, and riparian vegetation were used as bioindicators. While the Simplified Index of Water Quality (SIWQ) was used to characterize the physical-chemical quality of water at each site. SIWQ and BISLS scores were significantly different between sites (F-7,F-28=9.88, p<.001 and F-7,F-28=24.18, p<.001, respectively). SIWQ was significantly correlated with BISLS (Spearman correlation coefficient=0.8, p<.001). Four anuran species were registered along Potrero River, with no significant differences in the intensity of vocalizations between sites. No species were detected in Las Chacras Stream. Average total plant species richness, exotic plants richness, and vegetation cover were higher at the most impaired system, Las Chacras Stream. The principal component analysis showed that the first two principal components (PCs) explained 76.3% of the total variance. PC1, with strong loadings of SIWQ, BISLS, and amphibian richness, was principally driven by chemical water quality and biological conditions. PC2 was mainly determined by plant richness. The chemical and biological water quality of Potrero and Las Chacras is somewhat impaired, being the upper Las Chacras Stream the most compromised area. This study provides information that will certainly be used to manage future impacts of urbanization on aquatic resources.																	1535-1459	1535-1467				SEP	2017	33	7					1119	1129		10.1002/rra.3160								WOS:000409105100014

Until now, general end-users have had no effective method to measure the drinking water quality in situ and identify first-hand any violation. In return, there has been no feedback closed-loop of water quality monitoring and a control regime along distribution systems to provide real-time in situ early-warning for water treatment plants. This study targeted this crucial challenge by developing flat flexible thin micro-electrode array (MEA) sensors that integrate multiple types of mm-sized sensors to simultaneously monitor critical water quality parameters (temperature, conductivity, pH, Cl- and ClO-). MEA films were directly mounted onto a water tube that simulated a distribution system. Each type of sensor showed high accuracy with an R-2 value higher than 0.95 in the calibration tests. The shock tests clearly demonstrated the higher sensitivity of the MEA sensors than commercial sensors, and the advantage of integrating multiple types of sensors on a single film for autocorrection. More importantly, the Ag nanoparticle-modified ClO- MEA sensors showed high selectivity in the presence of competing elements (Cl-). Four-week tests in tap water revealed the intact structure of the MEA sensors and stable signal output. Overall, the MEAs possessed high accuracy, sensitivity, and selectivity for monitoring water quality. The flat flexible thin material and integrated configuration make the deployment of the sensors easy along distribution systems and at end-user points, and ultimately enable the in situ assessment of water quality in the water infrastructure.																	2053-1400	2053-1419				SEP 1	2017	3	5					865	874		10.1039/c7ew00103g								WOS:000408431500008						
J	Yuan, PY; Kim, Y				Yuan, Pengyi; Kim, Younggy			Accurate and rapid organic detection by eliminating hysteresis in bioanode sensor applications	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY												Bioanode sensors utilizing exoelectrogenic bacteria can be used for real-time and in situ assessment of water quality. The main challenges for practical applications of bioanode sensors in water quality assessment include their narrow detection range, long analysis time, and hysteresis effects. To overcome these limitations, a new operation method was proposed and examined in microbial electrolysis cell (MEC)-based bioanode sensors. The new operation method consists of normal operation (0.6 V application), a reset step (1.8 V application for 1 min), and a test step (1.2 V application for 2 min). The inclusion of the reset step in the sensor operation eliminated potential hysteresis effects and thus resulted in accurate correlations between readily biodegradable COD (chemical oxygen demand) and electric current with consistent R-2 values of 99% in triplicated sensor experiments. The high voltage application (1.2 V) during the test step not only enhanced sensor accuracy but also extended the detection range up to 130 mg-COD L-1. The combination of a reset step and a test step was proven to allow reliable sensor applications of MECs and other bioelectrochemical systems. Even with the greatly improved sensor accuracy, the correlation between readily biodegradable COD (acetate) and electric current varied substantially in 2 days. The findings indicate that bioanode sensors can be used for rapid organic detection in 3 min with very high accuracies but require frequent sensor calibration.

Projections from four global climate models (GCMs) under representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP8.5 are used to drive the hydrological models. An ensemble prediction in the future period (2021-2050) from three competing hydrological models is generated using the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method. Though hydrological models do well in simulating daily discharges, all underestimate the observed low flows to some extent. Such underestimation of low flows could be compensated by application of the BMA method. Uncertainty from GCMs is a predominating source for monthly mean discharges. An increase in intensity of 7Q10, 7Q20, and 7Q30 is found under both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 for most cases. The increase of 7Q10, 7Q20, and 7Q30 could be more related to minimum monthly precipitation rather than the amount of monthly mean precipitation. The magnitude of the increase is smaller under RCP8.5 than RCP4.5, which could be explained by the higher temperature increase under RCP8.5. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

A screening model for assessing water quality in small, dynamic estuaries	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Despite mounting evidence of the harm associated with excessive nutrient loading to estuaries, tools to translate this body of knowledge into sound environmental management and planning practices in data poor environments are lacking. In this paper, a design science approach is adopted to develop a screening (box) model for the water quality assessment of South African estuaries. The key design principles are first distilled from literature on the nutrient dynamics and hydro-morphological functioning of small, dynamic, bar-blocked estuaries. The proportional volume contribution of land-based flows (river inflows, diffuse inflows from the peri-catchment, point source discharges) is determined; a water quality class is allocated to each of the inflows, and the overall water quality class for the land-based inflows to an estuary is determined. Taking the percentage mouth closure and the perched nature of the estuaries into account, a WQ Similarity rating is allocated. This similarity rating reflects the degree of similarity of the water quality in the estuary to the reference (natural) water quality. The entire water quality assessment uses readily available information such as land-cover data, legal limits for disposal and water quality monitoring data where they exist, making it suitable for a data-poor environment. The screening model is calibrated and validated on a selection of South African estuaries for which official health condition assessments exist. Results are promising, and the screening model is deemed appropriate for assessing the water quality of individual estuaries and for comparing the sensitivity of multiple estuaries to changes in the volume and nutrient loading of land-based inflows. As such, the screening model can be employed at a regional or national scale for strategic assessments of water quality in small, dynamic estuaries. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

An assessment of water quality parameters and survival of indicator in pilgrimage place of Velankanni, Tamil Nadu, India	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Velankanni is anthropogenically highly vulnerable due to unregulated religious activities and intensive tourist density. The present study focuses on the impact of holy water bathing on water quality parameters and microbiological indicators. Water samples were collected at three different stations in a monthly interval starting before the onset of festival, during the festival and after festival season from August to October, 2013. The following indicators were analyzed: surface seawater temperature (30 -33 degrees C), hydrogen ion concentration (7.4-8.3), electrical conductivity (6.9-11.4 mS/cm), salinity (16.2 -37.0 ppt), total suspended solids (1080-2920 mg/l), total dissolved solids (20450-51880 mg/l), total solids (22650-53120 mg/l), dissolved oxygen (3.4-5.7 mg/l) and microbiological indicators (total heterotrophic bacteria (1-61 x 10(-3) cfu/ml), total coliform bacteria (1-57 x 10(-2) cfu/ml) and total Enterococcus bacteria (1-41 x 10(-2) cfu/ml). Statistical analysis revealed a significant correlation between season and water quality (p < 0.05). This study strongly supports the necessity to implement water quality monitoring, coastal management policy and regulation of ritual activities, including the prevention of the waterborne diseases. Implementing these ideas would increase coastal water quality and maintenance of the beauty of the beach, which in turn promotes pilgrimage and tourism activities thereby benefiting the local communities and improving the regional economy.

Fate of water and nitrate using drainage water management on tile systems in east-central Illinois	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Drainage water management (DWM) is a potential edge-of-field technique that is being studied as a method to improve soil water management in agricultural fields, which may reduce nitrate losses to surface waters during the non-growing season. Inline water level control structures were installed on two adjacent tile systems draining a 34 ha field located in the Upper Salt Fork of the Vermillion River Watershed in central Illinois to evaluate DWM from 2011 through 2013. The overall objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of DWM in reducing nitrate losses from fields in a corn and soybean production system in east-central Illinois, as well as to investigate the fate of the retained water. A paired watershed approach was used to determine the impact of DWM on tile flow and nitrate load compared to a control treatment or free drainage (FD) tile system. The entire 34 ha field was under a corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max L.) rotation with continuous no-till. During 2011 and 2012, DWM was able to greatly reduce tile flow compared to the FD tile system. However, based on runoff and nitrate yields from the entire field, there was no measureable reduction in nitrate loss and shallow ground-water wells showed little area of influence in the field (similar to 2 ha). Water from the DWM tile system flowed laterally to the nearby FD tile system, increasing flow and nitrate loss from the FD system. In 2013, when both tiles were under DWM, water was retained and the water table level was increased in a larger area of the field (similar to 6 ha). However, at the end of the experiment when the control stoplogs were lowered the retained water was discharged through the tiles lines with little apparent reduction (10%) in overall water and nitrate loss for the year. Measurements of tile and well nitrate concentrations suggested that nitrate was not denitrified in the shallow groundwater of the field during the three-year study. Nitrate losses were directly proportional to tile flow each year of the study. Retrofitting DWM on an existing tile system was found to have a limited water quality benefit. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Fraction of young water as an indicator of aquifer vulnerability along two regional flow paths in the Mississippi embayment aquifer system, southeastern USA	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Wells along two regional flow paths were sampled to characterize changes in water quality and the vulnerability to contamination of the Memphis aquifer across a range of hydrologic and land-use conditions in the southeastern United States. The flow paths begin in the aquifer outcrop area and end at public supply wells in the confined parts of the aquifer at Memphis, Tennessee. Age-date tracer (e.g. SF6, H-3, C-14) data indicate that a component of young water is present in the aquifer at most locations along both flow paths, which is consistent with previous studies at Memphis that documented leakage of shallow water into the Memphis aquifer locally where the overlying confining unit is thin or absent. Mixtures of young and old water were most prevalent where long-term pumping for public supply has lowered groundwater levels and induced downward movement of young water. The occurrence of nitrate, chloride and synthetic organic compounds was correlated to the fraction of young water along the flow paths. Oxic conditions persisted for 10 km or more down dip of the confining unit, and the presence of young water in confined parts of the aquifer suggest that contaminants such as nitrate-N have the potential for transport. Long-term monitoring data for one of the flow-path wells screened in the confined part of the aquifer suggest that the vulnerability of the aquifer as indicated by the fraction of young water is increasing over time.

J	Jurado, A; Vazquez-Sune, E; Pujades, E				Jurado, Anna; Vazquez-Sune, Enric; Pujades, Estanislao			Potential uses of pumped urban groundwater: a case study in Sant AdriA del Bess (Spain)	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Urban groundwater has often been over-exploited for industrial uses. Now, this usage tends to be reduced or the resource abandoned due to pollution and/or changes in land use. The use and the subsequent disuse of groundwater has resulted in rising water tables that damage underground structures (e.g., building basements and underground car parks and tunnels), leading to the need for additional pumping in urban areas. In the case of the underground parking lot of Sant AdriA del Bess (Barcelona, NE Spain), large amounts of urban groundwater are pumped to avoid seepage problems. Can this pumped groundwater be used for other purposes (e.g., drinking water and urban irrigation) instead of wasting this valuable resource? To answer this question, it was necessary to quantify the groundwater recharge and to assess the evolution of groundwater quality. The limiting factor at this study site is the groundwater quality because ammonium and some metals (iron and manganese) are present at high concentrations. Hence, further treatment would be needed to meet drinking water requirements. The pumped groundwater could also be used for supplementing river flow for ecological benefit and/or for mitigating seawater intrusion problems. Currently, only a small amount of this urban groundwater is used for cleaning public areas and watering public gardens. This situation highlighted the urgent need to manage this resource in a responsible and more efficient manner, especially in moments of high water demand such as drought periods.

Inventory of managed aquifer recharge sites in Europe: historical development, current situation and perspectives	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Different types of managed aquifer recharge (MAR) schemes are widely distributed and applied on various scales and for various purposes in the European countries, but a systematic categorization and compilation of data has been missing up to now. The European MAR catalogue presented herein contains various key parameters collected from the available literature. The catalogue includes 224 currently active MAR sites found in 23 European countries. Large quantities of drinking water are produced by MAR sites in Hungary, Slovakia, the Netherlands, Germany, Finland, Poland, Switzerland and France. This inventory highlights that, for over a century, MAR has played an important role in the development of European water supply and contributes to drinking-water production substantially. This development has occurred autonomously, with "trial-and-error" within the full range of climatically and hydrogeologically diverse conditions of the European countries. For the future, MAR has the potential to facilitate optimal (re)use and storage of available water resources and to take advantage of the natural purification and low energy requirements during MAR operations. Particularly with respect to the re-use of wastewater treatment-plant effluent and stormwater, which is currently underdeveloped, the use of MAR can support the public acceptance of such water-resource efficient schemes. Particularly for the highly productive and urbanized coastal zones, where the pressure on freshwater supplies increases by growing water demand, salinization and increased agricultural needs for food production (such as along the Mediterranean and North Sea coasts), MAR is expected to be increasingly relied on in Europe.																	1431-2174	1435-0157				SEP	2017	25	6					1909	1922		10.1007/s10040-017-1554-8								WOS:000407923900025

The investigated post-mining lakes were very young compared to glacial lakes and represent early stages of ecosystem succession. Despite their different ages and morphometries, they are all mesotrophic and have good water quality. They have not been supplied with phosphorus and nitrogen, which can cause excessive development of pelagic phytoplankton; as a result, they share low chlorophyll a (Chl a) content, low phytoplankton biomass, and relatively high water transparency. Low abundance and species richness of zooplankton indicate low trophic levels in all of the lakes. Chl a in Lakes Przykona and Bogdaw were within the range typical of mesotrophic lakes, while Lake Janiszew had very low Chl a, typical of an oligotrophic water body. The low N:P ratios (4-6), especially in summer, indicates nitrogen limitation of primary production. There is a risk that such a proportion of the major biogenic elements could lead to harmful cyanobacterial blooms. The lake basins were formed using quaternary deposits (sand, clay) at their bottoms; as a result, the lakes had a slightly alkaline pH (> 8), which favors the development of aquatic organisms. Optimum depth helps establish lake stratification and ensures ecological stability. This applies to post-mining lakes as well; an optimum depth should be determined to ensure the development of thermal stratification, which affects lake processes.

Modeling of Water Resources Allocation and Water Quality Management for Supporting Regional Sustainability under Uncertainty in an Arid Region	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												In this study, a scenario-based interval-stochastic fraticle optimization with Laplace criterion (SISFL) method is developed for sustainable water resources allocation and water quality management (WAQM) under multiple uncertainties. SISFL can tackle uncertainties presented as interval parameters and probability distributions; meanwhile, it can also quantify artificial fuzziness such as risk-averse attitude in a decision-making issue. Besides, it can reflect random scenario occurrence under the supposition of no data available. The developed method is applied to a real case of water resources allocation and water quality management in the Kaidu-kongque River Basin, where encounter serve water deficit and water quality degradation simultaneously in Northwest China. Results of water allocation pattern, pollution mitigation scheme, and system benefit under various scenarios are analyzed. The tradeoff between economic activity and water-environment protection with interval necessity levels and Laplace criterions can support policymakers generating an effective and robust manner associated with risk control for WAQM under multiple uncertainties. These discoveries avail local policymakers gain insight into the capacity planning of water-environment to satisfy the basin's integrity of socio-economic development and eco-environmental sustainability.

They are useful, but understanding on LID practices and broadening the LID applications among practitioners is another important task. The main purpose of this study is to understand local professionals' perceptions on different LID techniques and awareness on their benefits, while also gathering opinions on barriers and incentives. An online survey was delivered to 91 recipients, a diverse pool of stakeholders involved in the Energy Corridor District (ECD) area in Houston, Texas. The majority of the respondents answered that they were familiar with LID. The techniques that have been applied to a larger extent are Detention Ponds and Bioswales. When asked about applying techniques in the future, Retention Ponds, Rain Gardens, Bioswales, and Detention Ponds are highly probable items. Decision-makers identified the major barriers as being the lack of incentives for their application, lack of knowledge of the client, and lack of knowledge of the development team. Education programs would be the most successful incentive, followed by financial incentives and innovations in policy systems. Urban planners have the most expertise in LID practices, followed by architects/landscape architects, while developers were found not to be very familiar with the concepts. This study understands the current and practical opinions about LID from the decision-makers. Different groups understand the importance of education and identified a major barrier as the lack of policy instruments. Some innovation in regulations may elevate proper LID practices.																	0920-4741	1573-1650				SEP	2017	31	12					3795	3808		10.1007/s11269-017-1707-5								WOS:000407831200007

In addition, the modified universal soil loss equation (MUSLE) uses a constant K-factor which cannot address seasonal variation in soil erodibility caused by freeze-thaw cycles in cold regions. The current study presents a simple method to incorporate detailed landuse and management inputs in SWAT. The method delineates HRUs based on field boundaries and associates each HRU with a particular field. As a result, long-term detailed records can be incorporated into the SWAT management files. In addition, the existing MUSLE in SWAT was modified by introducing a variable K-factor to address effects of freeze-thaw cycles on soil erosion for cold regions. This modified version of SWAT was calibrated and validated for an agricultural micro-watershed, i.e., Black Brook Watershed in New Brunswick, Canada. The results showed that, compared with the standard HRU-delineation method, field-based HRU-delineation method was able to improve landuse and management practice input accuracy for SWAT and save time and effort for long-term simulation, and provide high resolution outputs in the watershed. As a result, the field-based HRU-delineation method can facilitate decision making not only at the subbasin scale but also at the field scale. In addition, results showed that sediment loading simulation accuracy was improved with the modified-MUSLE compared with the original-MUSLE.																	0920-4741	1573-1650				SEP	2017	31	12					3953	3974		10.1007/s11269-017-1718-2								WOS:000407831200016

This study analyzed the general hydrochemical characteristics of the lake water to determine the spatiotemporal variability of contaminants and to assess the potential health risk associated with the surface water. Lake water was monitored at three stations each month throughout 2013. Samples were analyzed for pH, total dissolved solids, temperature, EC, major ions (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, SO42-, Cl-, HCO3 (-), and CO3 (2-)), ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N), fluoride (F-), phenol, and heavy metals (As, Hg, and Cr6+). The results suggest that Na+ is the dominant cation in the lake water, and Cl- and SO4 (2-) are the dominant anions, resulting in a primary water type of Cl center dot SO4-Na. Contaminant levels (NH4-N, F-, As, Hg, Cr6+, and phenol) vary through time and space (spatiotemporal variations). As and F- are high in the summer season; Cr6+ and Hg do not significantly change over the year; and the NH4-N and phenol concentrations also remain relatively stable. Concentrations of all these substances are within the acceptable limits for recreational water use (1.5, 1.5, 0.1, 0.001, 0.05, and 0.01 mg/L for NH4-N, F-, As, Hg, Cr6+, and phenol, respectively). An assessment model recommended by the Ministry of Environmental Protection of the P.R. China was used in the study to conduct the health risk assessment. While workers do experience higher non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks than tourists, the risks are low and negligible. As and Cr6+ contribute the most to total carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks.

J	Al-Khafaji, MS; Abdulraheem, ZA				Al-Khafaji, Mahmoud Saleh; Abdulraheem, Zahraa Abdulhussain			A Deterministic Algorithm for Determination of Optimal Water Quality Monitoring Stations	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Water quality monitoring networks are usually designed according to statistical approaches and general criteria without a consistent or logical deterministic design strategy. In this research, a deterministic approach for allocating the most sensitive water quality monitoring stations was proposed. This approach was applied on the western part of the Al-Hammar Marsh. Two-dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality simulation models were used to estimate the distribution of total dissolved solids (TDS) within the marsh for all of the expected conditions. Subsequently, the spatial distribution of the variance of TDS was computed based on the results of these models and performed in a Geographic Information System (GIS) database layer. The standard acceptable TDS variation limits of +/- 5%, land-use map, land-cover map and other main selection criteria of the monitoring stations were set as constraints via GIS database layers. These layers were integrally applied to the variance layer to obtain the locations of the most sensitive monitoring stations. It was concluded that, the most representative monitoring network consists of 46 stations. This number can be reduced to 37 and 29 stations by increasing the acceptable TDS variation limits to +/- 10% and 15%, respectively. The developed approach can be used with limited data. Moreover, it can be applied to rivers, lakes or wetlands, considering all of the related constraints. In addition, the GIS database can be easily updated and analysed. These features are not available in other methods such as the Sanders method, multiple criteria decision making and dynamic programming approach.																	0920-4741	1573-1650				SEP	2017	31	11					3575	3592		10.1007/s11269-017-1686-6								WOS:000406652400019

Comparison of Computer Models for Estimating Hydrology and Water Quality in an Agricultural Watershed	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Various computer models, ranging from simple to complex, have been developed to simulate hydrology and water quality from field to watershed scales. However, many users are uncertain about which model to choose when estimating water quantity and quality conditions in a watershed. This study compared hydrologic/water quality models including Spreadsheet Tool for the Estimation of Pollutant Load (STEPL)-Purdue, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), High Impact Targeting (HIT), Long-Term Hydrologic Impact Assessment (L-THIA), Pollutant Load (PLOAD), Spatially and Temporally Distributed Model for Phosphorus Management (STEM-P), Region 5, and ensemble modeling (using STEPL-Purdue, SWAT, L-THIA, PLOAD, and STEM-P). Model capabilities, inputs, and underlying methods to estimate streamflow, surface runoff, baseflow, nutrients, and sediment were examined. Uncalibrated, calibrated, and validated outputs of these models and uncalibrated ensemble modeling in estimating water quantity and quality for a 41.5 km(2) agricultural watershed in Northeastern Indiana were explored, and suggestions were provided on the selection and use of models. Models need to be selected carefully based on the simulation objectives, data availability, model characteristics, time constraints, and project budgets.																	0920-4741	1573-1650				SEP	2017	31	11					3641	3665		10.1007/s11269-017-1691-9								WOS:000406652400023

Tolerable erosion concept is a tool for awareness and assessment of soil erosion status and its economic, social, and environmental hazards. This study was conducted to design a framework for evaluating and identifying spatial patterns of erosion hazard in Haji-Ghushan watershed, based on tolerable erosion concept, by using the SWAT model. The framework was consisted of two parts: the erosion tolerance index (ETI), and the sediment-phosphorous index (SPI) for evaluating onsite and offsite effects of soil erosion, respectively. Four hazard levels were defined for each index. The results of sediment simulation indicated that the maximum rate of erosion belonged to agricultural lands located on steep slopes in the central part of the watershed, and the minimum rate was from forest lands, despite their steep slopes. The map of spatial,distribution of erosion hazard showed that, in terms of both onsite and offsite effects, a major part of the watershed (around 65%) had experienced an erosion rate lower than the erosion tolerance threshold; hence, these areas were not faced with erosion hazard. The spatial distribution of the areas exposed to the onsite erosion hazard, however, was differed from those confronted by the offsite erosion hazard. Identified high hazard areas based on the erosion offsite impacts were mainly located in sub-basins close to the watershed outlet where the sediment and phosphorous yield was high due to the high sediment-phosphorous delivery ratio. High hazard areas with high risk of soil degradation and productivity reduction are distributed throughout the watershed, depending on the magnitude of the erosion rate. These findings revealed that, in addition to erosion rate, sediment delivery ratio is also an important parameter in evaluating soil erosion hazard. For achieving the sustainable agro-environment, it is necessary to consider both the onsite and offsite effects of soil erosion to identify the high hazard areas. Also the results showed that the designed framework was capable of identifying the high hazard and hot spot areas well. The findings of this study are useful for officials and policy makers of soil conservation and environmental protection agencies in the region.

J	Kim, YJ; Choo, BK; Cho, JY				Kim, Young-Joo; Choo, Byung-Kil; Cho, Jae-Young			Effect of gypsum and rice straw compost application on improvements of soil quality during desalination of reclaimed coastal tideland soils: Ten years of long-term experiments	CATENA												The objective of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of applying gypsum and rice straw compost on improvements in soil quality during the desalination of previously reclaimed coastal tideland soils. The four treatments were control (without amendment), gypsum, rice straw compost, and gypsum + rice straw compost. The experiments were carried out in a completely randomized design with three replicates. Saturated electrical conductivity (ECe) and exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) values of soils treated with gypsum, or gypsum + rice straw compost, reached the salinity and sodicity classification limits of 4 dS m(-1) and 15% (US Salinity Laboratory Staff, 1954), respectively, after eight years of leaching experiments. However, despite 10 years of leaching experiments, neither the control nor the rice straw compost alone treatment reached the salinity and sodicity classification limits. The addition of gypsum and rice straw compost resulted in a reduction in soil bulk density and a corresponding increase in soil porosity in highly saline-sodic soils (p <= 0.05). The results of mean weight diameter (MWD) showed that the application of soil amendments increased MWD significantly (p <= 0.05); the highest MWD was observed for the gypsum + rice straw compost treatment and was twice the magnitude of the control.																	0341-8162	1872-6887				SEP	2017	156						131	138		10.1016/j.catena.2017.04.008								WOS:000404305700014

However, the interpretation of c-Q data can be difficult unless these data are fitted using statistical models. Such models are frequently applied for geogenic solutes, but it is unclear to what extent they might aid in the investigation of nutrient export patterns, particularly for total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) which is a critical driver of downstream eutrophication problems. The goal of the present study was therefore to statistically model c-Q relations (where c is TDP concentrations) in a set of contrasting watersheds in the Northern Great Plains-ranging in size from 0.2 to 1000+km(2)-to assess the controls of landscape properties on TDP transport dynamics. Six statistical models were fitted to c-Q data, notably (a) one linear model, (b) one model assuming that c-Q relations are driven by the mixing of end-member waters from different landscape locations (i.e., hydrograph separation), (c) one model relying on a biogeochemical stationarity hypothesis (i.e., power law), (d) one model hypothesizing that c-Q relations change as a function of the solute subsurface contact time (i.e., hyperbolic model), and (e) two models assuming that solute fluxes are mostly dependent on reaction rates (i.e., chemical models). Model performance ranged from mediocre (R-2 < 0.2) to very good (R-2 > 0.9), but the hydrograph separation model seemed most universal. No watershed was found to exhibit chemostatic behaviour, but many showed signs of dilution or enrichment behaviour. A tendency toward a multi-model fit and better model performance was observed for watersheds with moderate slope and higher effective drainage area. The relatively poor model performance obtained outside these conditions illustrates the likely importance of controls on TDP concentrations in the region that are independent of flow dynamics.

J	Chen, X; McGowan, S; Zeng, LH; Xu, L; Yang, XD				Chen, Xu; McGowan, Suzanne; Zeng, Linghan; Xu, Lei; Yang, Xiangdong			Changes in carbon and nitrogen cycling in a floodplain lake over recent decades linked to littoral expansion, declining riverine influx, and eutrophication	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												This study aimed to understand changes in the biogeochemical processing of organic matter (OM) in response to multiple stressors (e.g., littoral area expansion, wastewater input, and hydrological regulation) in East Dongting Lake (Central China) over the past 60 years, using analyses of total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), C/N ratios, delta C-13, delta N-15, and diatoms from 2 sediment cores collected from the littoral and central parts of the lake. OM mainly originated from phyto-plankton and C-3 plant-derived soil OM based on the ranges of C/N ratios (from 7 to 11) and delta C-13 (between - 27% and -23%). Littoral area expansion due to siltation caused an increasing influx of terrestrial soil OM in the 1980s and the 1990s, subsequently lowering delta C-13 values and rising C/N ratios in both sediment cores. Meanwhile, higher delta N-15 was linked to a high influx of isotopically heavy nitrate from urban and agricultural wastewaters. After 2000, slight decreases in TOC and TN in the littoral area were attributable to reducing inputs of external OM, likely linked to declining sediment influx from the upper reaches resulting from the Three Gorges Dam impoundment. Contrasting increases in TOC, TN, and C/N ratios in the central part indicated a high influx of terrestrial soil OM due to the declining distance from the shoreline with littoral area expansion. Declining delta N-15 values after 2000 indicated an increase in N-2-fixing cyanobacteria with eutrophication. Changes in diatom assemblages in both the littoral and central zones reflected nutrient enrichment and hydrological alterations. These results indicate that littoral expansion, declining riverine influx, and anthropogenic nutrient inputs are potential driving forces for the biogeochemical processing of OM in floodplain lakes. This study provides sedimentary biogeochemical clues for tracking past limnological conditions of floodplain lakes that are subjected to increasing disturbances from hydrological regulation and eutrophication.

Presently, reverse osmosis (RO) processes are leading in global desalination with 53% share followed by thermally driven technologies 33%, but in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries their shares are 42% and 56% respectively due to severe feed water quality. In RO processes, intake, pretreatment and brine disposal cost 25% of total desalination cost at 30-35% recovery. We proposed a tri-hybrid system to enhance overall recovery up to 81%. The conditioned brine leaving from RO processes supplied to proposed multi evaporator adsorption cycle driven by low temperature industrial waste heat sources or solar energy. RO membrane simulation has been performed using WinFlow and IMSDesign commercial softwares developed by GE and Nitto. Detailed mathematical model of overall system is developed and simulation has been conducted in FORTRAN. The final brine reject concentration from tri-hybrid cycle can vary from 166,000 ppm to 222,000 ppm if RO retentate concentration varies from 45,000 ppm to 60,000 ppm. We also conducted economic analysis and showed that the proposed tri-hybrid cycle can achieve highest recovery, 81%, and lowest energy consumption, 1.76 kWh(elec)/m(3), for desalination reported in the literature up till now.

Environmental assessment of two small scale wastewater treatment systems: SBR vs CAS	WATER PRACTICE AND TECHNOLOGY												European Water Directive 91/271/EEC introduced a series of measures aimed at protecting sensitive areas against the emission of nutrients originating from waste water treatment plants. There are, however, environmental costs associated with achieving the required level of water quality, such as greenhouse gas emissions resulting from energy consumption. The goal of this study is to assess these environmental costs in an enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR)-sequencing batch reactor (SBR) system for a population equivalent (p.e.) of 45 people and compare it to a conventional activated sludge (CAS) system. For that purpose, three major environmental indicators have been estimated: the global warming potential (GWP); eutrophication potential (EP) and power consumption (PC). Moreover, two different functional units, one based on volume (m(3)) and the other on eutrophication reduction (kg PO4removed3-), were used to further determine sustainability. In this case study, the 45 p. e. EBPR-SBR showed a GWP of 150 kg CO2/kg PO4removed3-, an EP of 13.6 equivalent g PO43-/m(3) and a PC of 175 kWh/kg PO4removed3-. These values are below those obtained for a CAS system.																	1751-231X					AUG	2017	12	3					549	556		10.2166/wpt.2017.066								WOS:000424140400006

The SWMM hydrological model was calibrated and then used to predict the hydrograph and concentration graphs of surface runoff from a storm events based on weather forecasts. These results are used to decide how to operate the first flush treatment unit in the field by comparing water quality in the unit with that in runoff. This water quality monitoring system will also be used to reflect real-time field conditions, which will be used to improve the efficiency of the treatment system. The first flush treatment unit can be installed underground to use for storage of storm water. The system was tested against field data collected in a sub-basin of the Gwanpyung-cheon stream in Daejeon, Republic of Korea. Continuous monitoring results indicated that the first 4 hours of surface runoff exhibit higher concentrations than normal levels in the study site, and these levels can be used to determine the necessary volume for efficient treatment. When settling in the treatment system over 24 hours, the average removal efficiencies for TSS, TP and TN were 87.4%, 57.3%, and 43.6%, respectively.																	1751-231X					AUG	2017	12	3					557	563		10.2166/wpt.2017.065								WOS:000424140400007						
J	Masindi, V				Masindi, Vhahangwele			Integrated treatment of acid mine drainage using cryptocrystalline magnesite and barium chloride	WATER PRACTICE AND TECHNOLOGY												This study endeavours to report the efficiency of a hybrid approach in the treatment of acid mine drainage. Cryptocrystalline magnesite was used to pre-treat acid mine drainage and barium chloride was used to remove the residual sulphate through the formation of barium sulphate. Batch experimental approach was adopted and the documented optimum conditions for both cryptocrystalline magnesite and barium salts were used. This was 60 mins for pre-treatment and 60 mins for polishing the residual sulphate. Water quality was assessed using ICP-MS and IC. Mineralogical composition was done using XRD, elemental composition with XRF, morphology with SEM and transmission electron microscope. Magnesite removed >99% of heavy metal species and 40% sulphate except for base cations. Barium managed to remove 99% of residual sulphate from an aqueous system. This indicate that the water meet the industrial, discharge and irrigation standards as stipulated by the water quality guidelines. As such, it can be concluded that this integrated approach can be used to treat acid mine drainage to useable standards as defined in the water quality guidelines. This will be a pragmatic approach for mining houses to curtail the impact of acid mine drainage by using natural and locally available materials such as cryptocrystalline magnesite and polish the water with barium salts.																	1751-231X					AUG	2017	12	3					727	736		10.2166/wpt.2017.074								WOS:000424140400023

It outlines key issues such as: the configuration of the system, number of household connections, water production and consumption, Non-revenue Water (NRW), service level, water tariff structure and the financial situation of the state-owned water utility (ENACAL). The analysis of the data collected shows that Nicaragua has reached 99% coverage of safe drinking water in urban areas and has met Target 7.C of the MDGs. Nevertheless, it is still a challenge to provide a better level of service in terms of both water quality and continuity of supply. Managua city has a continuous water supply of between 3 and 24 h per day and some areas have long-term water shortages. The study also showed that ENACAL and its main water system (Managua) has a NRW above 50% and a non-cost recovery water tariff. This has created an unsustainable financial situation in the national water utility, which is reflected in the lack of maintenance and lack of replacement of old infrastructure, leading to a "vicious circle" of ineffective service and non-willingness to pay for water supply services. Without UWDM plans, measures or strategies in Managua, there is a low probability that ENACAL's financial situation will improve, making it unlikely that the current water service level will improve in Managua city.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				AUG	2017	87						120	130		10.5004/dwt.2017.21338								WOS:000415820700010

A survey of inorganic chemicals was performed in water samples collected from the Kirklareli dam reservoirs in 2014-2015. Water samples from five sampling sites were collected and analyzed for 12 different water quality parameters. Using these data, regional irrigation water quality was assessed via a method prescribed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Results from the application of this method indicated that the salinity of the dam water, as represented by electrical conductivity (ECw), was at a medium level (C2: 250-750 micromhos cm(-1)), and that the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) ranged from medium (S2: 10-18) to high (S3: 18-26) sodicity. Therefore, the dam water from the sampling sites of 1, 3, 4, and 5 was predominantly of the C2-S2 class. Cation concentrations were found to be higher in January than in the other months. In examining the water quality classes in terms of measured physico-chemical parameters, the dam water was determined to be class I for pH, EC, TSS and cations. Furthermore, the results showed that the Pb concentrations in the Kirklareli dam water (10-200 mu g L-1) were of the class IV quality, which is the maximum limit of the Turkish Water Pollution Control Regulations. The Fe and Mn concentrations in the dam water were class II.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				AUG	2017	87						306	313		10.5004/dwt.2017.21316								WOS:000415820700028

This study describes a methodology to obtain the best performance for multiple LID units under varying by time-to-peak of storm with the same intensity and duration using storm water management model (SWMM), a popular model for rainfall-runoff and water quality simulation. The hypothetical temporal distributions were designated by Huff curves, which provided characterizing storm mass curves, along with the relationship of intensity-duration-frequency to determine storm intensity for 1-h in 2-year return period. Three types of LID units (rain barrel, infiltration trench, and vegetative swale) were selected to develop aggregate LID scenarios using the SWMM. The results indicated that, when compared with other field experiments, the SWMM successfully estimated change in flow discharge and suspended solid (SS) loss reflecting different storm patterns at the final outlet of and urbanized sub-catchment as well as the effects of LID practices. The performances of aggregate LID scenarios including lag time of peak runoff, peak runoff reduction, volume reduction, and SS loss reduction were sensitive to arrangement order and time-of-storm peak-to-storm duration. Scenario 5, which had the order of vegetative swale, rain barrel, and infiltration trench, showed the most effective serial arrangement, as it exhibited the more consistent results across the storm patters. This study thus provides insights into the effective design of aggregate LID scenarios considering different storm characteristics.

Groundwater salinization in Graciosa and Pico islands (Azores archipelago, Portugal): processes and impacts	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: Graciosa and Pico islands, Azores, Portugal Study focus: Seawater intrusion is a main driver of groundwater salinization in the Azores archipelago. In order to characterize the associated geochemical processes through major-ion and determination of stable (delta O-18; delta H-2; delta B-11) and radiogenic isotopic ratios (delta(87) Sr) a total of 46 wells were sampled in Graciosa and Pico, as well as 51 wells from other islands. New hydrological insights for the region: The overall groundwater chemistry is mainly controlled by Cl and Na, which account respectively for 10.4%-46.9% and 16%-39.7% of the relative major-ion content. Mean electrical conductivity (EC) in Graciosa is in the range 308 - 3462 mu S/cm, while hand-dug wells in Pico are highly mineralized (1758-9732 mu S/cm). Drilled wells in Pico are in the range of 186 mu S/cm to 5625 mu S/cm. Besides mixture with seawater, groundwater chemistry is also influenced by dissolution of silicate minerals which also contributes to water composition. Moreover, O-18 and H-2 stable isotope data show that a few samples depict an evaporative effect, resulting in heavier isotopic compositions besides mixing with a marine source. About 70% of the wells in Graciosa and Pico exceed the 200 mg Cl/L and the EC Portuguese reference values, severely constraining water supply. The impact on water quality is also shown by exceedances of the groundwater threshold values derived for the Azores River Basin District (89%).
