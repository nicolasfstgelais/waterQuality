J	Karan, S; Sebok, E; Engesgaard, P				Karan, Sachin; Sebok, Eva; Engesgaard, Peter			Air/water/sediment temperature contrasts in small streams to identify groundwater seepage locations	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The need to identify groundwater seepage locations is of great importance for managing both stream water quality and groundwater sourced ecosystems due to their dependency on groundwater-borne nutrients and temperatures. Although several reconnaissance methods using temperature as tracer exist, these are subjected to limitations related to mainly the spatial and temporal resolution and/or mixing of groundwater and surface water leading to dilution of the temperature differences. Further, some methods, for example, thermal imagery and fiber optic distributed temperature sensing, although relative efficient in detecting temperature differences over larger distances, these are labor-intensive and costly. Therefore, there is a need for additional cost-effective methods identifying substantial groundwater seepage locations. We present a method expanding the linear regression of air and stream temperatures by measuring the temperatures in dual-depth; in the stream column and at the streambed-water interface (SWI). By doing so, we apply metrics from linear regression analysis of temperatures between air/stream and air/SWI (linear regression slope, intercept, and coefficient of determination), and the daily water temperature cycle (daily mean temperatures, temperature variance, and the mean diel temperature fluctuation). We show that using metrics from only single-depth stream temperature measurements are insufficient to identify substantial groundwater seepage locations in a head-water stream. Conversely, comparing the metrics from dual-depth temperatures show significant differences; at groundwater seepage locations, temperatures at the SWI merely explain 43-75% of the variation opposed to 91% at the corresponding stream column temperatures. In general, at these locations at the SWI, the slopes (<0.25) and intercepts (>6.5 degrees C) are substantially lower and higher, respectively, while the mean diel temperature fluctuations (<0.98 degrees C) are decreased compared to remaining locations. The dual-depth approach was applied in a post-glacial fluvial setting, where metrics analyses overall corroborated with field measurements of groundwater fluxes and stream flow accretions. Thus, we propose a method reliably identifying groundwater seepage locations along streambeds in such settings.

It is therefore important to assess any hydrologic trends in urban catchments for stormwater management and planning. This study addresses urban hydrological trend analysis by examining trends in variables that characterize hydrological processes. The original and modified Mann-Kendall methods are applied to trend detection in two French catchments, that is, Chassieu and La Lechere, based on approximately 1decade of data from local monitoring programs. In both catchments, no trend is found in the major hydrological process driver (i.e., rainfall variables), whereas increasing trends are detected in runoff flow rates. As a consequence, the runoff coefficients tend to increase during the study period, probably due to growing imperviousness with the local urbanization process. In addition, conceptual urban rainfall-runoff model parameters, which are identified via model calibration with an event based approach, are examined. Trend detection results indicate that there is no trend in the time of concentration in Chassieu, whereas a decreasing trend is present in La Lechere, which, however, needs to be validated with additional data. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the original Mann-Kendall method is not sensitive to a few noisy values in the data series.

J	Hurkamp, K; Tafelmeier, S; Tschiersch, J				Huerkamp, Kerstin; Tafelmeier, Stefanie; Tschiersch, Jochen			Influence of melt-freeze-cycles on the radionuclide transport in homogeneous laboratory snowpack	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Radionuclides released to the environment and deposited with or onto snow can be stored over long time periods if ambient temperature stays low, particularly in glaciated areas or high alpine sites. The radionuclides will be accumulated in the snowpack during the winter unless meltwater runoff at the snow base occurs. They will be released to surface waters within short time during snowmelt in spring. In two experiments under controlled melting conditions of snow in the laboratory, radionuclide migration and runoff during melt-freeze-cycles were examined. The distribution of Cs-134 and Sr-85 tracers in homogeneous snow columns and their fractionation and potential preferential elution in the first meltwater portions were determined. Transport was associated with the percolation of meltwater at ambient temperatures above 0 degrees C after the snowpack became ripe. Mean migration velocities in the pack were examined for both nuclides to about 0.5cmhr(-1) after one diurnal melt-freeze-cycle at ambient temperatures of -2to 4 degrees C. Meltwater fluxes were calculated with a median of 1.68cmhr(-1). Highly contaminated portions of meltwater with concentration factors between 5 and 10 against initial bulk concentrations in the snowpack were released as ionic pulse with the first meltwater. Neither for caesium nor strontium preferential elution was observed. After recurrent simulated day-night-cycles (-2 to 4 degrees C), 80% of both radionuclides was released with the first 20% of snowmelt within 4days. 50% of Cs-134 and Sr-85 were already set free after 24hr. Snowmelt contained highest specific activities when the melt rate was lowest during the freeze-cycles due to concentration processes in remaining liquids, enhanced by the melt-freeze-cycling. This implies for natural snowpack after significant radionuclide releases, that long-time accumulation of radionuclides in the snow during frost periods, followed by an onset of steady meltwater runoff at low melt rates, will cause the most pronounced removal of the contaminants from the snow cover. This scenario represents the worst case of impact on water quality and radiation exposure in aquatic environments.																	0885-6087	1099-1085				MAR 15	2017	31	6					1360	1370		10.1002/hyp.11110								WOS:000395628600012

Dissolved nitrous oxide (N2O) dynamics in agricultural field drains and headwater streams in an intensive arable catchment	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Indirect nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions produced by nitrogen (N) leaching into surface water and groundwater bodies are poorly understood in comparison to direct N2O emissions from soils. In this study, dissolved N2O concentrations were measured weekly in both lowland headwater streams and subsurface agricultural field drain discharges over a 2-year period (2013-2015) in an intensive arable catchment, Norfolk, UK. All field drain and stream water samples were found to have dissolved N2O concentrations higher than the water-air equilibrium concentration, illustrating that all sites were acting as a net source of N2O emissions to the atmosphere. Soil texture was found to significantly influence field drain N2O dynamics, with mean concentrations from drains in clay loam soils (5.3gNL(-1)) being greater than drains in sandy loam soils (4.0gNL(-1)). Soil texture also impacted upon the relationships between field drain N2O concentrations and other water quality parameters (pH, flow rate, and nitrate (NO3) and nitrite (NO2) concentrations), highlighting possible differences in N2O production mechanisms in different soil types. Catchment antecedent moisture conditions influenced the storm event mobilisation of N2O in both field drains and streams, with the greatest concentration increases recorded during precipitation events preceded by prolonged wet conditions. N2O concentrations also varied seasonally, with the lowest mean concentrations typically occurring during the summer months (JJA). Nitrogen fertiliser application rates and different soil inversion regimes were found to have no effect on dissolved N2O concentrations, whereas higher N2O concentrations recorded in field drains under a winter cover crop compared to fallow fields revealed cover crops are an ineffective greenhouse gas emission mitigation strategy. Overall, this study highlights the complex interactions governing the dynamics of dissolved N2O concentrations in field drains and headwater streams in a lowland intensive agricultural catchment.

Hypothetical scenario exercises to improve planning and readiness for drinking water quality management during extreme weather events	WATER RESEARCH												Two hypothetical scenario exercises were designed and conducted to reflect the increasingly extreme weather-related challenges faced by water utilities as the global climate changes. The first event was based on an extreme flood scenario. The second scenario involved a combination of weather events, including a wild forest fire ('bushfire') followed by runoff due to significant rainfall. For each scenario, a panel of diverse personnel from water utilities and relevant agencies (e.g. health departments) formed a hypothetical water utility and associated regulatory body to manage water quality following the simulated extreme weather event. A larger audience participated by asking questions and contributing key insights. Participants were confronted with unanticipated developments as the simulated scenarios unfolded, introduced by a facilitator. Participants were presented with information that may have challenged their conventional experiences regarding operational procedures in order to identify limitations in current procedures, assumptions, and readily available information. The process worked toward the identification of a list of specific key lessons for each event. At the conclusion of each simulation a facilitated discussion was used to establish key lessons of value to water utilities in preparing them for similar future extreme events. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, the possibility of using pre-ozonation instead of post-ozonation for the removal of micropollutants was explored because of the lower risk of forming carcinogenic bromate. A 1.0 m(3)/h pilot system was utilized to compare the efficacy of pre- and post-ozonation in the removal of bulk organic pollutants as well as micropollutants, including typical odor-causing compounds, pharmaceuticals, and typical pesticides, from one source water (Huangpu River) characterized by the occurrence of various micropollutants. Both pre-ozonation and post-ozonation could achieve similar water purification performance under an ozone dose of 1.5 mg/L, in terms of bulk water quality parameters like CODMn, (66% in combination with biological activated carbon (BAC) treatment, compared to 62% with the pre-ozonation-BAC combination) or micropollutants including 27 pharmaceuticals (85% in combination with BAC compared to 87% with the pre-ozonation-BAC combination) and 25 pesticides (72% in combination with BAC compared to 61% with the preozonation-BAC combination). Pre-ozonation exhibited slightly better odorant removal performance (100% in combination with BAC compared to 92% with the post-ozonation-BAC combination); however, post-ozonation generated approximately 6.0 mu g/L bromate at an ozone dose of 2.0 mg/L, while pre-ozonation did not form bromate even at an ozone dose as high as 3.0 mg/L. So pre-ozonation in combination with BAC might be a solution for the removal of micropollutants from source water with high bromate formation risk. The results of this study will be helpful for the optimization of ozonation processes in the water supply industry. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Microbial source tracking in shellfish harvesting waters in the Gulf of Nicoya, Costa Rica	WATER RESEARCH												Current microbial water quality monitoring is generally limited to culture-based measurements of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB). Given the many possible sources of fecal pollution within a watershed and extra intestinal FIB reservoirs, it is important to determine source(s) of fecal pollution as a means to improve water quality and protect public health. The principal objective of this investigation was to characterize the microbial water quality of shellfish harvesting areas in the Gulf of Nicoya, Costa Rica during 2015. In order to achieve this objective, the specificity and sensitivity of 11 existing microbial source tracking (MST) PCR assays, associated with cows (BacCow), dogs (BacCan, DogBac), domestic wastewater (PMMoV), general avian (GFD), gulls (Gull2), horses (HorseBac, HoF), humans (HF183, HPyV), and pigs (PF), were evaluated using domestic wastewater and animal fecal samples collected from the region. The sensitivity of animal-associated assays ranged from 13 to 100%, while assay specificity ranged from 38 to 100%. The specificity of pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) and human polyomavirus (HPyV) was 100% for domestic wastewater, as compared to 94% specificity of the HF183 Bacteroidales marker. PMMoV was identified as a useful domestic wastewater-associated marker, with concentrations as high as 1.1 x 10(5) copies/ml and 100% sensitivity and specificity. Monthly surface water samples collected from four shellfish harvesting areas were analyzed using culture-based methods for Escherichia coli as well as molecular methods for FIB and a suite of MST markers, which were selected for their specificity in the region. While culturable E. coli results suggested possible fecal pollution during the monitoring period, the absence of human/domestic wastewater-associated markers and low FIB concentrations determined using molecular methods indicated sufficient microbial water quality for shellfish harvesting. This is the first study to our knowledge to test the performance of MST markers in Costa Rica as well as in Central America. Given the lack of wastewater treatment and the presence of secondary sources of FIB, this study highlights the importance of an MST toolbox approach to characterize water quality in tropical regions. Furthermore, it confirms and extends the geographic range of PMMoV as an effective tool for monitoring domestic wastewater pollution. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Evaluation of the dry and wet weather recreational health risks in a semi-enclosed marine embayment in Southern California	WATER RESEARCH												For many coastal regions around the world, recreational beach water quality is assessed using fecal indicator bacteria (FIB). However, the utility of FIB as indicators of recreational water illness (RWI) risk has been questioned, particularly in coastal settings with no obvious sources of human sewage. In this study we employed a source-apportionment quantitative microbial risk assessment (SA-QMRA) to assess RWI risk at a popular semi-enclosed recreational beach in Southern California (Baby Beach, City of Dana Point) with no obvious point sources of human sewage. Our SA-QMRA results suggest that, during dry weather, the median RWI risk at this beach is below the U.S. EPA recreational water quality criteria (RWQC) of 36 illness cases per 1000 bathers. During wet weather, the median RWI risk predicted by SA-QMRA depends on the assumed level of human waste associated with stormwater; the RWI risk is below the EPA RWQC illness risk benchmark 100% of the time provided that <2% of the FIB in stormwater are of human origin. However, these QMRA outcomes contrast strongly with the EPA RWQC for 30-day geometric mean of enterococci bacteria. Our results suggest that SA-QMRA is a useful framework for estimating robust RWI risk that takes into account local information about possible human and non-human sources of FIB.

J	Jayakumar, R; Lee, E				Jayakumar, Ramasamy; Lee, Eunhee			Climate change and groundwater conditions in the Mekong Region-A review	JOURNAL OF GROUNDWATER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING												Changes in the climatic system introduce uncertainties in the supply and management of water resources. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts an increase of 2 to 4 degrees C over the next 100 years. Temperature increases will impact the hydrologic cycle by directly increasing the evaporation of surface water sources. Consequently, changes in precipitation will indirectly impact the flux and storage of water in surface and subsurface reservoirs (i.e., lakes, soil moisture, groundwater, etc.). In addition, increases in temperature contribute to increases in the sea level, which may lead to sea water intrusions, water quality deterioration, potable water shortages, etc. Climate change has direct impacts on the surface water and the control of storage in rivers, lakes and reservoirs, which indirectly controls the groundwater recharge process. The main and direct impact of climate change on groundwater is changes in the volume and distribution of groundwater recharge. The impact of climate change on groundwater resources requires reliable forecasting of changes in the major climatic variables and accurate estimations of groundwater recharge. A number of Global Climate Models (GCMs) are available for understanding climate and projecting climate change. These GCMs can be downscaled to a basin scale, and when they are coupled with relevant hydrological models, the output of these coupled models can be used to quantify the groundwater recharge, which will facilitate the adoption of appropriate adaptation strategies under the impact of climate change.																	2305-7068					MAR 2	2017	5	1					14	30										WOS:000395830300002

In this study, two commercially available kits were compared to assess their performance, the MO BIO PowerViral Environmental DNA/RNA Isolation kit and the Qiagen QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit. A performance assessment of extraction kits for detecting and quantifying six human enteric viruses as the commonest waterborne pathogens and one plant virus as an alternative fecal indicator has been carried out using quantitative PCR (qPCR). Water samples were collected from seven sites in Singapore during March and April 2015. In general, a strong association was observed between two different viral DNA/RNA extraction kits and detection frequency of targets (P = 0.017). The Qiagen kit showed higher extraction efficiency than the MoBio kit. However, in terms of quantification, a significant difference was only observed in the occurrences of NoV GI and PMMoV between two different kits (P < 0.05), although the kits showed similar efficiency removing qPCR inhibitors. The Qiagen kit was preferred for routine water quality monitoring.

This study selected the factors affecting residual ozone concentration and attempted to estimate the optimum amount of hydrogen peroxide dosage for the control of the residual ozone concentration by developing a model for the prediction of the residual ozone concentration. The prediction formulas developed in this study can quickly respond to the environment of water quality and surrounding environmental factors, which change in real time, so it is judged that they could be used for the operation of the optimum ozone process, and the control of ozone dosage could be used as a new method in controlling the concentration of ozone dosage and the concentration of residual ozone.																	1751-231X					MAR	2017	12	1					87	96		10.2166/wpt.2017.014								WOS:000407606400009

Treatment of industrial mineral oil wastewater - effects of coagulant type and dosage	WATER PRACTICE AND TECHNOLOGY												The use of coagulants is essential in the diverse disciplines of conventional water and wastewater treatment. This work aimed to select an economic and effective coagulant, to minimize the cost of treatment and the oil droplet content of the water, thus enhancing the efficiency of a local South African oil refinery effluent plant recovering water and oil for reuse by treating the industrial mineral oil wastewater. A standard dissolved air flotation jar test preceded evaluation of four coagulants, viz. aluminum sulfate (Alum), aluminum chloride, ferric sulfate and ferric chloride. Chemical oxygen demand, soap oil and grease, total suspended solids and turbidity were determined as water quality parameters to check coagulant efficiency. Removal of over 70% was achieved for each parameter. The results obtained at pH 5 and coagulant dose of 50 mg/L showed that alum was the best pretreatment coagulant for destabilizing and minimizing oil droplets in water, due to its trivalent cationic nature. It was also economically viable.					Kweinor Tetteh, Emmanuel/0000-0003-1400-7847												1751-231X					MAR	2017	12	1					139	145		10.2166/wpt.2017.021								WOS:000407606400014						
J	Daigger, GT				Daigger, Glen T.			Flexibility and adaptability: essential elements of the WRRF of the future	WATER PRACTICE AND TECHNOLOGY												All Water Resource Recovery Facilities (WRRFs) must comply with evolving treatment objectives and product water quality requirements, using technologies which also evolve over time. The useful life of the physical structures, especially hydraulic conveyance (pipes and channels) and water holding structures, is significantly longer than that of the specific technologies used. Thus, the WRRF of the future must, first and foremost, be designed with the flexibility to adapt to a wide variety of requirements over its life using a wide variety of technologies, some of which are currently known while others will be invented and/or further developed over time. This might be seen as the true essence of the WRRF of the future, rather than the specific technology implemented at a particular time. While incorporating flexibility and adaptability into facilities may seem daunting, especially since future requirements and technologies are largely unknown, experience indicates that much can be done to prepare for such changes. Proven engineering approaches are presented and discussed in the paper, including the 'building block approach' to plant layout and design, and the choice of process tank configurations which can accommodate numerous technologies.																	1751-231X					MAR	2017	12	1					156	165		10.2166/wpt.2017.019								WOS:000407606400016

Modelling of nitrates in River Nzoia using MIKE 11	WATER PRACTICE AND TECHNOLOGY												Eutrophication is a serious problem in Lake Victoria as a result of enrichment by nutrients transported by the rivers draining into it. River Nzoia is one of the main rivers draining into the lake. The main aim of this study was to simulate the level of nitrates using MIKE 11 and to establish relationship between nitrogen and phosphorus. The model was calibrated using water quality data for 2009 and validated with March 2013 data and then it was used to simulate nitrate concentration for the wet month of April 2013. The model performance was good with R-2 values of between 0.87 and 0.98 and EF values of between 0.73 and 0.96. From the simulations, the effluent discharge from municipal and industrial wastewater ponds elevated the concentration of the nitrates in the river. Analysis of the concentrations of nitrates for wet and dry periods showed significant variations indicating significant contributions from the catchment through run-off. The relationship between total nitrogen and total phosphorus was analysed and found to have a strong positive correlation (r = 0.714, p < 0.05) indicating that both originate from similar sources or are influenced by the same factors such as agriculture.																	1751-231X					MAR	2017	12	1					217	223		10.2166/wpt.2017.026								WOS:000407606400022

Fossil fuel reserves are diminishing and increasing fossil fuels combustion has also resulted severe climatic and environmental issues. In the meanwhile, the enormous amount of solar energy 5-5.5 kWh/m(2) in most parts of the Pakistan offers an excellent opportunity to use it effectively for desalination processes. This study has been carried out for the development and evaluation of solar desalination system using evaporation condensation and heat recovery method. The effect of key parameters on fresh water production have been studied and it was found that the fresh water productivity and system efficiency is a function of solar radiation, mass flow rates (MFR), tilt angle of flat plate collector (FPC) and inlet hot water temperature. The result shows that the daily specific fresh water productivity was found to be 4.5 l/m(2) with an overall system efficiency of 52%. The result also shows that the heat recovery of vapors in condensation chamber (CC) increases the system efficiency by 6% and the gain output ratio (GOR) of the system was found in the range of 1.7-2.2. The water quality tests show that the quality parameters are in line with WHO water quality standards and the concentration of arsenic, E. coli and facial coliform remained undetectable in the distillate. The cost per liter of water from the system was found to be $0.021 which is lower than the cost of the available bottled fresh water in the country.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				MAR	2017	68						80	90		10.5004/dwt.2017.20306								WOS:000403569900009

This study evaluated the physical and chemical parameters of 19 wells located in South Khorasan Province, within the boundary of Birjand City (with an area of 5,400 km(2)). First, using ArcGIS 10.22 software, the zoning maps were plotted for pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), total hardness (TH), bicarbonate, ammonium, sulfate, nitrate, calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium. Then, WQI was employed to evaluate water quality. According to the results, in over 90% of the studied area, EC, TDS, and TH values were above the allowable limit. Considering the zoning map and the results of spatial analysis of the parameters, the more we moved from the south of the studied region to the north, the parameters values increased, representing the worsened quality of water. Based on the results of WQI classification, only 10.5% of the studied wells were placed in the first group (excellent water), while the majority of sampling points (36.84%) were placed in the third group (poor water). The zoning and spatial analysis of water quality showed that water quality was suitable for drinking purposes only in 1,958 km(2) (36.28%) of the entire studied region. Moreover, in 3,437.53 km(2) (63.69%) of the studied area, water quality was unsuitable for drinking. Therefore, the application of WQI and spatial analysis through GIS was effective for monitoring groundwater quality in the studied region, and it can be considered as a promising tool for understanding the spatial patterns and changes.				eslami, hadi/S-6433-2017; khodadadi, maryam/J-4091-2017	eslami, hadi/0000-0001-5137-4764; khosravi, Rasoul/0000-0003-0202-2353												1944-3994	1944-3986				MAR	2017	67						74	83		10.5004/dwt.2017.20458								WOS:000403569700008

This process is free of the harmful by substances associated with chemical disinfection. Furthermore, it has the added benefit of not compromising the taste, the color and the odor of the treated water. In order to operate UV disinfection plants at the optimum conditions, an efficient control based on multivariable model has to be implemented. The main objective of this paper is development of a novel multiple- input multiple-output model of the UV disinfection process. Compared with other developed models, this new dynamic model, based on empirical transfer matrix and extended to a state-space model, takes into account various water quality parameters. It is also easy to be used in simulation and in practical implementation. The accuracy of our developed model is demonstrated by computer dynamic simulation and validated by experimental results. A good agreement was observed.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				MAR	2017	67						89	96		10.5004/dwt.2017.20451								WOS:000403569700010

In this study, a combined processing method was established to enhance discharge water quality. This process incorporated a pretreatment system, a biological contact oxidation unit, an ozone oxidation unit, and an intensive treatment system. Through this treatment approach, the ozonation of textile wastewater was examined to determine the effects of ozone dosage, ozonation time, and color/chemical oxygen demand (COD) of feed wastewater. Results revealed that the color and COD removal rates increased with increased ozone dosage. Color and COD decreased whereas NH3-N slightly increased with the progress of ozonation. Color removal rate decreased whereas ozone dosage increased with increased feed color and COD. Feed color greatly influenced ozone dosage but not COD. Color removal rate during ozonation can be controlled to 50%-55% at a response time of approximately 2 h. The average ozone dosage was 51 g m(-3). After treatment by the combined process, the final discharge water was able to meet the national first-grade emission standard (GB4287-2012). The total removal rates of COD and color reached 95.2% and 95.4%, respectively. The cost of wastewater treatment amounted to only approximately 1.70 Yuan RMB m(-3) wastewater.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				MAR	2017	66						140	148		10.5004/dwt.2016.1619								WOS:000403569400017						
J	Xue, SA; Liu, Y; Wen, Y; Li, FY				Xue, Shuang; Liu, Ying; Wen, Yang; Li, Fayun			The distribution and characteristics of dissolved organic matter fractions in urban rivers during icebound season	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in surface waters has important implication for water quality, and also plays an important role in the distribution, bioavailability, and toxicity of pollutants in waters. The distribution, spectroscopic characteristics and chlorine reactivity of DOM fractions in the North Canal in Shenyang during icebound season were investigated. DOM was fractionated using XAD resins into five fractions: hydrophobic acid (HPO-A), hydrophobic neutral (HPO-N), transphilic acid (TPI-A), transphilic neutral (TPI-N) and hydrophilic fraction (HPI). The results showed that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in river waters were relatively high during icebound season. DOC values of the bulk DOM, HPO-A, TPI-A and TPI-N in ice phase were lower than those corresponding values in liquid phase. The variation trend of absorbance of ultraviolet light at 254 nm (UV254) along the direction of water was inconsistent with that of DOC in both liquid and ice phases. HPO-A and TPI-A were the dominant ultraviolet (UV)-absorbing compounds in both liquid and ice phases. The variation trend of fluorescent materials in ice phase along the direction of water was similar to that in liquid phase. HPO-A, HPO-N and TPI-N were the main trihalomethane precursors in both liquid and ice phases. Trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP) of HPO-A, TPI-A, HPO-N and TPI-N in ice phase was lower than that in liquid phase. Such knowledge can assist in our understanding of DOM dynamics in urban rivers during icebound season, and thus provides improved insight into the development of effective water quality management.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				MAR	2017	66						184	194		10.5004/dwt.2017.20207								WOS:000403569400022

The sediments were characterized using XRD, XRF and FTIR techniques. The physico-chemical parameters and heavy metals content of water were also measured to evaluate their impact on water quality and fitness for human consumption. The highest percentages of Fe, total Cr and Mg (83.46, 27.43, and 88.83%, respectively) were predominantly associated with the residual fraction of the sediments. Elements such as Ca and Mn were mostly bound to the exchangeable fraction of the sediments. Association of Fe, total Cr and Mg with the residual fraction as predicted by speciation calculations suggests that these metals are strongly bound to the sediments and therefore less susceptible to cause pollution. The mobility order of the heavy metals in the sediments samples was Ca > Mn > Mg > Fe > Cr. For the first time the implication of organic matter in the sediments along the Mooi River on the retention of metals was investigated and it was found that organic matter occurring in various concentrations in these sediments, contained binding groups such as C-O, C-C=C, O-H and = C-H much likely to contribute to the retention of metals in the exchangeable fraction of the sediments. The amount of inorganic pollutants in water was found to basically decrease moving downstream, but the water quality remained unfit for human consumption at most of the sampling points.

Compared with point-source pollutants, the identification and quantification of non-point-source pollutants are critical but difficult issues in water environmental pollution studies. The Jinghe River is one of the main tributaries of the Weihe River. However, the non-point-source pollution of this river is not well understood. In order to analyze the sources of pointand non-point loads to river water, the river water quality model QUAL2E and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) & Factor Analysis (FA) were applied simultaneously to calculate the point-and non-point-source loads of ammonia nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen, respectively, in dry and wet seasons from 2002 to 2007. The results show that NO3- -N can be associated with point-source pollution, such as domestic sewage in dry seasons, but non-point-source pollution generated by precipitation in wet seasons. NH4+-N can be associated with point-source pollution throughout the year. The methods applied in this research provide reliable results on non-point-source pollution caused by storm runoff.																	0187-8336	2007-2422				MAR-APR	2017	8	2					117	126										WOS:000403101600011

Results show that, depending on how respondents perceived the issue, knowledge level and perception of a problem both are dominating factors in people's understanding of their water source. Using a survey to identify relationships, the study found that those respondents from cities with lead levels that exceeded the action level showed higher concern for their tap water quality; this increased when the respondents could not identify their water source. Looking at these results in the context of the theory of planned behavior (specifically perception, knowledge, and behavior), showed that the more people know about their source water, the less likely they are to express unnecessary concern due to a misperception of an issue.

Biologically active filtration successfully decreased dissolved organic carbon (DOC) by 5-25% and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) by 5-38%. The removal of these parameters corresponded to some decreases in carbonaceous and nitrogenous DBP formation. Formation potential tests showed 13-45% and 18-57% reduction in the formation of trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids, respectively. Bromine incorporation factors of trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids increased across the biofilters. Biofilters also showed 25-48%, 15-20%, and 34-50% removal of halonitromethane, haloacetonitrile, and N-nitrosodimethylamine precursors, respectively. The effects of filter media and phosphate amendment were also evaluated in full-and pilot-scale systems. Results showed that replacing the anthracite layer with granular activated carbon increased the removal of DOC, DON, and DBP precursors. Phosphate amendment had no distinct effect on the removal of DOC, DON, or DBP precursors.																	2164-4535					MAR	2017	109	3					E73	E84		10.5942/jawwa.2017.109.0014								WOS:000400052000004

The aim of this study was to evaluate the water quality from the fountains located in three public parks in Curitiba, Parana, Brasil. The monitoring was conducted monthly by microbiological analysis of total coliforms (TC), Escherichia coli (EC) and heterotrophic bacteria (HB) and the pH was taken, with triplicate samples during a year at three sites: Atuba Park (A), Gutierrez Park (B) and Sao Lourenco Park (C). The results showed TC in site A; at B it was observed the presence, at high levels, of TC (log 2.4350 +/- 0.6730 NMP center dot 100 mL(-1)), EC (log 1.0890 +/- 0.6327 NMP center dot 100 mL(-1)) and HB (log 1.9170 +/- 0.6920 UFC center dot mL-1), significant differences among sampling periods were not observed (p>0.05). It was observed that in the rainy season the condition of water portability decreased in all evaluated sites with a significant increase in TC, followed by increasing of HB, suggesting infiltration in the channeled sources. The presence of E. coli in site B suggests wastewater pollution, which can endanger the health people consuming the available water in the taps.																	1413-4152	1809-4457				MAR-APR	2017	22	2					271	275		10.1590/S1413-41522016158283								WOS:000397875300006						
J	Bajjali, W; Al-Hadidi, K; Ismail, M				Bajjali, William; Al-Hadidi, Kheir; Ismail, Ma'mmon			Water quality and geochemistry evaluation of groundwater upstream and downstream of the Khirbet Al-Samra wastewater treatment plant/Jordan	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Groundwater in the northeastern Amman-Zarqa basin is an important source of water for irrigation. The quality and quantity of water has deteriorated due to mismanagement and misunderstanding of the hydrogeological system. Overexploitation of groundwater resources upstream of the Khirbet Al-Samra wastewater treatment plant (KSWTP) has lowered the water table 43 m since the beginning of groundwater development in 1968. Heavy pumping of groundwater downstream of KSWTP has not dropped the water level due to constant recharge from the Zarqa river bed. The water level of groundwater is rising continuously at a rate of 20 cm per year since building the KSWTP in 1985. Groundwater salinity has also shifted the quality of the aquifer from fresh to brackish. Continual irrigation from the groundwater upstream of KSWTP dissolves accumulated salt from the soil formed by evaporation, and the contaminated water infiltrates back to the aquifer, thereby increasing both salt and nitrate concentrations. The intense irrigation from the reclaimed water downstream of KSWTP and leakage of treated wastewater from the Zarqa River to the shallow groundwater is a secondary source of salt and nitrates. The isotopic composition of groundwater varies over a wide range and is associated with the meteoric water line affected by Mediterranean Sea air moisture. The isotopic composition of groundwater is represented by evaporation line (EL) with a low slope of 3.6. The enrichment of groundwater in delta O-18 and delta D is attributed mainly to the two processes of evaporation before infiltration of return flow and mixing of different types of water in KSWTP originating from different aquifers. The EL starts from a location more depleted than the weighted mean value of the Amman rainfall station on the Eastern Meteoric Water Line indicating that the recharge took place under the climate regime prevailing today in Jordan and the recharge of the groundwater originates from a greater elevation than that of the Amman station. Elevated high tritium levels observed in wells in close proximity to a regional fault system signify local recharge and short residence time. The Khaldyia dam is a local source for groundwater recharge.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				MAR	2017	7	1					53	69		10.1007/s13201-014-0263-x								WOS:000398963100004

For this study, a total of six water samples were collected from three borehole and three spring water sources. The analyses for 14 physico-chemical parameters, pH, turbidity, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, total suspended solids total hardness cations (Ca2+, Mg2+), anions (NO2-, NO3-, SO42- and PO43-) and heavy metals (Fe and Mn), were done in the laboratory by adopting standard procedures suggested by the American Public Health Association (APHA). Descriptive statistics were used to describe data, while Pearson correlation was used to determine the influences of the physico-chemical variables. The single factor analysis of variance (t test) was used to determine possible differences between the borehole and spring water, while means plots were used for further structure detection. From the total samples analyzed, most of the samples comply with the water quality guidelines of Ethiopian limit, WHO and U.SEPA. The pH of the water samples from borehole groundwater source was found to be slightly acidic and bove the maximum permissible limit (MPL). High concentration of Fe and Mn that exceeds the MPL set by WHO was found in the three boreholes. The spring water sources were found to be better for drinking than borehole water sources.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				MAR	2017	7	1					155	164		10.1007/s13201-016-0502-4								WOS:000398963100011

Physico-chemical, bacteriological water quality parameters and trace metal concentration of water samples from five different treatment points from the Owabi water treatment plant were investigated. The raw water was moderately hard with high turbidity and colour that exceeds the WHO guideline limits. Nutrient concentrations were of the following order: NH3 < NO2- < -NO3- < PO43- < SO42- and were all below WHO permissible level for drinking water in all the samples at different stages of treatment. Trace metal concentrations of the reservoir were all below WHO limit except chromium (0.06 mg/L) and copper (0.24 mg/L). The bacteriological study showed that the raw water had total coliform (1,766 cfu/100 mL) and faecal coliform (257 cfu/100 mL) that exceeded the WHO standard limits, rendering it unsafe for domestic purposes without treatment. Colour showed strong positive correlation with turbidity (r = 0.730), TSS (r >= 0.922) and alkalinity (0.564) significant at p < 0.01. The quality of the treated water indicates that colour, turbidity, Cr and Cu levels reduced and fall within the WHO permissible limit for drinking water. Treatment process at the water treatment plant is adjudged to be good.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				MAR	2017	7	1					175	186		10.1007/s13201-014-0232-4								WOS:000398963100013

Assessment of water quality: a case study of the Seybouse River (North East of Algeria)	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The assessment of water quality has been carried out to determine the concentrations of different ions present in the surface waters. The Seybouse River constitutes a dump of industrial and domestic rejections which contribute to the degradation of water quality. A total of 48 surface water samples were collected from different stations. The first objective of this study is the use of water quality index (WQI) to evaluate the state of the water in this river. The second aim is to calculate the parameters of the quality of water destined for irrigation such as sodium adsorption ratio, sodium percentage, and residual sodium carbonate. A high mineralization and high concentration of major chemical elements and nutrients indicate inevitably a high value of WQI index. The mean value of electrical conductivity is about 945.25 mu s/cm in the station 2 (Bouhamdane) and exceeds 1,400 mu s/cm in station 12 of Nador. The concentration of sulfates is above 250 mg/l in the stations 8 (Zimba) and 11 (Helia). A concentration of orthophosphate over 2 mg/l was observed in the station 11. The comparison of the obtained and the WHO standards indicates a before using it use in agricultural purposes.

This is driving the need for environmental compliance in industries like mining, metal processing, pulp and paper, sewage treatment, and chemical manufacturing. The sulfate removal from synthetic water by high cross-linked polystyrene divinylbenzene resin was studied at batch experiments in this study. The effect of pH, contact time, sulfates concentration, and adsorbent dose on the sulfate sequestration was investigated. The optimum conditions were studied on Saline water as a case study. The results showed that with increasing of the absorbent amount; contact time, and pH improve the efficiency of sulfate removal. The maximum sulfates uptake was obtained in pH and contact time 3.0 and 120 min, respectively. Also, with increasing initial concentration of sulfates in water, the efficiency of sulfate removal decreased. The obtained results in this study were matched with Freundlich isotherm and pseudo-second-order kinetic. The maximum adsorption capacity (Qm) and constant rate were found 0.318 (mg/g) and 0.21 (mg/g.min), respectively. This study also showed that in the optimum conditions, the sulfate removal efficiency from Saline water by 0.1 mg/L sulfates was 65.64 %. Eventually, high cross-linked polystyrene divinylbenzene resin is recommended as a suitable and low cost absorbent to sulfate removal from aqueous solutions.

J	Alhamed, M				Alhamed, Mohammad			The hydrological and the hydrogeological framework of the Lottenbachtal, Bochum, Germany	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												This study was performed to investigate the hydrological and the hydrogeological framework of the Lottenbachtal, Germany. Long-term climatic data were statistically analyzed, water and soil samples were collected and analyzed, stream flow discharge was measured and separated, the hydrological balance of this catchment was calculated and a hydrological and hydrogeological conceptual model was constructed. The study area is characterized mainly by the precipitation value ranged between 0.1 and 5 mm/day. The actual evapotranspiration constitutes 31.90 % of the total precipitation, the direct surface runoff constitutes 61.04 %, the soil storage constitutes 3 % and the groundwater recharge of the Lottenbachtal constitutes only 4 % of the total precipitation. The Lottenbachtal has largely affected the diversity of the land use, which includes forests, arable areas, abandoned coal mines and settlement areas. The soil of the forested area is represented by relatively high acidic conditions and relatively high sulfate concentrations, while the soil of the arable areas is represented by near-neutral conditions associated with relatively high concentrations of nutrients and other chemical elements (calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, chloride, sulfate, nitrate). The settlement areas are characterized by huge blocks of concrete and backfills, which are rich in calcium and magnesium carbonates. The effects of this diversity in the land use on groundwater and surface water quality resulting by leaching the chemical elements from the soil covers and the other materials. These effects are represented by the following complex water types of Ca-Na-Mg-Cl-SO4-HCO3, Ca-Mg-HCO3-SO4, Ca-Na-Mg-Cl-SO4, Ca-Na-Mg-Cl-SO4 and Ca-HCO3, which represent the diversity of the flow paths of the water as well as to mixing processes. The diversity of the land use also affected the physical hydrological-hydrogeological characteristics of the study area by increasing the direct surface runoff and decreasing the groundwater recharge. The impervious surfaces of the settlement areas and the low hydraulic conductivities of the soil covers are responsible for these conditions.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				MAR	2017	7	1					315	328		10.1007/s13201-014-0247-x								WOS:000398963100025

Spatio-temporal variability of hydro-chemical characteristics of coastal waters of Gulf of Mannar Marine Biosphere Reserve (GoMMBR), South India	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The intention of this study was to appraise the spatial and temporal variations in the physico-chemical parameters of coastal waters of Rameswaram Island, Gulf of Mannar Marine Biosphere Reserve, south India, using multivariate statistical techniques, such as cluster analysis, factor analysis and principal component analysis. Spatio-temporal variations among the physico-chemical parameters are observed in the coastal waters of Gulf of Mannar, especially during northeast and post monsoon seasons. It is inferred that the high loadings of pH, temperature, suspended particulate matter, salinity, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, chlorophyll a, nutrient species of nitrogen and phosphorus strongly determine the discrimination of coastal water quality. Results highlight the important role of monsoonal variations to determine the coastal water quality around Rameswaram Island.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				MAR	2017	7	1					361	373		10.1007/s13201-014-0251-1								WOS:000398963100029

It accounts for 80 % of the total Tunisian surface water. In this paper, hydrographical methods and PHREEQC geochemical program were used to characterize water quality of Medjerda River, whereas its suitability for irrigation was determined in accordance with its electrical conductivity (EC), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) and sodium concentrations. It was established that the water samples were undersaturated with calcite, dolomite, aragonite, anhydrite, gypsum and halite except in one water sample which is supersaturated with carbonate minerals. The quality assessment of Medjerda River for irrigation purposes showed that some points belonged to the excellent-to-good and good-to-permissible irrigation water categories, while the remaining ones were classified as doubtful to unsuitable for irrigation making the river water use limited to plants with high salt tolerance. Moreover, based on FAO guidelines, almost all water samples may cause immediate salinity to gradual increasing problem but no soil infiltration problems except for two sampling points. However, immediate development or possible increasing of severe toxicity problems may be caused by the continuous use of this water for irrigation due to troublesome concentrations of chloride and sodium.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				MAR	2017	7	1					469	480		10.1007/s13201-015-0265-3								WOS:000398963100040

Assessing the Impact of Recycled Water Quality and Clogging on Infiltration Rates at A Pioneering Soil Aquifer Treatment (SAT) Site in Alice Springs, Northern Territory (NT), Australia	WATER												Infiltration techniques for managed aquifer recharge (MAR), such as soil aquifer treatment (SAT) can facilitate low-cost water recycling and supplement groundwater resources. However there are still challenges in sustaining adequate infiltration rates in the presence of lower permeability sediments, especially when wastewater containing suspended solids and nutrients is used to recharge the aquifer. To gain a better insight into reductions in infiltration rates during MAR, a field investigation was carried out via soil aquifer treatment (SAT) using recharge basins located within a mixture of fine and coarse grained riverine deposits in Alice Springs, Northern Territory, Australia. A total of 2.6 Mm(3) was delivered via five SAT basins over six years; this evaluation focused on three years of operation (2011-2014), recharging 1.5 Mm(3) treated wastewater via an expanded recharge area of approximately 38,400 m(2). Average infiltration rates per basin varied from 0.1 to 1 m/day due to heterogeneous soil characteristics and variability in recharge water quality. A treatment upgrade to include sand filtration and UV disinfection (in 2013) prior to recharge improved the average infiltration rate per basin by 40% to 100%.

Relating Watershed Characteristics to Elevated Stream Escherichia coli Levels in Agriculturally Dominated Landscapes: An Iowa Case Study	WATER												Fecal Indicator Bacteria (FIB) such as Escherichia coli (E. coli) are a leading cause of surface water impairments in the United States. However, the relative impacts of different watershed characteristics on microbial water quality in agriculturally dominated watersheds are unclear. Spatial and statistical analyses were utilized to examine relationships between watershed characteristics and FIB and a multiple regression model was created. Geometric mean E. coli concentration data were obtained for 395 ambient water quality monitoring locations in Iowa. Watersheds were delineated for thirty randomly selected monitoring locations and drainage areas ranged from 93 to 1.1 million hectares. Watershed characteristics examined include area, presence of animal units (open feed lots and confinements), percent of watershed area receiving manure application, presence of point-source discharges, and land cover. The results from the analyses reveal that the presence of animal feeding operations and agriculture, wetland, and woody vegetation land covers are the most influential watershed characteristics regarding E. coli concentration. A significant positive correlation was identified between E. coli concentration and agriculture while significant negative correlations were identified with animal feeding operations and wetland and woody vegetation. Establishing relationships between watershed characteristics and presence of E. coli is needed to identify dominant watershed characteristics contributing to pathogen water impairments and to prioritize remediation efforts.

However, this hypothesis must be validated in various contexts as interactions between multiple land use and land cover (LULC) types, ecological variables and water quality variables render this relationship highly complex. This paper applies a straightforward multivariate approach on a typical large monitoring dataset of a highly managed and densely populated area (Wallonia, Belgium; 10-year dataset), quantifying forest cover effects on nine physico-chemical water quality variables. Results show that forest cover explains about one third of the variability of water quality and is positively correlated with higher quality water. When controlling for spatial autocorrelation, forest cover still explains 9% of water quality. Unlike needle-leaved forest cover, broad-leaved forest cover presents an independent effect from ecological variables and explains independently 4.8% of water quality variability while it shares 5.8% with cropland cover. This study demonstrates clear independent effects of forest cover on water quality, and presents a method to tease out independent LULC effects from typical large multivariate monitoring datasets. Further research on explanatory variables, spatial distribution effects and water quality datasets could lead to effective strategies to mitigate pollution and reach legal targets.

J	Hosseini, N; Johnston, J; Lindenschmidt, KE				Hosseini, Nasim; Johnston, Jacinda; Lindenschmidt, Karl-Erich			Impacts of Climate Change on the Water Quality of a Regulated Prairie River	WATER												Flows along the upper Qu'Appelle River are expected to increase in the future via increased discharge from Lake Diefenbaker to meet the demands of increased agricultural and industrial activity and population growth in southern Saskatchewan. This increased discharge and increased air temperature due to climate change are both expected to have an impact on the water quality of the river. The Water Quality Analysis Simulation Program (WASP7) was used to model current and future water quality of the upper Qu'Appelle River. The model was calibrated and validated to characterize the current state of the water quality of the river. The model was then used to predict water quality [nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) concentrations and oxygen dynamics] for the years 2050-2055 and 2080-2085. The modelling results indicate that global warming will result in a decrease in ice thickness, a shorter ice cover period, and decreased nutrient concentrations in 2050 or 2080 relative to 2010, with a greater decrease of nutrient concentrations in open water. In contrast to the effect of warmer water temperatures, increased flow through water management may cause increases in ammonium, nitrate, and dissolved oxygen concentrations and decreases in orthophosphate concentrations in summer.

A Methodology to Model Environmental Preferences of EPT Taxa in the Machangara River Basin (Ecuador)	WATER												Rivers have been frequently assessed based on the presence of the EphemeropteraPlecopteraTrichoptera (EPT) taxa in order to determine the water quality status and develop conservation programs. This research evaluates the abiotic preferences of three families of the EPT taxa Baetidae, Leptoceridae and Perlidae in the Machangara River Basin located in the southern Andes of Ecuador. With this objective, using generalized linear models (GLMs), we analyzed the relation between the probability of occurrence of these pollution-sensitive macroinvertebrates families and physicochemical water quality conditions. The explanatory variables of the constructed GLMs differed substantially among the taxa, as did the preference range of the common predictors. In total, eight variables had a substantial influence on the outcomes of the three models. For choosing the best predictors of each studied taxa and for evaluation of the accuracy of its models, the Akaike information criterion (AIC) was used. The results indicated that the GLMs can be applied to predict either the presence or the absence of the invertebrate taxa and moreover, to clarify the relation to the environmental conditions of the stream. In this manner, these modeling tools can help to determine key variables for river restoration and protection management.

The objective of this paper is to assess the effect of projected climate change on water quantity and quality in two lowland catchments (the Upper Narew and the Barycz) in Poland in two future periods (near future: 2021-2050, and far future: 2071-2100). The hydrological model SWAT was driven by climate forcing data from an ensemble of nine bias-corrected General Circulation ModelsRegional Climate Models (GCM-RCM) runs based on the Coordinated Downscaling ExperimentEuropean Domain (EURO-CORDEX). Hydrological response to climate warming and wetter conditions (particularly in winter and spring) in both catchments includes: lower snowmelt, increased percolation and baseflow and higher runoff. Seasonal differences in the response between catchments can be explained by their properties (e.g., different thermal conditions and soil permeability). Projections suggest only moderate increases in sediment loss, occurring mainly in summer and winter. A sharper increase is projected in both catchments for TN losses, especially in the Barycz catchment characterized by a more intensive agriculture. The signal of change in annual TP losses is blurred by climate model uncertainty in the Barycz catchment, whereas a weak and uncertain increase is projected in the Upper Narew catchment.																	2073-4441					MAR	2017	9	3							UNSP 156	10.3390/w9030156								WOS:000398721300007

Pilot Scale Testing of Adsorbent Amended Filters under High Hydraulic Loads for Highway Runoff in Cold Climates	WATER												This paper presents an estimation of the service life of three filters composed of sand and three alternative adsorbents for stormwater treatment according to Norwegian water quality standards for receiving surface waters. The study conducted pilot scale column tests on three adsorbent amended filters for treatment of highway runoff in cold climates under high hydraulic loads. The objectives were to evaluate the effect of high hydraulic loads and the application of deicing salts on the performance of these filters. From previous theoretical and laboratory analysis granulated activated charcoal, pine bark, and granulated olivine were chosen as alternative adsorbent materials for the present test. Adsorption performance of the filters was evaluated vis-a-vis four commonly found hazardous metals (Cu, Pb, Ni and Zn) in stormwater. The results showed that the filters were able to pass water at high inflow rates while achieving high removal. Among the filters, the filters amended with olivine or pine bark provided the best performance both in short and long-term tests. The addition of NaCl (1 g/L) did not show any adverse impact on the desorption of already adsorbed metals, except for Ni removal by the charcoal amended filter, which was negatively impacted by the salt addition. The service life of the filters was found to be limited by zinc and copper, due to high concentrations observed in local urban runoff, combined with moderate affinity with the adsorbents. It was concluded that both the olivine and the pine bark amended filter should be tested in full-scale conditions.																	2073-4441					MAR	2017	9	3							230	10.3390/w9030230								WOS:000398721300080

This study presents a generalised framework for assessing and mitigating the impacts of intense rainfall on sanitary sewer networks. The first part of the proposed framework involves a detailed hydraulic modelling to evaluate the performance of the sewer network. The second part deals with the development of SSO mitigation strategies based on Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) approaches. This paper also demonstrates the application of the first part of the proposed framework for a case study catchment in Melbourne, Australia. The hydraulic performance of the case study sewer network during a wet and a dry year is presented. The analysis found that for the wet year, 11 manholes had sewer overflows, whereas 53 of 57 manholes in the network of 3.2 km had surcharges. Such a study will benefit the water authorities to develop mitigation strategies for controlling SSOs in their sewer systems.

This study presents a unique pilot site at Horni Bekovice in Central Bohemia, where wastewater parameters are significantly influenced by the effluent from a local psychiatric hospital, and where the treated wastewater infiltrates into a shallow aquifer over a long period. The survey compared the quality parameters of local wastewater with those of the wastewater in four other catchments with no sources of concentrated pharmaceutical contamination. A total of 10 pharmaceuticals were detected while monitoring a common sewage system, but their number increased 3-fold at Horni Bekovice. The water quality data revealed the effectiveness of the removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater at the local sewage treatment plant and tracked the fate of substances that move from the treatment plant into the recharge ponds and then gradually into groundwater. The findings showed a significant decrease in all the monitored micropollutants that remained bound in sediments and in the unsaturated zone. Their passage into groundwater was highly reduced, and they virtually disappear after a few hundred meters in the saturated zone. The only exception is carbamazepine. This substance passes through the treatment technology and unsaturated zone. It systematically appears in the groundwater samples collected about 1 km from the infiltration site.

J	Shen, Y; Cao, HM; Tang, MF; Deng, HB				Shen, Yuan; Cao, Huiming; Tang, Mingfang; Deng, Hongbing			The Human Threat to River Ecosystems at the Watershed Scale: An Ecological Security Assessment of the Songhua River Basin, Northeast China	WATER												Human disturbances impact river basins by reducing the quality of, and services provided by, aquatic ecosystems. Conducting quantitative assessments of ecological security at the watershed scale is important for enhancing the water quality of river basins and promoting environmental management. In this study, China's Songhua River Basin was divided into 204 assessment units by combining watershed and administrative boundaries. Ten human threat factors were identified based on their significant influence on the river ecosystem. A modified ecological threat index was used to synthetically evaluate the ecological security, where frequency was weighted by flow length from the grids to the main rivers, while severity was weighted by the potential hazard of the factors on variables of river ecosystem integrity. The results showed that individual factors related to urbanization, agricultural development and facility construction presented different spatial distribution characteristics. At the center of the plain area, the provincial capital cities posed the highest level of threat, as did the municipal districts of prefecture-level cities. The spatial relationships between hot spot locations of the ecological threat index and water quality, as well as the distribution areas of critically endangered species, were analyzed. The sensitivity analysis illustrated that alteration of agricultural development largely changed the ecological security level of the basin. By offering a reference for assessing ecological security, this study can enhance water environmental planning and management.																	2073-4441					MAR	2017	9	3								10.3390/w9030219								WOS:000398721300069

Observations and Prediction of Recovered Quality of Desalinated Seawater in the Strategic ASR Project in Liwa, Abu Dhabi	WATER												To be able to overcome water shortages, Abu Dhabi Emirate started an Aquifer Storage and Recovery (ASR) project with desalinated seawater (DSW) as source water near Liwa. It is the largest DSW-ASR project in the world (stored volume similar to 10 Mm(3)/year), and should recover potable water for direct use. DSW is infiltrated into a desert dune sand aquifer using sand-covered gravel-bed recharge basins. In this study, we evaluate the hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical stratification of the (sub)oxic target aquifer, and water quality changes of DSW during trial infiltration runs. We predict water quality changes of DSW after 824 d of infiltration, during 90 d of intensive recovery (67% recovered) without storage (scenario A), as well as after 10 years of storage (scenario B, with significant bubble drift). Monitoring of preceding trials revealed a lack of redox reactions; little carbonate dissolution and Ca/Na exchange; much SiO2 dissolution; a strong mobilization of natural AsO43-, B, Ba, F, CrO42-, Mo, Sr and V from the (sub)oxic aquifer; and immobilization of PO4, Al, Cu, Fe and Ni from DSW. The Easy-Leacher model was applied in forward and reverse mode including lateral bubble drift, to predict water quality of the recovered water. We show that hydrogeochemical modeling of a complex ASR-system can be relatively easy and straightforward, if aquifer reactivity is low and redox reactions can be ignored. The pilot observations and modeling results demonstrate that in scenario A recovered water quality still complies with Abu Dhabi's drinking water standards (even up to 85% recovery). For scenario B, however, the recovery efficiency declines to 60% after which various drinking water standards are exceeded, especially the one for chromium.

Simulation of Hydrology and Nutrient Transport in the Hetao Irrigation District, Inner Mongolia, China	WATER												Intensive agricultural activities in the Hetao irrigation district have severely degraded local aquatic ecosystems and water quality, and Ulansuhai Lake is now the most rapidly degrading eutrophic lake in China. A better understanding of the hydro-agronomic and pollutant transport processes in the area is thus urgently needed. This study simulated monthly streamflow, total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) for the Hetao irrigation district using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to evaluate the nutrient load, source areas, and hydrological pathways. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values obtained for the streamflow simulations were 0.75 and 0.78 for the calibration and evaluation periods, respectively. The SWAT model captured the temporal variation in streamflow (R-2 > 0.8) for two periods; the NSE values for the TN and TP loads were 0.63 and 0.64 for the calibration period and 0.48 and 0.42 for the evaluation period, respectively. The predicted monthly TN load was correlated with irrigation (r = 0.61) and the monthly TP load with precipitation (r = 0.89), indicating that nitrogen transport is primarily associated with soil leaching and groundwater flow, and phosphorus is primarily transported by sediments caused by rainfall erosion. A case study of split nitrogen fertilizer applications demonstrated reduced annual TN load by as much as 13% in one year. Fertilization timing also affects the load in different pathways especially in lateral subsurface flow and shallow groundwater. Better agricultural management could thus reduce nitrogen losses, and buffer strips could minimize phosphorus transport.

To conduct this study the major ion concentrations, including HCO3-, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, SO42- and Cl- and water levels in ten water wells and the dam reservoir were measured during two periods ( June 2009 and June 2011), analyzed by factor analysis and plotted in water quality charts. The results of factor analysis show that most of the dissolved ions including Mg2+, Ca2+, SO42-, Cl- and HCO3-, particularly in 2009, were mainly originated from carbonate and evaporitic formations as well as from the playa lake ( Factor 1). In 2011, elevated salinity levels were found to be mainly related to intense evaporation during irrigation that are proportional to Na+ and K+ concentrations ( Factor 2) and depend on the type of crop and irrigation method. It was also found that the surface waters from deeper origins had less of an effect on groundwater recharge compared to upstream carbonate aquifers.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				MAR	2017	76	6							238	10.1007/s12665-017-6550-8								WOS:000398451000006

Short-term forecasting of saltwater occurrence at La Comte River (French Guiana) using a kernel-based support vector machine	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Saltwater intrusion into rivers is a major concern for freshwater exploitation and management in French Guiana (South America). To detect and analyse saltwater occurrence, a permanent station was installed on La Comte River to measure the electrical conductivity C. The objective of the present study was twofold. First, the temporal link between C, sea water level SWL and river discharge Q was explored during the dry seasons from 2009 to 2012 (total measurement duration of similar to 6 months). A lag of 3 h between C and SWL was evidenced (i.e. the C peaks are delayed by 3 h with high water conditions), as well as the co-occurrence of sea water intrusion with the low Q period. Second, a data-driven approach was set up through a kernel-based support vector machine SVM technique to forecast two events: (1) the forthcoming maximum value of C (for the next 3 h) exceeds 500 mu S/cm; (2) C exceeds 500 mu S/cm during more than 2 h. One potential drawback of such a data-driven approach is to fail to predict outside the range of calibration: this issue was thoroughly explored by means of an intensive bootstrap-based test exercise. It was showed that SVM has very high degree of predictive capability with accuracy and area under receiver operator curve above 90% in average. We additionally analyse the practical implementation of the SVM model with comparison to alternative popular classification techniques (logistic regression, random forest, linear and quadratic discriminant analysis): the SVM strength is to provide the nonlinear decision boundary without making a priori restrictive assumptions on its shape (like linear or quadratic methods) and without being too sensitive to noisy observations/outliers. Yet this strength can turn to be a weakness unless a careful examination of the shape is done from a physical perspective.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				MAR	2017	76	6							246	10.1007/s12665-017-6553-5								WOS:000398451000014

Reservoir dams are local for the accumulation of sediments transported from upstream. The amount of P release from sediments to water is potentially controlled by the retention characteristics of sediments. In this regard, 100 sediment samples were taken from surface sediments to determine the P retention capacity of sediments in Ekbatan Dam, Hamadan, Iran, and 15 water samples were collected from the interface of bottom sediments with lake water to determine different types of water P, including water-soluble P (WSP), dissolved reactive P (DRP), suspended solids P (SSP), and total P (TP). Firstly, some physical and chemical properties of sediments such as pH, cation exchangeable capacity (CEC), organic carbon (OC) content, equivalent CaCO3 (TNV), aluminum (Al) and iron (Fe) content were measured, and then WSP, TP, SSP, and DRP as well as P isotherms were determined. Moreover, three isotherm equations of Freundlich, Langmuir, and Temkin were fitted to the experimental data. Finally, the map of spatial variation of degree of P saturation (DPS) was plotted. The results revealed that the amount of DRP in water was at high level (0.02 mg L-1). The maximum adsorption in the sediments ranged from 83.93 to 634.13 mg kg(-1) that was significantly correlated with the physical and chemical properties of sediments, such as clay percentage, OC, and TNV. The equilibrium concentration of P at zero point was significantly higher than DRP. This demonstrated the release of P from sediments into water. P binding energy in the sediments ranged from 0.03 to 5.48 L mg(-1). There was a significant correlation between the binding energy and oxalate-extractable Fe, representing that the poorly crystalline or amorphous Fe would play a dominate role in the P adsorption under the slightly alkaline condition. The results suggested that the sediments not only had high P adsorption capacity and binding energy but released loosely bound WSP to water as well, which can cause eutrophication in the long term.

Modeling of subsurface agricultural drainage using two hydrological models with different conceptual approaches as well as dimensions and spatial scales	CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL												In regions where soils are seasonally or perennially wet, subsurface drainage represents an essential water management practice. Two hydrological models with different modeling approaches as well as different dimensional and spatial scales, DRAINMOD (1D, lumped and field-scale) and CATHY (3D, spatially distributed and watershed-scale), were compared in terms of their performance to predict tile-drain flow and to simulate evapotranspiration (ET) under field conditions. Two metrics were defined to assess the capacity of the models to represent the soil water dynamics: relative errors in simulating peak flow and drainage volume. Using different hydraulic conductivity scenarios, both models provided similar results. For the total predicted/observed tile-drain flow comparison, the two models yielded very similar results. In terms of coefficient of determination (R-2) and Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (NSE), their performances were low in simulating tile-drain flows for dry periods (low observed tile-drain flow). During periods with higher observed tile-drain flow, the performance of both models was good (R-2>0.75 and NSE mostly>0.60), but DRAINMOD produced better results than CATHY did. The two models had similar ET values (R-2>0.80). Regarding the impact of the hydraulic conductivity of each soil layer on subsurface drainage outflow, this study showed that the soil layer below the tile-drain system was the most influential for the two models.																	0701-1784	1918-1817				MAR	2017	42	1					38	53		10.1080/07011784.2016.1231014								WOS:000395100900004

Integrating hydrogeomorphological concepts in management approaches of lowland agricultural streams: Perspectives, problems and prospects based on case studies in Quebec	CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL												Alternative management approaches for agricultural streams based on hydrogeomorphological principles such as a two-stage channel are promising, but need to be further tested in contexts other than the Midwestern United States. In Quebec (Canada), the presence of many deep drain outlets may limit their applicability. The objectives of this research are to (1) assess the feasibility of implementing the two-stage channel design in Quebec; (2) determine how alternative management approaches compare with traditional management from an economical point of view, and (3) evaluate the impact of modifying the drain outlet design using small horseshoe wetlands to accommodate hydrogeomorphological adjustments of the channel. A combination of case studies and numerical modelling (HEC-RAS, Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System) was used for three study sites located in the Monteregie region (QC). Based on regional hydraulic geometry curves, additional space on each bank required for a two-stage channel ranged between 1.3 and 2.8 m for a width equal to 3 times the inset channel. Hydraulic modelling confirms previous findings of improved drainage capacity at high flow, (up to a 54% increase). Cost analysis reveals that two-stage and over-widened channels are 3 to 4 times more expensive to implement when compared to traditional trapezoidal clean-out dredging operations, mainly due to spoil removal and transportation. However, self-formed channels are less expensive since they only require additional riparian land. A crop yield analysis in the near-stream zone at three sites which are frequently flooded revealed markedly lower productivity in zones within the flooding space. The horseshoe wetland design for drain outlets could also be maintained at low cost, and would promote more heterogeneity than the traditional trapezoidal ditches. Using alternative agricultural stream management approaches based on hydrogeomorphological concepts would be feasible in the Quebec context without compromising the overall productivity of this key economic sector.																	0701-1784	1918-1817				MAR	2017	42	1					54	69		10.1080/07011784.2016.1163241								WOS:000395100900005						
J	Ahada, CPS; Suthar, S				Ahada, Chetan P. S.; Suthar, Surindra			Hydrochemistry of groundwater in North Rajasthan, India: chemical and multivariate analysis	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												This paper presents the hydrochemistry of groundwater of the northern districts of Rajasthan, India. Groundwater samples were collected from 50 sampling stations (rural and suburban areas) and analyzed for pH, EC, TDS, TH, NO3-, SO4 (2-), PO43-, Na (+), K (+), Mg2+, Ca (2+), Fe (2+), F(-)and Cl-. The pH varied from 6.54 to 9.51 in groundwater, slightly higher than WHO limit. The majority of sampling sites (80-100%) showed the high EC, TDS, TH and Na (+) contents in groundwater with an average value of 4.46 S/cm, 2856.1, 1774.4 and 426 mg/L, respectively. Na (+)/Cl(-)ratio was >1 in most of the sampling locations, which indicates the releasing of Na+ from silicate weathering. NO3- in groundwater ranged between (0.37 and 51.4 mg/L), and a few sites indicate an anthropogenic contribution of NO3- in groundwater. The F-in groundwater is a major issue in this area, and F-varied from 0.02 to 7.18 mg/L (with an average of 2.08 mg/L). Piper diagram identified Ca-Mg-HCO3 ([80%) and NaK- HCO(3)(-)as the dominant types of water of this area. The strong correlation between Na-Cl and K-Cl, Ca-Mg-SO4 suggests feldspar weathering in groundwater. Six components with a variance of 79% were extracted, which suggests cation exchange, rock-water interaction and anthropogenic activities as major factors affecting groundwater chemistry of this area. Water quality index of study area ranged between 178.58 and 944.8, and groundwater of about 58% of the study site fell under unsuitable for drinking category. The result of SAR analysis indicated the high Na+ content in groundwater (>10% sites), unsuitable for irrigation purposes. Langelier saturation index indicates that >60% sampling sites may have scaling problems due to excess CaCO3 in groundwater. Results suggest complex geological processes and anthropogenic pressure as major causes of deterioration of the overall quality of groundwater in this area.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				MAR	2017	76	5							203	10.1007/s12665-017-6496-x								WOS:000396208400016

Under various river management and conservation strategies for its protection, the assessment of water quality of its main tributary Ramganga River is lacking. This study focuses on assessment of physicochemical and heavy metal pollution of the Ramganga River by application of multivariate statistical techniques. Sampling of Ramganga River at sixteen sampling sites was carried out in three seasons (summer, monsoon and winter) of 2014. The collected water samples were analyzed for physicochemical parameters and heavy metals. Results from cluster analysis (CA) of the data divided the whole stretch of the river into three clusters as elevation from 1304 to 259 m as less polluted, from 207 to 154 m as moderately polluted and from elevation 154 to 139 m as high-polluted stretches with anthropogenic as main sources of pollution in high-polluted stretch. Principal component analysis of the seasonal dataset resulted in three significant principal components (PC) in each season explaining 72-8% of total variance with strong loadings (>0.75) of PC1 on fluoride (F-), chloride (Cl-), sodium (Na+), calcium (Ca2+), magnesium Mg2+), bicarbonate (HCO3-), total dissolved solids and electrical conductivity. Temporal variation by one-way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) showed significant seasonal variation was in the pH, chemical oxygen demand, biochemical oxygen demand, turbidity, HCO3-, F-, Zn, cadmium (Cd) and Mn (p < 0.05). Turbidity showed approximately a twofold increase in monsoon season due to rainfall in the catchment area and subsequent flow of runoff into the river. Concentration of HCO3-, F- and pH also showed similar increase in monsoon. The concentration of Zn, Cd and Mn showed an increasing trend in summers compared to monsoon and winter season due to dilution effect in the monsoon season and its lasting effect in winters.

GIS-based FRASTIC model for pollution vulnerability assessment of fractured-rock aquifer systems	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												All groundwater is vulnerable to pollution, but the level of susceptibility depends on the spatial peculiarities of a region. Among the numerous vulnerability assessment methodologies, the geographical information system-based DRASTIC model is the most sophisticated and achieves reliable results even in complex areas. Fractured-rock aquifers are not only complex, but they are also potential sources of radioactive and other types of waste and are liable to high recharge rates. Hence, they can serve as a conduit for fluid (and potentially) contaminants. Therefore, in this study, a new parameter, 'fracture media' (F), is fashioned to replace the weakest parameter (i.e. depth to water, D) in the standardized DRASTIC model to create a new model (FRASTIC) for the complex fractured aquifer system. The proposed model was tested on a case study area (Kano, Nigeria), and the FRASTIC minimum and maximum indices obtained were in the range of 63-170. The region was characterized as having very low (covering 0.16% of the total study area), low (55.52%), medium (42.53%), and high (1.79%) vulnerability based on the standardized classification system. In addition, the modified FRASTIC model was further developed using the sensitivity analysis (SA) and recorded the highest vulnerable area coverage (32.86%) within Kano. Thus, the modified FRASTIC model is appropriate for the complex nature of the study area because it contributes appreciably to defining the vulnerable zones. The single-parameter SA was employed to obtain effective weights for two modified models, which were then implemented to improve efficacy. Conventional nitrate validation indicated that there is a strong correlation between nitrate and vulnerability for the modified models. In addition, a new approach for identifying the relationship between the water quality and vulnerability indices was developed by this study and was proven to be an effective validation tool.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				MAR	2017	76	5							197	10.1007/s12665-017-6520-1								WOS:000396208400010

Under the hydrochemical condition, the solar photocycle would result in changes of the water temperature, in photosynthesis and in iron photoreduction, which leads to substantial hydrochemical fluctuations, especially for heavy metals. It is important to consider the daily variations in water quality when developing a hydrochemical monitoring plan for an area with highly developed agriculture, such as the Tatun Volcano Group watershed area in this study. The results show that the water chemistry is highly complicated by both solar photocycles and hydrochemical fluctuations in the upstream area. Using principal component analysis, the contributions from the two factors can be successfully separated. During the daytime, the photocycle results in the formation of aluminum hydroxide, which can remove heavy metals from water. Consequently, the content of heavy metals, including As, Cu, Ni, Co and Ba, increases after sunset and can reach a maximum before sunrise, while Fe behaves inversely due to the photoreduction. The variation of As during a diel cycle can reach 97%. However, the content of most of the heavy metals during diel cycle is incomparable with those in the earlier studies due to the formation of aluminum hydroxide instead of iron hydroxide. The other significant factor, hydrochemical fluctuation, can explain the variation of major components in water including Cl, SO4. Rare earth elements (REEs) were also analyzed and can be an excellent natural tracer in this study. The distribution of REEs shows a depletion of light REEs and an even normalized concentration of middle and heavy REEs. It is theorized that the REEs in the water in this study derive mainly from the reservoir rock of geothermal water. In a hydrochemical monitoring plan, REEs can be an indicator for identifying an anthropogenic source.

J	Wu, JH; Xue, CY; Tian, R; Wang, S				Wu, Jianhua; Xue, Chenyang; Tian, Rui; Wang, Siting			Lake water quality assessment: a case study of Shahu Lake in the semiarid loess area of northwest China	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												A comprehensive assessment on lake water quality was carried out in Shahu Lake, northwest China, to provide valuable information about present lake water quality for decision making. Major ions, general parameters, bacteriological parameters, organics and trace metals monitored monthly in 2014 were considered. Monitored parameters were compared with quality criteria for surface water of China, and overall water quality assessment was carried out using an entropy weighted water quality index (EWQI) based on 20 selected parameters. Lake water quality was also assessed for irrigation purpose. The results show that the lake water is of Cl center dot SO4-Na facies with high salinity and COD. The geochemistry of the lake water is regulated by intense evaporation and human activities. TP, TN and F- are major inorganic contaminants, with over 50% of the water samples polluted by them. Oil, mainly attributed by leaky motor tourist boats, is the major organic pollutants in the lake water, with 10 samples (37.04%) showing higher oil content than the permissible limit. The concentrations of other inorganic and organic contaminants as well as trace metals are well below the permissible limits. The present study indicates that inorganic contamination in the lake water is more severe than organic pollution. The overall lake water quality, assessed by EWQI, is poor and very poor with SO42-, TDS, TH and Cl-being the dominant contributing factors. The lake water is suitable for irrigation in terms of alkalinity, but is unsuitable for irrigation from the salinity point of view. Accelerating the circulation and replenishment of the lake water is an important way of reducing contaminant concentrations. This study is important in providing comprehensive information on lake water quality for decision makers and valuable reference for international lake water researchers.

River-groundwater connectivity in a karst system, Wellington, New South Wales, Australia	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												The characterization of river-aquifer connectivity in karst environments is difficult due to the presence of conduits and caves. This work demonstrates how geophysical imaging combined with hydrogeological data can improve the conceptualization of surface-water and groundwater interactions in karst terrains. The objective of this study is to understand the association between the Bell River and karst-alluvial aquifer at Wellington, Australia. River and groundwater levels were continuously monitored, and electrical resistivity imaging and water quality surveys conducted. Two-dimensional resistivity imaging mapped the transition between the alluvium and karst. This is important for highlighting the proximity of the saturated alluvial sediments to the water-filled caves and conduits. In the unsaturated zone the resistivity imaging differentiated between air- and sediment-filled karst features, and in the saturated zone it mapped the location of possible water- and sediment-filled caves. Groundwater levels are dynamic and respond quickly to changes in the river stage, implying that there is a strong hydraulic connection, and that the river is losing and recharging the adjacent aquifer. Groundwater extractions (1,370 ML, megalitres, annually) from the alluvial aquifer can cause the groundwater level to fall by as much as 1.5 m in a year. However, when the Bell River flows after significant rainfall in the upper catchment, river-leakage rapidly recharges the alluvial and karst aquifers. This work demonstrates that in complex hydrogeological settings, the combined use of geophysical imaging, hydrograph analysis and geochemical measurements provide insights on the local karst hydrology and groundwater processes, which will enable better water-resource and karst management.

Model calibration is thus an essential task to obtain the optimal parameter values, which match simulations with observations as closely as possible. This study used the Zenne River Basin (Belgium) as a case study, which experiences high spatial heterogeneity in terms of geological formation, groundwater recharge, and rainfall-runoff responses. Therefore, the objectives of this paper were to calibrate the SWAT model on the basis of different calibration techniques and identify which technique is suitable for such a heterogeneous basin so that the calibrated SWAT can be used as a tool for integrated management of the Zenne River Basin. Prior to calibration, the sensitive parameters were identified on the basis of a detailed sensitivity analysis (SA) of the Latin hypercube one-factor-at-a-time (LH-OAT) technique and increased sampling intervals. Then, SWAT was calibrated by using single-site calibration (SSC) at the watershed outlet; sequential calibration (SC), calibration from upstream to downstream; and simultaneous multisite calibration (SMSC), where data of two flow gauging stations were simultaneously used in a single calibration. It was found that at least 200 sampling intervals should be considered for the LH-OAT SA method to obtain converged rankings of SWAT parameters. In addition, to well capture the spatial variability of heterogeneous catchment and achieve stable sensitivity ranking, simultaneous multisite SA technique is important. Streamflow findings suggested that the SC and the SMSC techniques provided very good results and significantly improved model performance, but the SSC results were merely satisfactory. Though the results of SC and SMSC techniques were similar, the SMSC was selected over SC because it simultaneously handles the entire catchment spatial variability by assigning different parameter values and allows data information communication among stations in a single calibration. It was thus concluded that simultaneous multisite calibration should be considered for catchments with a high spatial variability like the Zenne River Basin.

J	Henault-Ethier, L; Larocque, M; Perron, R; Wiseman, N; Labrecque, M				Henault-Ethier, Louise; Larocque, Marie; Perron, Rachel; Wiseman, Natalie; Labrecque, Michel			Hydrological heterogeneity in agricultural riparian buffer strips	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Riparian buffer strips (RBS) may protect surface water and groundwater in agricultural settings, although their effectiveness, observed in field-scale studies, may not extend to a watershed scale. Hydrologically-controlled leaching plots have often shown RBS to be effective at buffering nutrients and pesticides, but uncontrolled field studies have sometimes suggested limited effectiveness. The limited RBS effectiveness may be explained by the spatiotemporal hydrological heterogeneity near non -irrigated fields. This hypothesis was tested in conventional corn and soy fields in the St. Lawrence Lowlands of southern Quebec (Canada), where spring melt brings heavy and rapid runoff, while summer months are hot and dry. One field with a mineral soil (Saint-Roch-de-l'Achigan) and another with an organic-rich soil (Boisbriand) were equipped with passive runoff collectors, suction cup lysimeters, and piezometers placed before and after a 3 m-wide RBS, and monitored from 2011 to 2014. Soil topography of the RBS was mapped to a 1 cm vertical precision and a 50 cm sampling grid. On average, surface runoff intersects the RBS perpendicularly, but is subject to substantial local heterogeneity. Groundwater saturates the root zones, but flows little at the time of snowmelt. Groundwater flow is not consistently perpendicular to the RBS, and may reverse, flowing from stream to field under low water flow regimes with stream-aquifer connectivity, thus affecting RBS effectiveness calculations. Groundwater flow direction can be influenced by stratigraphy, local soil hydraulic properties, and historical modification of the agricultural stream beds. Understanding the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of surface and groundwater flows is essential to correctly assess the effectiveness of RBS in intercepting agro-chemical pollution. The implicit assumption that water flows across vegetated RBS, from the field to the stream, should always be verified.

Prediction and visualization of redox conditions in the groundwater of Central Valley, California	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Regional-scale, three-dimensional continuous probability models, were constructed for aspects of redox conditions in the groundwater system of the Central Valley, California. These models yield grids depicting the probability that groundwater in a particular location will have dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations less than selected threshold values representing anoxic groundwater conditions, or will have dissolved manganese (Mn) concentrations greater than selected threshold values representing secondary drinking water-quality contaminant levels (SMCL) and health-based screening levels (HBSL). The probability models were constrained by the alluvial boundary of the Central Valley to a depth of approximately 300 m. Probability distribution grids can be extracted from the 3-D models at any desired depth, and are of interest to water-resource managers, water-quality researchers, and groundwater modelers concerned with the occurrence of natural and anthropogenic contaminants related to anoxic conditions. Models were constructed using a Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) machine learning technique that produces many trees as part of an additive model and has the ability to handle many variables, automatically incorporate interactions, and is resistant to collinearity. Machine learning methods for statistical prediction are becoming increasing popular in that they do not require assumptions associated with traditional hypothesis testing. Models were constructed using measured dissolved oxygen and manganese concentrations sampled from 2767 wells within the alluvial boundary of the Central Valley, and over 60 explanatory variables representing regional-scale soil properties, soil chemistry, land use, aquifer textures, and aquifer hydrologic properties. Models were trained on a USGS dataset of 932 wells, and evaluated on an independent hold-out dataset of 1835 wells from the California Division of Drinking Water. We used cross-validation to assess the predictive performance of models of varying complexity, as a basis for selecting final models. Trained models were applied to cross-validation testing data and a separate hold-out dataset to evaluate model predictive performance by emphasizing three model metrics of fit: Kappa; accuracy; and the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC). The final trained models were used for mapping predictions at discrete depths to a depth of 304.8 m. Trained DO and Mn models had accuracies of 86-100%, Kappa values of 0.69-0.99, and ROC values of 0.92-1.0. Model accuracies for cross-validation testing datasets were 82-95% and ROC values were 0.87-0.91, indicating good predictive performance. Kappas for the cross-validation testing dataset were 0.30-0.69, indicating fair to substantial agreement between testing observations and model predictions. Hold-out data were available for the manganese model only and indicated accuracies of 89-97%, ROC values of 0.73-0.75, and Kappa values of 0.06-0.30. The predictive performance of both the DO and Mn models was reasonable, considering all three of these fit metrics and the low percentages of low-DO and high-Mn events in the data.

Acceptance of Mobile Technology for Citizen Science in Water Resource Management	JOURNAL OF IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE ENGINEERING												Dutch water management is considered highly efficient, but it faces a lack of public awareness and other certain physical challenges. One proposed strategy to deal with these challenges includes increasing citizen participation and citizen science using mobile devices in particular. Such mobile crowd sensing (MCS) can be used to enhance canal operations and model predictive control (MPC) by nonexperts. The data collector often pushes implementations, and little knowledge and experience from the field of product design is used. This can lead to underperformance both with regards to the technology and the volunteer citizens. This study uses an adapted Technology Acceptance Model 3 (TAM3) to survey Dutch citizens' intentions while operating a mock-up smartphone application to identify key drivers of their acceptance in an early design phase. Included among the important drivers of citizens' behavioral intentions (BI) are usefulness, relevance to the task, and the demonstrability of benefits. These insights can possibly unveil validated design criteria for future MCS applications. Such validated criteria can not only prevent the underperformance of citizen science from a volunteer point of view, but it can also affect the performance of the MCS as well.																	0733-9437	1943-4774				MAR	2017	143	3			SI				B6016001	10.1061/(ASCE)IR.1943-4774.0001043								WOS:000395516600003

Comparing Two Multi-Criteria Methods for Prioritizing Wetland Restoration and Creation Sites Based on Ecological, Biophysical and Socio-Economic Factors	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Wetland restoration has been recognized as a useful tool for improving water quality. Many studies have focused on developing strategies and models to optimize wetland performance. However, some important wetland placement characteristics have not been taken into account. In this research and unlike other studies, we included the social aspect (availability of public lands) as a fundamental factor to locate wetlands. Thus, environmental, biophysical and socio-economic factors were integrated through the comparison of two multi-criteria methods (a suitability model and a greedy algorithm). With nitrate removal as the main goal, the suitability model was applied considering the ''terrain slope'', ''proximity to watercourses'' and ''soil permeability''. The greedy algorithm was executed based on the ''availability of public lands'' and the ''wetland restoration project costs''. These factors were chosen based on the Eu Life-CREAMAgua Flumen River project, which was carried out previously in the study area. Both the suitability model and the greedy algorithm provided critical information for siting a wetland and demonstrated the effectiveness of both approaches. By means of this study, we present highly applicable results as they are based on a real project (Eu Life-CREAMAgua Flumen River project), besides proposing and using the social factor as an innovative approach for the wetlands siting. This research and its possible adaptations can be used by decision makers to improve water quality using social and economic criteria, resulting in the efficient implementation of ecological-restoration projects.																	0920-4741	1573-1650				MAR	2017	31	4					1227	1241		10.1007/s11269-017-1572-2								WOS:000397923700009

In order to improve water quality in downstream waterbodies, the Manitoba government is currently investigating the relationship between hydrological standard of agricultural drainage network and nutrient retention in the drainage systems. Briefly, oversized drains have more capacity to transport nutrients, which can increase nutrient loading to downstream waterbodies, especially during rainfall events. Currently, the hydrological standards of agricultural drainage design in Manitoba were mainly developed according to cost-benefit analysis without considering nutrient retention. The purpose of this study was to use computer modelling techniques to simulate the impact of drain size (based on different hydrological standards) on nutrient retention within an agricultural drainage network. The site chosen was the Tobacco Creek Watershed, an agricultural area which drains into the Red River, and thence into Lake Winnipeg. Suspended sediment, nutrient and flow data, from several locations along the Brown drain within this watershed, were used to calibrate a water quality model. Scenarios were then simulated with the model to estimate how different drain sizes affect nutrient transport and retention. Sampling took place during the spring and summer of 2013 starting with freshet and ending when the drains dried up near mid-summer. Study results indicated that the amount of nutrients transported was generally greater during freshet and summer rain storms. Occasionally, however, nutrients in summer discharge exceeded those transported during freshet. The water quality model was applied to the Brown drain to investigate the effects of different drain sizes for rainfall amounts under 2, 5, 10, 15, and 20 year return periods. Generally the results indicate that as the return periods became larger (in larger channels) lower nutrients concentrations were predicted downstream (higher decay rates). On average, the model predicted a 15%-20% decline in nutrient concentration with a 20-year return channel design compared to a 2-year return. The research from this study may provide an impetus to the policy-making process of drainage design.

J	Buyukyildiz, M; Kumcu, SY				Buyukyildiz, Meral; Kumcu, Serife Yurdagul			An Estimation of the Suspended Sediment Load Using Adaptive Network Based Fuzzy Inference System, Support Vector Machine and Artificial Neural Network Models	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Sediment transport in streams and rivers takes two forms as suspended load and bed load. Suspended load comprises sand + silt + clay-sized particles that are held in suspension due to the turbulence and will only settle when the stream velocity decreases, such as when the streambed becomes flatter, or the streamflow into a pond or lake. The sources of the suspended sediments are the sediments transported from the river basin by runoff or wind and the eroded sediments of the river bed and banks. Suspended-sediment load is a key indicator for assessing the effect of land use changes, water quality studies and engineering practices in watercourses. Measuring suspended sediment in streams is real sampling and the collection process is both complex and expensive. In recent years, artificial intelligence methods have been used as a predictor for hydrological phenomenon namely to estimate the amount of suspended sediment. In this paper the abilities of Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Adaptive Network Based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) models among the artificial intelligence methods have been investigated to estimate the suspended sediment load (SSL) in Ispir Bridge gauging station on Coruh River (station number: 2316). Coruh River is located in the northern east part of Turkey and it is one of the world"s the fastest, the deepest and the largest rivers of the Coruh Basin. In this study, in order to estimate the suspended sediment load, different combinations of the streamflow and the SSL were used as the model inputs. Its results accuracy was compared with the results of conventional correlation coefficient analysis between input and output variables and the best combination was identified. Finally, in order to predict SSL, the SVM, ANFIS and various ANNs models were used. The reliability of SVM, ANFIS and ANN models were determined based on performance criteria such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Efficiency Coefficient (EC) and Determination Coefficient (R-2).																	0920-4741	1573-1650				MAR	2017	31	4					1343	1359		10.1007/s11269-017-1581-1								WOS:000397923700016						
J	Vieira, J; Cunha, MC				Vieira, Joao; Cunha, Maria Conceicao			Nested Optimization Approach for the Capacity Expansion of Multiquality Water Supply Systems under Uncertainty	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												A nested optimization approach is proposed to solve capacity expansion problems of multiquality water supply systems. The problem to be solved consists of determining the infrastructure that should be built and/or rehabilitated at a specific time. This decision should be taken in a long-term planning perspective. It should consider how the operation will be performed to satisfy demand and water quality requirements by using multiple sources with different water quality at the source, take into account the temporal and spatial distribution of the water resources available and remain aware of the environmental impacts. In addition, decision processes which do not appropriately consider inherent uncertainties (e.g., hydrological, demographic, and technological uncertainties) can lead to suboptimal solutions. Here, uncertainty is handled using scenario planning with the aim of finding expansion solutions that can be expected to perform well under a set of possible future situations (or scenarios). The solution method combines simulated annealing with nonlinear programming to determine the solution to the nested optimization problem.

In this paper, a water bloom precursor analysis method, based on two direction singular rough set, was proposed. This approach was produced on the basis of the different sections and pre-water bloom of water bloom precursor anomalies and characteristic of elements transferred in singular rough set. For testing the validity of two direction singular rough set application in water bloom precursor analysis, Xiangxi River, which is one of the typical tributaries of Three Gorges Reservoir in China, was selected as study area. The result showed that compared with other indexes, pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) are the most valuable indicators of water bloom in the precursory anomalies. Furthermore, regarding with water bloom precursory anomalies in Xiangxi River, most of the nutrient loading and biological community are the key indicators. Hence, this method can determine the main precursory anomaly for water bloom in the study area, which provides powerful knowledge support to water quality specialists for them to comprehensively analyze precursory anomaly so as to find out its relationship with occurrence law of water bloom.					, Huyong/0000-0002-2800-4930												0920-4741	1573-1650				MAR	2017	31	5					1435	1456		10.1007/s11269-017-1579-8								WOS:000398042800002

Ensemble Decision Tree Models Using RUSBoost for Estimating Risk of Iron Failure in Drinking Water Distribution Systems	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Safe, trusted drinking water is fundamental to society. Discolouration is a key aesthetic indicator visible to customers. Investigations to understand discolouration and iron failures in water supply systems require assessment of large quantities of disparate, inconsistent, multidimensional data from multiple corporate systems. A comprehensive data matrix was assembled for a seven year period across the whole of a UK water company (serving three million people). From this a novel data driven tool for assessment of iron risk was developed based on a yearly update and ranking procedure, for a subset of the best quality data. To avoid a 'black box' output, and provide an element of explanatory (human readable) interpretation, classification decision trees were utilised. Due to the very limited number of iron failures, results from many weak learners were melded into one high-quality ensemble predictor using the RUSBoost algorithm which is designed for class imbalance. Results, exploring simplicity vs predictive power, indicate enough discrimination between variable relationships in the matrix to produce ensemble decision tree classification models with good accuracy for iron failure estimation at District Management Area (DMA) scale. Two model variants were explored: 'Nowcast' (situation at end of calendar year) and 'Futurecast' (predict end of next year situation from this year's data). The Nowcast 2014 model achieved 100% True Positive Rate (TPR) and 95.3% True Negative Rate (TNR), with 3.3% of DMAs classified High Risk for un-sampled instances. The Futurecast 2014 achieved 60.5% TPR and 75.9% TNR, with 25.7% of DMAs classified High Risk for un-sampled instances. The output can be used to focus preventive measures to improve iron compliance.

The Use of NARX Neural Networks to Forecast Daily Groundwater Levels	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												The lack of information to manage groundwater for irrigation is one of the biggest concerns for farmers and stakeholders in agricultural areas of Mississippi. In this study, we present a novel implementation of a nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs (NARX) network to simulate daily groundwater levels at a local scale in the Mississippi River Valley Alluvial (MRVA) aquifer, located in the southeastern United States. The NARX network was trained using the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) and Bayesian Regularization (BR) algorithms, and the results were compared to identify an optimal architecture for the forecasting of daily groundwater levels over time. The training algorithms were implemented using different hidden node combinations and delays (5, 25, 50, 75, and 100) until the optimal network was found. Eight years of daily historical input time series including precipitation and groundwater levels were used to forecast groundwater levels up to three months ahead. The comparison between LM and BR showed that NARX-BR is superior in forecasting daily levels based on the Mean Squared Error (MSE), coefficient of determination (R-2), and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency. The results showed that BR with two hidden nodes and 100 time delays provided the most accurate prediction of groundwater levels with an error of +/- 0.00119 m. This innovative study is the first of its kind and will provide significant contributions for the implementation of data-based models (DBMs) in the prediction and management of groundwater for agricultural use.

Eight heavy metals including chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), arsenic (As), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and mercury (Hg) were determined using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). Among the tested heavy metals, Cd and Hg were detected in all surface water samples. The concentrations of Cr, Cd, Ni, and Pb were relatively lower than those of other metals in the four lakes. Results of Kohonen self-organizing map indicated that all the sampling sites in four lakes of the Great Rift Valley in Kenya could be classified into three different groups based on the heavy metal pollution. Lake Naivasha and Nakuru had characteristics of low concentrations of Cr, Ni, Cu, As, and Hg. Lake Bogoria was characterized by high levels of Ni, Cu, Cd, and Hg, and low levels of Pb, Cr, Zn, and As. Lake Elementaita showed characteristics of high concentrations of As and Hg and low concentrations of Pb, Ni, Cu, and Cd. Source identification using principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that anthropogenic factor played an increasingly important role in the heavy metal pollution of four lakes of the Great Rift Valley in Kenya, East Africa. Analysis of non-carcinogenic health risks of heavy metals indicated Hg and As in Lake Elementaita and Hg in Lake Bogoria may pose adverse health effects to local residents via ingestion route.

Samples were collected in fluviometric station at Turcato basin (19.5 km(2)), located in the South region of Brazil. The collected material underwent screening and pipetting processes for fractionation in sand and silt grain size. For each diameter were separated fractions with different sediment concentration ranging between 0.01 and 5.00 g.L-1. The results demonstrate great influence of CSS and particle size on turbidity readings. The increase in turbidity is opposite to particle size and directly related to CSS. Variations in turbidity, expressed in CSS function (sensor sensitivity), are higher for smaller diameters, reaching almost constant values for sand particles. Turbidity readings of the three sensors showed no significant difference in the level of 5% by the Mann-Whitney rank sum test. For a given CSS, the turbidity reading may be different, depending on the granulometric class analyzed. Turbidity recorded by the sensor to the silt-class is equivalent to a sensor response observed for a CSS ten times lower for the sand class.																	1413-4152	1809-4457				MAR-APR	2017	22	2					213	219		10.1590/S1413-41522016144228								WOS:000397875300001

The physicochemical and microbiological characteristics of the water at points upstream and downstream of each water body were evaluated, comparing the results with the CONAMA Resolution 357/2005 and the water quality index (WQI). In the period from May to August 2012, monthly samples of the following physical and chemical parameters of water were made: temperature, turbidity, pH, total solids, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, total phosphorus and fecal coliforms. The results showed significant differences in the parameters between upstream and downstream points, only for the parameters total solids and turbidity, especially for the Precua creek. The principal component analysis revealed a moderate correlation between the parameters. The data indicated that water from most of the points can be classified in the class 3, followed by the class 2 of the CONAMA Resolution 357/2005. The WQI showed slight spatial and temporal differences between the water bodies investigated: Rabo de Porco creek registered the best WQI, while the worst one occurred in sampling at the downstream Precua point in May. The information registered will be used as a basis for changes evaluation in characteristics and quality of water bodies studied during the deployment and operation of the enterprise.																	1413-4152	1809-4457				MAR-APR	2017	22	2					251	259		10.1590/S1413-41522016131212								WOS:000397875300004

Thus, this work aimed at studying the formation and distribution of phytoplankton in stretches of the Piranhas-Acu River Basin, in the semiarid region of Northeastern Brazil, from 2010 to 2011, with 13 sampling points in river and reservoirs. We identified 81 infrageneric taxa, distributed into 9 classes: Cyanophyceae, Chlorophyceae, Bacillariophyceae, Trebouxiophyceae, Euglenophyceae, Coscinodiscophyceae, Zygnematophyceae, Mediophyceae, and Klebsormidiophyceae. The Chlorophyta and Cyanophyta divisions were the most representative, with 30 (37%) and 24 (30%) taxa, respectively. However, the cyanobacteria were more seen throughout the study period. In some sampling points, they had limits above 20.000 cells/mL, requiring weekly monitoring as provided by Decree 2914 from December 12, 2011, of the Brazilian Ministry of Health. The species with high abundance are those producing toxins, represented by Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, Pseudanabaena limnetic, Microcystis sp. Dolichospermum sp., and Oscillatoria sp. The data indicate a potential health risk to the population served by these waters.																	1413-4152	1809-4457				MAR-APR	2017	22	2					261	269		10.1590/S1413-41522016146707								WOS:000397875300005

The purpose of this study was to present the modelling of drainage systems in flood situations, based on the software of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM), in which the study case is to analyze a unitary urban drainage system of Zona Central catchment in Coimbra, Portugal. By using the Automatic Overland Flow Delineation (AOFD) methodology for the generation of a superficial drainage network and implementing it in the SWMM, it was obtained a dual drainage model that allows the flow analysis in flood conditions, including flow control between the surface and collectors network and also modeling of water quality at the surface. This model allows quantifying the pollution load at the surface, relatively to the parameter of total suspended solids, for any extreme rainfall event.

Analysis of the quality of water intended for recreation as well as being an important action in terms of public health, is also justified in view of the importance of tourism in Ubatuba, having also great importance to environmental planning. In modeling, the modules Delft3D system were used. In the water quality module, the pollutants dispersal mechanisms were studied, from the association of pollution data with the results of the hydrodynamic module, in two bays in Ubatuba: Flamengo and Palmas. The results allow us to state that the system of currents, determined by the geomorphology of the area, does not provide high capacity for dilution and dispersion of effluents in the study area. However, the marine circulation and the processes involved in the decay of bacteria are enough to spread and reduce their concentrations along the bays. It was concluded that environmental modeling reproduced satisfactorily the processes involved in the transport and diffusion of microbiological indicators, contributing to the studies on the effects of human activities on the coastal system of Ubatuba.																	1413-4152	1809-4457				MAR-APR	2017	22	2					403	414		10.1590/S1413-41522016158594								WOS:000397875300021

This study attempts to model a small-scale BIOECODS using InfoWorks SD. New modelling techniques are used to fully integrate the surface and on-line subsurface conveyance system, in which overland flow routing is described by a storm water management model that uses a nonlinear reservoir method and the kinematic wave approximation of the St Venant equation, and subsurface flow is described by the Horton method in conjunction with the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) curve number (CN) method. The observed water levels at primary outlets are compared with those obtained from model simulation. The modelling approach has been proven successful as the hydrographs (predicted and observed) match each other closely, with a mean error in the range of 4.58-7.32%. Results from the model showed that the BIOECODS is able to attenuate peak flow by 60-75%, and increase the lag time by 20min within an area of <28300m(2) when compared with a traditional drainage system.

Conventional treatment processes such as neutralization, clariflocculation, and biological processes are used to clean the effluent before feeding to the PAC and UF combined RO system. The efficiency of the combined system was evaluated using the chemical oxygen demand Mn (CODMn), color, pH, turbidity, total nitrogen, total phosphate, and conductivity. The PAC was effective in greatly reducing the CODMn and color. The turbidity and silt density index of the UF permeate satisfied the water quality indices required for the RO feed. The RO system was constantly maintained at approximately 75% RO recovery, and the RO permeate satisfied the water quality requirements for reusing the processed water. Therefore, the PAC-UF combined RO system can be used to process effluent discharged from tannery wastewater treatment plants for reuse.																	2220-1319					MAR	2017	7	1					97	102		10.2166/wrd.2016.001								WOS:000398026700011

A rare Uroglena bloom in Beaver Lake, Arkansas, spring 2015. Lake Reserve Manage. 33:8-13.A combination of factors triggered a Uroglena volvox bloom and taste and odor event in Beaver Lake, a water-supply reservoir in northwest Arkansas, in late April 2015. Factors contributing to the bloom included increased rainfall and runoff containing increased concentrations of dissolved organic carbon, followed by a stable pool, low nutrient concentrations, and an expansion of lake surface area and littoral zone. This was the first time U. volvox was identified in Beaver Lake and the first time it was recognized as a source of taste and odor. Routine water quality samples happened to be collected by the US Geological Survey and the Beaver Water District throughout the reservoir during the bloom. Higher than normal rainfall in March 2015 increased the pool elevation in Beaver Lake by 2.3m (by early April), increased the surface area by 10%, and increased the littoral zone by 1214 ha; these conditions persisted for 38days, resulting from flood water being retained behind the dam. Monitoring programs that cover a wide range of reservoir features, including dissolved organic carbon, zooplankton, and phytoplankton, are valuable in explaining unusual events such as this Uroglena bloom.																	1040-2381	2151-5530				MAR	2017	33	1					8	13		10.1080/10402381.2016.1238427								WOS:000396042900002

Predicting cyanobacterial abundance, microcystin, and geosmin in a eutrophic drinking-water reservoir using a 14-year dataset	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Harris TD, Graham JL. 2017. Predicting cyanobacterial abundance, microcystin, and geosmin in a eutrophic drinking-water reservoir using a 14-year dataset. Lake Reserve Manage. 33:32-48.Cyanobacterial blooms degrade water quality in drinking water supply reservoirs by producing toxic and taste-and-odor causing secondary metabolites, which ultimately cause public health concerns and lead to increased treatment costs for water utilities. There have been numerous attempts to create models that predict cyanobacteria and their secondary metabolites, most using linear models; however, linear models are limited by assumptions about the data and have had limited success as predictive tools. Thus, lake and reservoir managers need improved modeling techniques that can accurately predict large bloom events that have the highest impact on recreational activities and drinking-water treatment processes. In this study, we compared 12 unique linear and nonlinear regression modeling techniques to predict cyanobacterial abundance and the cyanobacterial secondary metabolites microcystin and geosmin using 14years of physiochemical water quality data collected from Cheney Reservoir, Kansas. Support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), boosted tree (BT), and Cubist modeling techniques were the most predictive of the compared modeling approaches. SVM, RF, and BT modeling techniques were able to successfully predict cyanobacterial abundance, microcystin, and geosmin concentrations <60,000 cells/mL, 2.5 mu g/L, and 20ng/L, respectively. Only Cubist modeling predicted maxima concentrations of cyanobacteria and geosmin; no modeling technique was able to predict maxima microcystin concentrations. Because maxima concentrations are a primary concern for lake and reservoir managers, Cubist modeling may help predict the largest and most noxious concentrations of cyanobacteria and their secondary metabolites.																	1040-2381	2151-5530				MAR	2017	33	1					32	48		10.1080/10402381.2016.1263694								WOS:000396042900005

Seventeen years of grass carp: an examination of vegetation management and collateral impacts in Ball Pond, New Fairfield, Connecticut. Lake Reserve Manage. 33:84-100.Ball Pond is a 32ha meso-eutrophic lake located in the Marble Valley of Connecticut. The local bedrock geology and watershed influences have resulted in a hardwater system with limited plant community diversity and an assemblage dominated by the nonnative species Myriophyllum spicatum. By 1996, M. spicatum dominated 32% of the waterbody, and residents were concerned their property values would fall as the recreational value of the lake diminished. In an attempt to remedy this issue, 400 grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella; approximate to 30cm length) were released in 1997 at a rate of 38 per vegetated hectare. As a requirement of the state permit, the plant community, water quality, and the fish community were monitored throughout the initiative (1997-2014) to examine the impact of grass carp at multiple ecological levels of the lentic system. M. spicatum was significantly reduced in biomass and cover between 1997 and 2014, with no change in plant community richness. Concordant with the decrease in M. spicatum, the cover of Ceratophyllum demersum increased significantly and became more dominant in the plant community as M. spicatum was reduced. Our results also suggest there was no change in water quality or fish community density/diversity during the study period; however, fish community richness was reduced. Bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) density and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) size distribution both increased during this study. We assert that grass carp can be an effective approach to nonnative plant management in a northern meso-eutrophic lake.																	1040-2381	2151-5530				MAR	2017	33	1					84	100		10.1080/10402381.2017.1284966								WOS:000396042900009

THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AND FILAMENTOUS ALGAE MAT FORMATION IN TWO AGRICULTURAL INFLUENCED SOUTH AFRICAN RIVERS	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												The regulation of nutrient inputs into rivers dominated by agriculture land use activities is an important aspect of ecological resilience of aquatic systems and the management of river eutrophication. The overabundance of benthic filamentous algae mats in river systems due to nutrient enrichment can modify the habitats of macroinvertebrate and fish communities as well as clogging irrigation crop sprayers of downstream water users. The current study examined over a period of 2 years (2013-2014) the interplay between physical and chemical river characteristics and epilithic filamentous algae biomass in two South African agricultural influenced rivers. The study area consisted of the Touw and Duiwe Rivers, which run into a proclaimed Ramsar site, namely, the Wilderness Lake System. A strong positive correlation was observed between the maximum filamentous algae biomass (97 chl-a mgm(-2)) observed during the dry season and the average water column alkalinity > 30 mg l(-1). The benthic trophic status of the nine sampling sites during the dry seasons indicated the highest benthic algae biomass with mesotrophic (1.7-21 chl-a mgm(-2)) to hypertrophic (> 84 chl-a mgm(-2)) conditions. During the dry season, only three sampling sites were below the suggested guideline value (35 mu g l(-1)) for total phosphorus (TP), while four sampling sites were below the total nitrogen guideline of 252 mu g l(-1). In the wet season, two sites were below TP values with five sites below total nitrogen guideline values. From the data gathered, it was evident that water column alkalinity and hardness were the main drivers for the formation or absence of benthic filamentous algae mats in the two river systems and that nitrogen and/or phosphorus concentrations was overshadowed by the physical and chemical characteristics of the river systems at certain sites. Nutrient results for the river bottom sediments revealed that the sediment qualities were variable at the different sampling sites, but more specifically along the longitudinal paths of flow. It was apparent that the high TP concentrations in the water column and bottom sediment, which were lowest during the dry season, were associated with the highest epilithic filamentous algae mat formation. The outcome of the current study shows that a more holistic approach must be followed for the development of future eutrophication guidelines and nutrient thresholds in South African rivers influenced by agriculture land use activities.

Specifically, we develop a possible probabilistic model of sensor measurement error and the measurement error model is embedded into a simulation model of a river system. An optimization algorithm is used to find the optimal sensor locations that minimize the expected time until a spill detection in the presence of a constraint on the probability of detecting a spill. The experimental results show that the optimal sensor locations are highly sensitive to the variability of measurement error and false alarm rates are often unacceptably high. An SPC method is useful in finding thresholds that guarantee a false alarm rate no more than a pre-specified target level, and an optimization algorithm combined with the thresholds finds a robust sensor network.

Biomarkers such as oxidase enzymes are especially useful indicators because they represent a direct biological response to environmental toxicity. A luminometer was used to quantify oxidase enzyme production in watercress (Nasturtium officinale) due to toxic chemical exposure of E85 (85% ethanol and 15% gasoline blend), gasoline, and 99% pure ethanol over a 72-h period in aquatic root exposure and volatile leaf exposure experiments. Aquatic exposure to E85 caused an increase in oxidative enzyme production while gasoline and ethanol caused no significant changes in oxidase concentrations. Aquatic root exposure results were compared to volatile leaf exposures where effects of E85, gasoline, and ethanol caused increases in oxidase production. Morphometric measurements were also conducted as plant stress comparisons to oxidative enzyme analyses. Measurements of root length showed increases in root growth at some concentrations of fuels with only the highest concentration of E85 resulting in a decrease in root growth when compared to the control.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				MAR	2017	228	3							117	10.1007/s11270-017-3302-z								WOS:000397821100032

The Impact of Climate Change on Metal Transport in a Lowland Catchment	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												This study investigates the impact of future climate change on heavy metal (i.e., Cd and Zn) transport from soils to surface waters in a contaminated lowland catchment. The WALRUS hydrological model is employed in a semi-distributed manner to simulate current and future hydrological fluxes in the Dommel catchment in the Netherlands. The model is forced with climate change projections and the simulated fluxes are used as input to a metal transport model that simulates heavy metal concentrations and loads in quickflow and baseflow pathways. Metal transport is simulated under baseline climate ("2000-2010") and future climate ("2090-2099") conditions including scenarios for no climate change and climate change. The outcomes show an increase in Cd and Zn loads and the mean flux-weighted Cd and Zn concentrations in the discharged runoff, which is attributed to breakthrough of heavy metals from the soil system. Due to climate change, runoff enhances and leaching is accelerated, resulting in enhanced Cd and Zn loads. Mean flux-weighted concentrations in the discharged runoff increase during early summer and decrease during late summer and early autumn under the most extreme scenario of climate change. The results of this study provide improved understanding on the processes responsible for future changes in heavy metal contamination in lowland catchments.

Coal Mine Water Pollution and Ecological Impairment of One of Australia's Most 'Protected' High Conservation-Value Rivers	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												The environmental regulation of a coal mine in the greater Sydney area has failed to recognise the importance of and protect a high conservation-value river located in a World Heritage listed area. This study measured the water quality and ecological health (using macroinvertebrates) of the Wollangambe River and its tributaries near the point of the waste water discharge of a coal mine and assessed the longitudinal impact for 22 km downstream. The investigation revealed two important aspects. The first is the significant impact of the waste water discharge when compared to the otherwise near-pristine condition of the high conservation-value river system. The second is the spatial extent of the pollution from the mine that extends at least 22 km downstream from the outflow of coal mine wastes. The resulting water pollution is causing major impairment of the aquatic ecosystem, with reduced abundance, taxonomic richness and loss of pollution-sensitive macroin-vertebrate groups. Water pollution from the mine includes thermal pollution, increased salinity and increased concentrations of zinc and nickel. The mine's waste discharge also strongly modified the river's ionic composition. The study also highlights the failure of the regulatory and governance systems that enable the mine to operate in a manner that causes major environmental impacts.

A commonly used water quality simulation model, Qual2K, was linked to a Genetic Algorithm optimization model for exploration of relevant fuzzy objective-function formulations for addressing imprecision and conflicting goals of pollution control agencies and various dischargers. Results showed a dynamic flow dependence of optimal wastewater loading with good convergence to near global optimum. Explicit considerations of real-world technological limitations, which were developed here in a new S-O framework, led to better compromise solutions between conflicting goals than those identified within traditional S-O frameworks. The newly developed framework, in addition to being more technologically realistic, is also less complicated and converges on solutions more rapidly than traditional frameworks. This technique marks a significant step forward for development of holistic, riverscape-based approaches that balance the conflicting needs of the stakeholders.				jaafarzadeh, neemat/M-1190-2017	jaafarzadeh, neemat/0000-0003-2516-2340; Destouni, Georgia/0000-0001-9408-4425												1061-4303	1554-7531				MAR 1	2017	89	3					211	220		10.2175/106143017X14839994523866								WOS:000397300200002	28236817

Developing an Integrated Modeling Tool for River Water Quality Index Assessment	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												The goal of this study was to establish a modeling tool for river water quality with a direct linkage to the water quality index (WQI(5)) calculation and the river water quality model, the Water Quality Analysis Simulation Program (WASP), for pollutant transport modeling. The integrated WASP and WQI(5) tool was field- tested to assess pollutant loadings and their impacts on river environment. Suspended solid (SS) and electric conductivity (EC) correlation equations and the WQI(5) calculation tool were included in the water quality model and direct WQI(5) calculation. The SS concentration, which was influenced by river flows, had crucial effects on river water quality and WQI(5) values. EC value was controlled by dissolution of soil minerals, which was affected by the watershed drainage area and surface runoff. The integrated system could establish a direct correlation for river water quality, river flow, and WQI(5).																	1061-4303	1554-7531				MAR 1	2017	89	3					260	273		10.2175/106143016X14798353399584								WOS:000397300200007	28236820

Eutrophication Control Decision Making Using EFDC Model for Shenzhen Reservoir, China	WATER RESOURCES												The three-dimensional hydrodynamic and eutrophication model was implemented based on EFDC to help eutrophication control decision making of Shenzhen Reservoir. Model calibration and validation were conducted with two set of independent observed data in 2009 and 2010-2011. The model represented the hydrodynamic process and the spatial and temporal distribution of water quality well. Subsequently, three eutrophication control scenarios were configured, included removing 100% nutrients from all tributaries, increasing by 50% of water flows, and removing 50% nutrients from Dongjiang. As results shown, the maximum chlorophyll-a concentrations were decreased by 1, 16.4 and 46.3%, the average chlorophyll-a concentrations were decreased by 1.3, 29.8 and 29.9%. Increasing water flows and removing nutrients from Dongjiang can significantly improve water quality and effectively reduce risk of water bloom.																	0097-8078	1608-344X				MAR	2017	44	2					308	314		10.1134/S0097807817020142								WOS:000398107300015

The main objective of the expedition studies of the Institute of Oceanology, Russian Academy of Sciences, was to examine the sedimentation and biogeochemical processes in the mixing zone of the Volga and its tributaries with the aim to assess the present-day water quality and trends in its changes in the recent years. In this context, the study was focused on the aerosols of near-water layer, surface water, and bottom sediments along the route the Rybinsk Reservoir (Borok Settl.) - Lower Volga (Astrakhan C.). The methodology was based on a multidisciplinary study of dissolved compounds and suspended particles (<1 mu m). The main attention was focused on studying the spatial variations of biogenic substances, organic compounds (C-org in suspension and solution), the suspension itself, and hydrcarbons.

Water quality and antifungal susceptibility of opportunistic yeast pathogens from rivers	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Yeasts from water sources have been associated with diseases ranging from superficial mucosal infections to life threatening diseases. The aim of this study was to determine the water quality as well as diversity and antifungal susceptibility of yeasts from two rivers. Yeast levels and physicochemical parameter data were analyzed by principal component analysis to determine correlations between physico-chemical data and yeast levels. Yeast morphotypes were identified by biochemical tests and 26S rRNA gene sequencing. Disk diffusion antifungal susceptibility tests were conducted. Physico-chemical parameters of the water were within target water quality range (TWQR) for livestock farming. For irrigational use, total dissolved solids and nitrates were not within the TWQR. Yeast levels ranged between 27 +/- 10 and 2,573 +/- 306 cfu/L. Only non-pigmented, ascomycetous yeasts were isolated. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida glabrata were most frequently isolated. Several other opportunistic pathogens were also isolated. A large number of isolates were resistant to azoles, especially fluconazole, but also to other antifungal classes. Candida species were resistant to almost all the antifungal classes. These water sources are used for recreation and religious as well as for watering livestock and irrigation. Of particular concern is the direct contact of individuals with opportunistic yeast, especially the immune-compromised. Resistance of these yeast species to antifungal agents is a further health concern.

J	Saberi, L; Niksokhan, MH				Saberi, Leila; Niksokhan, Mohammad Hossein			Optimal waste load allocation using graph model for conflict resolution	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												In this paper, a new methodology is proposed for waste load allocation in river systems using the decision support system (DSS) for the graph model for conflict resolution II (GMCRII), multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) analysis and the Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) algorithm. Minimization of total treatment and penalty costs and minimization of biological oxygen demand violation of standards at the check point are considered as the main objectives of this study. At first, the water quality along the river was simulated using the Streeter-Phelps (S-P) equation coupled with the MOPSO model. Thereby a trade-off curve between the objectives is obtained and a set of non-dominated solutions is selected. In the next step, the best alternative is chosen using MCDM techniques and the GMCRII DSS package and non-cooperative stability definitions. The applicability and efficiency of the methodology are examined in a real-world case study of the Sefidrud River in the northern part of Iran.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				MAR	2017	75	6					1512	1522		10.2166/wst.2016.429								WOS:000397590800025	28333067

Investigation and control of seawater intrusion in the Eastern Nile Delta aquifer considering climate change	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												Seawater intrusion is considered one of the main processes that degrade water quality by raising salinity. Over-pumping and decreasing recharge are considered the main causes of saltwater intrusion. Moreover, climate change and sea-level rise accelerate saltwater intrusion. In this paper SEAWAT code was used to study groundwater flow and seawater intrusion in the Eastern Nile Delta aquifer considering four scenarios of climate change including sea-level rise, increasing abstraction, decreasing recharge and the combination of these scenarios. The results showed that decreasing recharge has a significant effect on seawater intrusion. However, the combinations of these scenarios resulted in harmful intrusion and loss of groundwater. The soil salinity increased, which decreased agricultural production. The control of seawater intrusion and protection of groundwater resources and soil is very important. Different scenarios were implemented to protect the aquifer from seawater intrusion including decreasing abstraction, increasing recharge, abstracting brackish water and the combination of these three scenarios. The abstraction of brackish water gave a higher reduction of seawater intrusion and decreased groundwater table in the aquifer near the shore line, which protected the soil from salinity and increased agricultural production. However, the combination of these three scenarios gave the highest reduction of seawater intrusion.																	1606-9749					MAR	2017	17	2					311	323		10.2166/ws.2016.129								WOS:000398000000001

Despite the substantial resources invested to provide safe water, there is a significant number of water points that are non-functional. Knowledge of the degree of sustainability and the contributing factors for rural water supply projects is limited. This study employs the fuzzy set concept to assess the degree of sustainability of water points in seven Local Government Authorities (LGAs) of Dodoma region in Tanzania. Dodoma region lies in the semi-arid area of Tanzania where boreholes are the major sources of water supply. Due to limited information, four dimensions of sustainability of water projects were used in this study. These include water quantity from the water sources, water quality, institution setting with regard to community participation in meetings, and financing of the projects for operation and maintenance. The multidimensional sustainability indices of water points were determined. The results indicate that only two LGAs, of Bahi and Kondoa, have sustainable water points with sustainability indices of 0.86 and 0.83, respectively. Kongwa has the lowest sustainability index of 0.17 due to poor water quality and inadequate quantity of water from the boreholes.																	1606-9749					MAR	2017	17	2					372	380		10.2166/ws.2016.141								WOS:000398000000006

Implementing tactical plans to improve water-energy loss management	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												Water utilities are aware of the water-energy loss relevance in supply systems. However, they still mainly focus on daily water loss control (real and apparent losses), without considering the impact on embedded energy. Moreover, they are mostly concerned with the economic dimension and, in most cases, tend to disregard the impact that water-energy loss may have on the quality of service, communication with the consumers, social awareness, water quality and environment. This paper focuses on the application of the developed and tested AWARE-P infrastructure asset management (IAM) methodology to improve water-energy loss management in water supply systems, while demonstrating the main benefits from implementing an integrated approach for water losses and related energy assessment.

The results indicate that preventive or remediation actions are necessary to improve its water quality. Water samples were collected between 2012 and 2013 at five sampling stations at the Mopanshan Reservoir, and analyzed for CODMn and total nitrogen (TN). SPSS software was used to carry out analysis of variance and correlation analysis. Spatially, CODMn and TN exhibited a rather small distinction in the horizontal direction, but there was a significant difference regarding TN in the vertical orientation. The concentration of TN also increased with the increase in sampling depth. Seasonally, the concentration of CODMn and TN showed a pronounced seasonal pattern and was divided into four periods. CODMn reached a maximum in September and was at a minimum in June. And TN reached a maximum in June and was at a minimum in November or December. The use of correlation analysis shows that the regular variations of TN were primarily affected by temperature. The main form of nitrogen in the Mopanshan Reservoir is NO3-N, and the change of TN is consistent with that of NO3-N. By Pearson correlation coefficient, the seasonal variability of CODMn correlated to changes in the reservoir's water level. The results showed that the concentration of TN exceeded the guideline values in most months and CODMn was slightly over the standard limit. Thus, it is urgent that preventive actions and remediation processes are developed to improve the water quality in this reservoir.																	1606-9749					MAR	2017	17	2					389	398		10.2166/ws.2016.118								WOS:000398000000008

Islamabad is the capital city, located at the foot of the Margallah Hills, whereas Rawalpindi lies in the Potohar Plateau. Both cities are located in the semi-arid region of Pakistan, where the residents meet their basic need of water through groundwater resources. For the lastmany years, the quantity and quality of groundwater in these cities has been deteriorating very rapidly. In this study, the foremost recharge source for these cities was identified using tritium and major ion chemistry, and different physiochemical parameters were studied to find out the facts behind the quality deterioration of the groundwater. Tritiumvalues and chemical data suggested that aquifers located in the territory of Islamabad were mainly recharged by upland areas (theMargalla Hills), which accounts for their low electrical conductivity and total dissolved solids contents. A higher sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) suggested an alteration in recharge patterns through soil compaction and cementation (from increased construction activity) that reduced the recharge inputs. The high SAR also disturbs the recharge pattern and had disturbed the natural equilibrium of the groundwater system, deteriorating the quality of the water.																	1606-9749					MAR	2017	17	2					433	451		10.2166/ws.2016.149								WOS:000398000000012

A serious shortcoming of the debate is that there are differences in the design and management of rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems. This study is based on the performance of two RWH systems that are used for drinking purposes at a kindergarten and a primary school in Cu Khe, Vietnam. Each system comprised a painted galvanized iron roof, a first-flush diverter, two stainless steel tanks connected in series, a calmed inlet, mosquito screens on open holes, PVC pipelines, filter cartridges, and a UV sterilizer. During 18 months, stored rainwater was sampled five times, and treated rainwater was sampled four times. Twenty-three water quality parameters were analyzed, including pH, total dissolved solids, turbidity, nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, hardness, arsenic, iron, cadmium, nickel, chromium, manganese, mercury, selenium, lead, zinc, Escherichia coli, and total coliform. It was found that all the physicochemical qualities of the stored rainwater, prior to treatment, satisfied the World Health Organization (WHO) drinking water guidelines. After physical filtration and UV sterilization, all parameters, including microbiological indicators, satisfied the WHO drinking water guidelines. Further management strategies to stabilize water quality were discussed.																	1606-9749					MAR	2017	17	2					452	460		10.2166/ws.2016.154								WOS:000398000000013

A case assessment in China	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												The overall purpose was to assess the feasibilities of recycling filter backwash water (FBWW) and combined filter backwash water (CFBWW) in a drinking water treatment plant in south China. The variations of regular water-quality indexes, metal indexes (Al, Mn and Cd), polyacrylamide and disinfection by-product indexes (trihalomethanes and their formation potentials) along with the treatment and the recycling processes were monitored. Results showed the recycling procedure caused increases of turbidity, total solids, ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), permanganate index (CODMn), and dissolved organic carbon, Al, Mn and Cd concentrations in a mixture of raw water and FBWW or CFBWW compared to those in raw water. However, the recycling procedure had negligible impacts on the qualities of settled water and filtered water because most of the contaminants could be effectively removed by the conventional water treatment process. Although recycling did cause slight increases of NH3-N and CODMn levels in settled water and filtered water, the quality of finished water always conformed to Chinese standards for drinking water quality according to the surveyed indexes in the present study. Thus, it is appropriate to recycle waste streams in water-stressed areas if the source water is well managed and the water treatment processes are carefully conducted.

J	Boroumand, A; Rajaee, T				Boroumand, Amir; Rajaee, Taher			Discrete entropy theory for optimal redesigning of salinity monitoring network in San Francisco bay	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												The paper presents an entropy-based method for designing an optimum bay water salinity monitoring network in San Francisco bay (S. F. bay) considering maximum-monitoring-information and minimum-data-lost criteria. Due to cost concerns, it is necessary to design the optimal salinity monitoring network with a minimal number of sampling stations to provide reliable data. The monthly data recorded from January 1995 to December 2014 were obtained over 37 active stations located in S. F. bay and is applied in the research. Transinformation entropy in discrete mode is used to calculate the stations' optimum distance. The discrete approach uses the frequency table to calculate transinformation measures. After calculating these measures, a transinformation-distance (T-D) curve is developed. Then, the optimum distance between salinity monitoring stations is elicited from the curve. The study shows that the S. F. bay salinity monitoring stations provide redundant information and the existing stations can be reduced to 21 with an approximate distance of 7.5 km. The coverage of the proposed monitoring network by using the optimum distance is complete and the system does not generate redundant data. The results of this research indicate that transinformation entropy is a promising method for the design of monitoring networks in bays such as those found in San Francisco bay.																	1606-9749					MAR	2017	17	2					606	612		10.2166/ws.2016.110								WOS:000398000000029

Quantifying tillage dynamics from time ordered spatially aggregated data	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Understanding and documenting historical agricultural land use and farming practices is important for assessment of environmental benefits of no-till (NT). To address the need for quantitative estimates of time patterns of tillage practices, this study proposes modeling the time patterns using the Markov chains framework and estimating the probabilities of transition from one tillage-crop combination to another tillage-crop combination from time-ordered spatially aggregated data. We developed a first-order, four-state Markov chain model of tillage-crop dynamics in corn (Zea mays L.) soybean (Glycine max L.) production systems and estimated the transition probabilities for the state of Iowa using the 1992 to 1997 data collected by the Conservation Technology Information Center. The transition probabilities strongly suggest that the "majority of NT acreage is not in continuous but rather in rotational NT, i.e., NT crop production in rotation with conventional or other tillage systems. We find that the probability of two-year continuous NT is 8%, and that 70% of Iowa cropland has never used NT over two consecutive years. When three-year tillage history is considered on corn acreage, 3% is in continuous NT, 62% has never used NT, and the rest of the acreage is in rotational NT. When three-year tillage history is considered on soybean acreage, 4% is in continuous NT, 56% has never used, NT, and the rest of the acreage is in rotational NT. The methodology presented is applicable to corn soybean,production systems in other regions and is generalizable to other cropping systems. Regional estimates of the use of rotational and continuous NT are likely to benefit simulation Modeling for the assessment of the environmental effects of alternative tillage practices.																	0022-4561	1941-3300				MAR-APR	2017	72	2					131	138		10.2489/jswc.72.2.131								WOS:000395957900009

Nutrient biofilters in the Virginia Coastal Plain: Nitrogen removal, cost, and potential adoption pathways	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Excess nonpoint source nutrient loss presents one of the most vexing water management challenges for water quality managers: Agriculture is the single largest contributor of nutrients to the Chesapeake Bay, and achieving nutrient reduction targets for agriculture will be costly. Biofilters offer new opportunities to reduce nutrient loads from artificially drained agricultural land. Nutrient biofilters consist of organic carbon (C) medium, typically wood chips, that when saturated with nitrogen (N)-enriched waters supports the activity of naturally occurring soil microorganisms that convert bioavailable N into N gases via denitrification.This study estimates the cost and N removal effectiveness for a biochar-amended woodchip biofilter draining a 10 ha (25 ac) field planted in a corn (Zea mays L.)-soy (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) rotation in eastern Virginia as well as for alternative design scenarios for biofilters ranging 25 to 150 m(3) (883 to 5,297 ft(3)) with either woodchips alone or biochar-amended woodchip C substrates. Nitrogen removal effectiveness is estimated using modeled site-specific influent loads and N removal effectiveness estimates derived from experimental trials in a pilot scale system on the Delmarva Peninsula. This analysis estimates N removal costs as a function of biofilter size, which directly relates to residence time, per unit of N removed. Modeled N removal estimates over a five-year period (2009 to 2013) for five bed volumes range from 88 to 391 kg (194 to 862 lb) for the woodchip biofilters (21% to 95% removal) and 132 to 412 kg (291 to 908 lb) for the biochar-amended woodchip biofilters (32% to 100% removal) of the 412 kg total N load exported to the biofilters during the five-year period.The N removal costs range from US$15 to US$48 kg' y-1 (US$6.82 to US$21.82 lb(-1)yr(-1)) for the woodchip biofilter and US$15 to US$33 kg(-1) y(-1) (US$6.82 to US$15 lb(-1) yr(-1)) for biochar-amended woodchip filters. While biofilters are determined to be cost-effective for N removal compared to conventional agricultural best management practices, agricultural producers may be reluctant to voluntarily adopt biofilters because of the relatively high initial installation costs and the lack of direct incentive payments for pollutant removal effectiveness. Nutrient trading programs offer some potential to enhance adoption, but not in the immediate future.

Riparian proper functioning condition assessment to improve watershed management for water quality	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Pollutants can be reduced, ameliorated or assimilated when riparian ecosystems have the vegetation, water, and soil/landform needed for riparian functions. Loss of physical form and ecological function unravels assimilation processes, increasing supply and transport of pollutants. Water quality and aquatic organisms are response measures of accumulated upstream discharges, and ultimately of changes in riparian functions. Thus, water quality monitoring often fails to identify or lags behind many causes of pollution or remediation from riparian degradation. This paper reviews the interagency riparian proper functioning condition (PFC) assessment for lotic (running water) riparian ecosystems and outlines connections between PFC and water quality attributes (sediment, nutrients, temperature, and dissolved oxygen [DO]). The PFC interaction of hydrology, vegetation, and soils/landforms influences water quality by dissipating energy associated with high waterflow, thereby reducing vertical instability and lateral erosion while developing floodplains with captured sediment and nutrients. Slowing flood water enables aquifer recharge, deposition, and plant nutrient uptake. Water-loving, densely rooted streambank stabilizing vegetation and/or wood helps integrate riparian functions to maintain channel pattern, profile, and dimension with characteristics for a diversity of habitats. A complex food web helps slow the nutrient spiral with uptake and storage. Temperature fluctuations are dampened by delayed discharges, narrower and deeper active channels, coarser substrates that enhance hyporheic interchange, and shade from riparian vegetation. After assessment and implementation, monitoring recovery of impaired riparian function attributes (e.g., streambank plant species) naturally focuses on persistent drivers of water quality and aquatic habitat. This provides timely environmental indicators of stream ecological health and water quality remediation projects or land management.																	0022-4561	1941-3300				MAR-APR	2017	72	2					168	182		10.2489/jSWC.72.2.168								WOS:000395957900013

In this study, several online real-time sensors were utilized to monitor effluent from a wastewater fed laboratory-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) under natural and simulated failure conditions. These simulated failures included adding reactor mixed liquor to emulate a membrane breach, and spiking MS2 bacteriophage into the reactor to create a high viral load, which might be observed during an outbreak. The CANARY event detection software was used to analyze sensor data and report changes in water quality that might be indicative of poor system behavior. During simulated failure conditions, CANARY reported 20 alarms, accurately detecting each failure. During natural operating conditions, 219 alarms were produced and 189 were attributed to known events (e.g., system and sensor maintenance). The remaining alarms (23) during natural operating conditions were considered to have an unknown cause. However, 13 of those had signal deviations similar to known events, but could not be definitively linked to a source. The results of this study suggest that real-time monitoring in conjunction with CANARY analysis may be useful as an early warning system for monitoring the effluent of water reuse systems, and may help to quickly identify treatment malfunctions or other abnormal conditions.

Lessons and guidance for the management of safe drinking water during extreme weather events	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY												Extreme weather events have presented significant challenges to drinking water quality managers in Australia and elsewhere. Examples of extreme weather events include droughts, floods, cyclones, and wildfires. With global climate change, an increased frequency and severity of diverse extreme weather events is projected for many parts of the world. As such, the need to effectively prepare for and manage these types of extreme events is increasing. Previous experience with managing water supplies before, during and after extreme weather events can provide valuable lessons to aid planning for future events. By surveying Australian water utilities, detailed experiences and lessons from ten case studies of the management of extreme weather events was compiled. The weather events and their impacts to water quality management are described. The lessons learned from these events were used to establish a series of recommendations intended to be used as guidance for future management of extreme events. An important finding was the need to lead change and coordinate effort by the development of a formal whole-of-organisation strategy for building resilience to extreme events. Effective components of such a strategy include the implementation of a water quality management system and the development of specific incident response plans. The development and maintenance of inter-agency relationships was also found to be important and the use of inter-agency hypothetical scenario testing was identified as an effective way to support this. Strategies identified to assist in maintaining operations during and immediately following extreme weather events include the enactment of incident response plans, effective communication and, where possible, the implementation of short-term risk management controls. Post-event activities were also identified, including event recovery, learning from experiences and knowledge dissemination. The guidance presented in this paper will be of value to water quality managers throughout the world as they plan to enhance resilience within their organisations and services.

Water treatment process evaluation of wildfire-affected sediment leachates	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY												The recent increase in wildfire activity has raised concerns among many water utilities that rely on forested watersheds susceptible to wildfire for drinking water supplies. An understanding of post-fire treatment challenges, and guidance on how water providers can prepare is needed. In this study, dark, charred, river-bank sediment deposits were collected from the High Park fire burn area in northern Colorado, USA and leached in the laboratory to simulate the impact of post-fire runoff on source water quality. A comparison of the sediment leachates to post-fire river samples collected during flow events indicated the turbidity, phosphorus, nitrogen and dissolved organic carbon concentrations were similar, although the leachates do not reflect extreme concentrations observed in the field. The treatability of the leachates was evaluated with conventional coagulation and additional unit processes (pre-oxidation, powdered activated carbon, biofiltration), and samples were analyzed for disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation. Material leached from the sediments was enriched in haloacetonitrile (HAN) and chloropicrin precursors compared to baseline organic material of source waters, whereas total trihalomethane and haloacetic acid precursor reactivity were not statistically different from baseline source waters. Sediment leachates were amenable to conventional coagulation (25 mg L-1 aluminum sulfate), but may require additional treatment to meet DBP maximum contaminant levels. Enhanced coagulation (50 mg L-1) or pre-ozonation followed by conventional treatment are recommended as the best options for reducing carbonaceous DBP formation. Pre-ozonation/coagulation/biofiltration resulted in the lowest HAN and chloropicrin formation of the sediment leachates.

In this context, drinking water sources are severely affected, including adverse effects on agriculture, health, fisheries and the ecosystem. This research investigates i) selected water quality parameters ii) local people's perception on drinking water scarcity iii) how local people's cope with safe drinking water scarcity. This research was conducted using local water samples, questionnaire survey of 200 households and 4 focus group discussions (FDGs) in Shyamnagar and Tala subdistrict of Satkhira district. The study of the water quality parameters exposed the extreme conditions of the drinking water sources in the area. The average values of total dissolved solids (TDS), electrical conductivity (EC) and Chloride concentration (Cl-) were found respectively 4044.12 mg/L, 7186.7 mu S/cm, and 3143.6 mg/L in Shyamnagar and 2313.60 mg/L, 43903 mu S/cm, and 1402.1 mg/L in Tala. The result of community perception reveals that local people are aware of the safe water scarcity and nearly all of them perceive that salinity is the main reason behind it. Even though there are a number of socioeconomic factors, communities have their own adaptation technologies to cope with the problem. The study concludes with the development of a community based model defining the key responsibilities of the stakeholders, including local and central government, NGOs and community people to work in a well coordinated manner which will be effective for reducing the scarcity of the safe drinking water.

A long-term field experiment, implementing nanotechnology in the form of UltraFiltration (UF) and Reverse Osmosis (RO) for salt removal from treated wastewater, was conducted with secondary effluents, aiming to prove the sustainability of agricultural production using irrigation with treated wastewater. Six outdoor field treatments, each under four replications, were conducted for examining the salt accumulation effects on the soil and the crops. The field experiments proved that crop development is correlated with the water quality as achieved from the wastewater filtration capability of the hybrid nanotechnology system. The key goal was to maintain sustainable food production, despite the low quality of the waters. Of the six treatment methods tested, irrigation with RO-treated effluent produced the best results in terms of its effect on soil salinity and crop yield. Nevertheless, it must be kept in mind that this process is not only costly, but it also removes all organic matter content from the irrigation water, requiring the addition of fertilizers to the effluent.

Samuel; von Gunten, Urs			Formation and reactivity of inorganic and organic chloramines and bromamines during oxidative water treatment	WATER RESEARCH												The formation and further reactions of halamines during oxidative water treatment can be relevant for water quality. In this study, we investigated the formation and reactivity of several inorganic and organic halamines (monochloramine, N-chloromethylamine, N-chlorodimethylamine, monobromamine, dibromamine, N-bromomethylamine, N,N-dibromomethylamine, and N-bromodimethylamine) by kinetic experiments, transformation product analysis, and quantum chemical computations. Kinetic model simulations were conducted to evaluate the relevance of halamines for various water treatment scenarios. Halamines were quickly formed from the reaction of chlorine and bromine with ammonia or organic amines. Species-specific second-order rate constants for the reaction of chlorine and bromine with ammonia, methyl- and dimethylamine were in the order of 10(6)-10(8) M(-1)s(-1). The formed halamines were found to be reactive towards phenolic compounds, forming halogenated phenols via electrophilic aromatic substitution (phenol and resorcinol) or quinones via electron transfer (catechol and hydroquinone). At near neutral pH, apparent second-order rate constants for these reactions were in the order of 10(-4)-10(-1) M(-1)s(-1) for chloramines and 10(1)-10(2) M(-1)s(-1) for bromamines. Quantum chemical computations were used to determine previously unknown aqueous pK(a) values, gas phase bond dissociation energies (BDE) and partial atomic charges of the halamines, allowing a better understanding of their reactivities. Kinetic model simulations, based on the results of this study, showed that during zhlorination inorganic and organic chloramines are the main halamines formed. However, their further reactions with organic matter are outcompeted kinetically by chlorine. During ozonation, mainly inorganic bromamines are formed, since ozone quickly oxidizes organic amines. The further reactions of bromamine are typically outcompeted by ozone and thus generally of minor importance. The use of peracetic acid for saline ballast water treatment can result in the formation of substantial amounts of bromamines, which can react with dissolved organic matter and contribute to the formation of brominated products.

J	Housh, M; Ohar, Z				Housh, Mashor; Ohar, Ziv			Integrating physically based simulators with Event Detection Systems: Multi-site detection approach	WATER RESEARCH												The Fault Detection (FD) Problem in control theory concerns of monitoring a system to identify when a fault has occurred. Two approaches can be distinguished for the FD: Signal processing based FD and Model-based FD. The former concerns of developing algorithms to directly infer faults from sensors' readings, while the latter uses a simulation model of the real-system to analyze the discrepancy between sensors' readings and expected values from the simulation model. Most contamination Event Detection Systems (EDSs) for water distribution systems have followed the signal processing based FD, which relies on analyzing the signals from monitoring stations independently of each other, rather than evaluating all stations simultaneously within an integrated network. In this study, we show that a model-based EDS which utilizes a physically based water quality and hydraulics simulation models, can outperform the signal processing based EDS. We also show that the model-based EDS can facilitate the development of a Multi-Site EDS (MSEDS), which analyzes the data from all the monitoring stations simultaneously within an integrated network. The advantage of the joint analysis in the MSEDS is expressed by increased detection accuracy (higher true positive alarms and fewer false alarms) and shorter detection time. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Challenges with secondary use of multi-source water-quality data in the United States	WATER RESEARCH												Combining water-quality data from multiple sources can help counterbalance diminishing resources for stream monitoring in the United States and lead to important regional and national insights that would not otherwise be possible. Individual monitoring organizations understand their own data very well, but issues can arise when their data are combined with data from other organizations that have used different methods for reporting the same common metadata elements. Such use of multi-source data is termed "secondary use"-the use of data beyond the original intent determined by the organization that collected the data. In this study, we surveyed more than 25 million nutrient records collected by 488 organizations in the United States since 1899 to identify major inconsistencies in metadata elements that limit the secondary use of multi-source data. Nearly 14.5 million of these records had missing or ambiguous information for one or more key metadata elements, including (in decreasing order of records affected) sample fraction, chemical form, parameter name, units of measurement, precise numerical value, and remark codes. As a result, metadata harmonization to make secondary use of these multi source data will be time consuming, expensive, and inexact. Different data users may make different assumptions about the same ambiguous data, potentially resulting in different conclusions about important environmental issues. The value of these ambiguous data is estimated at $US12 billion, a substantial collective investment by water-resource organizations in the United States. By comparison, the value of unambiguous data is estimated at $US8.2 billion. The ambiguous data could be preserved for uses beyond the original intent by developing and implementing standardized metadata practices for future and legacy water-quality data throughout the United States.

Effects of nitrate addition on water column methylmercury in Occoquan Reservoir, Virginia, USA	WATER RESEARCH												Mercury bioaccumulation in aquatic biota poses a widespread threat to human and environmental health. Methylmercury (MeHg), the toxic form of mercury, tends to build up under anaerobic conditions in the profundal zones of lakes. In this study we performed a two-year assessment of spatial and temporal patterns of dissolved oxygen, nitrate, MeHg, manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe) in Occoquan Reservoir, a large run-of-the-river drinking water reservoir in Virginia, USA. A tributary to the reservoir receives input of nitrate-rich tertiary-treated wastewater that enhances the oxidant capacity of bottom water. Multiple lines of evidence supported the hypothesis that the presences of nitrate and/or oxygen in bottom water correlated with low MeHg in bottom water. Bottom water MeHg was significantly lower in a nitrate-rich tributary (annual mean of 0.05 ng/L in both 2012 and 2013) compared to a nitrate-poor tributary (annual mean of 0.58 ng/L in 2012 and 0.21 ng/L in 2013). The presence of nitrate and oxygen in bottom water corresponded with significantly lower bottom water MeHg at an upstream station in the main reservoir (0.05 versus 0.11 ng/L in 2013). In 2012 the reservoir exhibited a longitudinal gradient with nitrate and oxygen decreasing and MeHg and Mn increasing downstream. In both study years, there was a clear threshold of oxygen equivalent (3-5 mg/L), a metric that combines the oxidant capacity of nitrate and oxygen, above which MeHg (<0.05 ng/L), Mn (<0.3 mg/L) and Fe (<0.5 mg/L) were low. Results indicated that the addition of nitrate-rich tertiary-treated wastewater to the bottom of anaerobic reservoirs can reduce MeHg concentrations, and potentially decrease mercury bioaccumulation, while increasing the safe water yield for potable use.

Significant water quality challenges are related to nutrients, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, pathogens, sediments and habitat alteration. To facilitate the challenges posed, there is a need for predictive, spatially distributed models to be developed that encompass the key aspects of agriculture and water management in order to inform future policy and organizations with an interest in land management. Additionally, there needs to be recognition from policy makers that different solutions are needed in different agri-water systems and that it often takes many years or decades for policies to have a sustained water quality impact. Long-term support for research infrastructure and the scientific skills base is required to enable measurement and data analysis necessary to inform decision making. Farmers need clearly articulated information on the issues and potential solutions on which to make informed management decisions regarding water. There are existing solutions to some problems and this knowledge needs to be effectively disseminated with appropriate incentives for implementation to have maximum impact. Greater collaboration between researchers, industry, and policy makers, with the necessary framework to deliver effective joint working, is urgently needed. There is also a need for a wider societal understanding of the land-water system and the various ways in which society pays (and might pay in the future) for the real value of water.

With this increase, there has been a proliferation of studies that assess the physical and ecological responses of rivers to these removals. As more dams are considered for removal, scientific information from these dam-removal studies will increasingly be called upon to inform decisions about whether, and how best, to bring down dams. This raises a critical question: what is the current state of dam-removal science in the United States? To explore the status, trends, and characteristics of dam-removal research in the U.S., we searched the scientific literature and extracted basic information from studies on dam removal. Our literature review illustrates that although over 1200 dams have been removed in the U.S., fewer than 10% have been scientifically evaluated, and most of these studies were short in duration (<4 years) and had limited ( 1-2 years) or no pre-removal monitoring. The majority of studies focused on hydrologic and geomorphic responses to removal rather than biological and water-quality responses, and few studies were published on linkages between physical and ecological components. Our review illustrates the need for long-term, multidisciplinary case studies, with robust study designs, in order to anticipate the effects of dam removal and inform future decision making.

Ferdous			Hydrochemical Characteristics and Quality Assessment of Groundwater in Patuakhali District, Southern Coastal Region of Bangladesh	EXPOSURE AND HEALTH												Groundwater quality is important as it is the main factor determining its suitability for drinking, domestic, agricultural, and industrial purposes. Hydrogeochemical characteristics of groundwater in coastal aquifers of Patuakhali district have been investigated based on different indices for assessing its utility and to evaluate the factors influencing groundwater quality. A total of 18 groundwater samples were collected from tube wells having depth between 244 and 365 m and were analyzed for physicochemical parameters, including temperature, pH, electric conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), salinity; major ion concentrations such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, SO4 (2-), NO3 (-), HCO3 (-), Br-; and trace element concentrations such as As, Pb, Li, Rb, Ba, Be, Co, Mn, Ti, Cd, and Se. The results revealed that the groundwater is slightly alkaline and brackish in nature. The trends of dominant cations and anions are Na+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > K+ and HCO3 (-) > Cl- > SO4 (2-) > NO3 (-) > Br-, respectively and Na-Cl-HCO3 is the dominant groundwater type. Ion exchange and seawater plays a significant role in the geochemistry of the groundwater and signatures of Br-/Cl- ratio showed evidence of mixing of seawater in the southern part of study area. The samples analyzed were also classified with different indices, diagram, and permissible limit i.e., EC, TDS, chloride content, soluble sodium percentage or Na %, sodium adsorption ratio, residual sodium carbonate, magnesium adsorption ratio, Kelley's ratio, Wilcox diagram, USSL diagram and results showed that groundwater is not suitable for drinking and irrigation purpose. However, except for Se and As, the trace metals concentration are within permissible limit.																	2451-9766	2451-9685				MAR	2017	9	1					43	60		10.1007/s12403-016-0221-y								WOS:000394286000004

The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) with a TGR specific database was utilized to evaluate the hydrology and water quality processes of the Pengxi River Basin. The flow and its nutrient content were assessed by the model, and the largest pollutant load generation areas of this basin were identified. The Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) method was used to conduct sensitivity analysis, model calibration and validation. Results of sensitivity analysis showed that CN2 (initial SCS runoff curve number for moisture condition II) was most sensitive for runoff, while RCN (concentration of nitrogen in rainfall) and FILTERW (width of edge of field filter strip) were most sensitive for nitrogen and phosphorus loadings respectively. Determination of the most sensitive parameters on the rate of change of SWAT outputs was identified. The coefficient of determination (R-2) in the validation ranged from 0.66-0.85 for daily stream flow and 0.70-0.86 for nutrient yield. Average annual water yield for the entire basin was found to be 3.93 billion m(3) from 2010 to 2013, while average annual total nitrogen yield was 9406 t, and average annual total phosphorus yield was 984t. The simulation results indicate that runoff appeared to vary significantly throughout the year and from year to year, and was correlated with precipitation. Higher pollutant load generation areas were mainly concentrated in the central and southern part of the Pengxi River basin. This study is expected to have major implications for identifying non-point source (NPS) and water quality management policies and approaches. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The imbalance between the resources and the demand has been caused by the expansion of irrigated areas, the emergence of illegal new irrigated lands and pumping wells, the increase in energy cost and the bad management of water use rights by the public water administration. In addition, climate change and frequent drought in this semi-arid region aggravate the situation. As a consequence, many aquifers are overexploited. The region of Murcia has well-developed agri-food sector, Which is a key factor in, the regional economy. This sector accounts for 21.4% of the regional GDP, and Murcia also has an important tourism sector, so the overexploitation of the aquifers would concern production, exportation and agricultural development as well as the decline in the water level, environmental damage and water quality impairment. On the other hand, the fulfilment of the "good ecological status" objectives set by the Water Framework Directive, with a deadline of 2027, will be a difficult task for water managers. This study proposed a hydroeconomic model to obtain the cost of the overexploited aquifers in the Segura basin in order to decide on the feasibility of using groundwater for agriculture in situations of overexploitation. The results showed that the price paid by farmers for irrigation water in the year 2027 would be 0.53(sic)/m(3) (i.e., annual spending of 180(sic)), which will involve 10% of the final agricultural crop production in the Region of Murcia. Alternative water sources are proposed to increase water supply security for farmers and to ensure the socio-economic and environmental sustainability of the basin. Finally, the methodology proposed would help to manage water use in other European Mediterranean basins under similar climatic, hydrological and agricultural conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Alrajhi, A; Beecham, S; Hassanli, A				Alrajhi, Abdullah; Beecham, Simon; Hassanli, Ali			Effects of partial root-zone drying irrigation and water quality on soil physical and chemical properties	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Using recycled wastewater (RW) is considered to be a strategic choice for overcoming water scarcity worldwide, so there is a pressing need to improve irrigation and nutrient uptake to sustain crop yields and at the same time to reduce the negative impacts of RW. In the present Study, tomato plants (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. var. "Azmier") were exposed to three different water qualities: recycled wastewater (RW); fresh municipal tap water (FW); and a blend of RW and stormwater (BW), in combination with five irrigation scenarios: full irrigation (FI) full plant water requirement; deficit irrigation (DI), with 75% and 50% of FI as DI75 and DI50, respectively; and partial root-zone drying (PRD), with 75% and 50% as PRD75 and PRD50, respectively. The effects of these treatments on soil hydraulic conductivity (K-s), soil pH, root growth, leaf area (LA) as well as the residual phosphorus (P), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) in the soil were investigated. The results showed that there was no significant difference in the soil K-s. However, different types of irrigation waters significantly affected the soil pH, while irrigation scenarios had no effect on soil pH. Also, irrigation scenarios influenced root growth and LA, while PRD scenarios lowered soil P, K+, and Mg2+ concentration compared to DI. The results also showed that water quality influenced canopy coverage 107 days after planting (DAP). It is clear that PRD is a promising scenario for sustaining agriculture in areas with high water scarcity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Jo, B; Baloch, Z				Jo, Byungwan; Baloch, Zafar			Internet of Things-Based Arduino Intelligent Monitoring and Cluster Analysis of Seasonal Variation in Physicochemical Parameters of Jungnangcheon, an Urban Stream	WATER												In the present case study, the use of an advanced, efficient and low-cost technique for monitoring an urban stream was reported. Physicochemical parameters (PcPs) of Jungnangcheon stream (Seoul, South Korea) were assessed using an Internet of Things (IoT) platform. Temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), and pH parameters were monitored for the three summer months and the first fall month at a fixed location. Analysis was performed using clustering techniques (CTs), such as K-means clustering, agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC), and density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN). An IoT-based Arduino sensor module (ASM) network with a 99.99% efficient communication platform was developed to allow collection of stream data with user-friendly software and hardware and facilitated data analysis by interested individuals using their smartphones. Clustering was used to formulate relationships among physicochemical parameters. K-means clustering was used to identify natural clusters using the silhouette coefficient based on cluster compactness and looseness. AHC grouped all data into two clusters as well as temperature, DO and pH into four, eight, and four clusters, respectively. DBSCAN analysis was also performed to evaluate yearly variations in physicochemical parameters. Noise points (NOISE) of temperature in 2016 were border points (p), whereas in 2014 and 2015 they remained core points (q), indicating a trend toward increasing stream temperature. We found the stream parameters were within the permissible limits set by the Water Quality Standards for River Water, South Korea.

Using multiple watershed models to assess the water quality impacts of alternate land development scenarios for a small community	CATENA												Chesapeake Bay, the largest estuary in North America, is impaired by excess nutrient discharges, especially from urban and agricultural land. Watershed simulation models have provided key insights to understanding land -to water connections, but rarely are these models applied to guide local land management to explore and communicate uncertainty in the model predictions. In this study, three watershed simulation models; the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), the Generalized Watershed Loading Function (GWLF) model, and the Chesapeake Bay Program's Chesapeake Watershed Model (CBP-CWM) were implemented to predict water, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus discharges from small tributaries in the town of Queenstown, Maryland, USA. Based on our evaluation metrics, none of the models consistently provided better results. In general, there was a good agreement on annual average water flow between the SWAT and CBP-CWM models, and the GWLF and CBP-CWM models predicted similar TN and TP loads. Each model has strengths and weaknesses in flow and nutrient predictions, and predictions differed among models even when models were initialized with the same data. Using multiple models may enhance the quality of model predictions and the decision making process. However, it could also be the case that the complexity of implemented watershed models and resolution of our understanding currently are not yet suited to provide scientifically credible solutions.

J	de Oliveira, LM; Maillard, P; Pinto, EJD				de Oliveira, Lilia Maria; Maillard, Philippe; de Andrade Pinto, Eber Jose			Application of a land cover pollution index to model non-point pollution sources in a Brazilian watershed	CATENA												Non-point and point source pollution are a water quality problem in most parts of the World. Many studies have used the land use and land cover (LULC) to model non-point pollution sources. In this article we evaluate the relationship between LULC and five water quality parameters using different zones of analysis: riparian buffers (B) and exclusive contribution areas (ECA). The five parameters are nitrate, nitrite, total ammonia nitrogen, total phosphorous and dissolved oxygen. Analyses were performed on riparian zones of different widths and ECA5 to verify if the effect of the land cover on the water quality of the stream decreases with the increased distance. The urban and agricultural/pasture categories of LULC were characterized as pollution sources while vegetation (Forest and Riparian Forest) as pollution sink (filter). We proposed a Land Cover Pollution index (LCPI) which is a ratio between source and sink to substitute the individual LULC categories. The source and sink categories were selected considering our knowledge of the LULC relationship and the sign of the Pearson's Correlation Coefficient. The LCPI varied between 0.11 in the 150 m buffer (higher filter effect) and a maximum of 27.99 (largest source effect). Additionally, we transformed the water quality data in incremental loads per unit area so that each station could be considered independent from the others and be compared between themselves independently of the contribution area they represent. Our method also included only data from the rain season, the beginning of which was determined using the hydrograms of discharge data. Results indicate that the index is better than the individual LULC classes to explain this relationship, especially in riparian zones. In 12 out of 15 models the coefficient of determination (R-2) increased by 11 to 155%, when we use the index instead of the LULC classes. We believe that these good results can be attributed to the LCPI but also to the special processing of the water quality data making it more sound for statistical processing. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The pressure to use non-conventional water sources has boosted the construction of numerous desalination plants. High concentrations of secondary ions as calcium and magnesium cause problems in reverse osmosis plants and in other industries such as copper mining and cooling system. Biomineralization process based on hydrolysis of urea has been described in a wide variety of bacterial species with diverse applications. The selection of ureolytic halotolerant bacteria from Atacama Salar and their ability to precipitate calcium and magnesium crystals in seawater is described. Besides crystal structure and morphology were determined by electron microscopy analysis and X-ray diffraction. When assessing the mineral precipitate ability, Rhodococcus erythropolis precipitates a similar to 95% soluble calcium and 8% magnesium. The analysis of crystals showed that correspond to similar to 12.69% monohydrocalcite, similar to 30.72% struvite and similar to 56.59% halite. These results demonstrate that the biomineralization by ureolytic bacteria in seawater has great potential for its application as a pretreatment to improve water quality for industrial processes.

J	Sorribas, MV; Marques, DD; Castro, NMD; Fan, FM				Sorribas, Mino Viana; Marques, David da Motta; dos Reis Castro, Nilza Maria; Fan, Fernando Mainardi			Fluvial carbon export and CO2 efflux in representative nested headwater catchments of the eastern La Plata River Basin	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												This study involved a baseline evaluation of fluvial carbon export and degas rates in three nested rural catchments (1 to 80 km(2)) in Taboao, a representative experimental catchment of the Upper Uruguay River Basin. Analyses of the carbon content in stream waters and the catchment carbon yield were based on 4-year monthly in situ data and statistical modeling using the United States Geological Survey load estimator model. We also estimated pCO(2) and degas fluxes using carbonate equilibrium and gas-exchange formulas. Our results indicated that the water was consistently pCO2 saturated (similar to 90% of the cases) and that the steep terrain favors high gas evasion rates. The mean calculated fluvial export was 5.4 tC.km(-2).year(-1) with inorganic carbon dominating (dissolved inorganic carbon: dissolved organic carbon ratio >4), and degas rates (similar to 40 tC.km(-2).year(-1)) were nearly sevenfold higher than the downstream export. The homogeneous land use in this nested catchment system results in similar water-quality characteristics, and therefore, export rates are expected to be closely related to the rainfall-runoff relationships at each scale. Although the sampling campaigns did not fully reproduce storm-event conditions and related effects such as flushing or dilution of in-stream carbon, our results indicated a potential link between dissolved inorganic carbon and slower hydrological pathways related to subsurface water storage and movement.																	0885-6087	1099-1085				FEB 28	2017	31	5					995	1006		10.1002/hyp.11076								WOS:000394901800003

An Assessment of Source Water Quality in Karoi, Mashonaland West Province, Zimbabwe	JOURNAL OF WATER MANAGEMENT MODELING												The aim of this study was to assess the quality of source water used for domestic purposes in the town of Karoi. The objectives were: to determine the quality of surface water in the study area; and to characterize point and non-point sources of pollution. The study examined physical and chemical surface water quality parameters that may indicate pollution and so help to identify surface water pollution. The results showed that most of the measured parameters in surface water examined in Karoi were within the acceptable range of WHO drinking water guidelines. When compared with the guidelines, electrical conductivity was slightly higher; turbidity and total suspended solids were significantly higher in the wet season than in the dry season due to water flowing, which carries particles with it; and the changing seasons resulted in slight changes in surface water temperature. The results suggest that some human activities, like agriculture and poor sewage disposal in Karoi, can reduce surface water quality in Karoi.																	2292-6062					FEB 24	2017	25								UNSP C426	10.14796/JWMM.C426								WOS:000408028100001

River water quality changes in New Zealand over 26 years: response to land use intensity	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Relationships between land use and water quality are complex with interdependencies, feedbacks, and legacy effects. Most river water quality studies have assessed catchment land use as areal coverage, but here, we hypothesize and test whether land use intensity - the inputs (fertilizer, livestock) and activities (vegetation removal) of land use is a better predictor of environmental impact. We use New Zealand (NZ) as a case study because it has had one of the highest rates of agricultural land intensification globally over recent decades. We interpreted water quality state and trends for the 26 years from 1989 to 2014 in the National Rivers Water Quality Network (NRWQN) - consisting of 77 sites on 35 mostly large river systems. To characterize land use intensity, we analyzed spatial and temporal changes in livestock density and land disturbance (i.e., bare soil resulting from vegetation loss by either grazing or forest harvesting) at the catchment scale, as well as fertilizer inputs at the national scale. Using simple multivariate statistical analyses across the 77 catchments, we found that median visual water clarity was best predicted inversely by areal coverage of intensively managed pastures. The primary predictor for all four nutrient variables (TN, NOx, TP, DRP), however, was cattle density, with plantation forest coverage as the secondary predictor variable. While land disturbance was not itself a strong predictor of water quality, it did help explain outliers of land use-water quality relationships. From 1990 to 2014, visual clarity significantly improved in 35 out of 77 (34 = 77) catchments, which we attribute mainly to increased dairy cattle exclusion from rivers (despite dairy expansion) and the considerable decrease in sheep numbers across the NZ landscape, from 58 million sheep in 1990 to 31 million in 2012. Nutrient concentrations increased in many of NZ's rivers with dissolved oxidized nitrogen significantly increasing in 27/77 catchments, which we largely attribute to increased cattle density and legacy nutrients that have built up on intensively managed grasslands and plantation forests since the 1950s and are slowly leaking to the rivers. Despite recent improvements in water quality for some NZ rivers, these legacy nutrients and continued agricultural intensification are expected to pose broad-scale environmental problems for decades to come.

Effect of boron rejection and recovery rate on a single-pass design of SWRO using hybrid membrane inter-stage design (HID) concept	DESALINATION												Seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) has been applied as a desalination method to provide potable water to regions under the stress of water shortages and is more effective than other desalination processes. However, specific energy consumption (SEC) must be considered in SWRO process design because of its energy intensive features. Hybrid membrane inter-stage design (HID) was examined to enhance the SEC efficiency of the reverse osmosis process. The additional removal of boron may improve the Water quality by adding a second pass. However, this additional factor may increase costs. This study investigated a potential HID that satisfies water quality standards with single pass SWRO only. The element configuration for the HID was evaluated by changes in SEC, salt rejection, and boron rejection under general seawater quality conditions. Case studies were also conducted to estimate the energy efficiency of the HID under three feed conditions: high concentration and high temperature (Case 1); low concentration and high temperature (Case 2); and low concentration and low temperature (Case 3). The results showed HID application can save up to 0.41 kWh/m(3) of SEC. Temperature is a more important design factor than recovery rate for HID application. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

These thin film nanocomposite (TEN) membranes boast many advantages over their TFC counterparts such as increased water flux without compromising salt rejection and bacterial resistance. However, the stability of TFN membranes is unknown in industrial, long-term applications. Via interfacial polymerization, we synthesized a series of polyamide TFC and TFN membranes with different nanoparticle content, 0 wt%, 0.15 wt%, 0.30 wt%, in the casting solutions. At the United States Bureau of Reclamation's Water Quality Improvement Center in Yuma, AZ, the membranes were tested for similar to 3000 h in a lab-scale testing system. We characterized the physico-chemical nature and morphology of the membranes before and after the testing. All membranes exhibited relatively stable long-term separation performances. At the highest zeolite loading tested, in comparison with the TFC membrane, water permeance increased from 3.7 +/- 0.6 mu m MPa-1 s(-1) to 5.3 +/- 0.5 mu m MPa-1 s(-1) and solute rejection slightly increased from 97.4 +/- 0.3% to 97.9 +/- 0.1%.

Cha-Am uses an aerated lagoon system consisting of three ponds and a natural wetland to treat the municipal wastewater. A personal computer version of the storm water management model, PCSWMM, was used to simulate the effluent quality of the treatment system. Water quality samplings for total suspended solids (TSS), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), Escherichia coli (E. coli), chemical oxygen demand (COD), as well as evaporation measurements, were conducted on a bi-weekly basis for three months to calibrate the model. The four ponds were considered as four storage zones in the model. Based on the observed water quality data distribution, Monte Carlo simulation was used (1 000 iterations, 20 times) to get the most probable input concentration for each pond to determine the appropriate treatment fractions for the model. Data on daily inflow rates, pump operation and bathymetric survey also were obtained from the system operator as model input. The dynamic wave method was used with observed inflow rates to generate a continuous water quality simulation from 2015-07-19 to 2015-09-12. Observed mean treatment efficiency was 51.9%, 77.3%, 99.6% and 9.4% for TSS, TKN, E. coli and COD respectively. Observed concentrations at the outlet ranged between, 10 mg/L to 25.5 mg/L, 0.98 mg/L to 3.92 mg/L, 0.1 CFU/100 mL to 260 CFU/100 ml and 48 mg/L to 119 mg/L for TSS, TKN, E. coli and COD respectively. The treatment fraction approach in PCSWWM was able to accurately represent the outlet concentrations of TSS, TKN, E. coli and COD.																	2292-6062					FEB 13	2017	25								UNSP C423	10.14796/JWMM.C423								WOS:000408027200001

HSPEXP+: An Enhanced Expert System for HSPF Model Calibration-A Case Study of the Snake River Watershed in Minnesota	JOURNAL OF WATER MANAGEMENT MODELING												The U.S. Geological Survey developed the Expert System (HSPExp) in 1994 to assist modelers in the calibration of Hydrologic Simulation Program-FORTRAN (HSPF) models by calculating statistics, displaying graphs, and recommending parameter adjustments, based on model-data comparisons and several sets of rules. HSPExp has been used extensively since its release; however, HSPExp support was recently discontinued, and the software does not operate reliably on most modern computers. Many organizations have developed software to calculate calibration statistics, but these programs are neither freely available nor open source, which limits their usability by a wide user community. Using the existing open source codebase of Better Assessment Science Integrating Point and Nonpoint Sources (BASINS), RESPEC developed HSPEXP+and released it in February 2015. HSPEXP+replicates most of the functionality of HSPExp, and provides several additional reports and an advanced graphing functionality to assist a modeler in obtaining meaningful insights about the model on an overall basis, as well as on an operation-by-operation basis. This paper presents a case study of the calibration of the Snake River watershed situated in the eastern part of Minnesota. Snake River is a tributary to the St. Croix River at the border of Minnesota and Wisconsin, and drains a watershed of > 2 500 km(2), with multiple lakes. HSPEXP+was used to assist in hydrologic and water quality calibration in the watershed. The hydrologic model resulted in a model fit efficiency of > 0.9 for monthly flow and > 0.8 for daily flow with a mean error < 10% in total volume. The water quality calibration included simulated loading rate comparisons with the target loading rates, and a graphical comparisons of instream observed and simulated data. The Snake River watershed model was satisfactory based on quantitative and graphical comparisons, and the model can be used for TMDL development.																	2292-6062					FEB 9	2017	25								UNSP C422	10.14796/JWMM.C422								WOS:000408026800001

In this cross-sectional descriptive study, 50 samples were taken from 10 stations of drinking water distribution network (5 times from every station). The mean values of physical, chemical and microbial parameters of drinking water in distribution network were as follows: turbidity (0.274 NTU), electrical conductivity (1,149.3 mu S/cm), pH (7.12), total hardness (458), calcium hardness (390.9), magnesium hardness (68), alkalinity (171.5) mg/L CaCO3, magnesium (16.95), calcium (156), residual chlorine (0.63), chloride (83.26), fluoride (0.48), iron (0.11), phosphate (0.053), nitrite (0.0026), nitrate (3.08), sulfate (728.4), TDS (577.66) mg/L, heterotrophic plate counts (HPC; 299.8 CFU/mL), total coliform (0) and fecal coliform (0). Results of the present study revealed that except TDS, sulfate, and HPC (14% of samples) the mean concentration levels of all examined parameters in drinking water of distribution network in Bushehr generally complied with the Iranian National Regulation (INR), EPA and WHO drinking water guidelines.

J	Wang, SH; Wang, T; Zhao, L; Li, R				Wang, Shuhang; Wang, Tao; Zhao, Li; Li, Rong			Spatial distribution characteristics of phosphorus in the overlying water, interstitial and sediment of Lihu Lake, China	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												The levels and spatial distributions of phosphorus in the overlying water, interstitial water and sediments in Lihu Lake were investigated in April 2012. In the overlying water, the total phosphorus (TP) concentrations ranged from 0.024 to 0.306 mg/L with an average value of 0.064 mg/L. The lake was divided into four zones, and the spatial distribution trends of TP and dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) levels in the overlying water were both as follows: Zone A < Zone < B < Zone C < Zone D. The spatial distribution trends of dissolved total phosphorus (DTP) and inorganic phosphorus levels in the interstitial water were consistent with those of TP and DIP levels in the overlying water. The average DTP concentration of the interstitial water (0.134 mg/L) was evidently higher than that of the overlying water (0.025 mg/L), indicating the potential release of the bio-available phosphorus. The TP concentrations in the surface sediments were at the range of 321.77-1,062.08 mg/kg. The DTP levels in the interstitial water had a positive correlation with TP levels in the surface sediments. Changes of environmental conditions could make the sediments continue to release phosphorus to the overlying water. The TP levels of the overlying water showed a decreasing trend from 2002 to 2012. The results showed that the artificial ecological projects and environmental treatment projects for endogenous pollution sources had effectively improved the water quality since 2003.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				FEB	2017	65						252	258		10.5004/dwt.2017.20259								WOS:000403569200028

The model uses the clustering fusion method to process the data collected by the sensors, and the processed data are used as the original input data of the grey forecasting control. At the same time, the output data of the grey forecasting control are compared with the sensor data after fusion to determine the forecast value. Finally, accurate forecast values of water quality in the system are obtained. Many data were obtained after running the system; grey forecasting control model based on clustering and fusion provides system parameters. The mean absolute percentage error of water quality characteristics of conductivity, dissolved oxygen and turbidity was 0.38%, 9.91% and 9.16%, respectively. The results highlight that the proposed method is better than the single grey forecasting method; thus, it can guarantee the different water quality parameters remain stable and meet the water quality requirements.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				FEB	2017	64						48	53		10.5004/dwt.2017.20186								WOS:000403568100006

Synthesis of halogenated nanodendrimer as novel antimicrobial agents in water treatment	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												Microbiological quality of drinking water is an important aspect of water quality. The aim of this research work was to fabricate and modify G2 and G4 dendrimers as novel antibacterial agent for local application. Poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) (G(2) and G(4)) dendrimers were fabricated and modified into quaternary ammonium salts using halogens groups (Cl, Br, I), and characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis. The results of these analysis proved that nanostructure dendrimer and their quaternary ammonium salts are well fabricated. For evaluation of the antimicrobial property, the water samples were collected from rural drinking water resources, and the bacteria isolated and identified from these samples were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus aureus. The antimicrobial activities of PAMAM dendrimers (G(2) and G(4)) and modified PAMAM dendrimers (G(2)Cl, G(2)Br, G(2)I, G(4)Cl, G(4)Br, and G(4)I) against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were examined by calculating minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), and disc diffusion methods. Quaternary ammonium salts exhibited more antimicrobial efficacy against bacteria compared with unmodified ones. The most antibacterial effect was obtained by G(4)I with MIC: 52, 50, 55, and 57 mu g/ml, and MBC: 64, 67, 71, and 75 mu g/ml for Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Escherichia coli, respectively. The disc diffusion test of G(4)I (60 mu M) on different bacteria showed inhibition zone diameters of 31, 28, 26, and 25 ml for Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Escherichia coli, respectively.

The removal -efficiencies of phenol were determined, and their relationships with the initial phenol concentration, absorbed dose, and electron-beam energy were investigated. The EBI was conducted in air with absorbed doses from 40 to 120 kGy under 0.3, 1, and 2 MeV electron beams. G-values were introduced to evaluate the removal of phenol quantitatively and were higher at an absorbed dose of 40 kGy than at 80 or 120 kGy. Dose constants (K) were found to depend on the absorbed dose and initial phenol concentration and used to calculate the optimum doses required for 90% (D-0.9) and 50% (D-0.5) removal of phenol. The reduction of the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (CODCr), and total organic carbon (TOC) via EBI indicated organic degradation upon irradiation. The EBI process was combined with activated carbon fiber (ACF) adsorption to improve the CODCr removal efficiency. The optimum ACF doses were 0.5, 1.0, and 1.33 g L-1 with 3, 6, and 6 h contact times for the 20, 50, and 100 mg L-1 phenol solutions, respectively. The combination of EBI with ACF improved the CODCr removal efficiency, even in the more concentrated phenol solution. EBI may be a promising pretreatment process for purifying highly concentrated wastewater.

Analysis of water environment changing trend in Bhagirathi tributary of Ganges in India	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												While determining the quality of water for any water body, low, medium and high values of a parameter stand out to be a very important reference. Moreover, these values are used to decide various design parameters based on scientific aspects and its real applications around the world. In this research, determination of trend of water quality (WQ) status for Bhagirathi River was carried out at two sites, Uttarkashi and Tehri station (Tehri Zero point), for 18 WQ parameters and discharges. Preliminary analysis reveals that all parameter concentrations are below the standard permissible limit. No significant correlation was observed between any parameter with respect to discharge; however, out of 18 parameters, 14 were showing negative correlation indicating groundwater source and geological origin. Moreover, a strong correlation was found between 11 parameters at both sites. Seasonal MannKendall test and Sen's slope method have been used to detect trend and to quantify its magnitude. Increasing trend in the concentration of 7 WQ parameters (Q, EC, K+, Na+, SO42-, BOD and Na%) was observed while decreasing trend was observed for 8 parameters (TA, Ca2+, HCO3-, Mg2+, NO2 + NO3, o-PO43-, DO and TH). Overall, WQ of Bhagirathi River was found to be good and hence is suitable for drinking and life-supporting activities.

J	Jeon, JC; Kim, LH; Min, KS				Jeon, Je-Chan; Kim, Lee-Hyung; Min, Kyung-Sok			Determination on the optimum design factors of BMP for nonpoint pollutant treatment through long-term monitoring	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												Despite huge investments about point source pollution in South Korea over the past 30 years, there is no improvement in the restoration of water quality in rivers and lakes since the 1990s. The reason for this was because of the nonpoint source (NPS) pollution. Therefore, the Korean government prepared a variety of policies and systems to control NPS. The 1st comprehensive measures for NPS management were established to provide policies on the installations of test beds for NPS reduction facilities, determination of treatment efficiency through monitoring, and guidelines for planning and maintenance. The study provided a method for proper installation of the inlet screen and weir in the NPS reduction facility. In addition, the study has identified the optimal linear velocity and depth of media in a filtration facility. In the case of screens installed in closed channels, due to clogging caused by wastes, it was found out that installation of a 3-dimensional structure will be convenient for maintenance. Earth and sediment were not controlled when the weir was installed near the inlet of the facility. However, installation of the weir farther from the inlet of the facility had made improvement for the facility's removal efficiency and maintenance. Therefore, the weir should be installed 1-2 m away from the inlet of the facility to improve efficiency and to provide easier maintenance. Meanwhile, results show that a linear velocity of 25-30 m(3)/h in the filtration facility is most effective for the treatment of contaminants. Also, the facility is most efficient when replacement of media takes place once a year during March. On the other hand, the media does not function normally due to blockage by particulate matters after the rainy season. Therefore, there should be surface dredging of the media once a year after heavy rainfalls. It was also found out the optimal thickness of the media in the filtration facility is more than 0.7 m according to the Total suspended solids (TSS) and Total Phosphorus (TP) treatment efficiency analysis.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				FEB	2017	63						389	396		10.5004/dwt.2017.11442								WOS:000403567200043

The CW was composed of 7 cells in series including a sedimentation zone, deep marsh and shallow marsh. Water quality, sediment and plant monitoring on the CW was conducted since October 2009 and additional analyses were performed to recognize the causes of algae occurrence since 2012. Large amounts of Haematococcus pluvialis species was observed in the first five cells of the CW but no algae was seen at the last 2 cells prior to the outlet. Results indicated that the proportion of plant coverage to surface area in Cells 1 to 5 was very low (less than 6%). Findings revealed that nutrients were being transported into the CW from the catchment area with the soluble nutrients degraded by microbial activities in the sediments and released to the water table. Relatively high potassium content was found in Cell 1 of the CW which originated from the chemical fertilizers used in the paddy field. Algal bloom control and better design methods in the CW were suggested to prevent and regulate the algal bloom in CWs.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				FEB	2017	63						404	411		10.5004/dwt.2017.11445								WOS:000403567200045

Therefore, the government to control nonpoint pollutant source should try to the effort. Long term monitoring is demanded at research on nonpoint pollutant source because the results of nonpoint pollutant source monitoring is very different through meteorological and geography characteristics such as rainfall, rainfall intensity, catchment area, slope of catchment, soil class and so on. Although, many researches on stormwater runoff characteristics of nonpoint pollutant source at the urban and rural area have been conducted, the research which focused on monitoring of vinyl greenhouse area has been insufficiency. This paper reported results of research that finds out stormwater runoff characteristics. At the first stage of stormwater runoff, the concentration of TSS was the highest because of first flush effect. And then the concentration of BOD and COD was increasing. After discharging stormwater runoff 1 and 2 h later, the concentration of TN and TP was increasing. Rainfall intensity has a great effect on outflow of pollutants. At the vinyl greenhouse, after about 15 mm of rainfall, stormwater runoff was observed. Average runoff ratio of monitoring was 0.53.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				FEB	2017	63						425	432		10.5004/dwt.2017.11451								WOS:000403567200048

Combined sewer overflows (CSOs) generated from combined sewer systems (CSS) have a large impact on the water bodies. Today, many researches to treat CSOs are being conducted. In this study, the jar test was conducted to determine the applicability of the coagulation-sedimentation process using chemicals to treat CSOs. Stormwater runoff (mixed with sewer) from a catchment area of 998 ha was used as raw water sample for the experiment. Alum, polyaluminum chloride (PAC), and FeCl3 were used as coagulants and the optimum dose was determined. Moreover, the optimum dose of the weighted coagulant additives (WCA) and polymer coagulant were also determined. Based on the TSS removal efficiency, 30 mg/L, 20 mg/L and 38 mg/L of Alum, PAC and FeCl3, respectively, were determined as the optimum dose. The optimum dosage of polymer coagulant was at 4 mg/L, 5 mg/L and 10 mg/L of Alum, PAC and FeCl3, respectively. Proper coagulants, when injected along with WCA and polymer coagulant, were estimated to be 92.2% (alum), 92.7% (PAC), and 87.6% (FeCl3) based on the TSS removal efficiency.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				FEB	2017	63						469	477		10.5004/dwt.2017.11453								WOS:000403567200054

Environmental characterization of a Mediterranean protected shallow brackish coastal aquatic system, Klisova Lagoon, Western Greece: a case study	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												The Klisova lagoon aquatic system belongs to the wetland of Messolonghi - Aetoliko - Klisova Lagoon Complex, located in the western Greece and represents one of the most important Mediterranean lagoon systems, as it is protected by international conventions and is listed in the Natura 2000 European Network. Water physicochemical parameters such as pH, temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, nutrients definition, TOC, TN and bacteriological indicators (E.coli and Enterococcus spp.) were analyzed in a time period of 1 year monthly monitoring in five sampling sites along the lagoon. The geographical distribution of these parameters show a clear zonation and partition of the lagoon as the result of: (a) the discharging of poorly treated wastes into the lagoon of Mesolonghi city waste water treatment plant and (b) the interplay between sea water influence via the lagoon inlet and the fresh water inflow via lagoon's perimeter channels. The lagoon is characterized by seasonal hypoxic conditions, which are responsible for several ecological socks in the past including fish mortalities. The system is threatened by human interference and sedimentological processes such as the longshore drifting and siltation of the lagoon inlet. Measurements should immediately be taken in order to prevent further downgrading of the water quality.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				FEB	2017	21	1					115	125		10.1007/s11852-016-0476-2								WOS:000399030200010

Elemental properties, hydrology, and biology interact to shape concentration-discharge curves for carbon, nutrients, sediment, and major ions	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												To investigate the prevalence and cause of concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships for carbon, nutrients, major ions, and particulates, we analyzed 40 years of water quality data from 293 monitoring stations in France. Catchments drained diverse landscapes and ranged from 50 to 110,000 km2, together covering nearly half of France. To test for differences during low and high flows, we calculated independent C-Q slopes above and below the median discharge. We found that 84% of all catchment-element combinations were chemodynamic for at least half of the hydrograph and 60% of combinations showed nonlinear C-Q curves. Only two or three of the nine possible C-Q modalities were manifest for each parameter, and these modalities were stable through time, suggesting that intrinsic and extrinsic elemental properties (e. g., solubility, reactivity, and source dynamics) set basic C-Q templates for each parameter, which are secondarily influenced by biological activity during low flows, and the interaction between hydrology and catchment characteristics at high flows. Several patterns challenged current C-Q views, including low-flow chemostasis for TSS in 66% of catchments, low-flow biological mediation of NO23 in 71% of catchments, and positive C-Q for dissolved organic carbon independent of catchment size in 80% of catchments. Efforts to reduce nutrient loading decreased phosphorus concentration and altered C-Q curves, but NO23 continued to increase. While C-Q segmentation requires more data than a single analysis, the prevalence of nonlinear C-Q slopes demonstrates the potential information loss associated with linear or monotonic analysis of C-Q relationships, and conversely, the value of long-term monitoring.

Water quality data for national-scale aquatic research: The Water Quality Portal	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Aquatic systems are critical to food, security, and society. But, water data are collected by hundreds of research groups and organizations, many of which use nonstandard or inconsistent data descriptions and dissemination, and disparities across different types of water observation systems represent a major challenge for freshwater research. To address this issue, the Water Quality Portal (WQP) was developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the National Water Quality Monitoring Council to be a single point of access for water quality data dating back more than a century. The WQP is the largest standardized water quality data set available at the time of this writing, with more than 290 million records from more than 2.7 million sites in groundwater, inland, and coastal waters. The number of data contributors, data consumers, and third-party application developers making use of the WQP is growing rapidly. Here we introduce the WQP, including an overview of data, the standardized data model, and data access and services; and we describe challenges and opportunities associated with using WQP data. We also demonstrate through an example the value of the WQP data by characterizing seasonal variation in lake water clarity for regions of the continental U.S. The code used to access, download, analyze, and display these WQP data as shown in the figures is included as supporting information. Plain Language Summary The Water Quality Portal (http://www.waterqualitydata.us/) makes available more than 297,000,000 water quality records from all 50 states. Users can search for records at, upstream or downstream of their favorite river or lake location.

The effluents of the Montpellier wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) represented the main nutrient input. To improve the water quality of these lagoons, this WWTP was renovated and upgraded and, since the end of 2005, its effluents have been discharged 11km offshore into the Mediterranean (total investment Euro150M). Possibilities of ecosystem restoration as part of a conservation programme were explored by a focus group of experts. Their tasks were: (i) to evaluate the impact of the reduction of the nutrient input; (ii) if necessary, to design additional measures for an active restoration programme; and (iii) to predict ecosystem trajectories for the different cases. Extension of Magnoliophyta meadows can be taken as a proxy for ecosystem restoration as they favour the increase of several fish (seahorse) and bird (ducks, swans, herons) species, albeit they represent a trade-off for greater flamingos. Additional measures for active ecosystem restoration were only recommended for the most impaired lagoon Mejean, while the least impaired lagoon Ingril is already on a trajectory of spontaneous recovery. A multiple contingent valuation considering four different management options for the Mejean lagoon was used in a pilot study based on face-to-face interviews with 159 respondents. Three levels of ecosystem restoration were expressed in terms of recovery of Magnoliophyta meadows, including their impact on emblematic fish and avifauna. These were combined with different options for access (status quo, increasing access, increasing access with measures to reduce disturbance). The results show a willingness of local populations to pay per year about Euro25 for the highest level of ecological restoration, while they were only willing to allocate about Euro5 for additional footpaths and hides.

The present study provides a deeper understanding of the impact of seasonal change on the co-occurrence of As and F-, as both contaminants vary with climatic patterns. Groundwater samples were collected in pre- and post-monsoon seasons (n = 40 in each season) from the Brahmaputra flood plains (BFP) in northeast India to study the effect of season on As and F- levels. Weathering is a key hydrogeochemical process in the BFP and both silicate and carbonate weathering are enhanced in the post-monsoon season. The increase in carbonate weathering is linked to an elevation in pH during the post-monsoon season. A Piper diagram revealed that bicarbonate-type water, with Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ cations, is common in both seasons. Correlation between Cl- and NO3- (r = 0.74, p = 0.01) in the post-monsoon indicates mobilization of anthropogenic deposits during the rainy season. As was within the 10 mu g L-1 WHO limit for drinking water and F- was under the 1.5 mu g L-1 limit. A negative correlation between oxidation reduction potential and groundwater As in both seasons (r = -0.26 and -0.49, respectively, for pre-monsoon and post-monsoon, p = 0.05) indicates enhanced As levels due to prevailing reducing conditions. Reductive hydrolysis of Fe (hydr) oxides appears to be the predominant process of As release, consistent with a positive correlation between As and Fe in both seasons (r = 0.75 and 0.73 for pre- and post-monsoon seasons, respectively, at p = 0.01). Principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis revealed grouping of Fe and As in both seasons. F- and sulfate were also clustered during the pre-monsoon season, which could be due to their similar interactions with Fe (hydr) oxides. Higher As levels in the post-monsoon appears driven by the influx of water into the aquifer, which drives out oxygen and creates a more reducing condition suitable for reductive dissolution of Fe (hydr) oxides. An increase in pH promotes desorption of As oxyanions AsO43- (arsenate) and AsO33- (arsenite) from Fe (hydr) oxide surfaces. Fluoride appears mainly released from F--bearing minerals, but Fe (hydr) oxides can be a secondary source of F-, as suggested by the positive correlation between As and F- in the pre-monsoon season.

Hydrogeochemical studies were carried out in this area with the objective of identifying the geochemical processes influencing water quality and suitability of surface and groundwater for agricultural and domestic uses. Sixty-one groundwater and four surface water samples were collected from boreholes, dams and rivers and analysed for Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, HCO3-, Cl-, and SO42-, Fe-tot, PO43-, Mn-tot, NH4+, NO3-, NO2-. In addition, pH, total dissolved solids, electrical conductivity, total hardness, turbidity, colour, salinity and dissolved oxygen were analysed. Chloro-alkaline indices 1 and 2, and characterization of weathering processes suggest that the chemistry of groundwater is dominated by the interaction between water and rocks. Cation exchange and silicate weathering are the dominant processes controlling the chemical composition of the groundwater in the area studied. Mineral saturation indices indicate the presence of at least three groups of groundwater in the Vea catchment with respect to residence time. The meteoric genesis index suggests that 86% of the water samples belong to the shallow meteoric water percolation type. The findings further suggest that the groundwater and surface water in the basin studied are mainly Ca-Mg-HCO3 water type, regardless of the geology. Compared to the water quality guidelines of WHO, the study results on sodium absorption ratio, sodium percentage, magnesium hazard, permeability index and residual sodium carbonate indicate that groundwater and surface water in the Vea catchment are generally suitable for drinking and irrigation purposes.

The temporal trends from 1993 to 2012 in the concentrations of NO3-N and Cl from more than 3900 wells were estimated using the Mann-Kendall trend test and Sen's slope analysis and compared with the land use change trend for the period 1995-2009. The results indicate that the upward trends in NO3-N were associated with the expansion of agricultural lands, whereas Cl trends were considered to be affected by other factors in addition to the land use changes. In the mid-mountainous region, the deterioration in the groundwater quality by the both NO3-N and Cl was expected due to the continuous expansion of agricultural lands. In the lowland area, the NO3-N and Cl components showed different trends depending on the regions. In the eastern area, increasing trends in NO3-N were observed due to the development of new agricultural areas, while the Cl concentration was observed to decrease as a result of the regulation on groundwater extraction to reduce seawater intrusion. Our study highlights that a comprehensive interpretation of trends in NO3-N and Cl and land use changes for long-term periods can provide useful insights to prepare for suitable groundwater management plans in the whole island perspective.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				FEB	2017	76	4							176	10.1007/s12665-017-6466-3								WOS:000394965100038

Distribution of rare earth elements, thorium and uranium in streams and aquatic mosses of Central Portugal	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The distribution of 14 rare earth elements, Th and U was studied in streams of the study area at 21 sites. Aquatic mosses are known to accumulate even metabolically nonessential or toxic metals in concentrations much higher than their aqueous environment due to their unique morphology and physiology. Thus, the capacity of metal amplification in four aquatic mosses (Fontinalis squamosa, Brachythecium rivulare, Platyhypnidium riparioides and Thamnobryum alopecurum) was also evaluated as a potential bioindicator/biomonitoring tool. Thirteen REEs (0.001-2.81 mu g L-1) and U were detected in the stream water. Mean content of lighter rare earth elements (LREEs) was higher than that of heavier rare earth elements (HREEs). Fourteen REEs and two actinides were detected in moss samples, including Yb and Th which were below detection level in water samples. LREE uptake (0.17-12.2 mg kg(-1)) was greater than HREE uptake (0.02-0.78 mg kg(-1)) in all mosses. Uptake of LREEs was observed in the order: B. rivulare > T. alopecurum > F. squamosa > P. riparioides and that of HREEs in the order: T. alopecurum > B. rivulare > F. squamosa > P. riparioides. Mean U content (0.68-1.62 mg kg(-1)) in the mosses was found in the order: B. rivulare > F. squamosa > T. alopecurum > P. riparioides. Th content ranged from 0.4 to 2.36 mg kg(-1) in the order: B. rivulare > T. alopecurum > P. riparioides > F. squamosa. One-way ANOVA indicated a statistically significant difference (P <= 0.01) in mean concentrations of all elements (individually) in moss samples except for U. Highest bioconcentration factors of six REEs each were observed in B. rivulare (La, Ce, Sm, Eu, Tb and Dy) and T. alopecurum (Nd, Gd, Ho, Er, Tm and Lu). The highest BCFs for Pr and U were obtained in F. squamosa and P. riparioides, respectively. These species hold promise for biomonitoring studies in the future.

J	Sewilam, H; Nacken, H; Breuer, R; Pyka, C				Sewilam, Hani; Nacken, Heribert; Breuer, Roman; Pyka, Christiane			Competence-based and game-based capacity development for sustainable water management in Germany	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Sustainable water management is one of humanity's most important challenges-today and in the future. Germany does not face a significant water shortage problem, but it has three main challenges: protection of water quality, ensuring public water supply and public wastewater disposal, and protecting the public and infrastructure from floods. Capacity development is a key issue to overcome the challenges of water resources in any country including Germany. Engineers, technicians, and mechanics need to upgrade their knowledge on a regular basis to deal with the complex management and rapid technological developments. In order to create efficient training schemes, the Vocational Training Working Group of Global Water Partnership (GWP), part of the GWP Capacity Development Task Force, has worked on the definition of fundamental job profiles for the Water and Sanitation Sector (WASS). To cover all technical functions of the industrial water cycle, it was necessary to identify around thirty occupations. Then, a competence-based training approach was adopted. Additionally, an assessment approach was also developed based on comparing the level of competence of the workers to a standard level of competence for each job. The RWTH Aachen University with its partners have developed another game based approach (SeCom2.0) based on serious gaming technology to enable water professionals dealing with flood risk management to be trained on different flood situations in a virtual environment. SeCom2.0 has three main components that are connected by a database layer. In addition to the serious games component, there is a collaboration component and a learning management system. For nearly 100 members from the flood competence centre (HochwasserKompetenzCentrum) in Cologne, Germany gave input to simulate the real flooding scenarios, and the learners will have to deal with a flood scenario by protecting the city in a given time and using a given resources and tools. This work concluded that both competence-based and game-based approaches could be significantly improved by blending both approaches. This will improve the process of training; for example, the competence-based approach can be enriched by using game- based simulation by introducing the trainees to a simulation of different technologies in water utilities. This can save resources and money and enrich the training. More importantly is modifying the game-based approach using the approach of competence-based to focus on specific competencies and to make use of the competence standards in its assessment component. The first section of this introduces and categorizes water challenges in Germany. In the second and third section, the two approaches are introduced in details. The competence-based approach is introduced to the WASS while the games-based to the flood risk management. Finally, a conclusion and recommendations are illustrated.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				FEB	2017	76	3							131	10.1007/s12665-017-6416-0								WOS:000394967300011

Four distinct DOM components were identified: two main components regarding terrestrial humic-like materials (C1 and C2), one about terrestrial fulvic/humic-like materials (C3), and one related to autochthonous tryptophanlike materials (C4). The dominance of terrestrial fluorescence materials in DOM indicated that terrestrial inputs have critical effects on the surveyed lakes. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Canonical Corresponding Analysis (CCA) were applied to analyze DOM components and their relationship with the environmental variables. PCA graphs showed that there were spatial differences in DOM fluorophores among lakes with various environments. Components C1, C2, and C4 were correlated positively with PC1 axis (factor 1), while C3 was opposite. Component C1 and C3 showed positive correlations with PC2 axis (factor 2). The CCA and Pearson correlation analysis showed that sediment DOC was correlated significantly with sediment variables (TN, OM, and conductivity), water quality variables (TN, PO43-, and Chl a), and DOM components C1 and C3. All DOM components were related significantly to different environment variables, including water quality variables especially nutrient elements (NO3-, TN, Chl a, and DOC) and sediment variables (OM, NH4+, and HCl-P). The relationship between DOC and the lake comprehensive nutritive index TLI was marginally significant.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				FEB	2017	76	4							142	10.1007/s12665-017-6427-x								WOS:000394965100004

Forest roads, their construction and logging activities can have various effects on streams and the groundwater. These are presented and analysed in this literature review which encompasses the current research and publications as well as the legal framework. Generally, two aspects can be highlighted: on the one hand, the impacts of erosion and sediment loads on water quality, and on the other hand, the influence on the flow regime, the stream network and the water budget. Recent studies show that these effects can be minimised if Best Management-Practices are considered. In general, very few studies that analyse the impacts of forestry operations on karst areas and on the groundwater can be found.																	1439-1783					FEB	2017	61	1					6	26		10.5675/HyWa_2017.1_1								WOS:000395806500002

Statistical Framework to Assess Water Quality for Irrigation and Drainage Canals	IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE												The rapid pace of economic growth in Egypt has been accompanied by resource depletion and environmental degradation. Consequently, management action and regular assessment to meet the challenges are essential. The aim of this work is to introduce a statistical framework to assess water quality for irrigation and drainage canals in accordance to monitoring objectives that deal with pollutant concentrations and loads. The water quality/quantity data collected from 2000 to 2013 for the El-Salam Canal and the Hadus Drain in Egypt were used as case studies. A framework that includes a series of statistical tools was employed to facilitate better handling of the collected data and then transform it into fruitful information. These tools included descriptive statistics, frequency/percentile analysis and presenting pollutant loads through boxplot analysis. Finally, hierarchical cluster analysis was employed to classify the monitoring locations into a number of groups that have similar water quality conditions. The success in applying the proposed framework to the El-Salam Canal and Hadus Drain data showed its effectiveness and applicability to check compliance with water quality standards and allocate waste loads from different sources as well as classifying water quality status.

These measures include a broad variety of actions, including using different types of vegetation intended to solve individual or groups of problems, e.g. improving water quality, protecting the soil from water and wind erosion, and increasing biodiversity. The factors on which the decision concerning the location where the biotechnical measures will be applied would be made mainly depend on the vulnerability of the drainage system. Estimation of the suitability of localities for biotechnical measures would include identifying key factors and appropriately evaluating them, using GIS technology for spatial analysis, and an objective determination of the weight criteria based on entropy. As a result of the process described, optimal locations for the application of biotechnical measures were obtained, and findings show that utilization of these measures in Vojvodina has a significant and positive potential in water management, agriculture and forestry in both ecological and economic senses.

Hydrological and environmental controls of the stream nitrate concentration and flux in a small agricultural watershed	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Nitrate exports from diffuse sources constitute a major cause of eutrophication and episodic acidification in inland aquatic systems, and remedial action requires the identification of the influencing factors associated with these nitrate exports. This paper examines the combined effects of watershed complexity on nitrate concentration and flux in terms of the hydrological and environmental factors in heterogeneous nested subwatersheds in the Danjiangkou Reservoir Area (DRA), China. We established 15 sampling sites in the main stream and tributaries and conducted biweekly sampling in 2008-2012 to monitor the nitrate exports. The hydrological and environmental indices within the watershed were divided into sub watersheds and considered as potential influencing factors. In consideration of the high co-linearity of these influencing factors, we used partial least squares regression (PLSR) to determine the associations between the stream nitrate concentration or flux and 26 selected watershed characteristics. The number of components was unequal for the nitrate concentration and flux models. The optimal models explained 66.4%, 60.0% and 59.9% of the variability in nitrate concentration and 74.7%, 67.1% and 58.0% of the variability in nitrate flux annually, in the dry season, and in the wet season, respectively. According to the variable importance in the projection (VIP) values, the dominant first-order factors for the nitrate concentration were as follows: the areal percentages of agricultural, forest and residential areas; followed by the slope; the largest patch index (LPI); the flow path gradient (FPG); the slope gradient variance (SGV); and the splitting index (SPLIT). In addition to these factors, the runoff coefficient (RC), flashiness index (FI), and patch density (PD) affected the changes in the nitrate flux. This study illustrates the influence of hydrological and environmental factors on seasonal water quality and can serve as guidelines for better watershed modeling and effective water quality management.

Infiltration capacity of roadside filter strips with non-uniform overland flow	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The side slope to a roadside swale (drainage ditch) constitutes a filter strip that has potential for infiltration of road runoff, thereby serving as a stormwater quantity and quality control mechanism. A total of thirty-two tests were performed during three seasons in four different highways located in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, MN to analyze the infiltration performance of roadside filter strips and the effect of fractional coverage of water on infiltration. Three different application rates were used in the experiments. All the tests showed that water flow on the lateral slope of a roadside swale is concentrated in fingers, instead of sheet flow, at the typical road runoff intensities for which infiltration practices are utilized to improve surface water quality. A linear relationship between flux of water from the road and fraction of wetted surface was observed, for the intensities tested. The average percentage infiltration of the medium road runoff rate (1.55 x 10(-4) m(2)/s, without direct rainfall) experiments performed in fall was 85% and in spring 70%. For the high road runoff rate (3.1 x 10(-4) m(2)/s, without direct rainfall) tests the average amount of water infiltrated was 47% and for the low road runoff rate (7.76 x 10(-5) m(2)/s, without direct rainfall) tests it was 69%, both set of tests performed in spring and summer. The saturated hydraulic conductivity of swale soil was high, relative to the values typical of laboratory permeameter measurements for these types of soils. This is believed to be due to the macropores generated by vegetation roots, activity of macrofauna (e.g. earthworms), and construction/maintenance procedures. The trend was to have more infiltration when the saturated hydraulic conductivity was higher and for a greater side slope length, as expected. The vegetation, type of soil and length of the side slope are important to consider for constructing and maintaining roadside swales that will be efficient as stormwater control measures. These measurements indicate that the filter strip portion of a roadside swale typically infiltrates a substantial fraction of road runoff. However, the measurements do not incorporate the influence of direct rainfall upon the infiltration into filter strips. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The Ray catchment in the upper Thames basin, UK, was extensively monitored using in-situ, high-resolution (15 min) flow and water quality instrumentation. Dissolved oxygen, ammonium, turbidity and specific conductivity are used to characterise the water quality dynamics. The impact of the Swindon sewage treatment works (SSTW) on water chemistry at the catchment outlet is considerable. Hydrological and water-quality response varies considerably during the events, with the rural catchments exhibiting a much slower hydrological response compared to urban areas. A simple hydrological model (TETIS) was developed to provide insight into water sources in nested subcatchments, highlighting the disparity of the hydrological dynamics across contrasting land-uses during events. The variation in stormwater runoff sources impacts water quality signals with urban sites contributing to dilution dynamics in ammonium, whereas the more rural site experiences a peak in ammonium during the same event. Dissolved oxygen concentrations vary on a rural-urban gradient and experience a notable sag at the Water Eaton outlet (4.4 mg/I) during the events, that would have resulted in significant ecological harm had they occurred during the summer in warmer temperatures. The water-quality legacy of these storms in the wider context of the hydrological year is somewhat negligible, with markedly poorer water quality signals being observed during the summer months of 2014. Although ammonium concentrations during the events are elevated (above the 'good' status threshold under the WFD), higher values are observed during spring and summer months. The high flows actually appear to flush contaminants out of the Ray and its subcatchments, though the urban sites demonstrate a resupply dynamic during interim dry periods. Data suggest winter storms following dry spells in urban catchments cause some short-lived and spatially extensive deteriorations in water quality. More chronic effects, although prolonged, are only seen downstream of SSTW. These are indicative of capacity of infrastructure being reached, and from the data do not appear to be severe enough to cause ecological harm. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Two SWAT models were created over two discrete time periods (1981-1990 and 2005-2014) for each watershed. National Land Cover Datasets 1992 and 2011 were, respectively, ingested into 1981-1990 and 2005-2014 models, along with corresponding weather data, to enable comparison of annual and seasonal runoff, soil water content, evapotranspiration (ET), water yield, and percolation between these two decades. Simulation results based on the calibrated models showed that surface runoff, soil water content, water yield, and percolation increased in all three watersheds. Elevated ET was also apparent, except in Skunk Creek watershed. Differences in annual water balance components appeared to follow changes in land use more closely than variation in precipitation amounts, although seasonal variation in precipitation was reflected in seasonal surface runoff. Subbasin-scale spatial analyses revealed noticeable increases in water balance components mostly in downstream parts of Bad River and Skunk Creek watersheds, and the western part of Upper Big Sioux River watershed. Results presented in this study provide some insight into recent changes in hydrological processes in South Dakota watersheds.

J	Radcliffe, DE; Mukundan, R				Radcliffe, D. E.; Mukundan, R.			PRISM vs. CFSR Precipitation Data Effects on Calibration and Validation of SWAT Models	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Precipitation is one of the most important drivers in watershed models. Our objective was to compare two sources of interpolated precipitation data in terms of their effect on calibration and validation of two Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) models. One model was a suburban watershed in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia. The precipitation sources were Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) data on a 4-km grid and climate forecast system reanalysis (CFSR) data on a 38-km grid. The PRISM data resulted in a better fit to the calibration data (Nash Sutcliffe efficiency [NSE]=0.64, Kling-Gupta efficiency [KGE]=0.74, p-factor=0.84, and r-factor=0.43) than the CFSR data (NSE=0.47, KGE=0.53, p-factor=0.67, and r-factor=0.39). Validation results were similar. Sensitive parameters were similar in both the PRISM and CFSR models, but fitted values indicated more rapid groundwater flow to the streams with the PRISM data. The same comparison was made in the Big Creek watershed located approximately 1,000km away, in central Louisiana. Results were similar with a more responsive groundwater system indicating PRISM data may produce better predictions of streamflow because of a more accurate estimate of rainfall within a watershed or because of a denser grid. Our study implies PRISM is providing a better estimate than CFSR of precipitation within a watershed when rain gauge data are not available, resulting in more accurate simulations of streamflows at the watershed outlet.

The objectives of this study were to (1) test the modified streambank erosion and instream P routines for the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model in the Barren Fork Creek watershed in northeast Oklahoma, (2) predict P in the watershed with and without streambank-derived P, and (3) determine the significance of streambank erosion P relative to overland P sources. Measured streambank and channel parameters were incorporated into a flow-calibrated SWAT model and used to estimate streambank erosion and P for the Barren Fork Creek using modified streambank erosion and instream P routines. The predicted reach-weighted streambank erosion was 40kg/m vs. the measured 42kg/m. Streambank erosion contributed 47% of the total P to the Barren Fork Creek and improved P predictions compared to observed data, especially during the high-flow events. Of the total P entering the stream system, approximately 65% was removed via the watershed outlet and 35% was stored in the floodplain and stream system. This study successfully applied the SWAT model's modified streambank erosion and instream P routines and demonstrated that streambank-derived P can improve P modeling at the watershed scale.

It is expected to improve code development and maintenance; support data availability, analysis, and visualization; and enhance the model's capabilities in terms of the spatial representation of elements and processes within watersheds. The most important change is the implementation of landscape units and flow and pollutant routing across the landscape. Also, SWAT+ offers more flexibility than SWAT in defining management schedules, routing constituents, and connecting managed flow systems to the natural stream network. To test the basic hydrologic function of SWAT+, it was applied to the Little River Experimental Watershed (Georgia) without enhanced overland routing and compared with previous models. SWAT+ gave similar results and inaccuracies as these models did for streamflow and water balance. Taking full advantage of the new capabilities of SWAT+ regarding watershed discretization and landscape and river interactions is expected to improve simulations in future studies. While many capabilities of SWAT have already been enhanced in SWAT+ and new capabilities have been added, the model will continue to evolve in response to advancements in scientific knowledge and the demands of the growing worldwide user community.

Estimation of Catchment Nutrient Loads in New Zealand Using Monthly Water Quality Monitoring Data	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Causes of variation between loads estimated using alternative calculation methods and their repeatability were investigated using 20years of daily flow and monthly concentration samples for 77 rivers in New Zealand. Loads of dissolved and total nitrogen and phosphorus were calculated using the Ratio, L5, and L7 methods. Estimates of loads and their precision associated with short-term records of 5, 10, and 15years were simulated by subsampling. The representativeness of the short-term loads was quantified as the standard deviation of the 20 realizations. The L7 method generally produced more realistic loads with the highest precision and representativeness. Differences between load estimates were shown to be associated with poor agreement between the data and the underlying model. The best method was shown to depend on the match between the model and functional and distributional characteristics of the data, rather than on the contaminant. Short-term load estimates poorly represented the long-term load estimate, and deviations frequently exceeded estimated imprecision. The results highlight there is no single preferred load calculation method, the inadvisability of unsupervised load estimation and the importance of inspecting concentration-flow, unit load-flow plots and regression residuals. Regulatory authorities should be aware that the precision of loads estimated from monthly data are likely to be optimistic with respect to the actual repeatability of load estimates.																	1093-474X	1752-1688				FEB	2017	53	1					158	178		10.1111/1752-1688.12492								WOS:000394779000013

Numerical and Qualitative Contrasts of Two Statistical Models for Water Quality Change in Tidal Waters	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Two statistical approaches, weighted regression on time, discharge, and season and generalized additive models, have recently been used to evaluate water quality trends in estuaries. Both models have been used in similar contexts despite differences in statistical foundations and products. This study provided an empirical and qualitative comparison of both models using 29years of data for two discrete time series of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) in the Patuxent River estuary. Empirical descriptions of each model were based on predictive performance against the observed data, ability to reproduce flow-normalized trends with simulated data, and comparisons of performance with validation datasets. Between-model differences were apparent but minor and both models had comparable abilities to remove flow effects from simulated time series. Both models similarly predicted observations for missing data with different characteristics. Trends from each model revealed distinct mainstem influences of the Chesapeake Bay with both models predicting a roughly 65% increase in chl-a over time in the lower estuary, whereas flow-normalized predictions for the upper estuary showed a more dynamic pattern, with a nearly 100% increase in chl-a in the last 10years. Qualitative comparisons highlighted important differences in the statistical structure, available products, and characteristics of the data and desired analysis.

Multi-Year Microbial Source Tracking Study Characterizing Fecal Contamination in an Urban Watershed	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												Microbiological and hydrological data were used to rank tributary stream contributions of bacteria to the Little Blue River in Independence, Missouri. Concentrations, loadings and yields of E. coli and microbial source tracking (MST) markers, were characterized during base flow and storm events in five subbasins within Independence, as well as sources entering and leaving the city through the river. The E. coli water quality threshold was exceeded in 29% of base-flow and 89% of storm-event samples. The total contribution of E. coli and MST markers from tributaries within Independence to the Little Blue River, regardless of streamflow, did not significantly increase the median concentrations leaving the city. Daily loads and yields of E. coli and MST markers were used to rank the subbasins according to their contribution of each constituent to the river. The ranking methodology used in this study may prove useful in prioritizing remediation in the different subbasins.

Chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC), and fluorescence spectroscopy are also capable of quantifying organic content, although the mechanisms of quantification and the organic fractions targeted differ for each test. This study explores correlations between BOD5 and these alternate test procedures using facility influent, primary effluent, and facility effluent samples from a full-scale water resource recovery facility. Relative reductions of the water quality parameters proved to be strong indicators of their suitability as surrogates for BOD5. Suitable correlations were generally limited to the combined datasets for the three sampling locations or the facility effluent alone. COD exhibited relatively strong linear correlations with BOD5 when considering the three sample points (r = 0.985) and the facility effluent alone (r = 0.914), while TOC exhibited a suitable linear correlation with BOD5 in the facility effluent (r = 0.902). Exponential regressions proved to be useful for estimating BOD5 based on TOC or fluorescence (r > 0.95).																	1061-4303	1554-7531				FEB 1	2017	89	2					168	177		10.2175/106143016X14504669768976								WOS:000397280800007	27074790

The groundwater is used mainly for drinking, agriculture and industry. The study also discusses the issue of the industrial untreated wastewater discharge to the Plain aquifer that is a high Ca-Cl water type with TDS value of about 150 g/L. The hydrogeochemical study is conducted by collecting and analyzing the groundwater samples from July and September of 2013. The studied system contains three major groundwater types, namely Ca-Mg-HCO3, Na-Cl, and non-dominant water, based on the analysis of the major ions. The main processes contributing to chemical compositions in the groundwater are the dissolution along the flow path, dedolomitisation, ion exchange reactions, and the mixing with wastewater. According to the computed water quality index (WQI) ranging from 25.45 to 194.35, the groundwater in the plain can be categorized into "excellent water", "good water", and "poor water". There is a resemblance between the spatial distribution of the WQI and hydrochemical water types in the Piper diagram. The "excellent" quality water broadly coincides with the Ca-Mg-HCO3 water type. The "poor" water matches with the Na-Cl water type, and the "good" quality water coincides with blended water. The results indicate that this aquifer suffers from intense human activities which are forcing the aquifer into a critical condition.																	0920-4741	1573-1650				FEB	2017	31	3					765	780		10.1007/s11269-016-1390-y								WOS:000395000500003						
J	Shi, W; Xia, J				Shi, Wei; Xia, Jun			Combined risk assessment of nonstationary monthly water quality based on Markov chain and time-varying copula	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Water quality risk management is a global hot research linkage with the sustainable water resource development. Ammonium nitrogen (NH3-N) and permanganate index (CODMn) as the focus indicators in Huai River Basin, are selected to reveal their joint transition laws based on Markov theory. The time-varying moments model with either time or land cover index as explanatory variables is applied to build the time-varying marginal distributions of water quality time series. Time-varying copula model, which takes the non-stationarity in the marginal distribution and/or the time variation in dependence structure between water quality series into consideration, is constructed to describe a bivariate frequency analysis for NH3-N and CODMn series at the same monitoring gauge. The larger first-order Markov joint transition probability indicates water quality state Class V-w, Class IV and Class III will occur easily in the water body of Bengbu Sluice. Both marginal distribution and copula models are nonstationary, and the explanatory variable time yields better performance than land cover index in describing the non-stationarities in the marginal distributions. In modelling the dependence structure changes, time-varying copula has a better fitting performance than the copula with the constant or the time-trend dependence parameter. The largest synchronous encounter risk probability of NH3-N and CODMn simultaneously reaching Class V is 50.61%, while the asynchronous encounter risk probability is largest when NH3-N and CODMn is inferior to class V and class IV water quality standards, respectively.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				FEB	2017	75	3					693	704		10.2166/wst.2016.553								WOS:000394350100021	28192363

Therefore, a combination of principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of a data set and artificial neural networks (ANNs) for forecasting purposes was used. The results obtained were compared with those obtained by using discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The proposed methodology was applied to four absorbance time series data sets composed by a total number of 5705 UV-Vis spectra. Absolute percentage errors obtained by applying the proposed PCA/ANN methodology vary between 10% and 13% for all four study sites. In general terms, the results obtained were hardly generalizable, as they appeared to be highly dependent on specific dynamics of the water system; however, some trends can be outlined. PCA/ANN methodology gives better results than PCA/DFT forecasting procedure by using a specific spectra range for the following conditions: (i) for Salitre wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) (first hour) and Graz West R05 (first 18 min), from the last part of UV range to all visible range; (ii) for Gibraltar pumping station (first 6 min) for all UV-Vis absorbance spectra; and (iii) for San Fernando WWTP (first 24 min) for all of UV range to middle part of visible range.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				FEB	2017	75	4					765	774		10.2166/wst.2016.524								WOS:000395820000002	28234277

Performance evaluation of 388 full-scale waste stabilization pond systems with seven different configurations	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Waste stabilization ponds (WSPs) and their variants are one the most widely used wastewater treatment systems in the world. However, the scarcity of systematic performance data from fullscale plants has led to challenges associated with their design. The objective of this research was to assess the performance of 388 full-scale WSP systems located in Brazil, Ecuador, Bolivia and the United States through the statistical analysis of available monitoring data. Descriptive statistics were calculated of the influent and effluent concentrations and the removal efficiencies for 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), total suspended solids (TSS), ammonia nitrogen (N-Ammonia), and either thermotolerant coliforms (TTC) or Escherichia coli for each WSP system, leading to a broad characterization of actual treatment performance. Compliance with different water quality and system performance goals was also evaluated. The treatment plants were subdivided into seven different categories, according to their units and flowsheet. The median influent concentrations of BOD5 and TSS were 431 mg/L and 397 mg/L and the effluent concentrations varied from technology to technology, but median values were 50 mg/L and 47 mg/L, respectively. The median removal efficiencies were 85% for BOD5 and 75% for TSS. The overall removals of TTC and E. coli were 1.74 and 1.63 log10 units, respectively. Future research is needed to better understand the influence of design, operational and environmental factors on WSP system performance.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				FEB	2017	75	4					916	927		10.2166/wst.2016.532								WOS:000395820000017	28234292

This study investigated the use of information on ionic composition as a fingerprint to identify the source land-use of stormwater runoff. We used 12 ionic species in stormwater runoff monitored for a total of 20 storm events at five sites with different land-use compositions during the 2012-2014 wet seasons. A stepwise forward discriminant function analysis (DFA) with the jack-knifed cross validation approach was used to select ionic species that better discriminate the land-use of its source. Of the 12 ionic species, 9 species (K+, Mg2+, Na+, NH4+, Br-, Cl-, F-, NO2-, and SO42-) were selected for better performance of the DFA. The DFA successfully differentiated stormwater samples from urban, rural, and construction sites using concentrations of the ionic species (70%, 95%, and 91% of correct classification, respectively). Over 80% of the new data cases were correctly classified by the trained DFA model. When applied to data cases from a mixed land-use catchment and downstream, the DFA model showed the greater impact of urban areas and rural areas respectively in the earlier and later parts of a storm event.

Evaluation of leached metals in recovered aluminum coagulants from water treatment slurry	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The water treatment industry consumes large quantities of coagulant and produces huge amounts of slurry. The cost of alum used in water treatment, stringent regulations and negative impacts of sludge disposal are the motive to do integrated research studies on the technical feasibility of aluminum coagulant recovery from sludge using acidification. This work studied the leaching of iron, manganese, and chromium as the most extracted metals with aluminum during sludge acidification; furthermore, these metals have a great impact on the recovered coagulants' efficiency and treated water quality. The sludge used was collected from El-Sheikh Zayd water treatment plant in Egypt, then dried and ground; afterward, the effect of acid concentration, sludge mass, temperature, mixing speed and mixing time was studied. In addition, it was noticeable that the efficiency of sulfuric acid in leaching iron, manganese and chromium is higher than that of hydrochloric acid. Also, higher leaching for the three metals was obtained in all the experiments using higher acid concentration, elevated temperature, and rotational speed. Finally, the leached metals in recovered aluminum coagulants will not limit its application to water and wastewater treatment, as their concentrations are still very low if compared with aluminum, even with the highest leaching efficiency.

In this research, three techniques, multilayer perceptron (MLP), adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and generalized regression neural network (GRNN), are applied to determine the coagulant dosage at Bansong drinking WTP. Each model is developed based on 8,760 historical data sets with hourly resolution for a whole year. Several statistical properties are determined to obtain the best-fit model from each method. The top performing models of each method are evaluated by external validation indices and absolute relative error according to nine turbidity zones. From the result, MLP and ANFIS models meet all conditions of validation indices, but GRNN cannot. The MLP shows the best result for high turbidity zones over 20 NTU as well as for overall performance. Meanwhile, ANFIS provides consistent results and better performance than MLP for low turbidity zones which have higher disorder of coagulant dosage data. The GRNN shows high accuracy for the highest turbidity zone which occurs during the rainy season. It is concluded that MLP, ANFIS, and GRNN can support operators effectively for real-time determination of coagulant dosage.																	0003-7214	1365-2087				FEB	2017	66	1					49	61		10.2166/aqua.2016.022								WOS:000396920500005

Intra-seasonal and inter-seasonal changes in endorheic and floodplain pans in relation to limnology, size, hydroperiod, and river connectivity were studied over two rainfall seasons across 36 pans at the Save Valley Conservancy. In the study region, floodplain pans were identified as pans that had connectivity with the Save River, while the endorheic pans (large and small) were hydrologically isolated basins. Seasonal trends for physicochemical variables were initial low and gradual increased for both rainfall seasons. Significant interseasonal differences for several physico-chemical variables were observed. No significant differences in physico-chemical variables were observed between large and small endorheic pans, with the except for vegetation cover, which was higher in large pans. Floodplain pans differed from the endorheic systems in pH, conductivity, nutrients and suspended solids. Connectivity was found to be insignificant, as connections between these systems were probably too infrequent. Seasonal pans were uniquely distinguished by their morphometric, physico-chemical and hydrological characteristics. Inevitably, they are vulnerable to climate change with the extent of their resilience currently unknown. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the sources of water used by this growing packaged water industry and the implications for water resource management and transport-related environmental impacts have not been described. This study aimed to assess the spatial distribution of regulated packaged water production in Ghana, both in relation to demand for natural mineral water and hydrogeological characteristics. A total of 764 addresses for premises licensed to produce packaged water from 2009 to 2015 were mapped and compared to regional sachet water consumption and examined beverage import/export data. We found evidence to suggest that packaged water is transported shorter distances in Ghana than in developed countries. Groundwater abstraction for packaged water is low relative to piped water production and domestic borehole abstraction nationally, but may be locally significant. For natural mineral water, producers should be able to address the most widespread water quality hazards (including high salinity, iron and nitrates) in aquifers used for production through reverse osmosis treatment. In future, packaged water producer surveys could be used to quantify unregulated production, volumes of piped versus groundwater abstracted and treatment processes used.

Changes in climate result in changes in streamflow and rising water temperatures, which impact biochemical reaction rates and increase stratification in lakes and reservoirs. Using two water quality modeling systems (the Hydrologic and Water Quality System; HAWQS and US Basins), five climate models, and two greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation policies, we assess future water quality in the continental U.S. to 2100 considering four water quality parameters: water temperature, dissolved oxygen, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus. Once these parameters are aggregated into a water quality index, we find that, while the water quality models differ under the baseline, there is more agreement between future projections. In addition, we find that the difference in national-scale economic benefits across climate models is generally larger than the difference between the two water quality models. Both water quality models find that water quality will more likely worsen in the East than in the West. Under the business-as-usual emissions scenario, we find that climate change is likely to cause economic impacts ranging from 1.2 to 2.3 (2005 billion USD/year) in 2050 and 2.7 to 4.8 in 2090 across all climate and water quality models.

Stormwater discharge into water bodies significantly contributes to environmental pollution. The choice of suitable treatment technologies is dependent on the pollutant concentrations. Wastewater quality indicators such as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solids (TSS), and total dissolved solids (TDS) give a measure of the main pollutants. The aim of this study is to provide an indirect methodology for the estimation of the main wastewater quality indicators, based on some characteristics of the drainage basin. The catchment is seen as a black box: the physical processes of accumulation, washing, and transport of pollutants are not mathematically described.Two models deriving from studies on artificial intelligence have been used in this research: Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Regression Trees (RT). Both the models showed robustness, reliability, and high generalization capability. However, with reference to coefficient of determination R-2 and root-mean square error, Support Vector Regression showed a better performance than Regression Tree in predicting TSS, TDS, and COD. As regards BOD5, the two models showed a comparable performance.

In order to decrease clogging and increase system capacity, OCWD is testing the ability of riverbed filtration to reduce suspended solids concentrations and improve recharge rates. Riverbed filtration is achieved through a shallow subsurface collector system placed approximately one meter below the surface. Filtered water from the collector system is conveyed by gravity to the receiving recharge basin. Initial results show that riverbed filtration is highly effective in removing suspended solids in the recharge water, which in turn also greatly increases the recharge capacity of the receiving basin. Some other water quality benefits are also achieved. Data collected thus far indicate that it will be cost-effective to use this approach at a larger scale to capture and recharge increased quantities of storm flow obtained from the Santa Ana River.

J	Jeppesen, E; Sondergaard, M; Liu, ZW				Jeppesen, Erik; Sondergaard, Martin; Liu, Zhengwen			Lake Restoration and Management in a Climate Change Perspective: An Introduction	WATER												Lakes all around the globe are under severe pressure due to an increasing anthropogenic impact from a growing population in a more developed world. Accordingly, today, many lakes are highly eutrophic and suffer from severe blooms of often toxic cyanobacteria and may become even more eutrophic in the future unless strong lake management actions are taken. Recent research has further shown that global warming and subsequent changes in water use will further exacerbate the eutrophication process in lakes. There is therefore a growing demand for lake restoration and insight into sustainable lake management. The measures to be taken, however, depend on the climate and other local conditions. This special issue addresses lake restoration and management with special emphasis on the restoration of eutrophicated lakes within a climate change perspective. The papers included collectively highlight that the ongoing climate change affects lake water quality by (1) changes in external and internal nutrient loading; (2) higher frequency of extreme events (such as hurricanes); (3) temperature-induced changes in biota, biotic interactions; and (4) water level. Lower nutrient loading is therefore needed in a future warmer world to achieve the same ecological state as today. Several papers discuss lake restoration methods within a climate change perspective and show practical results, notably of various attempts of biomanipulation. Finally, some papers discuss the effects of other anthropogenic stressors and their interaction with climate.																	2073-4441					FEB	2017	9	2							122	10.3390/w9020122								WOS:000395435800052

A typical MAR procedure consists of the infiltration of surface water into a Quaternary glaciofluvial esker with subsequent withdrawal of the MAR treated water from wells a few hundred meters downstream. The infiltrated water should have a residence time of at least approximately one month before withdrawal to provide sufficient time for the subsurface processes needed to break down or remove humic substances. Most of the Finnish MAR plants do not have pretreatment and raw water is infiltrated directly into the soil. The objectives of this paper are to present MAR experiences and to discuss the need for and choice of pretreatment. Data from basin, sprinkling, and well infiltration processes are presented. Total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations of the raw waters presented here varied from 6.5 to 11 mg/L and after MAR the TOC concentrations of the abstracted waters were approximately 2 mg/L. The overall reduction of organic matter in the treatment (with or without pretreatment) was 70%-85%. Mechanical pretreatment can be used for clogging prevention. Turbidity of the Finnish lakes used as raw water does not necessitate pretreatment in basin and sprinkling infiltration, however, pretreatment in well infiltration needs to be judged separately. River waters may have high turbidity requiring pretreatment. Biodegradation of NOM in the saturated groundwater zone consumes dissolved oxygen. Thus, a high NOM concentration may create conditions for dissolution of iron and manganese from the soil. These conditions may be avoided by the addition of chemical pretreatment. Raw waters with TOC content up to at least approximately 8 mg/L were infiltrated without any considerations of chemical pretreatment, which should be evaluated based on local conditions.																	2073-4441					FEB	2017	9	2							138	10.3390/w9020138								WOS:000395435800068						
J	Naranjo-Gil, D				Naranjo-Gil, David			Accomplishing Water Strategy Policies in Hospitals: The Role of Management Information Systems and Managerial Styles	WATER												Hospitals are using more sophisticated and comprehensive management information systems to implement multiple strategic policies towards water cost saving and water quality enhancement. However, they do not always achieve the intended strategic goals. This paper analyzes how managerial styles interact with sophisticated management information systems to achieve different water strategic priorities. How proactive vs. reactive managerial styles moderate the effects of management information systems on water cost saving and water quality enhancement is analyzed. Relationships are explored using data collected from 122 general services directors in Spanish public hospitals. The findings show a positive effect of sophisticated management information systems on the achievement of water policies focused on cost saving and quality enhancement. Results also show a different moderated effect of managerial styles; thus, sophisticated management information systems with a proactive managerial style facilitate managers to achieve better water quality policies rather than water cost saving policies.																	2073-4441					FEB	2017	9	2							UNSP 107	10.3390/w9020107								WOS:000395435800037						
J	Rosen, T; Christianson, L				Rosen, Timothy; Christianson, Laura			Performance of Denitrifying Bioreactors at Reducing Agricultural Nitrogen Pollution in a Humid Subtropical Coastal Plain Climate	WATER												Denitrifying bioreactors are an agricultural best management practice developed in the midwestern United States to treat agricultural drainage water enriched with nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N). The practice is spreading rapidly to agricultural regions with poor water quality due to nutrient enrichment. This makes it imperative to track bioreactor NO3-N reduction efficiency as this practice gets deployed to new regions. This study evaluated the application and performance of denitrifying bioreactors in the humid subtropical coastal plain environment of the Chesapeake Bay catchment to provide data about regionally specific NO3-N reduction efficiencies. NO3-N samples were taken before and after treatment at three denitrifying bioreactors, in addition to other nutrients (orthophosphate-phosphorus, PO4-P; ammonium-nitrogen, NH4-N; total nitrogen, TN; total phosphorus, TP) and water quality parameters (dissolved oxygen, DO; oxidation reduction potential, ORP; pH; specific conductance, SPC). Total removal ranged drastically between bioreactors from 10 to 133 kg N, with removal efficiencies of 9.0% to 62% and N removal rates of 0.21 to 5.36 g N removed per m(3) of bioreactor per day. As the first bioreactor study in the humid subtropical coastal plain, this data provides positive proof of concept that denitrifying bioreactor is another tool for reducing N loads in agricultural tile drainage in this region.																	2073-4441					FEB	2017	9	2							112	10.3390/w9020112								WOS:000395435800042						
J	Terry, JA; Sadeghian, A; Lindenschmidt, KE				Terry, Julie A.; Sadeghian, Amir; Lindenschmidt, Karl-Erich			Modelling Dissolved Oxygen/Sediment Oxygen Demand under Ice in a Shallow Eutrophic Prairie Reservoir	WATER												Dissolved oxygen is an influential factor of aquatic ecosystem health. Future predictions of oxygen deficits are paramount for maintaining water quality. Oxygen demands depend greatly on a waterbody's attributes. A large sediment-water interface relative to volume means sediment oxygen demand has greater influence in shallow systems. In shallow, ice-covered waterbodies the potential for winter anoxia is high. Water quality models offer two options for modelling sediment oxygen demand: a zero-order constant rate, or a sediment diagenesis model. The constant rate is unrepresentative of a real system, yet a diagenesis model is difficult to parameterise and calibrate without data. We use the water quality model CE-QUAL-W2 to increase the complexity of a zero-order sediment compartment with limited data. We model summer and winter conditions individually to capture decay rates under-ice. Using a semi-automated calibration method, we find an annual pattern in sediment oxygen demand that follows the trend of chlorophyll-a concentrations in a shallow, eutrophic Prairie reservoir. We use chlorophyll-a as a proxy for estimation of summer oxygen demand and winter decay. We show that winter sediment oxygen demand is dependent on the previous summer's maximum chlorophyll-a concentrations.

The main objective of the present paper is to estimate the total NO3 flux to coastal water bodies due to groundwater discharge in the volcanic Azores archipelago (Portugal). Therefore, 78 springs discharging from perched-water bodies have been monitored since 2003, corresponding to cold (mean = 14.9 degrees C) and low mineralized (47.2-583 mu S/cm) groundwater from the sodium-bicarbonate to sodium-chloride water types. A set of 36 wells was also monitored, presenting groundwater with a higher mineralization. The nitrate content in springs range between 0.02 and 37.4 mg/L, and the most enriched samples are associated to the impact of agricultural activities. The total groundwater NO3 flux to the ocean is estimated in the range of 5.23 x 10(3) to 190.6 x 10(3) mol/km(2)/a (Sigma = similar to 523 x 10(3) mol/km(2)/a), exceeding the total flux associated to surface runoff (Sigma = similar to 281 x 10(3) mol/km(2)/a). In the majority of the islands, the estimated fluxes are higher than runoff fluxes, with the exception of Pico (47.2%), Corvo (46%) and Faial (7.2%). The total N-NO3 flux estimated in the Azores (similar to 118.9 x 10(3) mol/km(2)/a) is in the lower range of estimates made in other volcanic islands.

This article presents results of studies on three granular mixtures were used for remediation of lead (Pb2+) contaminated groundwater using PRBs. The mixtures were composed of pumice, perlite and lime in different proportions. Several column experiments were conducted for evaluation of performance of the mixtures for lead removal. The experiments were carried out for over 50 days to evaluate the long-term performance of the PRBs. It was found out that pumice-perlite mixture with a weight proportion of 1 : 1 and pumice-lime perlite mixture with a weight proportion of 2 : 2 : 1 can be used as effective reactive media for lead removal. The removal efficiency of the proposed mixtures was 99.9%. The permeability of the reactive media was relatively constant over 53 days continuous experiments and the results demonstrated that the mentioned mixtures have acceptable performance to maintain hydraulic conductivity of PRBs.

Use of Viability-Based Methods for Improved Detection of Recent Fecal Contamination in a Microbial Source Tracking Study Near Tijuana, Mexico	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Current microbial source tracking methods heavily rely on the use of quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays to differentiate human and non-human sources of fecal contamination. However, traditional qPCR measures DNA from viable, viable but not culturable (VBNC), and dead cells, which may confound the use of this technique for detecting recent fecal contamination from waters receiving treated sewage effluent. In this study, fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), six host-associated markers, and two viability-based methods for rapid detection and assessment of fecal contamination were used in a microbial source tracking study to identify sources impairing water quality and sediments within the San Antonio de los Buenos watershed in Tijuana, Mexico. Horse- and gull-associated markers were detected in 4 and 8% of samples tested, respectively. The human-and dog-associated markers were positive in 74 and 63% of watershed samples and 92 and 75% of storm drain samples, respectively. Propidium monoazide (PMA) successfully inhibited amplification of DNA from dead cells in environmental creek waters that receive large volumes of treated waste-water effluent. Accordingly, PMA-qPCR measurements were more comparable to measurements made by culture-based methods (IDEXX). The covalently linked immunomagnetic separation/adenosine triphosphate (Cov-IMS/ATP) method showed a strong linear relationship to culture methods when compared to measurements made by the qPCR Entero1a assay. Both the PMA-qPCR and the Cov-IMS/ATP methods show promise for improved assessment of water quality and recent fecal contamination in sewage impacted waters, including areas receiving discharge from wastewater treatment plants, where measurement by qPCR does not effectively differentiate between DNA from live and dead cells. This study serves as an important positive control for non-point source pollution studies.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				FEB	2017	228	2							63	10.1007/s11270-016-3204-5								WOS:000394351400011

Baseline Monitoring of Mercury Levels in Environmental Matrices in the Limpopo Province	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Mercury (Hg) speciation and bioavailability were studied in surface water, surface sediment and freshwater fish samples collected upstream and downstream of the Medupi (currently under construction) and Matimba power stations in the Waterberg area, Limpopo Province. The initial survey was conducted in May 2010 and continued periodically/seasonally until October 2014. This study was designed to provide an overall description of the levels of Hg in areas potentially impacted by emissions from the coal-fired power station and provide the necessary information to enhance the understanding of the factors regulating the fate and transport of Hg in the environment. Percent loss on ignition (LOI) and ancillary water quality measurements were also carried out. In this study, the total mercury (TotHg) concentrations ranged between 0.92 and 29.13 ng/L, and 0.13 and 8.00 ng/L for methylmercury (MeHg) in water. Total Hg concentrations ranged between 0.50 and 28.60 ng/g, while the MeHg concentration ranged between 0.08 and 2.22 ng/g in sediments. Mercury concentrations in fish ranged between 40 and 1200 ng/g for TotHg, and 13.42 and 600 ng/g for MeHg. Methylmercury concentrations in freshwater fish sampled exceeded the United States Environmental Protection Agency criteria (300 ng/g) in 10% of the total fish sampled and 5% exceeded the WHO guideline (500 ng/g).																	0049-6979	1573-2932				FEB	2017	228	2							57	10.1007/s11270-016-3230-3								WOS:000394351400005

In this study, decomposition of emergent aquatic plant (cattail) litter was investigated under different conditions to determine the influencing level of the decomposition process on the water quality. Different litter addition rates (0.1, 0.5, 1.0 g L-1), temperature changes, sediment additions, and kinestates (static and dynamic conditions) were selected as the influencing factors for the decomposition process. The results suggested that the decomposition process could be all accelerated when conducted at a higher litter addition rate, under a cold condition, with sediment addition or on dynamic condition, respectively. Additionally, the maximum ratio of releasing carbon to nitrogen (C/N) was increased when the decomposition process was conducted with a higher litter addition rate, under a cold condition (31.0), with sediment addition (24.6) and on a dynamic condition (28.0), respectively, and the C/N ratios were all higher than that with only 0.5 g L-1 litter addition (24.5), suggesting that lowering of water temperature, sediment addition, and increasing of oxygen might also enhance the C/N. The high C/N released during the decomposition process implied that the cattail litter might be utilized as the potential organic carbon source for nitrogen removal in the CW system.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				FEB	2017	228	2							70	10.1007/s11270-017-3257-0								WOS:000394351400018						
J	Pierce, G; Gonzalez, S				Pierce, Gregory; Gonzalez, Silvia			Mistrust at the tap? Factors contributing to public drinking water (mis) perception across US households	WATER POLICY												How individuals perceive the safety of their public drinking water influences whether they reach for the tap to quench their thirst, or an alternative such as bottled water or a sugary drink. In turn, mistrust of drinking water quality and subsequent reliance on alternative beverage sources can adversely impact health, welfare and the environment. Using data from the 2013 American Housing Survey, we provide the first national, rigorous assessment of individuals' perception of their public drinking water supply. We found strong evidence that perception of water quality is most influenced by individual and household indicators of socioeconomic status-education level, household income, racial or ethnic minority status, and most importantly foreign-born nativity, especially from Latin America. By contrast, our findings provide little indication that perception is tied to known built environment or neighborhood risk factors affecting water safety and quality. We outline the implications of our findings for proponents of enhanced tap water consumption, including public drinking water systems, county public health agencies, and particularly for environmental justice non-profits.																	1366-7017					FEB	2017	19	1					1	12		10.2166/wp.2016.143								WOS:000394341200001

Modeling anthropogenic boron in groundwater flow and discharge at Volusia Blue Spring (Florida, USA)	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Volusia Blue Spring (VBS) is the largest spring along the St. Johns River in Florida (USA) and the spring pool is refuge for hundreds of manatees during winter months. However, the water quality of the spring flow has been degraded due to urbanization in the past few decades. A three-dimensional contaminant fate and transport model, utilizing MODFLOW-2000 and MT3DMS, was developed to simulate boron transport in the Upper Florida Aquifer, which sustains the VBS spring discharge. The VBS model relied on information and data related to natural water features, rainfall, land use, water use, treated wastewater discharge, septic tank effluent flows, and fertilizers as inputs to simulate boron transport. The model was calibrated against field-observed water levels, spring discharge, and analysis of boron in water samples. The calibrated VBS model yielded a root-mean-square-error value of 1.8 m for the head and 17.7 mu g/L for boron concentrations within the springshed. Model results show that anthropogenic boron from surrounding urbanized areas contributes to the boron found at Volusia Blue Spring.

J	Roberts, PJW; Villegas, B				Roberts, Philip J. W.; Villegas, Beatriz			Modeling and Design of the Buenos Aires Outfalls	JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING												Field studies, modeling, and the design of two major outfalls to discharge domestic wastewater from Buenos Aires, Argentina, into the Rio de la Plata are described. Extensive data were gathered from current profilers, Lagrangian drifters, meteorological stations, and water column profiling. The river is essentially freshwater and is the main water source for the city; it is tidally dominated, shallow, and well-mixed vertically. The data were used to develop a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model of the river that closely simulated its major features. The wastewater disposal strategy and special design and modeling considerations of the outfalls and diffusers are discussed. The tidal currents will recirculate the wastewater back and forth over the diffuser several times before it is flushed away by the mean river flow. Because of the shallow water and low flushing currents, it is not possible to achieve the high near-field dilutions typical of deep-water marine outfalls, and other design constraints include the proximity to water intakes. Lagrangian particle-tracking modeling approaches were used to predict the fate and transport of the effluent and its dilution. The models reproduce near-field mixing at moderate to high current speeds and also reentrainment due to the reversing tide without the need for special model coupling. However, dilutions at low current speeds were corrected to account for the jet momentum and reentrainment. The near-field jet modeling to determine the riser and port designs is discussed. Bacterial impacts decreased rapidly with distance from the diffuser and no impacts on the shoreline or water intakes were predicted. The effects of sudestadas were also modeled and it was concluded that they will not significantly affect water quality for the proposed outfalls.																	0733-9429	1943-7900				FEB	2017	143	2								10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0001244								WOS:000394256200007

In the present study, 29 groundwater samples were collected and analyzed for physico-chemical parameters to determine the hydrochemical characteristics, groundwater quality, and human health risk in the study area. The dominant ions are Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO32-, and SO42. According to Gibbs plot, the predominant samples fall in the rock-water interaction field. A groundwater quality index (WQI) reveals that the majority of the samples falls under good to excellent category of water, suggesting that the groundwater is suitable for drinking and other domestic uses. The Ca-Mg-HCO3, Ca-HCO3, Ca-SO4-HCO3, and Ca-Mg-HCO3-SO4 water types are the dominant water types depending on the water-rock interaction in the investigation area. Risk of metals to human health was then evaluated using hazard quotients (HQ) by ingestion and dermal pathways for adults and children. It was indicated that As with HQ ingestion > 1 was the most important pollutant leading to non-carcinogenic concerns. It can be concluded that the highest contributors to chronic risks were As and Cr for both adults and children.																	1477-8920					FEB	2017	15	1					112	132		10.2166/wh.2016.148								WOS:000394230100011	28151445

Application of quantitative real-time PCR compared to filtration methods for the enumeration of Escherichia coli in surface waters within Vietnam	JOURNAL OF WATER AND HEALTH												Surface water samples in Vietnam were collected from the Saigon River, rural and suburban canals, and urban run off canals in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, and were processed to enumerate Escherichia coli. Quantification was done through membrane filtration and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Mean log colony-forming unit (CFU)/100 ml E. coli counts in the dry season for river/suburban canals and urban canals were log 2.8 and 3.7, respectively, using a membrane filtration method, while using Taqman quantitative real-time PCR they were log 2.4 and 2.8 for river/suburban canals and urban canals, respectively. For the wet season, data determined by the membrane filtration method in river/suburban canals and urban canals samples had mean counts of log 3.7 and 4.1, respectively. While mean log CFU/100 ml counts in the wet season using quantitative PCR were log 3 and 2, respectively. Additionally, the urban canal samples were significantly lower than those determined by conventional culture methods for the wet season. These results show that while quantitative real-time PCR can be used to determine levels of fecal indicator bacteria in surface waters, there are some limitations to its application and it may be impacted by sources of runoff based on surveyed samples.																	1477-8920					FEB	2017	15	1					155	162		10.2166/wh.2016.173								WOS:000394230100014	28151448

Being able to quickly detect a system contamination event may be the single most influential factor to reduce possible contamination fallout. Consequently, major research has explored how to best protect a water distribution system (WDS) through strategic placement of fixed water quality monitoring stations. Although fixed monitoring stations within a wireless sensor network (WSN) are robust with respect to hydraulic conditions, the stations are expensive to place, and may not provide the highest spatial and temporal resolution of contamination detection. This work sets to build the understanding of a mobile wireless sensor network (MWSN) where inline mobile sensors function within water in pipes to monitor water quality and to wirelessly transmit data to fixed transceivers in real time. Mobile sensor behavior was modeled alongside contamination simulations and the deployment of fixed and mobile sensors was together optimized to minimize the affected population prior contamination event detection constrained by a total system cost. Results show a MWSN to be highly sensitive to sensor battery life, transceiver network coverage, and total system cost. Future obstacles for implementation of a MWSN are highlighted and discussed to be address in future work. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

In this study, surface water from different sources (e.g. pond, canal, lake and river) treated with combined Moringa seed powder, and scallop powder (MOSP) at a ratio of 2:1 for 10 minutes showed a clear water layer at the top and a sediment layer at the bottom. The clear water was then passed through an eight-fold sari cloth and/or natural bio-sand filtration and the resulting water was found drinkable. The microbiological and physico-chemical quality of this water showed non-significant differences compared to the US EPA drinking water quality parameters. Moreover, no cytotoxic effect of MOSP with BHK-21 and HeLa cells, nor any bacterial endotoxins were observed, indicating use of MOSP does not pose any adverse health effect. Furthermore, the quality of 6 months stored water at room temperature was found acceptable, indicating the usefulness of this technology for drinking water purposes. On the other hand, the sediment or sludge produced in this process could be used in agricultural fields after proper composting. Therefore, this simple, inexpensive and ecofriendly method could be used in drinking water scarcity areas of the world.																	1606-9749					FEB	2017	17	1					125	137		10.2166/ws.2016.111								WOS:000394582100013

The first protocol targets uidA (Escherichia coli), int (Shigella spp.), and gyrB (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) genes, while invA (Salmonella spp.), ompW (Vibrio cholera), and lacZ (coliforms) were amplified by the second protocol. Specificity testing was carried out for 12 reference strains. Furthermore, the applicability of the multiplex PCR assays for detection of these bacteria was investigated for 52 surface water samples. The results indicated that all primer pairs showed specificities only for their corresponding target organisms. The detection sensitivity of both multiplex PCR assays was 3 x 10(2) 3 x 10(3) colony forming units. The developed assays represent simple and efficient diagnostic procedures for co-detection of water-borne bacteria and have the potential to provide earlier warnings of possible public health threats and more accurate surveillance of these organisms.

Yet the comprehensive performance in response to complex environmental conditions remains unclear. We investigated biofilm formation and distributed water quality under various nutrients, including chlorine concentrations and hydrodynamic conditions. Results showed that environmental fluctuations collectively induced changes in microbial propagation, which were mostly associated with turbidity variations, concentrations of total organic carbon, NH4+-N and soluble phosphorus compared to the other parameters. Fuzzy pattern recognition analysis integrating multiple water quality indicators revealed that low nutrient availability and addition of mild chlorine at 0.50 mg/L at 0.50 m/s flow velocity were the most favorable conditions screened for optimized comprehensive performance, while nutrient supplements yielded significant performance deterioration. These quantitative estimations offer new insights into advanced understanding of the system performance responding to often complex environmental fluctuations, essential for optimized design and practical functioning of DWDSs.																	1606-9749					FEB	2017	17	1					267	278		10.2166/ws.2016.134								WOS:000394582100028

Spatial and temporal patterns of dissolved organic matter quantity and quality in the Mississippi River Basin, 1997-2013	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Recent studies have found insignificant or decreasing trends in time-series dissolved organic carbon (DOC) datasets, questioning the assumption that long-term DOC concentrations in surface waters are increasing in response to anthropogenic forcing, including climate change, land use, and atmospheric acid deposition. We used the weighted regressions on time, discharge, and season (WRTDS) model to estimate annual flow-normalized concentrations and fluxes to determine if changes in DOC quantity and quality signal anthropogenic forcing at 10 locations in the Mississippi River Basin. Despite increases in agriculture and urban development throughout the basin, net increases in DOC concentration and flux were significant at only 3 of 10 sites from 1997 to 2013 and ranged between -3.5% to +18% and -0.1 to 19%, respectively. Positive shifts in DOC quality, characterized by increasing specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm, ranged between +8% and +45%, but only occurred at one of the sites with significant DOC quantity increases. Basinwide reductions in atmospheric sulfate deposition did not result in large increases in DOC either, likely because of the high buffering capacity of the soil. Hydroclimatic factors including annual discharge, precipitation, and temperature did not significantly change during the 17-year timespan of this study, which contrasts with results from previous studies showing significant increases in precipitation and discharge over a century time scale. Our study also contrasts with those from smaller catchments, which have shown stronger DOC responses to climate, land use, and acidic deposition. This temporal and spatial analysis indicated that there was a potential change in DOC sources in the Mississippi River Basin between 1997 and 2013. However, the overall magnitude of DOC trends was not large, and the pattern in quantity and quality increases for the 10 study sites was not consistent throughout the basin.

J	Sousa, VS; Corniciuc, C; Teixeira, MR				Sousa, Vania Serrao; Corniciuc, Claudia; Teixeira, Margarida Ribau			The effect of TiO2 nanoparticles removal on drinking water quality produced by conventional treatment C/F/S	WATER RESEARCH												Nanoparticles, namely titanium dioxide (TiO2), are emerging contaminants widely used to commercial and industrial applications, are a potential hazard and can cause damage to environment and human health due to their toxicity. Therefore, their removal from the water is urgent to minimize or eliminate the adverse environmental and human effects. This work, investigates the efficiency of conventional coagulation/flocculation/sedimentation (C/F/S) from drinking water treatment to remove TiO2 nano particles (NPs) from surface waters, and pretends to understand if the removal of TiO2 NPs affects the ability of C/F/S to remove natural organic matter (NOM) and turbidity, and consequently affects the quality of the treated water. Results show that TiO2 NPs removal is high (>90%) for all the waters studied (hydrophobic and hydrophilic waters) and the treated water quality is not compromised (turbidity, Ti and Al concentrations, pH and conductivity are below the national and international guidelines). In addition, TiO2 initial concentrations, ranging between 0.2 and 10 mg/L, have not a significant impact on NPs removal by C/F/S. Therefore, the widely used polyaluminium based coagulants are effective in the removal of TiO2 NPs by conventional C/F/S treatment, but removal is strongly influenced by the water characteristics. Hydrophobic waters need a higher coagulant dose than hydrophilic waters to achieve the same TiO2 NPs removals, as well as water with higher UV254nm values. The principal mechanism involved in TiO2 NPs removal is charge neutralisation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Iron and manganese removal: Recent advances in modelling treatment efficiency by rapid sand filtration	WATER RESEARCH												A model has been developed that takes into account the main characteristics of (submerged) rapid filtration: the water quality parameters of the influent water, notably pH, iron(II) and manganese(II) concentrations, homogeneous oxidation in the supernatant layer, surface sorption and heterogeneous oxidation kinetics in the filter, and filter media adsorption characteristics. Simplifying assumptions are made to enable validation in practice, while maintaining the main mechanisms involved in iron(II) and manganese(II) removal. Adsorption isotherm data collected from different Dutch treatment sites show that Fe(II)/Mn(II) adsorption may vary substantially between them, but generally increases with higher pH. The model is sensitive to (experimentally) determined adsorption parameters and the heterogeneous oxidation rate. Model results coincide with experimental values when the heterogeneous rate constants are calibrated. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Photocatalytic reduction of nitrate to molecular nitrogen presents a promising approach to remove nitrate from drinking water sources. However, harmful intermediates like NO2-, NO, NO2 and N2O are usually formed, and metal loading or hole scavengers are generally needed to reduce the recombination of photo generated electrons and holes, which will cause secondary pollution to drinking water. In this work, an efficient, selective and sustainable bioelectro-photocatalytic nitrate-reducing system by utilizing commercial TiO2 nanoparticles P25 as the photocatalyst and bio-electrons from microbial metabolism as the hole scavenger is reported. In this system, bio-electrons extracted from organic substrates in bio-anode are transferred to the photocathode through an external circuit for hole quenching. With the utilization of the residual photogenerated electrons, nitrate is completely reduced to nitrogen without accumulation of harmful nitrite or ammonium. The experimental results and the mechanistic analysis using the first-principles density functional theory calculations demonstrate that toxic by-products like nitrite or ammonium will not be accumulated in this system. Thus, this approach has a great potential for sustainable remediation of nitrate-contaminated drinking water sources. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Jarsjo, J; Tornqvist, R; Su, Y				Jarsjo, Jerker; Tornqvist, Rebecka; Su, Ye			Climate-driven change of nitrogen retention-attenuation near irrigated fields: multi-model projections for Central Asia	Environmental Earth Sciences												Agricultural intensification in semiarid regions comes at a cost of relatively high water losses through evapotranspiration and can contribute to releases of nutrients and pesticides that affect downstream water quality. In addition, highly managed river basins may be particularly sensitive to future climate change. However, effects on retention-attenuation of nutrients are difficult to quantify due to the complexity and variability of relevant processes. We here use the example case of the large (covering 1.3% of the earth's land surface) and extensively irrigated Aral Sea Drainage Basin (ASDB) in Central Asia, together with 73 general circulation model (GCM) projection results and field-data driven nitrogen retention-attenuation modeling, to investigate to which extent projected future climate change (for years 2025, 2050 and 2100) can influence nitrogen loads and concentrations in the water systems of the basin. Results for the principal Amu Darya River of the ASDB suggest that riverine concentrations of nitrogen will decrease considerably throughout the coming century. This is due to projected climate-related decreases in runoff and river discharge, which increases internal nitrogen recirculation ratios, average transport distances and nitrogen retention-attenuation. However, in groundwater near the agricultural fields, there is in contrast a risk of considerable nitrogen accumulation. More generally, the sensitivity of nitrogen concentrations in the ADRB to climate-driven changes in runoff and discharge is likely to be shared with many highly managed basins in arid and semiarid regions of Central Asia, and the world.

J	Sethy, SN; Syed, TH; Kumar, A				Sethy, Satya Narayan; Syed, Tajdarul H.; Kumar, Alok			Evaluation of groundwater quality in parts of the Southern Gangetic Plain using water quality indices	Environmental Earth Sciences												In India, persistent dependence on groundwater for intensively irrigated agriculture, industrial use and domestic activities imposes substantial threat to the quality and quantity of groundwater. This study assesses the suitability of groundwater for drinking purposes in parts of the Southern Gangetic Plain based on samples collected from 33 dug wells. In this scope, two robust indices are utilized, namely Groundwater Quality Index (GQI) and the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME) Water Quality Index (CCME_WQI), to assess the overall quality of groundwater by integrating observed water quality determinants like pH, TDS and major ion concentration. The concentration of major anions and cations is observed to be in the order of HCO3- > Cl- > SO42- > NO3- and Na+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > K+, respectively. The pH values of the analyzed samples vary between 6.2 and 7.37 during the post-monsoon (POM) period and between 6.6 and 7.9 during the pre-monsoon (PRM) period. Similarly, TDS concentrations are observed to vary between 6.7 and 1535 mg/l (POM) and 1.43 and 1327 mg/l (PRM). The values of GQI in the study area range between 10.41-108.56 and 16.03-130.06 for the PRM and POM periods, respectively. Among the groundwater samples collected during the PRM period, about 21, 73 and 6% are found to be excellent, good and poor quality, respectively. While the percentage of poor quality water for POM period is exactly the same as that of PRM, about 42 (52%) of the samples are found to be of excellent (good) quality for drinking purposes. The analysis of CCME_WQI for groundwater samples reveals that 3 (21%), 42 (36%), 33 (18%), 21 (24%) of the samples collected during PRM (POM) are classified to be of excellent, good, fair and marginal category, respectively. The spatial distribution of GQI and CCME_WQI illustrates that excellent quality water occurs primarily in the northeast part of the study area during the POM period. However, some localized patches with excellent quality are also observed in both the seasons. Results from this study will be crucial for proper utilization and management of already depleted groundwater resources of the study area.

In order to assess the effects of PES in the conservation soil area, the chemical and isotopic compositions of water from springs were characterized and the water baseline chemistry was established to provide a useful standard to monitor the water resources and to support the decision-making under current water management policies. A total of 32 water samples taken in four field surveys, during the dry and rainy season, and background chemical data from different information sources, were studied. The water salinity increases from southwest to northeast towards the urbanized area. The chemical composition of water is due to the occurrence of natural chemical interactions between water and rocks in aquifers and to the presence of effluents generated by human activities. In the forest area, water chemistry has not changed significantly over the past three decades and there are no major discernible trends in the compiled water chemistry data, suggesting that PES has contributed in part to maintain the initial condition in the aquifer recharge area. The natural reference levels proposed have allowed the current chemical conditions in the system to be understood and can be implemented to monitor water resources in the area of conservation soil in the Sierra de Las Cruces with an acceptable degree of reliability.

This would not be achievable unless continuous water quality monitoring is implemented. With the recent advances in remote sensing technology, this technology could assist us to produce accurate models for estimating water quality variables in the ecosystem of wetlands. The present study was carried out to evaluate the capability of remote sensing data to estimate the water quality variables [pH, total suspended solids (TSS), total dissolved solids (TDS), turbidity, nitrate, sulfate, phosphate, chloride and the concentration of chlorophyll a] in Zarivar International Wetland using linear regression (LR) and artificial neural network (ANN) models. For this purpose, spectral reflectance of bands 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the OLI sensor of Landsat 8 was utilized as the input data and the collected chemical and physical data of water samples were selected as the objective data for both ANN and LR models. Based on our results overall, ANN model was the proper model compared with LR model. The spectral reflectance in bands 5 and 4 of OLI sensor revealed the best results to estimate TDS, TSS, turbidity and chlorophyll in comparison with other used bands in ANN model, respectively. We conclude that OLI sensor data are an excellent means for studying physical properties of water quality and comparing its chemical properties.																	0921-030X	1573-0840				FEB	2017	85	3					1511	1527		10.1007/s11069-016-2641-1								WOS:000392302700010						
J	Kim, J; Park, J				Kim, Jinah; Park, Jinah			Bayesian structural equation modeling for coastal management: The case of the Saemangeum coast of Korea for water quality improvements	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												The data-driven paradigm is widely used in ocean science and includes the statistical modeling of various phenomena in coastal marine environments and data assimilation in numerical models. One of the most important challenges in the data-driven paradigm is finding the model that best approximates the underlying mechanism of a phenomenon with measurement data. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian approach to modeling coastal marine environments using ocean observational data, and we apply it to the Saemangeum coast. There are two main advantages to the Bayesian method: domain knowledge can be encoded to prior probability, and Markov-chain Monte Carlo simulation can be used in model estimation and inference. We apply the method to estimate model parameters and predict coastal water quality and sea current for maintaining optimal coastal water quality. The threshold quantity of sea current is computed to ensure sustainable coastal development. One of the interesting results we have obtained is a flat plateau relationship between the sea current for water exchange and the level of improvement of coastal water quality. This means that coastal water quality is not always being improved, even if the amount of water exchange is increased. The computed results are in good agreement with oceanographic theory, while showing a valid difference compared to the results using the frequentist approach and probabilistic inference using the probabilistic graphical model. These results will be helpful in coastal water quality management, ultimately contributing to sustainable coastal development. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study, the performance of phytoremediation by Salvinia molesta macrophytes on treated Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME) is investigated. The objectives of the study are to determine the nutrient uptake by S. molesta from treated POME and its effect towards the biomass and biochemical content. The water quality after phytoremediation were monitored. The wastewater phytoremediation by S. molesta was conducted outdoor for 16 days in a raceway pond rig. The results showed that S. molesta achieved 95% phosphate removal efficiency from the wastewater, lowering concentration to 0.17 mg/1. Nitrate concentration was determined to be at 0.50 mg/1 at the end of the experiment. Ammonia concentration showed a dynamic fluctuation trend with average value of 2.62 mg/1. For water quality assessment, turbidity decreased from 7.56 NTU to 0.94 NTU in just 2 days' time. MLVSS analysis was significantly low by day 2 of experiment. COD removal efficiency was determined at 39%. All six water quality assay met their respective statutory discharge limit. The S. molesta cultivated in the raceway pond rig also showed increment toward the biomass gain, carbohydrate and protein at the end of the experiment. This study indicates that S. molesta plants have the potential to be used in the phytoremediation of treated POME and showed a superior biochemical composition. 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Geng, YQ; Wang, DM; Yang, WB				Geng, Yuqing; Wang, Dongmei; Yang, Wenbin			Effects of different inundation periods on soil enzyme activity in riparian zones in Lijiang	CATENA												The most important environmental processes in riparian zones are the release of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus from various organic compounds. The extracellular enzymes of soil microorganisms are involved in the bio-geochemical cycling of organic matter nutrients and may be important for regulating water quality. The objectives of the present study were to determine whether the activities of soil enzymes were affected by different inundation periods in the riparian zone and to identify major factors that influence soil enzyme activity. We subjected three study plots to different inundation conditions (long inundation, moderate inundation, and rare inundation) within the transects perpendicular to the river flow at three sites (Weijiadu, Lijiaocun, and Daxu) in Lijiang, Guilin City, China. Soil physicochemical properties, dissolved nutrient composition, and soil enzyme activities were analyzed. The activity of acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, and arylsulfatase significantly increased as the inundation frequency decreased, whereas the activity of glucosidase, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, glycine aminopeptidase, L-leucine aminopeptidase, and dehydrogenase were significantly higher in study plots that received long inundation than in those subjected to moderate or rare inundation. Linear regression indicated that most hydrolase and dehydrogenase activities were affected by soil clay content, soil organic matter, and soil water content, among other factors. NO3--N limited the activity of acid phosphatase, L-leucine aminopeptidase, and glycine aminopeptidase. Polyphenol oxidase activity was constrained by soil water content and available potassium but promoted by NO3--N. Our study demonstrated that imposing longer inundation periods can increase soil enzyme activities. To maintain microbial activity and to minimize water pollution, it is important to reduce high NO3--N loads. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Predicting the impact of seasonal fluctuations on the potential ecotoxicological risk of multiple contaminants in the River Scheldt discharge into the Western Scheldt estuary	CATENA												The study site, Land van Saeftinghe, is an area within the Western Scheldt estuary with Special Protection Area (SPA) status for the EU Birds directive. We used a combination of hydrodynamic and water quality monitoring, hydrodynamic and water quality and modeling, ecotoxicity modeling and observations on the ecological status to correlate the water quality to the observed ecological status of the study site. The monitoring and modeling results show that the copper concentrations are elevated above the Maximum Tolerable Concentration (MTR) during the whole year, while zinc and cadmium show a spring peak (>MTR). Other metals, and all the measured organic contaminants where below the MTR. The peak in the three metals during springtime translates into an increase in the ecotoxicity, as expressed by the calculated multi-substance Potentially Affected Fraction (ms-PAF). The ms-PAF peaked at 25% for all organisms, and 30% for benthic invertebrates. The observed ecological status for the study site at the time of monitoring (2000) was Maximum Ecological Potential (MEP). This result seems to be in contradiction with the exceedance of the MTR for three metals during spring time. However the calculated ms-PAF during the spring peak of 25% is deemed acceptable based on current policy, therefore potential ecotoxic stress is within acceptable boundaries. The ms-PAF results therefore do not contradict the MEP status. The evaluation of the ecological status versus the water quality within the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) can be improved by using the calculated ecotoxicity (ms-PAF) instead of the water quality. We propose an additional step for water bodies which are currently 'at risk', based on their chemical status. In this additional step, the ms-PAF is calculated for all contaminants in the water phase, not discriminating between priority and non-priority substances. The outcome of this calculation defines if the water body is at risk (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

To evaluate the feasibility of applying MD process for SGPW treatment, membrane fouling and wetting, which are barrier to its practical application, were systematically examined by varying organic and inorganic constituents, simulating the SGPW from Marcellus shale (USA). The liquid entry pressure (LEP) was first measured to predict the possibility of wetting by the chemical constituents of SGPW, and then a series of lab-scale MD and MDC experiments were performed to elucidate membrane wetting mechanisms. The results revealed that membrane wetting became more pronounced in the presence of oil and grease. The inorganic scaling induced by multivalent ions, such as barium and calcium in SGPW, also enhanced membrane wettability and led to poor permeate water quality. By integrating with crystallization, scalant loading was reduced properly and thus membrane wetting was mitigated effectively. As a result, adopting this MDC process increased total recovery up to 62.5%. Our experimental observations demonstrated that MD could be sustainably operated for SGPW treatment through optimized crystallization for scaling removal as well as effective pre-treatment for organic removal.

J	Sen, ZK				Sen, Zekai			Hydrological trend analysis with innovative and over-whitening procedures	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES												Different statistical methodologies can be employed to identify possible trend components in any hydro-meteorological time series. A pre-whitening (P-W) procedure has been suggested to reduce the serial correlation effect on Mann-Kendall (M-K) trend analysis. In this paper, instead of P-W, an over-whitening (O-W) procedure is suggested, which generates serially independent series with the same trend slope value. Analytically necessary formulations for O-W are presented with a non-parametric but simple innovative trend assessment procedure, which are supported by extensive simulation studies. The applications of the methodology are presented for eight factual time series records from tropical, temperate and arid regions including temperature, rainfall, streamflow, relative humidity and CO2 concentrations for different short and long durations. Relative humidity and CO2 records are monthly time series and, hence, there are trend and periodicity components. It is noticed in all cases that the natural trends remain as they were after the O-W procedure, thus providing an opportunity to determine reliably the trends embedded even in the serially dependent series. The O-W procedure is applicable even in the cases of periodicity in the original records.																	0262-6667	2150-3435				FEB	2017	62	2					294	305		10.1080/02626667.2016.1222533								WOS:000392602000011

Modeling yield and biomass responses of maize cultivars to climate change under full and deficit irrigation	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												With as much as 4.8 degrees C increase in air temperature by end of 21st century, new crop cultivars are needed for adapting to the new climate. The objective of this study was to identify maize (Zea mays L) cultivar parameters that maintain yield under projected climate for late in the 21st century under full and deficit irrigation in a semi-arid region. The Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM2) was calibrated with four years of maize data from northeastern Colorado, USA, under various irrigation conditions and was then used to simulate climate change effects on maize production with current management practices. Results showed that projected climate change decreased yield by 21% and biomass by 7% late in the 21st century (2070-2091) under full irrigation, compared to yield in the current climate (1992-2013). Under deficit irrigation, the corresponding reductions were 14% and 3%, respectively. Using the cultivar parameters calibrated with RZWQM2 for southern Colorado condition did not show yield decrease under future climate, but it simulated much lower yield under current climate in northeastern Colorado. A cultivar from the DSSAT (Decision Support Systems for Agrotechnology Transfer) crop database (GL 482) produced similar yield to experimental data under current climate and increased yield by 4% at full irrigation under future climate in northeastern Colorado. Using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS), we also identified 70 cultivars with longer maturity duration (between silking and physiological maturity) and higher grain filling rate for mitigating climate change effects on maize production. These two identified traits can guide plant breeders in developing cultivars for the future. Published by Elsevier B.V.

F.; Piepho, Hans-Peter; Schmitter, Petra; Hilger, Thomas; Cadisch, Georg			Quantifying uncertainty on sediment loads using bootstrap confidence intervals	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Load estimates are more informative than constituent concentrations alone, as they allow quantification of on-and off-site impacts of environmental processes concerning pollutants, nutrients and sediment, such as soil fertility loss, reservoir sedimentation and irrigation channel siltation. While statistical models used to predict constituent concentrations have been developed considerably over the last few years, measures of uncertainty on constituent loads are rarely reported. Loads are the product of two predictions, constituent concentration and discharge, integrated over a time period, which does not make it straightforward to produce a standard error or a confidence interval. In this paper, a linear mixed model is used to estimate sediment concentrations. A bootstrap method is then developed that accounts for the uncertainty in the concentration and discharge predictions, allowing temporal correlation in the constituent data, and can be used when data transformations are required. The method was tested for a small watershed in Northwest Vietnam for the period 2010-2011. The results showed that confidence intervals were asymmetric, with the highest uncertainty in the upper limit, and that a load of 6262 Mg year(-1) had a 95% confidence interval of (4331, 12 267) in 2010 and a load of 5543Mg an interval of (3593, 8975) in 2011. Additionally, the approach demonstrated that direct estimates from the data were biased downwards compared to bootstrap median estimates. These results imply that constituent loads predicted from regression-type water quality models could frequently be underestimating sediment yields and their environmental impact.

The Performance Analysis of Two Relatively Small Capacity Urban Retrofit Stormwater Controls	JOURNAL OF WATER MANAGEMENT MODELING												This paper details field investigations that were conducted on the performance of small capacity urban retrofit stormwater control measures. The objective of the two year study (2013-2015) was to provide performance data on stormwater retrofits that could not be fully sized according to conventional standards due to space constraints. In many states performance credits are not granted to stormwater management controls that are not designed to manage regionally derived water quality volumes. In retrofit applications there may exist numerous limitations to conventionally sized systems such as limited rights of way, setback distances or existing utilities. The larger scale objective of green infrastructure implementation is to improve receiving water quality and therefore even undersized systems, to some extent, meet this objective. This study introduces data on two systems: an innovative bioretention design with a water treatment residual amended filter media and an internal storage reservoir; and an undersized linear subsurface gravel wetland sized to optimize both phosphorus and nitrogen removal. The systems were retrofitted into existing developed areas and were sized at less than the water quality volume due to limited space at each location. The bioretention system (IBSC) was constructed in a commercial area in the town of Durham, NH in summer 2011 and the subsurface gravel wetland system (SGWSC) was constructed in a narrow drainage right of way in a residential neighbourhood of Durham, NH in the fall of 2013. Sediment and metal removals for both undersized systems were high with median removal efficiencies in the SGW of 75% for both total suspended solids (TSS) and total zinc (TZn). The Durham IBSC recorded median removal efficiency (RE) of 86% for TSS and TZn. Total phosphorus (TP) REs were higher than conventional bioretention systems with the subsurface gravel wetland system achieving a median RE of 53% and the Durham IBSC achieving a median RE of 40% for TP. Both systems reduced total nitrogen (TN) by approximately 20% (23% for SGWSC and 21% for Durham IBSC) with median effluent concentrations of 1.4 mg/L.

A novel coagulant dose controller was designed and successfully implemented in a pilot UF-RO seawater desalination plant. The coagulant controller, which tracks the UF resistance during filtration and backwash, adjusts coagulant dose to the UF feed with the objective of reducing the incremental cycle -to -cycle UF post -backwash (PB) resistance change (i.e., Delta(n)). Real-time tracking the above UF resistance metrics, as well as the rate of change of Delta(n) with coagulant dose, enabled the controller to quantify the progression of both irreversible fouling and UF backwash effectiveness. The above information was then utilized by the controller to make the appropriate coagulant adjustment. Field tests of the proposed self -adaptive coagulant dosing approach demonstrated measurable coagulant dose reduction while maintaining robust UF operation even during periods of both mild and severe water quality degradation. The approach to real-time coagulant dose control developed in the present work should be suitable for both seawater and brackish water UF treatment and has the potential of providing both effective UF operation as well as reduction in coagulant use.

J	Yang, SQ; French, R				Yang, Shu-Qing; French, Rob			Coastal reservoirs - an Australian water storage option	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES												Besides dams, technologies such as desalination, wastewater recycling and rainwater tanks are being employed in urban water supplies. From the fact that Australian water consumption is only 5-6% of annual run-off - as it is worldwide - the coming shortage is not of water, but of storage. New dam sites are becoming increasingly difficult to find and develop on land surfaces, so a paradigm shift is suggested: water storage may be located in seawater environments. The first generation of coastal storages has been successfully constructed in China, Singapore, Hong Kong and Korea. Their water quality problems have been essentially overcome with the second generation of coastal reservoirs which bypass or select against poor quality floodwaters. At a concept level, coastal reservoir technology is compared with other urban water supply technologies.																	1324-1583						2017	21	2					89	97		10.1080/13241583.2018.1454086								WOS:000437912200005

Optimum Design of Water Networks Using A Micro Software Based Genetic Algorithms Multiobjective	RIBAGUA-REVISTA IBEROAMERICANA DEL AGUA												Water distribution networks are a system that searches for water and brings it to each user according to what they use the water for. The infrastructure needed to achieve this goal requires significant financial investment; therefore, providing the optimal design of these networks is very important. Not only is the economic aspect essential; in addition to it, there are others such as hydraulic behaviour, which refers to maximum pressures and speeds, availability of pipes, water quality, demand distribution, network reliability, system performance which further complicates an integral analysis leading to an optimal design. The optimization of a water network, due to its complexity, is associated to the combinatorial problem called NP-HARD, which means that it is not possible to use a deterministic method to solve it, but requires special methodologies that make use of a reasonable computational processing time. This is necessary to obtain a configuration of diameters complying with the limitations (speed and pressure), as well as achieving acceptable values in the objectives (lower cost and higher reliability). Using multiobjective genetic algorithms can solve this type of NP-HARD combinatorial problems; and consequently, optimizes the water network. To find an optimal set of solutions, we developed a computer program called Magmoredes, which based on the use of a multiobjective genetic microarray, proposed by Coello and Toscano [1], adapted for the application of water distribution networks. To comply the economic demands, under pressure and speed limits according to Peruvian regulations a program in the Java programming language was developed. Finally, verification of the proposed algorithm on the efficiency of the Hanoi water network is performed (Fujiwara and Khang, [2]). This water network has a single source with 3 basic circuits, 31 nodes, 1 reservoir and 34 pipes. The nodes are at the same elevation and minor losses in the pipes are not considered.																	2386-3781						2017	4	1					6	23		10.1080/23863781.2017.1317087								WOS:000437211300002

Jeli district in the state of Kelantan, Malaysia, is rich in water resources with attractive natural and geological/geomorphological features such as lake, river, waterfall, and hot spring. This study discusses the geological assessment of potential water-based tourism sites in the district, by selecting four (4) destinations i.e. Pergau Lake, Jeli Hot Spring, Rual River, and Lata Renyok Waterfall as case studies. Geological mapping and characterisation of these sites have been conducted in 2014. These sites contain some interesting geological/geomorphological features such as granitic mountainous and hilly areas (in Pergau Lake), exotic hot water spring in a small valley (in Jeli Hot Spring), beautiful landscape and features of a river valley (in Rual River), and wonderful cascading waterfall in the alternating bright and dark-coloured rocks (in Lata Renyok Waterfall). The geological assessment of these sites was carried out through qualitative and quantitative approaches based on some geodiversity values: scientific, educational, aesthetic, recreational, and some other values. To support the assessment, the in situ water quality analysis was conducted in mid of 2014 (June-July 2014) to show that these sites have different water quality classes based on Malaysia's Interim National Water Quality Standard (INWQS) i.e. Class I for Lata Renyok Waterfall, Class III for Rual River, and Class IV for Pergau Lake and Jeli Hot Spring. All localities are potential water-based tourism attractions in the district which have some specific tourism and recreational activities e.g. swimming and bathing (in Lata Renyok Waterfall and Rual River), fishing (in Lata Renyok Waterfall, Rual River, and Pergau Lake), rafting, boating, and kayaking/canoeing (in Pergau Lake), and hot water therapy and skin treatment (in Jeli Hot Spring). It is recommended that all these localities should be conserved and developed properly as models of sustainable water-based tourism destinations in Malaysia.																	2364-6934	2364-8198	978-3-319-51856-5; 978-3-319-51855-8				2017							173	195		10.1007/978-3-319-51856-5_11								WOS:000436089500011

They are predominantly represented by gastropods and only locally by bivalves. Within this framework, gastropod species of the genera Theodoxus, Melanopsis, Melanoides, Physa, Bulinus, Galba, Hydrobia, Ovatella, Falsipyrgula, Prosostenia, Pseudamnicola proved to be useful. Most commonly encountered are Theodoxus, Melanopsis Melanoides and Physa, and their presence alone presents good information about the quality of the water body they are living in. The results of the study indicate that Theodoxus and Melanopsis represent indicators of pure and clean fresh water while Physa is an indicator of polluted water. Of very special interest is the fauna in King Abdullah Canal influenced by the fauna of Lake Tiberias, represented by Falsipyrgula, and the bivalves of the two species of Unionidae and of Corbicula. Species of Falsipyrgula. Pseudamnicola, Melanoides, and Prosostenia tolerate increasing water salinity which when reaching sea water salinity Ovatella becomes present. Locally Pseudamnicola documents influence of mineral water which can tolerate high Sr2+ and Br(-)concentrations. Other members of Gastropods, especially Planorbis, Gyraulus and Ancylus have almost disappeared from running or standing fresh water in Jordan because of increasing pollution. The bivalves, Unio, Pisidium, Sphaerium, and Corbicula are found confined to freshwater environment. With exception of King Abdullah Canal where they used to be useful indicators for the quality of its water, they are rare in Jordanian waters. The study concludes that aquatic mollusks, mainly gastropods, can easily be used as biological indicators of environmental quality of surface water bodies. It is a fast, easy and trustful way of observing changes taking place in the environment, especially salinity, added chemical and pollution parameters.																	2364-6934	2364-8198	978-3-319-51856-5; 978-3-319-51855-8				2017							295	318		10.1007/978-3-319-51856-5_17								WOS:000436089500017

The operational change involved the cancellation of the primary settling tanks of the plant, and as a result, the raw wastewater received at the plant directly entered the aeration tanks. The effect of this change on treated wastewater quality as determined by Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) and total suspended solids (TSS) concentration was evaluated. These parameters were measured for one month before and one month after the cancelation of the primary settling tanks and the average values were calculated. Results showed that the average removal percentage of BOD and TSS in the last month before the operational change was implemented was 89 and 88%, respectively. The average removal percentage for the same parameters in the first month immediately after implementing the operational changes was 91 and 92% respectively, which shows that there is no significant difference in the removal efficiency for these parameters after the operational change. These results indicate that the treated wastewater quality was not affected by the operational change implemented at the plant. Results of this research provide useful information for the authorities responsible for wastewater treatment as well as for the scientific community.																	2364-6934	2364-8198	978-3-319-51856-5; 978-3-319-51855-8				2017							407	417		10.1007/978-3-319-51856-5_23								WOS:000436089500023

Application of DHS-USB System and Ozone in Recirculating Freshwater Aquaria Towards Zero Water Exchange Aquaria	FRONTIERS IN WASTEWATER TREATMENT AND MODELLING, FICWTM 2017	Lecture Notes in Civil Engineering				Frontiers International Conference on Wastewater Treatment (FICWTM)	MAY 21-24, 2017	Univ Palermo, Palermo, ITALY	Int Water Assoc	Univ Palermo			In recirculating aquaria system (RAS), partial water exchange was performed regularly as a part of aquaria maintenance for maintaining water quality and aesthetic beauty. To reduce large consumption of water during maintenance, this study proposed a biological nitrogen removal system consisted of down-flow hanging sponge (DHS) and an up-flow sludge blanket (USB) system with combination of ozone (O-3) to simultaneously maintain nitrogen compounds concentration and remove yellow substances that implicate color in aquaria without performing water exchange. The performance of the system was evaluated using on site freshwater aquaria at ambient temperature (20-34 degrees C). NH3, NO2-, and NO3- concentration detected was 0.10 +/- 0.12, 0.03 +/- 0.13 and 6.40 +/- 7.46 mg N L-1 respectively. Color were maintained at 6 color units at phase 2 and 4 when O-3 was applied continuously for 8 h per day. In addition, 16S rRNA gene of microorganisms from the bioreactors were sequenced to identify the microbial communities present. The analysis revealed that ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA) such as Ca. Nitrososphaera played important role in nitrification and Thauera played important role in denitrification. Fish survived throughout the study despite no water exchange was performed for 425 days. The application of O-3 in combination with DHS-USB system appeared to be a promising technology towards less-maintenance aquaria.																	2366-2557		978-3-319-58421-8; 978-3-319-58420-1				2017	4						43	49		10.1007/978-3-319-58421-8_7								WOS:000430181700007

Performance of a Baffled Membrane Bioreactor (BMBR) Operated with Sponge Biomass Carriers: Substantial Reduction in Operational Energy	FRONTIERS IN WASTEWATER TREATMENT AND MODELLING, FICWTM 2017	Lecture Notes in Civil Engineering				Frontiers International Conference on Wastewater Treatment (FICWTM)	MAY 21-24, 2017	Univ Palermo, Palermo, ITALY	Int Water Assoc	Univ Palermo			The authors have proposed a baffled membrane bioreactor (BMBR) that can eliminate the energy needed for the mixed liquor circulation. A combination of the BMBR concept and use of biomass carriers is promising, and a substantial reduction in energy consumption should be possible. In this study, a pilot-scale BMBR treating municipal wastewater was operated with sponge biomass carriers and its performance was investigated in terms of treated water quality and energy consumption (aeration intensity). Long-term operation of the BMBR revealed that aeration demand for the BMBR was substantially reduced with minimal membrane fouling and excellent nitrogen removal being achieved. The expected energy consumption (aeration intensity) in a full-scale BMBR operated with sponge carriers is very low, definitely lower than the values in "normal" MBRs. With the proposed modification of the MBR, processes using MBRs will no longer be considered to be energy-intensive processes.																	2366-2557		978-3-319-58421-8; 978-3-319-58420-1				2017	4						153	158		10.1007/978-3-319-58421-8_23								WOS:000430181700023

This promising process relying on a dense FO membrane and osmotic gradient demonstrated higher rejections of all contaminants and lower fouling propensity than for MBR. The concept that we developed aims at (partially) retrofit existing MBR into OMBR. In addition to the use of existing MBR installation, such process also allows for combined operation of MBR and OMBR to avoid salinity build-up and to be flexible/reversible in term of operation in MBR/OMBR modes to fit with (seasonal) water quality needs. The study presented aimed at validating the proof of concept of such retrofitting which includes also the development of OMBR/FO module with similar performance than MBR/UF ones. As such, OMBR plate were designed based on Kubota MF cartridge 203 design and using new generation of thin film composite FO membrane. Then, pilot tests were conducted using a 50L MBR/OMBR pilot for two months. Stable operation was obtained in terms of depuration efficiency and water flux. Salinity build up occurred in the reactor, but conductivity was maintained below 3 mS.cm(-1) thanks to the salt purge via the MBR permeate. Fouling was observed both for MBR and OMBR operation; however, for OMBR, osmotic backwash every 3 days allowed for complete removal of the fouling layer. Finally, 90% rejection of all pharmaceuticals compounds tested was observed in OMBR operation as a result of combined biological degradation and high rejection of FO membranes.																	2366-2557		978-3-319-58421-8; 978-3-319-58420-1				2017	4						188	192		10.1007/978-3-319-58421-8_29								WOS:000430181700029

Removal of Conventional Water Quality Parameters, Emerging Contaminants and Fluorescing Organic Matter in a Hybrid Constructed Wetland System	FRONTIERS IN WASTEWATER TREATMENT AND MODELLING, FICWTM 2017	Lecture Notes in Civil Engineering				Frontiers International Conference on Wastewater Treatment (FICWTM)	MAY 21-24, 2017	Univ Palermo, Palermo, ITALY	Int Water Assoc	Univ Palermo			Constructed wetlands (CWs) are nature-based wastewater treatment systems, which are often implemented in decentralized areas and small communities. In recent decades, the CW technology has rapidly evolved through the use of various designs and operational modes or other intensifications so as to improve effluent water quality with respect to various pollutants from wastewater. In the present study, the removal of conventional water quality parameters, emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) and fluorescence signature was investigated in a hybrid constructed wetland system comprising different CW configurations: (i) unsaturated vertical subsurface flow (VF), (ii) partial saturated vertical subsurface flow (VF sat), (iii) saturated horizontal flow (HF) and (iv) free water surface (FWS) wetlands. The obtained results showed higher removal of BOD5, COD and fluorescing organic matter in the aerobic VF reactor, whereas the anoxic HF wetland was the most efficient unit for nitrogen removal. The partially saturated VF wetland showed a greater performance in the reduction of nitrogen and highly biodegradable EOCs than the unsaturated VF bed. Finally, linear regression analyses performed between removal of water quality parameters, EOCs and fluorescence measurements suggested the possibility to use fluorescence indexes as useful indicators of water treatment efficacy and/or surrogate parameters for EOCs monitoring.																	2366-2557		978-3-319-58421-8; 978-3-319-58420-1				2017	4						313	317		10.1007/978-3-319-58421-8_50								WOS:000430181700050

REWAQUA: An Advanced Technology for Water Purification in Sustainable Aquaculture Based on Photocatalytic Ozonation	FRONTIERS IN WASTEWATER TREATMENT AND MODELLING, FICWTM 2017	Lecture Notes in Civil Engineering				Frontiers International Conference on Wastewater Treatment (FICWTM)	MAY 21-24, 2017	Univ Palermo, Palermo, ITALY	Int Water Assoc	Univ Palermo			The present study has been undertaken in order to test the real potential of photocatalytic ozonation in a bench-scale recirculating aquaculture system working on a 180 L reef coral aquarium. Notably, this choice may be considered representative. In fact, (i) the system is virtually closed so that fresh water turnover is practically negligible, (ii) the presence of living organisms is highly diversified (corals, fishes, molluscs, echinoderms and crustaceans) and some of them are particularly sensitive to water quality, (iii) high salinity strongly puts a strain on the purification system. The hereby presented purification method has been named REWAQUA, which stands for REcycling Water for AQUAculture and AQUAria. REWAQUA allows purification rates higher than the sum of the rates of the single technologies (photocatalysis and ozonation) operating in series. Furthermore the production of bromate ions, which are carcinogenic by-products of ozonation, is efficiently controlled. Two years observation of the reef coral aquarium reveals that photocatalytic ozonation is a good candidate for water purification in recirculating systems in view of a sustainable aquaculture.																	2366-2557		978-3-319-58421-8; 978-3-319-58420-1				2017	4						318	323		10.1007/978-3-319-58421-8_51								WOS:000430181700051

Limitations using mechanistic biofilm models for engineering design do not rely on improved biofilm models, but rely on improved biofilm reactor models. This is important when considering that biofilm reactors containing submerged, free-moving biofilm carriers are the most widely applied biofilm system(s) for municipal wastewater treatment. This paper presents a new biofilm reactor model that considers the impact of submerged free-moving biofilm carrier (Xcarrier) movement on system performance. The model accounts for a hydrodynamic condition characterized as plug flow with back mixing (to model axial dispersion).

Reshaping the Activated Sludge Model ASM2d for Better Manageability and Higher Integration Potential	FRONTIERS IN WASTEWATER TREATMENT AND MODELLING, FICWTM 2017	Lecture Notes in Civil Engineering				Frontiers International Conference on Wastewater Treatment (FICWTM)	MAY 21-24, 2017	Univ Palermo, Palermo, ITALY	Int Water Assoc	Univ Palermo			The European Water Framework Directive has pointed out that the best model for water management is management by river basin. However, to obtain an overview of the water quality in a river basin system, one has to look at the individual components of the system such as the sewer network, the wastewater treatment plant and the receiving water bodies and the interaction between them. Within this study, we develop an adjusted model from the original state-of-the-art activated sludge ASM2d model with as main focus to maximize the compatibility with the sewage and river water quality models while still assuring a sufficient prediction capacity of the activated sludge system. To this end, and to avoid the commonly required fractionation into the classic activated sludge model state variables, the latter are directly derived from the outputs of the sewage model (e.g., BOD5, COD, TN or TP) for the adjusted model. Furthermore, the modified ASM2d model is made more realistic and can be more broadly applied due to the re-introduction of organic nitrogen and phosphorus component state variables. While developed on the basis of the data of a wastewater treatment plant in Belgium, the validation of the adjusted model on a data set of a wastewater treatment plant in Girona (Spain) is highly promising.																	2366-2557		978-3-319-58421-8; 978-3-319-58420-1				2017	4						583	587		10.1007/978-3-319-58421-8_91								WOS:000430181700091

Since the 1970s, the city has been supplied with surface water that is collected from 5 small watersheds and treated in a single main plant located in Ntoum, 40 km east of Libreville. There are few additional surface water resources available nearby, and the national water utility is desperately seeking cheap, alternative water resources. From 2007 to 2014, SEURECA and HYDROCONSEIL provided SEEG with hydrogeological expertise to develop groundwater resource near existing facilities. A thick limestone layer (Madiela limestone) had been previously drilled by oil companies. Madiela has very limited outcrops (5 km(2)), but proved to be highly productive (2000-10,000 m3/day per borehole), and we successfully developed a new well field. As (a) the aquifer extension is limited and (b) there is a risk of seawater intrusion, the well field was developed step-by-step and the water levels and water quality were carefully monitored (i.e., conductivity, which can indicate seawater intrusion). The aquifer storage capacity was measured through the long dry season drawdown as being 220,000 m(3) per m. This is sizeable, but insufficient was the aquifer to be mined. For this reason, we proposed a MAR strategy and monitored aquifer recharge during rainfall events. This recharge proved to be highly impressive (>20 million m(3)/year). Such a large recharge is higher than expected from direct infiltration in such a tiny aquifer outcrop. Additional recharge mechanisms have been investigated through geophysical prospecting, and the hydrogeological model has been updated accordingly. Presently, Ntoum well field produces 55,000 m3/day of good quality water without this having any significant impact on resource quality or quantity (i.e., no significant drawdown of the water table has been recorded). In light of the recharge efficiency, we have developed a MAR strategy that includes a new well field further to the north, with 4 additional deep wells.																	2511-2066	2511-2082	978-3-319-45465-8; 978-3-319-45464-1				2017							273	281		10.1007/978-3-319-45465-8_26								WOS:000426347900026

A hundred year snow event which followed not only hindered the repair work, but also settled the water meter pit by 6". After rebuilding a 42-ft deep manhole on a 4' x6' egg shaped sewer, replacing a few segments of 8" water pipes, point-repair of a 12" sewer, and backfilling the street around the manhole, the street around the manhole continued to settle until dozens of cubic yards of low mobility grouting (LMG) in the impact zone around the manhole were deployed. During this investigation, DC Water engineers were surprised to find that the rest of the street had a very low blow count below a depth of 8 feet, indicating hidden voids in the soil and thus very poor soil condition. Review of the as-built records indicated that this street appeared to have a 42-ft +/-deep built-up fill in 1892 after constructing a 4' x6' egg shaped sewer to contain the spring water. Entry inspection by engineers also confirmed clear live flow in the "abandoned" section of the egg shape sewer. Water quality and low pressure issues in this neighborhood qualified the 8" water line on the list to be replaced with new ductile iron pipes via open-cut, i.e, the conventional rehabilitation method. It came to our engineer's realization that this dirt fill built-up street is in a delicate equilibrium atop of the hidden voids. The DDOT's reinforced concrete underlayment slab and a seven feet+/- of soil arch seems to act as a "land bridge" that supports the street. Any conventional open cut approach to slit the street open will likely remove the bridge effect. This presentation will showcase how DC Water engineers perform internal and external benchmarking to assess the risk associated with the conventional open-cut methodology, and how alternative CIPP for water service pipe rehab is confirmed.																			978-0-7844-8089-2				2017							249	258										WOS:000426213400024

The project was undertaken in 2016 between February and April and involved the replacement of approximately 5,800 L.F. of existing aging and undersized asbestos cement water lines in the vicinity of the downtown core to reduce maintenance and repairs and improve water service levels. Six line segments of existing 2-inch to 6-inch asbestos cement water lines were replaced by 6-inch diameter PVC pipe. The City of Yuma worked together with Stantec Consulting Services to use this project as a means to conduct a head-to-head analysis of various aspects of traditional open-cut construction compared to Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD). The project was intentionally separated into HDD (2,000 L.F.) and open-cut (3,800 L.F.) sections. PVC C900 DR14 was installed using open-cut, while Fusible PVC (FPVC) DR 14 was installed by HDD. Onsite data was collected to analyze and compare environmental impacts, traffic impacts, and productivity. HDD was found to be more advantageous in all three areas when compared to traditional open-cut. Airborne emissions generated during the project by each of the two methods were determined using the eCalc (TM) program. Water samples were taken for each installation method to compare water quality before and after the installation of the new water lines.																			978-0-7844-8089-2				2017							465	474										WOS:000426213400044

These systems convey a large flow along existing open channels. Man fill was brought to create land above for development. This has been the pillar of the urbanization in D.C. More than a century later, these trunk sewers carry even more flow than before. The forthcoming $3.5 billion CSO tunnel system in DC will supplement the trunk sewer system to relieve local flooding, reduce overflow thus improve water quality. The century old trunk sewers present a daunting task for DC Water to optimize its resources to manage the linear asset, a significant part of the goals in the Blue Horizon 2020 Strategic Plan. DC Water engineers synergize our engineering efforts to assess, improve, and protect our mission critical infrastructure. This presentation showcases our engineer's holistic effort, from tooling mindset, sharpening skillsets, to managing our collection system in Washington DC. Updating DC Water infrastructure design guidelines to summarize tried and true lessons learned from the past decades, promoting the best proactive practices in design, and impact assessments to improve risk management. Categorize recent sewer failures in Washington DC, to define the outside factors and inside factors, identify common cause(s): thinking outside the tunnel so as to gauge the sensitivity and vulnerability of the system and thus identify a threshold for open-cut and trenchless methodologies. Besides CCTV inspection, deploying sophisticated entry inspections in mission critical sewer tunnels, with non-destructive scanning and testing tools to perform at-contact inspections from inside the pipe, and to calibrate scanning and testing from outside the pipe as needed. Implementing in-house finite element model analysis of common sizes and shapes of sewer tunnels to reveal the loading conditions and in-situ capabilities so as to gauge the general as-is condition. Strategizing rehabilitation technologies to balance the effectiveness, longevity and cost: promoting a sensible discretionary composite rehabilitation design instead of a new pipe-in-pipe. Such composites appear more sustainable hydraulically and financially. Taking technical stewardship in managing spincast rehabilitation technology when lacking a consistent indirect engineering criteria among vendors, i.e., DC Water engineers do more to establish consistent design approach so that the public work contract can be assessed on equal ground.																			978-0-7844-8087-8				2017							378	388										WOS:000425812300035						
J	Beretta, GP				Beretta, Giovanni Pietro			Groundwater recharge through wells in open loop geothermal system: problems and solutions - part 1	ACQUE SOTTERRANEE-ITALIAN JOURNAL OF GROUNDWATER												In the two parts of this article, the problems related to the management of water wells as part of a low-enthalpy geothermal power plant by means of heat pumps (open loop system) are described. In many cases, in absence of discharge in surface water and/or to ensure the conservation of the resource from a quantitative point of view, a doublet system constituted by a pumping and a recharge well is provided. The clogging phenomenon often occurs in this kind of plant, affecting wells with different functions and different thermal potential related to water withdrawal and reinjection into the ground. This phenomenon is due to the presence of air bubbles, suspended solids, bacterial growth and to the chemical-physical reactions that are described in the text. Besides acknowledging the activities for recharge wells management to avoid the fracturing of the drain and the cementation, is also suggested the procedure of in situ tests that are used to properly determine the optimal well discharge, which determines the efficiency and effectiveness of the geothermal system and its economic performance. It is finally shown a regional regulation on the water quality used in an open loop.																	1828-454X						2017	6	2					41	54		10.7343/as-2017-263								WOS:000424991100005

This ecosystem is 70 Km long, and is a major regional source of urban and agricultural water supply, mainly for the municipality of Rio Grande, with ca. 250 thousand citizens. This study aims to diagnose their water quality by measuring benthic invertebrates (Shannon-Wiener diversity index, richness and abundance), use of a BMWP biotic index, physical and chemical evaluation, and applying a trophic state index. The BMWP index showed predominance of taxa indicating altered conditions and polluted waters (Sarcodina and Hydracarina). The abiotic variables indicated eutrophicated waters, chlorophyll values characteristic of eutrophic environments (>2.9 mu g.L-1), low N:P rates in sediment and water, with nitrogen limitation during most periods studied. The results of trophic state indexes indicated mesotrophic and eutrophic conditions, reaching hipereutrophic periods. The highest TSI were in Piratini river, in April 2009 and February 2011, coinciding with rice crop leaching. These results regarding nutrient concentration, nitrogen and phosphorus stoichiometry and biotic index support the need to evaluate the occupation of the surroundings of this water supply.																	1414-381X	2318-0331					2017	22								UNSP e2	10.1590/2318-0331.011716082								WOS:000424560900003

It generates extensive databases with time series of many variables and monitoring points that require the application of statistical methods for the information extraction. The application of statistical methods for frequency analysis of time series is linked to attending of the basic assumptions of randomness, homogeneity, independence, and stationarity. However, despite its importance, the verification of these assumptions in water quality literature is unusual. Therefore, the present study tests the Upper Iguacu basin water quality time series against the mentioned hypotheses. Rejection was observed in 15%, 26%, 51% e 31% for randomness, homogeneity, independence, and stationarity, respectively. The results evidenced the strong relation between monitoring strategy, data assessment and meeting of basic statistical assumptions for the analysis of water quality time series. Even with the existence of possible solutions for addressing those issues, the standard monitoring strategies, with irregular frequencies and lack of representativeness in relation to other periods, beyond commercial, act as an obstacle to their implementation.																	1414-381X	2318-0331					2017	22								UNSP e51	10.1590/2318-0331.0217160071								WOS:000424560900052

Among the main impacts observed are anoxia, hypoxia, toxic algal blooms, fish kills, loss of biodiversity and loss of bathing. This study aimed to evaluate the evolution of the trophic state of Lagoa da Conceicao, a subtropical lagoon located in an urbanized watershed on the island of Santa Catarina - Brazil. Spatio temporal patterns of stratification and eutrophication were investigated to understand the main biochemical changes over time. The water quality data were obtained from field campaigns supplemented with literature of the last 15 years. The vertical structure of the water column and the trophic state were evaluated by the stratification index and the TRIX index, respectively. Analyses of variance were performed in order to identify possible temporal variations in vertical stratification and trophic level. Eutrophication effects on biogeochemical cycles were verified through a multi-dimensional cluster analysis (MDS) and correlations between variables related to physical, chemical and biological processes were verified by principal component analysis (PCA). The results showed that the water column is homogeneous in all regions except in the central region of the lagoon, and the highest ammonia concentrations and lowest dissolved oxygen concentrations with periods of anoxia are observed in bottom waters. The study looked at the high trophic level of the lagoon and its inability to process the biogeochemical changes imposed by urban development.																	1414-381X	2318-0331					2017	22								UNSP e10	10.1590/2318-0331.011716027								WOS:000424560900011						
J	da Luz, GA; Guasselli, LA; Rocha, D				da Luz, Glenio Antonio; Guasselli, Laurindo Antonio; Rocha, Daniela			Temperature Surface of Guaiba Lake, RS, from time series of MODIS images	RBRH-REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE RECURSOS HIDRICOS												The Guaiba lake is located in an area of complex weather variation and is influenced by many atmospheric circulation systems, bringing about violent occluded fronts, and, sometimes, intense precipitation. In Rio Grande do Sul, during El Nino, air temperatures and the precipitation index are higher, contrary to La Nina. Moreover, the Guaiba Lake receives water from the Guaiba's Hydrographical Region, which corresponds to 1/3 of Rio Grande do Sul State, and is thus an important water body to the metropolitan region of Porto Alegre. Methods that seek to understand the behavior of Guaiba lake surface water temperature (LSWT) may lead to relevant information to identify periods of more or less water warming, as well as the relations between LSWT, water quality deterioration and risks to human health. This paper aims to comprehend the behavior of Guaiba LSWT during periods of climatic anomalies (El Nino/La Nina). Therefore, 418 sea surface temperature (SST) images from the MODIS sensor were processed with SeaDas 7.2 software. The quarterly averages of LSWT were obtained and compared to the climatological anomalies in Equatorial Pacific Ocean. LSWT behavior is more complex in El Nino/La Nina periods. The results show that during climatic abnormality periods there are no direct relationship between the warming/cooling of Guaiba LSWT and the warming/cooling of Equatorial Pacific Ocean's SST. The precipitation indices were more significant to the behavior of LSWT during El Nino periods, but for all periods (of climatic normality and abnormality), air temperature is what most influences LSWT. This relation occurs with climatic factors of water retention time, water entry and precipitation, and air temperature. There is a major correspondence during La Nina periods with the cooling of Guaiba LSWT only for some years. On the other hand, during El Nino periods there are no correspondences of this phenomenon with the warming of Guaiba LSWT. There are only more intense oscillations in surface temperatures than during regular and La Nina periods, but with a tendency to LSWT warming.																	1414-381X	2318-0331					2017	22								UNSP e17	10.1590/2318-0331.011716094								WOS:000424560900018

In this context, the present study aims to establish a methodology for pre-selection of wastewater treatment alternatives within watersheds. The methodology involves the combined use of water quality model, optimization technique and a set of technical and economic criteria associated with different wastewater treatment systems. To evaluate the proposed methodology there were considered different effluent disposal scenarios in the Pardo river watershed. Pardo is a major tributary of the Itapemirim river, watercourse located in the southern portion of Espirito Santo State, Brazil. The results indicated that the optimization model, that aimed to minimize wastewater treatment efficiencies within the watershed, considering watercourses self-purification capacities, selected treatment systems ranging from the combination of UASB and polishing lagoons systems to slow infiltration, treatment alternatives that presented the lowest net cost estimates. The incorporation of equity perspective between treatment systems increased the total present net cost associated with wastewater treatment within the watershed.																	1414-381X	2318-0331					2017	22								UNSP e12	10.1590/2318-0331.011716079								WOS:000424560900013

Rainwater drainage management plays a key role in urban areas, becoming increasingly complex, involving not only hydrological and hydraulic aspects, but also environmental, social and health issues, as well as other technical and high costs issues. This complexity leads, increasingly, to the use of multicriteria analysis as a support for decision-making. To deal with this, this work aimed to apply a multicriteria analysis methodology, using PROMETHEE method, to issues of urban rainwater drainage. The results indicated that the application of multiparticipative decision making and multicriteria analysis to possible scenarios of hydraulic interventions is well suited to reality.																	1414-381X	2318-0331					2017	22								UNSP e18	10.1590/2318-0331.011716006								WOS:000424560900019

However, in addition to the negative effects that dams have on the water quality of rivers, other practices such as discharge of untreated wastewater, intensive crop fertilization and fish farming have been contributing to water quality deterioration. Climate change may be another driver of water quality decrease. Increases in precipitation and drought intensities as well as temperature increase may redefine the dynamics of planktonic communities and favour species more adapted to the new environment. Water samples were collected in two reservoirs selected based on the recurrence of positive results for saxitoxins, Acarape do Meio (AM) and Sitios Novos (SN). In general, diversity in SN (1.08) was higher than in the AM (0.60). Phytoplankton dynamics in these reservoirs differ from other reservoirs in the same region of Brazil, in the sense that filamentous cyanobacteria are dominant. Furthermore, lower diversity, concentration and richness of chlorophyceae and bacillariophyceae were found in both reservoirs. Increase in diversity was observed during the intense rainy season of 2011, suggesting a slight improvement of water quality. A close inverse correlation between Cylindrospermopsis sp and other cyanobacteria was found in SN (R-2=-0.862) and in AM (R-2=-0.997) and the data collected demonstrates that a season with intensive rainfall may lead to lower cyanobacteria concentrations probably due to water dilution and higher flushing rates.																	1414-381X	2318-0331					2017	22								UNSP e6	10.1590/2318-0331.011716072								WOS:000424560900007

In this research, emphasis was placed on understanding the dynamics of organic matter (OM) in a drainage basin heavily influenced by anthropogenic activities, through the analysis and interpretation of qualitative and quantitative information. The case study was the Iguacu River basin, from its headwaters in the Metropolitan Region of Curitiba (MRC) to the municipality of Uniao da Vitoria. The results obtained showed a large deposition of labile OM in the MRC coming probably from domestic effluents, with consequent DO depletion and water quality degradation. However, after the more urbanized region, there is a reduction in the concentration of OM and the indication of the predominance of pedogenic material, suggesting that in addition to the dilution effect, there is less input of anthropogenic effluents in this region, which results in an improvement in water quality, represented mainly by the recovery of the DO concentration. The combined use of quantitative data and UV-visible spectroscopy was fundamental to comprehend the variation in the characteristics of OM and its sources along the studied section.																	1414-381X	2318-0331					2017	22								UNSP e55	10.1590/2318-0331.021720160065								WOS:000424560900056						
J	Martins, PD; Poleto, C				Martins, Patricia Diniz; Poleto, Cristiano			Principle of maximum entropy in the estimation of suspended sediment concentration	RBRH-REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE RECURSOS HIDRICOS												The concern with water quality has been promoting development of better monitoring and control techniques every day. As sediments transport most of water contaminants, their study is fundamental. Given the large number of variables for estimating sediment concentration and high costs of monitoring campaigns, it becomes necessary to develop more accessible methods which bring satisfactory practical results. Therefore, this work deals with application of the principle of maximum entropy, a probabilistic method to determine concentration of sediments in river channels with various concentrations and particle sizes. For this purpose, it was proposed a relationship between the theory of entropy parameters in order to reduce the computational effort. The results were satisfactory at concentrations above 10 g/L with R-2 greater than 0.88. The calculated squared errors in this study were lower than those found when using the theory of entropy by Tsallis and the equation of Rouse, classic models for determining the sediment concentration profile. The applicability of the proposed model and the ease of using the probabilistic method, since it reduces the amount of data needed to perform the estimate, makes it feasible on a global scale.																	1414-381X	2318-0331					2017	22								UNSP e23	10.1590/2318-0331.011716058								WOS:000424560900024

This method is insufficient given the broad variety and compositions of discharges. Therefore, the objectives of the study are to propose alternative charging mechanisms for the qualitative use of water resources, aiming to insert, beside BOD, other parameters as calculation criteria; and to evaluate the charging potential for the Doce River hydrological basin. Two methods were proposed: the Limiting Population Equivalent (LPE) and the Compromised/Committed Volume (CV). Five water quality parameters were established: Biochemical Oxygen Demand, Chemical Oxygen Demand, Total Suspended Solids, Ammonia Nitrogen, and Phosphorus. The proposed mechanisms contemplated, from a broader perspective, the real problem concerning water quality in the Doce River basin. Simulations showed that phosphorus was a problem of concern for managing water resources in the specific basin. The method of Limiting Population Equivalent was considered of easiest application and understanding by its users.

However, usually this method does not take into consideration the potentially polluting human activities, either in punctual or diffuse sources, or because the relative importance of the attributes are not considered. The paper proposes a multi-criteria approach as a way of solving this gap, reducing subjectivity and considering land use/cover due human actions influence in the process. The study was developed in Araras river watershed (Parana Basin, Brazil) using rock, groundwater, relief, soils, and land use/land cover classification, employing multi-criteria analysis and data of contamination sources. The potential contamination classification showed the predominance (54% of the area) of very high and high potential, especially due to geological environment conditions (exploitation areas and groundwater recharge of the Itarare Aquifer - clastic sedimentary and free flow). The contaminant sources analyzed are located mainly in higher potential contamination areas.

The aim of this study was to calculate time trends of loads and concentrations of eleven physical, chemical and biological parameters, in nine quality monitoring stations of the Verde River Basin from 2008 to 2014. The time series analysis was performed with different tests. First, with the verification of autocorrelation of the time series using the Spearman correlation test. Then, Kruskal-Wallis test was used to check significant differences between the seasons and, afterwards the Mann-Kendall or the Seasonal Mann-Kendall time trend tests were applied accordingly. The analysis results indicated differences between the spatial distribution of loads and concentrations for most of the parameters evaluated in this study. The results showed that the simultaneous analysis of concentration data and flow data is essential for a more comprehensive and reliable evaluation of water quality, since the changes in river flow over time can mislead the interpretation of the concentration data. Moreover, to analyze only the pollutant load data, without looking how the flow and concentration behaves, does not provide conclusive results, since it does not allow to evaluate whether changes in the load values were caused by alterations of the flow or concentration. Thus, the results indicate the need to monitor water quality along with flow measurement, providing more complete and reliable assessments of the evolution of water quality.																	1414-381X	2318-0331					2017	22								UNSP e40	10.1590/2318-0331.0117160030								WOS:000424560900041

Assessment of river water quality and ecological diversity through multivariate statistical techniques, and earth observation dataset of rivers Ghaghara and Gandak, India	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT												Water quality and ecological diversity of aquatic flora with respect to distribution in active channels and on banks of the rivers Ghaghara and Gandak have been investigated in years 2011-2012. The land use/land cover map of year 2010 showed agricultural land as the dominant class in both river basins. The appraisal of aquatic flora has indicated that the dominant plant species in numbers are as follows: macrophytic algae, aquatic angiosperms, aquatic pteridophytes, sedges, grasses, herbs, shrubs, climbers and trees collected from the banks and active channels of rivers Ghaghara and Gandak. In total, 207 plants species were reported as common in both river environments, and the remaining species have showed variability for both rivers. It was observed that the algal group showed higher species diversity in comparison to other plant groups. High numbers of macrophytic species were observed due to the alkaline pH and good level of dissolved oxygen at different sampling sites of the two rivers. Further, multivariate statistical techniques such as cluster analysis and principal component/factor analysis were applied to fulfil the knowledge gap and to identify the potential sources and types of pollutants.																	1571-5124	1814-2060					2017	15	3					347	360		10.1080/15715124.2017.1300159								WOS:000423964400010

The River Arab is monitored at the Babar dam. The later was build for drinking and industrial water supply for the local population. The impounded water is experiencing a degradation of its quality due to different types of pollution, in addition to the natural processes of erosion and leaching of various toxic elements. A total of 21 samples were collected. Eleven variables were determined on every sample representing three different sampling stations. TDS in the saline water was high in the eastern part (S1), low in the western part (S2), and intermediate in the dam (S3). The water type is SO42- - Na+ for S1, HCO3-Ca2+ - Mg2+ for S2 and SO42- - Ca2+ - Mg2+, mixed water in the dam. In the CA, 7 variables were classified into 2 clusters controlled by SO42- and 21 samples are grouped into 3 statistical groups coinciding with the stations S1, S2 and S3. Principal component analysis indicates two principal components (PCs), which explained 87% of the total variance in water quality data set. Two PCs, which are salinization and sulphates, explain 73% and 14% of the total variance, respectively. Time series analysis showed that Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, Cl- and SO42- have very similar trend to TDS and K+ have a similar pattern to NO3-. It suggests that five components control TDS. K+ and NO3- resulted from fertilizers and domestic sewage inputs from the tributaries of river.																	1571-5124	1814-2060					2017	15	3					361	372		10.1080/15715124.2017.1299157								WOS:000423964400011

Heavy metal monitoring and health risk assessment of a tropical mountainous river in Kerala, India	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT												Seasonal monitoring of surface water was performed in Meenachil River with emphasis on heavy metal quality. Mean concentration of heavy metals such as Cu, Cr, Zn and Pb during post-monsoon are comparatively higher than that in the other seasons. As and Cd concentrations are below detectable limit in all seasons. The escalated heavy metal pollution index (HPI) and contamination degree (CD) index level at the river mouth indicate a contaminated environment. Direct application of agrochemicals in the typical catchment activities like intense plantation and widespread lowland agriculture contribute heavy metals to the riverine system. The contamination index (CI) was strongly lowered during monsoon. The study has demonstrated that the mean hazard quotient falls to a permissible level throughout pre-monsoon and monsoon while the level slightly exceeds the level during post-monsoon. HPI, CD and CI indices suggest that better agricultural management practices need to be implemented in the Meenachil River basin for maintaining ecological integrity and protecting the lotic system from further degradation.																	1571-5124	1814-2060					2017	15	4					475	484		10.1080/15715124.2017.1315813								WOS:000423964600009

The different parameters indicate that the data are homogeneous. As against this record an annual variation is more important than the monthly change in connection with climate change. The facies of these waters is Cl-Na especially in connection with human actions. Values of the Water Quality Index classified the surface water as medium to good quality. The Pearson correlation analysis revealed a significant positive relationship between salinity and all variables and negative relationship between water volume of dam and all variables. The CA in R mode grouped the 16 variables into 4 clusters of similar water quality characteristics and in Q mode, 160 sampling are grouped into 2 statistically groups where total dissolve solids and capacity seem to be major distinguishing factors between variables and years. The CA has classified the data into two groups, one formed by the dry years and the other formed by wet years. The PCA and the FA applied to the datasets have resulted in two significant factors which represent 69.92% of total variance. The first factor as salinization factor explained 58.68% of the total variance. The second factor, can be called organic pollution factor, explained 11.24% of the total variance. The results of discriminant analysis showed only 11 parameters were necessary in the temporal variations analysis, affording more than 90% correct assignations.																	1571-5124	1814-2060					2017	15	2					133	143		10.1080/15715124.2016.1215325								WOS:000423964100001

This information is typically collected by field trip measurements, but these are not always feasible. Furthermore, freshwater discharge data are needed but these are generally gauged further upstream outside the tidal region and unable to reflect the individual flows entering a multi-channel estuary. With data provided by a network of fixed measurement stations only, the main goal of this paper is to set up an analytic model to simulate salinity distribution along a multi-channel estuary at high water slack. The Ma Estuary in Vietnam is considered as case study. A new approach is introduced to calibrate the parameters of a parsimonious salt intrusion model, which are typically extracted from estuary geometry measurements. Compared to the values derived from a field survey, the calibrated parameter values are in very high agreement. Furthermore, by assuming a linear relation between inverses of the individual flows entering the estuary and inverses of the sum of flows gauged further upstream, the individual flows can be assessed. Evaluation on the model simulations shows that the model explains salinity distribution along the Ma Estuary reasonably well with 75% of the simulations being satisfactory or better and with NSE values at the gauging stations being 0.50 or higher. This performance demonstrates the predictive power of the model and of the proposed parameter/input estimation approach.

Riparian and landscape disturbance effects on stream fish community composition in an agriculturally-dominated drainage	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												We compared historical stream fish community sampling and remote sensing data from 1993-2011 in an agriculturally-dominated drainage basin to determine the effects of varying levels of riparian and landscape disturbances on fish communities. Stream fish guilds were analyzed with National Land Cover Database and aerial imagery products to quantify disturbance levels at a local and watershed scale. Insectivores and benthic insectivores were associated with intact riparian areas, whereas environmentally tolerant and omnivorous species were found in environments with degraded riparian areas. Riparian disturbances had the greatest effect near the stream (0-10 m), and the effects diminished with increasing distance from the stream. This spatial scale corresponds with those reported in the literature whereby allocthonous inputs and riparian filtering influenced stream fish communities and water quality. The landscape disturbance was not a strong predictor for any fish guild, indicating that local riparian conditions were more biologically meaningful. Considering the rapid rates of land conversion to production agriculture across the midwestern United States, ensuring adequate riparian buffering of streams may help protect specialist aquatic species and their habitat. Given the broad temporal and spatial nature of our data, these results suggest that targeted conservation of the 10-m scale of intact riparian vegetation directly adjacent to streams is a sound practice and should be considered the minimum conservation goal for watershed restoration in low-gradient landscapes historically dominated by agricultural land-use practices.																	1463-4988	1539-4077					2017	20	4			SI		445	456		10.1080/14634988.2017.1368831								WOS:000423091000015

However, the level of impacts, especially on macroinvertebrates, are not well known, which is the goal of this study. Here, three biotic indices were used. The Saginaw River Basin, the largest watershed in Michigan was selected for this study. Since no know modeling package exists to evaluate the impacts of climate change on these biotic indices, a coupled modeling approach was proposed. First, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was setup to estimate streamflow and water quality for all stream segments. Next, the results from the SWAT model in combination with long-term biological monitoring data were used to develop biotic indices predictive models using a two-phase approach. An assemblage of 42 climate scenarios (2040-2060) were obtained from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which are biased corrected and statistically downscaled. The dataset provides two extreme Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) to account for best (RCP 4.5) and worst (RCP 8.5) case scenarios. The climate data were incorporated in SWAT and biotic indices predictive models to understand stream health conditions in the watershed. Results showed that the majority of streams have a probability of declining in values of biotic indices while streams that currently have excellent conditions are the most vulnerable streams to the climate change. This modeling approach provides a new mean to link more strongly biota indicators with flow regime indicators, which is of prime interest for the implementation of ecohydrology principles.

A comparative investigation on the inhibition kinetics of bioaccumulation of As(III) and As(V) ions using Bacillus arsenicus MTCC 4380	ECOHYDROLOGY & HYDROBIOLOGY												In the context of global environmental and social change, with increasing pollution and deterioration of biodiversity of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems having its deep roots in radical changes to hydrological mesocycles, there is an urgent requirement for a new approach for sustainability. The ecohydrology concept covers the entire hydrological cycle, including its atmospheric, terrestrial and aquatic phases, and the entire cycle of biological components of the environment playing a vital role as moderators of water quality and quantity. In the present study the simultaneous growth and bioaccumulation of As(III) and As(V) ions of living cells of Bacillus arsenicus MTCC 4380 was studied as a function of pH, inoculum size, concentrations of peptone and arsenic (As(III) or As(V)) ions. Although both As(III) and As(V) ions resulted in an inhibition effect on the growth of the bacteria, B. arsenicus MTCC 4380 was capable of removing. As(III) and As(V) with the maximum bioaccumulation % of 90.43 and 94.31 at 50 mg/L initial arsenic concentration, respectively at pH 7.0 and inoculum size 5% (v/v). As the maximum specific growth rate (mu(m))remained constant and the saturation constant (K '(s,app)) value increased in the presence of increasing concentrations of arsenic ions, the inhibition of As(III) or As(V) ions on the growth rate of B. arsenicus MTCC 4380 was found to be a competitive inhibition. The current investigation provides a new insight into the effect of As(III) and As(V) ions on B. arsenicus MTCC 4380, exclusively with regard to its toxicity, bioaccumulation and bioremediation potential.

An introduction to Lake of the Woods-from science to governance in an international waterbody	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Lake of the Woods (LOW), a vast lake covering over 3850 km(2), is a waterbody of current and historical significance that spans the borders between Minnesota and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Manitoba. Over the past 2 decades, there has been concern for the water quality of LOW, sparked by anecdotal evidence of increased intensity and frequency of algal blooms by the public and resource managers. Minnesota's waters of LOW were declared impaired in 2008 due to exceedances of eutrophication criteria, initiating a Total Maximum Daily Load study. LOW's impairment declaration spurred several contrasting challenges and opportunities for water quality management across this diverse lake and basin. Governance challenges are emphasized by the large number of government agencies (>25) with land or water authorities in the 70,000 km(2) basin, the variability in phosphorus standards applicable to LOW between Minnesota, Ontario, and Manitoba, and unequal funding resources allocated to LOW's water quality management agencies. Despite these challenges, there is a long history of international cooperation among agencies, recent funding increases, and the formation of a new International Joint Commission Board with the mandate to monitor ecosystem health in the entire LOW basin. As highlighted by the studies in this issue, the science of nutrient and algal dynamics in LOW is complex, and water quality restoration may take years to decades because major sources of nutrients to the lake are not subject to reductions by conventional lake restoration methods. An overview of papers in this special issue is provided.																	1040-2381	2151-5530					2017	33	4					325	334		10.1080/10402381.2017.1383539								WOS:000423047200001						
J	James, WF				James, William F.			Internal phosphorus loading contributions from deposited and resuspended sediment to the Lake of the Woods	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												The Lake of the Woods exhibits cyanobacterial blooms despite substantial declines in watershed phosphorus (P) loading since the 1970s, suggesting that internal P loads are contributing to the P budget. A better understanding of internal P loading contributions and dynamics is needed to refine management strategies and water quality goals. Sediment cores were collected from several stations within the US portion to examine potential internal P contributions from deposited and resuspended sediment. Although laboratory-derived diffusive P fluxes were highest under anaerobic conditions (8-12 mg/m(2) d), aerobic conditions at the sediment-water interface may regulate in situ diffusive P fluxes due to frequent polymixis. Although much lower under aerobic conditions, modest fluxes of 0.2-0.6 mg/m(2) d could play an important role in the P budget. Simulated resuspension indicated that the critical shear stress of deposited sediment was relatively low at 1.3-2.3 dynes/cm(2). The wind-exposed long fetches and shallow morphometry of regions of Lake of the Woods could result in frequent resuspension of P-enriched clays and silts that contribute inorganic P to the water column. Resuspended sediments exhibited a low equilibrium P concentration (near zero) and high linear adsorption coefficient (700-3200 L/kg), suggesting they may act more as a sink rather than a source for soluble P. Resuspension could compete with cyanobacterial uptake by sequestering soluble reactive P. Resuspended inorganic P could also constitute a significant portion of the water column total P composition in addition to organic P, incorporated as cyanobacterial biomass, and needs to be considered in the P budget and chlorophyll prediction.																	1040-2381	2151-5530					2017	33	4					347	359		10.1080/10402381.2017.1312647								WOS:000423047200003

Here we analyzed sediments from 6 sites in the southern basin for diverse biogeochemical (loss-on-ignition, biogenic silica, pigments) and microfossil (diatoms, chrysophytes) remains to reconstruct the environmental history of the lake. Our objectives were to quantify the magnitude and direction of historical trophic change and evaluate reasons for an apparent lack of basin recovery following documented nutrient diversion. Evidence came from fossil indicator profiles and comparisons of these long-term trends with historical land use and monitoring data. Results indicate major changes in algal communities during and following peak nutrient loading in the mid-20th century as well as more recent increases in colonial cyanobacteria and high-nutrient diatomtaxa. Combined, fossil indicators reflect an anthropogenically enriched system that has undergone substantial ecological change, particularly since similar to 1980, due to multiple drivers. Physical changes in lake thermal regime resulting from climate warming may be exacerbating internal phosphorus release from sediments, thereby lowering nitrogen: phosphorus ratios and enhancing cyanobacterial abundance. These drivers of lake condition in the lake may apply to other large shallow lakes that exhibit only limited biological recovery from reduced external nutrient loading.

Historical phosphorus dynamics in Lake of the Woods (USA-Canada) - does legacy phosphorus still affect the southern basin?	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												A historical phosphorus (P) budget was constructed for southern Lake of the Woods. Sediment cores from 7 bays were radioisotopically dated and analyzed for loss-on-ignition, P, Si, diatoms, and pigments. Geochemical records for cores were combined using focusing factors for whole-basin estimates of sediment, total P, and P fraction accumulation. Although historical monitoring shows that external P loads decreased since the 1950s, sediment P has continued to increase since the mid-20th century. Much sediment P is labile and may be mobile within the sediments and/or available for internal loading and resuspension. Two mass-balance models were used to explore historical P loading scenarios and in-lake dynamics, a static one-box model and a dynamic multi-box model. The one-box model predicts presettlement external loads were slightly less than modern loads. The dynamic model shows that water-column P was higher in the 1950s-1970s than today, that the lake is sensitive to external loads because P losses from burial and outflow are high, and that the lake is moving to a new steady state with respect to water-column P and size of the active sediment P pool. The active sediment pool built up in the mid-20th century has been depleted through outflow and burial, such that its legacy effects are now minimal. Comparison of historical nutrient dynamics and sediment records of algal production showed a counterintuitive increase in production after external P loads decreased, suggesting other drivers may now regulate modern limnoecology, including seasonality of P loading, shifting nutrient limitation, and climate warming.

Climate as a driver of increasing algal production in Lake of theWoods, Ontario, Canada	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Lake of the Woods (LOW) is a large, transboundary lake that straddles the provinces of Ontario and Manitoba, and the state of Minnesota. Although algal blooms have been reported in the lake since the early 1800s, monitoring data and anecdotal evidence suggest that toxic, cyanobacterial blooms have increased in frequency and intensity in recent years. However, total phosphorus inputs from the lake's primary tributary, the Rainy River, have declined significantly since the late 1960s. We explore this disconnect by examining spectrally-inferred determinations of chlorophyll a (Chl-a) in lake sediment cores, as a measure of past changes in aquatic primary production. Beginning in the late 1970s to early 1980s, inferred Chl-a increased at 5 impact sites in the north end of LOW that currently experience cyanobacterial blooms in late summer and autumn. In contrast, no change in Chl-a was observed at an oligotrophic reference site with much lower cyanobacteria biomass. At the impact sites, Chl-a generally showed no significant relationship to long-term trends in diatom-inferred total phosphorus concentrations, but was significantly and positively correlated to climatic variables, including mean annual air temperature at all sites and total annual precipitation at 4 sites. These data suggest that climate change may exacerbate algal blooms in this moderately-enriched lake. The results also show that the effects of climate change on aquatic production may be enhanced at sites with higher nutrient concentrations, likely because of positive feedbacks between cyanobacteria biomass, water temperature and nutrient availability. The impact of climate change should be considered carefully in future management initiatives.																	1040-2381	2151-5530					2017	33	4					403	414		10.1080/10402381.2017.1379574								WOS:000423047200007						
J	Watson, SB; Kling, H				Watson, Susan B.; Kling, Hedy			Lake of theWoods phyto- and picoplankton: spatiotemporal patterns in blooms, community composition, and nutrient status	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												This study evaluated the phytoplankton and trophic status in Lake of the Woods (LOW; Ontario, Canada), a large, multi-basin waterbody with marked gradients in water quality and annual cyanobacterial blooms. We combined a broad comparison of average total phosphorus (TP)-biomass relationships in LOW and other north temperate lakes with a detailed spatiotemporal analysis of net-, nanno-, and picoplankton, total bacterioplankton, nutrient status, and water quality across six hydrological sectors of the lake between 2008 and 2010. Average total phytoplankton biomass (TB) varied considerably among zones and years but, similar to TP, was highest in the shallower, more eutrophic southern zones with a generally lower than average TB/TP yield within the among-lakes dataset. Summer-fall blooms of N-2-fixing cyanobacteria were dominated by Aphanizomenon across most sectors except in the north, where Dolichospermum predominated. Unlike the larger size fractions, patterns in picoplankton suggested non-nutrient constraints: phycoerythrin-rich picocyanobacteria (<2 mu m) showed a distinct south-north increase correlated with water transparency, while the more abundant phycocyanin-rich fraction was related to dissolved organicmaterial with no distinct spatial patterns. Bacterial numbers were higher in surface layers and significantly related to temperature but not nutrients; spatial distribution indicated they were not directly introduced from riverine inputs. Overall, planktonic P deficiency was higher in the north and increased in late summer concurrent with N co-limitation and increases in N-2-fixers. The combined data suggest that P ultimately limits LOW plankton, but short-term N and Si deficiencies influence the plankton community composition.																	1040-2381	2151-5530					2017	33	4					415	432		10.1080/10402381.2017.1331282								WOS:000423047200008						
J	McDaniel, T; Pascoe, T				McDaniel, Tana; Pascoe, Timothy			Applying the reference condition approach to Lake of the Woods: sediment and benthic invertebrate community assessment for lake-wide management	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Lake of the Woods (LOW) is a large, international lake recently designated as impaired by the State of Minnesota due to excess nutrients and nuisance algal blooms. Concerns regarding the impacts of eutrophication have prompted the need for management tools to help to defines areas of ecosystem impairment and to monitor changes in trophic status. The goal of this study was to assess areas of potential anthropogenic impacts in LOW using a benthic macro-invertebrate reference condition approach model and identify factors correlating with these impacts. We also sought to provide baseline information on sediment chemistry prior to the initiation of increased mining activity in the basin. A Canadian Aquatic Biomonitoring Network (CABIN) reference model was developed for LOW to compare the benthic community structure at a number of potentially stressed or impaired sites. Concentrations of both nutrients and metals in sediments at many sites in LOW exceeded Ontario provincial and Canadian federal effect levels for aquatic life. The benthic community at some locations was found to be divergent from reference sites, with substantial reductions in diversity and abundance associated with stress to the benthic community. As expected, benthic invertebrate diversity appeared to be most affected at sites that were deep, thermally stratified and high in nutrients thus making them prone to hypoxia. Benthic diversity was also negatively associated with higher concentrations of metals such as lead and arsenic. The CABIN approach can provide a useful tool in lake management for the identification of stressed sites.																	1040-2381	2151-5530					2017	33	4					452	471		10.1080/10402381.2017.1379573								WOS:000423047200011

Assessing the potential zone of groundwater recharge is extremely crucial for the protection of water quality and the management of groundwater systems. To identify the groundwater potential zone in the study area, thematic layers of lithology, slope, karst degrees, land cover, lineament and drainage density were generated using topographic maps, thematic maps, field data and satellite image, and were prepared, classified, weighted and integrated in a geographic information system (GIS) environment by the means of fuzzy logic. The fuzzy membership values have been assigned to different thematic layers according to their classification on respect for their contribution and their occurrence in groundwater. Based on the generated groundwater potential map, it was found that about 8% of the investigation area was categorized as very high potential for groundwater recharge, 31% as high, 28% as moderate, 17% as low and 16% as very low potential for groundwater recharge. Finally, the results were verified using well-yield data. The highest recharge potential area is located towards the downstream regions related to more fractured and karstified limestone.																	1947-5705	1947-5713					2017	8	2					194	206		10.1080/19475705.2016.1181676								WOS:000418899200003

Monthly precipitation and temperature data for 29 climate divisions, and streamflow data for 29 naturalized gauges were analyzed. Two variations of the Mann-Kendall test, considering lag-1 auto correlation and long-term persistence, and the Pettitt test were employed to assess trends and shifts, respectively. Results indicated that streamflow increased during the winter-spring months and decreased during the summer-autumn period. Decreasing trends in winter precipitation were identified over snow-dominated regions in the upper basin. Significant increases in temperature were detected over several months. Major shifts were noticed in 1964, 1968 and in the late 1920s. Increasing temperature while decreasing streamflow and precipitation were noticed after major shifts in the 1930s, and these shifts coincided with coupled phases of El Nino Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation.																	0262-6667	2150-3435					2017	62	14					2280	2296		10.1080/02626667.2017.1372855								WOS:000418480700003

In the stream basin, natural afforestation of agricultural land began in the 1950s, and in the mid-1970s artificial drainage systems were installed in all agricultural land (70% of the total basin area). Climate variability and artificial drainage were the main factors observed to be affecting stream discharge. The changes were most evident in annual and seasonal mean, minimum and maximum streamflow. There was no effect of afforestation of agriculture land on stream discharge.

S	Angulo, J		Saldarriaga, J		Angulo, Jose			Barranquilla's Water Distribution System: A First Detailed Description	XVIII INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WATER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS, WDSA2016	Procedia Engineering				18th International Conference on Water Distribution System Analysis (WDSA)	JUL 24-28, 2016	Univ Andes, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Cartagena, COLOMBIA	Univ Andes, Water Supply & Sewers Syst Res Ctr	Univ Andes, Dept Civil & Environm Engn			Due to its great industrial and economic development, and its privileged geographical position, Barranquilla has always been one of the most important cities of Colombia. For this reason, Barranquilla is one of the most populated urban conglomerates in the country, having the obligation to ensure the coverage of public services to about 2 million people. Since 1992, the company Triple A S.A. E.S.P. has been responsible to manage, design and operate the Water Distribution System (WDS) that supplies treated water to the city, which must also supply water to 6 other municipalities in the region. To accomplish this task, the WDS has specialized facilities in each of the main stages of the process: collection, purification and distribution. Refering to collection, the system is able to take directly 7.5 m(3)/s from the Magdalena River, the principal waterway of Colombia. To achieve this, the system has a dock, a headrace channel and two pumping stations of low pressure. The water is conducted through cast iron and reinforced concrete pipes, from the pumping stations to treatment plants. To perform the potabilization process, the system has 5 Water Treatment Plants (WTPs) to ensure redundancy and security in the network. The plants have capacities ranging from 0.5 m(3)/s to 3 m(3)/s and its operations are based in the conventional treatment train of mixing-flocculation-coagulation-sedimentation-filtration-disinfection. Plant No. 5 can be highlighted, which has the largest capacity and consists of four modules. Regarding with the distribution, after the water potabilization process takes place in the main WTP, the treated water is pumped by the action of four high pressure pumping stations (6.5 m(3)/s including all the municipalities covered by the network) and is transported from the WTPs to other pumping stations located at strategic points in the city where the water is distributed to points of demand and also pumped again to another pump station located at a higher ground level to attend the new urbanizations in zones with higher elevations. This not allow a correct functioning of the distribution system by gravity. Additionally, Triple A has a laboratory of water quality control, accredited by ONAC (The National Agency for Accreditation of Colombia) and IDEAM (Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental Studies of Colombia) and authorized by the National Institute of Health in which all the characterizations required in the current Colombian legislation are performed. With the historical record of this monitoring, technical staff of Triple A is able to understand the dynamics of the river and variations in the water quality in order to identify changes that require the implementation of corrective actions.

However, these studies have focused in understanding mixing phenomena at junctions, without applying these results in water quality modeling of water distribution networks. This paper focuses on the application of both the complete and incomplete mixing models to model water quality in water distribution networks. Hydraulic networks are modelled in EPANET and EPANET-BAM, and the concentrations and their distributions are compared. Results show that there is little difference between the two mixing models, so water quality modeling might be done by using EPANET and its complete mixing model. (C) 2016 The Authors.

The DWDS offers reaction surfaces and contact time and, thus, acts as a bioreactor where biofilms develop that influence biomass dynamics. Under normal operational conditions the biofilm is in a steady state and the exchange of biomass between the biofilm and the bulk water phase is in equilibrium. When this equilibrium is disturbed, e.g. by a hydraulic incident, there is a potential of release of biomass from the biofilm leading to higher concentrations of biomass in the drinking water. This could lead to a discolouration event and may have an impact on microbial water quality. The main issue for a water company is to know where in the network the risk of these disturbances of the equilibrium is the largest and what control measures can be taken. The goal of our research is to combine and improve water quality models and a hydraulic network model to determine high and low risk locations in the DWDS with respect to bacterial biomass. As a first result a conceptual model, with parameter values based on internationally published laboratory and in situ measurements in the DWDS, has been developed. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Extensive studies have acknowledged the risk posed to large populations by an accidental or intentional contamination intrusion within a WDS; failure of an early warning system (EWS) to report a contamination event carries profound economic and public health consequences. Dynamic, stochastic conditions exist in municipal WDSs and a monitoring system needs to be designed according to a robust protocol that incorporates the inherent uncertainty in WDS operation, including: demand variability, and contamination event characteristic variability. This work composes the problem of locating the best junctions within a WDS to place fixed monitoring stations, and the best junctions to input innovative inline mobile sensors, in a multi-objective framework that incorporates uncertainty in the network's demands and EWS operation. Mobile sensors are carried by flow within pipes sampling and monitoring water quality in real time, and wirelessly uploading data to fixed transceiver beacons, providing an implicit preference towards demand dense regions. A multi-objective noisy messy genetic algorithm is structured to the problem at hand and employed on a small, medium, and large-scale model WDS to calculate near-optimal solutions from the large solutions space. This multi-objective framework provides high performing trade off (Pareto) sets comparing an EWS's system cost to numerous performance objectives incorporating non-deterministic objective functions to provide a high performing and resilient EWS. Results show a large trade off surface between the cost and the respective system's performance, with large diminishing returns. Although implementing a more expensive solution may provide little to no benefit from a traditional performance standpoint, implementing a system of higher cost can increase the systems resiliency, highlighting the importance of incorporating proper objective measures in optimization procedure.

Predicting the formation of haloacetonitriles and haloacetamides by simulated distribution system tests	XVIII INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WATER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS, WDSA2016	Procedia Engineering				18th International Conference on Water Distribution System Analysis (WDSA)	JUL 24-28, 2016	Univ Andes, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Cartagena, COLOMBIA	Univ Andes, Water Supply & Sewers Syst Res Ctr	Univ Andes, Dept Civil & Environm Engn			Unintended chemical reactions between disinfectants and natural organic matter (NOM) or anthropogenic compounds in natural waters result in the formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs) during drinking water treatment. To date, numerous groups of disinfection by-products have been identified in drinking water, some of which are suspected to be of public health importance and thus are regulated in the water industry. Recent studies have suggested that some unregulated nitrogen-containing DBPs, such as haloacetonitriles (HANs) and haloacetamides (HAcAms), may have greater toxicity than the currently regulated groups (trihalomethanes, THMs, and haloacetic acids, HAAs). There is only sparse information on the behaviour of the HANs and HAcAms in distribution systems. It is however known that HANs can be hydrolysed to the HAcAms, which in turn can hydrolyse to form dihaloacetic acids (DHAAs). Simulated distribution systems tests (SDS) have been successfully applied to predict the formation of THMs and HAAs using a simple and inexpensive lab-based technique, and have been recommended by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to American water utilities for collecting information about the levels of DBPs occurring in their distribution systems. SDS tests aim to simulate the water quality, disinfectant residuals, and water ages of a real distribution system, allowing easy sampling at prescribed time intervals for analysis of DBP formation. These tests are also a useful tool for considering the impact of potential changes to distribution practices, such as switching from chlorination to chloramination, for example. Therefore, a sampling survey was conducted in four surface water treatment plants in the UK to examine the formation of HANs and HAcAms in both real distribution systems and SDS tests. The samples were extracted using liquid-liquid extraction and analysed by gas chromatography with electron capture detection (GC-ECD). The research sought to determine whether SDS can be a useful predictive tool for HANs and HAcAms in distribution systems and what levels of prediction error are to be expected. (C) 2016 The Authors.

DL has been widely applied to big data analytics, graphics object detection, classification, voice recognition and many other problems. This paper presents an integrated data-driven modelling framework that couples DL with the well-developed evolutionary optimization tool in a scalable and heterogeneous high performance computing paradigm. The integrated framework enables modellers to effectively and efficiently construct a model with a given dataset. It is demonstrated that the framework has wide applicability including but not limited to the simulation, optimization and operation decision of water distribution systems. The paper elaborates the development of the deep learning framework with potential applications of facilitating the data fusion, system simulation and predictive analysis, anomaly detection from the time series data (pressures, flows and consumptions etc.), water usage prediction, construction of a meta-model as a surrogate to the physics-based models (hydraulic and water quality) for water distribution management.

Exact skeletonization method in water distribution systems for hydraulic and quality models	XVIII INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WATER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS, WDSA2016	Procedia Engineering				18th International Conference on Water Distribution System Analysis (WDSA)	JUL 24-28, 2016	Univ Andes, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Cartagena, COLOMBIA	Univ Andes, Water Supply & Sewers Syst Res Ctr	Univ Andes, Dept Civil & Environm Engn			A mathematical model is a powerful tool for simulating different scenarios that occur in a water distribution network without making physical experimentation. According to the objectives, a model can be classified into three categories: layout, design and operation. Furthermore, the level of detail is strongly related to the objective that the model tries to achieve. However, bigger amount of information does not mean better accuracy. For example, a fully detailed mathematical model of the network would lead to know every single connection. Usually, this information is so difficult to compile as imprecise. Therefore, one of the most important stages in elaborating a model consists of the model simplification, also known as skeletonization. During the works made for model skeletonization some assumptions are made. Most of the times, these assumptions may produce significant errors. Among the different techniques for network skeletonization, series pipe removal is one of the most used. It consists of replacing several adjacent pipes with a single one which must present the same head losses than the pipes being substituted. When there are no intermediate consumptions the problem has been effectively solved. The problem arises when a demand appears in one of the pipes being removed. It has been demonstrated that methods which assume constant roughness coefficients (either Hazen-Williams or Darcy equations) produce errors in the head losses. These errors may be even higher if travel time is included as a restriction, for example in water quality models. This paper reviews the most common techniques for serial pipes association. The error will be evaluated in both hydraulic and quality models. Finally, a method for exact substitution of serial pipes with intermediate demands is proposed. This method imposes two restrictions (head losses and travel time) and gives exact results when the flow direction is known. The method is tested with an example that highlights the results.

With some exceptions, at most nodes in a model, complete mixing occurs and the concentration after mixing can be given by a standard materials balance equation. This paper used benchtop batch mixing tests and a lab scale physical model of a water distribution system to test the hypothesis that standard water quality models based on a simple materials balance can be used to track turbidity through a water system. The results showed that as long as the components being mixed had similar concentration vs. Turbidity relationships, a materials balance was accurate but the accuracy decreased as the particle properties of the components differed.

In the present work the possibility to reduce the vulnerability of the population exposed to TTHMs by the optimal operational interventions in water distribution systems is explored. The proposed approach is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem with two objective functions, the number of the operations and the maximum TTHMs concentration that occurs at each node in the network during time, both to minimize. The feasible operational actions concern opening/closing valves and hydrants and turning pumping stations for a fixed time. The AMGA 2 optimizer [2] is used herein for solving the problem, coupled with a module coded in C++, where the implementation of the EPANET Programmers Toolkit functions allows to run the hydraulic and water quality simulations and to calculate the objective functions.

Three failure modes were considered for examining the risk. The risk has been defined imitating the original definition of Hashimoto's vulnerability, and expressed as the failure magnitude with respect to each level of service provided at a certain location and during a certain period of time. When assessing the risk rather than focusing on just one aspect the overwhelming task has been used for better evaluation and mitigation of the overall risk. The model was developed using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) coupled with Fuzzy Set Theory. The first assigns weight for each kind of risk that reflects its relative importance among the other risks. The second is a fuzzy building methodology that employs the assigned weight and others external information to harmonize all risks into a unique platform and allow one to obtain the system's overall risk. The model has been implemented and tested through the real network of Matera city. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

More than twenty years after its appearance, it has become a global reference both for hydraulic and quality analysis of water networks. In 2000, EPANET 2 appears, which includes as most important computational feature a new Toolkit. This toolkit was a library of functions allowing the modification of network data and reading results without access to the appropriate files. Over time, the use of this library has been the communication protocol for every application developers who use the method propose by Todini and Pilati to analyze the behavior of WDN. This library also provides interface tools that allow the execution of a simulation from an external application, as long as the network characteristics had been previously defined. This paper presents a change in the original EPANET model, including a new menu in the graphical user interface (GUI). This menu allows users to set up a personal collection of Add-In tools, which use both project data and simulation results. These tools can be customized and allows to extend the analysis capability of EPANET. All of them can access EPANET functions through the Toolkit and were developed by the authors during the Spanish translation of EPANET, taking into account the homologous Add-in tools developed for SWMM model. As an example of the operation and capabilities of this new menu, several applications integrated as EPANET add-in tools are presented. These tools perform tasks such as importing data network from both CAD and GIS systems, the design of WDNs using genetic algorithms, automatic assignment of initial water quality to network nodes; the skeletonization of a network or optimization of pumping schedule in the network in order to achieve a minimum energy cost.

A decade of drinking water advisories: Historical evidence of frequency, duration and causes	CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL												Maintaining acceptable drinking water quality is a challenge in Canadian First Nations communities, resulting in many residents experiencing frequent drinking water advisories (DWAs). Detailed information about drinking water systems on reserves was combined with 11 years of advisory data to consolidate existing data sets and to understand historical trends. Patterns related to the frequency, duration and causes of advisories are summarized. The results show that the total number of DWAs has increased over the last decade despite recent attention, policy renewal and funding commitments. The frequency and duration of DWAs vary according to location, source type, system size and operator certification. Facilities relying on surface water have a higher likelihood of experiencing DWAs, and systems without fully trained operators are more likely to experience long-lasting DWAs. Findings indicate the need exists to maintain an up-to-date record of First Nations system information to close existing data gaps.																	0701-1784	1918-1817					2017	42	4					378	390		10.1080/07011784.2017.1387609								WOS:000416548800006

D.; Ewers, Robert M.; Reynolds, Glen			Effects of different land-use on suspended sediment dynamics in Sabah (Malaysian Borneo) - a view at the event and annual timescales	HYDROLOGICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) and the duration of high SSC are important for river ecology and water resource conservation. Using annual and storm-event datasets, this paper explores the hypothesis that key suspended sediment variables increase along a land-use disturbance gradient in hilly terrain in Sabah (Malaysian Borneo). Five small (1.7-4.6 km(2)) catchments of increasing disturbance history - primary forest, old growth virgin jungle reserve, twice-logged forest, multiple-logged forest and mature oil palm - were instrumented from late 2011 with dataloggers and sensors to record river stage, turbidity and rainfall. The oil palm catchment had 4-12 times greater mean discharge-weighted SSC (587 mg L-1), annual sediment yield (1128 t km(-2) y(-1)), median event peak SSC, and duration of SSC above 1000 mg L-1 than in the other catchments. The multiple-logged catchment (last logged around 2004) has SSC characteristics close to values for primary forest, possibly due to increased ground protection against erosion afforded by low understorey regrowth and/or depletion of erodible sediment by multiple logging episodes. Results demonstrate that in hilly terrain even heavily logged rainforest has high value in safeguarding water quality and reducing erosion, whereas oil palm requires careful land management, especially of road runoff and ground cover.																	1882-3416						2017	11	1					79	84		10.3178/hrl.11.79								WOS:000416311100013

The aim was to evaluate the physical-water properties of the soil in no-tillage, conventional tillage and native forest area. Undisturbed soil samples were collected in the layers: 0.00-0.10; 0.10-0.20; 0.20-0.30; 0.30-0.40 and 0.40-0.50 m. The experimental design was completely randomized in subdivided plots scheme; the plots were constituted by conventional planting system (CPS), no-tillage system (NTS) and native forest (NF), and the subplots were the soil layers. The attributes analyzed were total porosity, soil density, available water capacity and water retention curve in the soil. For each variable evaluated, the analysis of variance and the comparison of means (Tukey p> 0.05) were performed. The NTS and CPS provide changes in the physical properties of the soil and in the shape of the water retention curves in the soil. NTS and CPS do not influence soil density in the superficial layer (0.00-0.10 m). The no-tillage system causes higher subsurface compaction (0.10-0.20 m) and provides less retention of water in the soil when compared to CPS and NF, possibly these attributes vary according to the cultivation time.																	2316-6886					JAN-APR	2017	6	1					87	94										WOS:000413688800001						
J	Xin, XK; Yin, W; Li, KF				Xin, Xiao-kang; Yin, Wei; Li, Ke-feng			Estimation of non-point source pollution loads with flux method in Danjiangkou Reservoir area, China	WATER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING												The estimation of non-point source pollution loads into the Danjiangkou Reservoir is highly significant to environmental protection in the watershed. In order to overcome the drawbacks of traditional watershed numerical models, a base flow separation method was established coupled with a digital filtering method and a flux method. The digital filtering method has been used to separate the base flows of the Hanjiang, Tianhe, Duhe, Danjiang, Laoguan, and Qihe rivers. Based on daily discharge, base flow, and pollutant concentration data, the flux method was used to calculate the point source pollution load and non-point source pollution load. The results show that: (1) In the year 2013, the total inflow of the six rivers mentioned above accounted for 95.9% of the total inflow to the Danjiangkou Reservoir. The total pollution loads of chemical oxygen demand (CODMn) and total phosphorus (TP) from the six rivers were 58.20 +/- 10 3 t and 1.863 +/- 10 3 t, respectively, and the non-point source pollution loads were 39.82 +/- 10 3 t and 1.544 +/- 10 3 t, respectively, indicating that the non-point source pollution is a major factor (with a contribution rate of 68.4% for CODMn and 82.9% for TP). (2) The Hanjiang River is the most significant contributor of pollution loads to the Danjiangkou Reservoir, and its CODMn and TP contribution rates reached 79.3% and 83.2%, respectively. The Duhe River took the second place. (3) Non-point source pollution mainly occurred in the wet season in 2013, accounting for 80.8% and 90.9% of the total pollution loads of CODMn and TP, respectively. It is concluded that the emphasis of pollution control should be placed on non-point source pollution. (C) 2017 Hohai University.

Assessment of long-term trends for management of Candlewood Lake, Connecticut, USA	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Candlewood Lake, the largest;lake in Connecticut, is a pumped-storage reservoir formed in the 1920s for hydropower generation. Since its inception, the lake has experienced shifts in water quality coupled with watershed development and, in the 1980s, the introduction and spread of the invasive macrophyte, Myriophyllum spicatum. In response, a monitoring program to track water quality, and a winter drawdown program to mitigate growth of M. spicatum were initiated in 1985. Recently it was sugpested that the drawdovvn program exacerbated eutrophication of the lake. To test this hypothesis, statistical analyses of the long-term (1985 to 2012) database was conducted with a focus on trophicrelated variables. We examined the database using principal component analysis (PCA) and multivarite singular spectrum analysis (MSSA). MSSA is an extension of PCA for multivariate time series data that accounts for both temporal and cross-sectional dependencies We found no evidence that the trophic condition declined, or that the drawdowns have deteriorated the water quality. Instead, we found that lower TS, TSIchi, and TSSD values corresponding with improved trophic conditions occurred in summers following deep drawdowns, while significantly higher values correlated with shallow and less effective drawdowns. Overall, there has been a modest improvement in the trophic condition overtime, attributed to a combination of the winter drawdowns and management efforts. In contrast, a steady and significant increase in dissolved salts, likely due to enhanced use of road deicing treatments, was documented.																	1040-2381	2151-5530					2017	33	3					280	300		10.1080/10402381.2017.1335812								WOS:000410569400008

In some regions of the lake, fish habitat that was formerly dominant has disappeared completely. A few areas of desirable habitatpersist as a result of purposeful restoration actions, and these areas provide important conservation and restoration opportunities. In this study, the ecological conditions of Qianling Lale were assessed to identify hydrodynamic conditions, sediment deposition, and fish habitat suitability to recommend strategies for, improving and restoring, these areas. Two restoration strategies, "flood flush" and "add an artificial island were proposed and modeled to predict the restoration effects. Simulation results showed that the restoration scheme "add an artificial island' could improve spinibarbus (Spinibarbus sinensis Bleeker) habitat quality. The analysis also indicated that this restoration strategy could succeed in restoring the fish habitat under natural dynamic processes.																	1040-2381	2151-5530					2017	33	3					301	313		10.1080/10402381.2017.1336739								WOS:000410569400009

Phytoplankton ecology of a culturally eutrophic embayment: Hamilton Harbour, Lake Ontario	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Hamilton Harbour is a chronically eutrophic embayment located at the western end of Lake Ontario that has experienced many decades of agricultural, industrial, and urban contamination. It has been identified as an Area of Concern under the terms of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement between Canada and the United States. This study examines the ecology of the phytoplankton communities at one centrally located station during the ice-free period (May-October) of three non-consecutive years: 2002, 2004 and 2006. This was the first comprehensive study to be conducted since the 1970s. It was found that the phytoplankton communities are diverse and fluctuate throughout the year, along with changing nutrient, physical and environmental conditions. No consistent patterns of seasonal succession were observed throughout the study. Phytoflagellates including Cryptophyceae and Dinophyceae had a tendency to outnumber and out-compete other phytoplankton since they are mobile and able to seek out optimal habitats within the water column. For a highly eutrophic water body, algal biomass (annual mean approximate to 2.0 g m(-3)) was lower than expected and more consistent with mesotrophic conditions-an observation first made by researchers in the 1970s and attributed to the highly variable physical environment. While our study supports these earlier results, we also conclude that zooplankton grazing likely has a significant role in limiting the size of the algal standing crop. Several algal bloom events were captured during our study. In addition to the somewhat predictable blooms of Diatomeae in the spring and Cyanophyta in the summer, we also observed blooms of Cryptophyceae and Dinophyceae. In one case we observed a bloom with no dominant taxon-it contained a diverse mixture of Cryptophyceae, Euglenophyta and Dinophyceae-challenging the commonly held notion that algal blooms are essentially monocultures. Our results show that such a variable and stressed ecosystem requires frequent sampling to capture the rapid changes that occur.																	1463-4988	1539-4077					2017	20	3			SI		201	213		10.1080/14634988.2017.1307678								WOS:000410570900002

Elevated zooplankton production in a eutrophic Lake Ontario embayment: Hamilton Harbour 2002-2014	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Hamilton Harbour is an Area of Concern in western Lake Ontario, long stressed by cultural eutrophication, urbanization and invasive species. Despite high nutrient levels leading to hypolimnetic hypoxia and contaminated sediment, it is a highly productive environment. To better understand zooplankton dynamics in Hamilton Harbour, we conducted biweekly May to October sampling of zooplankton and rotifer composition at open water harbour sites from 2002-2014. May to October zooplankton density, dry biomass and total production averaged 265 +/- 16 animals l(-1), 306 +/- 19 mg m(-3) and 4131 +/- 359 mg m(-3), (+/- SE), respectively. These values are among the highest reported in the Great Lakes, with biomass two to seven times greater than in other eutrophic embayments. Zooplankton populations and taxonomic seasonality have remained relatively stable in Hamilton Harbour since 2002. Biomass is often dominated by smaller taxa such as Bosmina, Eubosmina and juvenile copepods, suggestive of high fish planktivory, but Daphnia retrocurva and D. galeata mendotae are also dominant during the summer, indicating improvements in the zooplankton community since the 1970s when Daphnia and cyclopoids were uncommon. Conversely, rotifers have declined over the last 40 years, though while still numerically dominant, now comprise <4% of total biomass and production compared to 40% in the 1970s. Both adult Dreissenid Mussels and their veliger larvae are less abundant in Hamilton Harbour compared to nearshore Lake Ontario. Zooplankton appear to be effectively utilizing high production rates of edible algae and microorganisms in the harbour. More work is needed to explore trophic interactions in this eutrophic ecosystem and the effects of hypolimnetic hypoxia on the zooplankton community.																	1463-4988	1539-4077					2017	20	3			SI		230	241		10.1080/14634988.2017.1294425								WOS:000410570900004

Temperature is one of the rate-controlling parameters for many chemical and microbiological processes and is, therefore, considered as a surrogate parameter for water quality processes. In this study, a mathematical model is presented that predicts temperature dynamics of the drinking water in DDWSs. A full-scale DDWS resembling a conventional system was built and run according to one year of stochastic demands with a time step of 10s. The drinking water temperature was measured at each point-of-use in the systems and the data-set was used for model validation. The temperature model adequately reproduced the temperature profiles, both in cold and hot water lines, in the full-scale DDWS. The model showed that inlet water temperature and ambient temperature have a large effect on the water temperature in the DDWSs.

The Sebou river estuary is an area with high agricultural potential becoming one of the most important industrial zones in Morocco. However, salt water intrusion along the estuary is a natural phenomenon that affects the economic development of the whole region. Analytical models of salinity distribution are simple and efficient tools to study salt intrusion in alluvial estuaries since they require minimum data for their application. In this paper, an analytical model based on Savenije theory is used to assess salinity variation in the Sebou river estuary. A two optimization key parameters of the model (Van Der Burgh's and dispersion coefficients) are estimated by comparing computed and observed salinity distribution for high water slack and low water slack. Additionally, statistical performance evaluation and sensitivity analysis were conducted on the model results. The results show good agreement with salinity observations, which suggests that the predictive model can be used to obtain a first-order estimation of salt intrusion along the Sebou estuary axis.																	2324-9676						2017	5	1					40	50		10.1080/23249676.2015.1124029								WOS:000409046700005

Calibration of these devices requires sampling campaigns to elaborate relations between recorded spectra and measured concentrations. In order to build robust calibration data sets, several spectra must be recorded per sample. This study compares two approaches - principal component analysis and data depth theory - to identify outliers and select the most representative spectrum (MRS) among the repetitively recorded spectra. Detection of samples that contain outliers is consistent between the methods in more than 70% of the samples. Identification of spectra as outliers is consistent in more than 95% of the cases. The identification of MRS differs depending on the approach used. In their current form, both of the proposed approaches can be used for outlier detection and identification. Further studies are suggested to combine the methods and develop an automated ranking and sorting system.																	1573-062X	1744-9006					2017	14	9					908	921		10.1080/1573062X.2017.1280515								WOS:000407953200004

Impact of combined sewer overflow on urban river hydrodynamic modelling: a case study of the Chicago waterway	URBAN WATER JOURNAL												Combined sewer overflow (CSO) can be a critical inflow source for urban rivers during storm events. This paper presents a case study of the Chicago waterway. A three-dimensional (3D) river hydrodynamic model was developed and integrated with an urban rainfall-runoff model using the Open Modelling Interface (OpenMI). Both the effects of CSO discharge on river and river water levels on CSO outlets were considered by the integrated model. A historical storm, which was similar to a 100-year return period rain event, was simulated and compared with field measurements. This study highlights the necessity of quantifying CSO for hydraulic modelling of urban rivers under extreme storm event conditions, and shows that an integrated hydrologic and hydraulic approach can be used to address this challenge. The 3D river hydrodynamic model can deal with the complex hydrodynamics at river confluences and provide better hydrodynamic results for water quality modelling in the future.

Data entered in the tables are analysed according to the limit MAC values, whereas the major anions and cations entered in the application show physical and chemical parameters important for the classification of irrigation water. The application calculates the values of electrical conductivity (EC), total hardness (TH), non-carbonate hardness (NCH), total dissolved solids (TDS), sodium percentage (Na%), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), permeability index (PI) and total salts concentration (TSC). In addition to these parameters, the application can be used for checking potential incrustation and corrosion issues when the analysed water is used.																	1330-1144						2017	25	100					93	98										WOS:000407251700004

The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether water from selected springs close to popular visitor spots is suitable for drinking at the sampling time. Water samples were collected on 11 December 2016 from the springs Vidovec, Bacun, Bliznec, the spring at the top of the Leustek trail and from the Queen's Well. The number of total heterotrophic bacteria, faecal coliforms, intestinal enterococci and bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas as well as the concentrations of suspended solids and pH of water were determined. The analysis results indicate that water from the springs Vidovec, Bacun and Bliznec was suitable for drinking at the sampling time, whereas water from the spring at the top of the Leustek trail (due to excessive heterotrophic bacteria numbers) and water from the Queen's Well (due to Escherichia coli found in one sample) were unsuitable for drinking at the sampling time. In order to gain a more comprehensive insight regarding the suitability for drinking of water from the investigated springs, a systemic monitoring of water quality should be performed.																	1330-1144						2017	25	99					13	16										WOS:000407249700003

This is consequent upon the failure of government to provide safe water to the people. This paper looks at the vulnerability of HDWs in the core area of Akure, Nigeria. The study area is made up of 11 residential quarters with 1149 buildings; 10% of buildings and five wells in each quarter were randomly selected for the study. Data were collected using structured questionnaires and laboratory examinations. Water quality assessment showed that most parameters fall within WHO permissible limits for drinking water. However, microbial examinations indicated that drinking water quality was compromised in two residential quarters as there was evidence of coliform and e-coli. The study also identified other possible sources of water contamination in the study area. This paper recommends regular treatment of wells and the adoption of pipe-borne water supply systems in the city and other similar cities in developing countries.																	1573-062X	1744-9006					2017	14	8					797	803		10.1080/1573062X.2016.1254257								WOS:000406135200004

Bryan; Lundy, Lian			Assessing the impact of swales on receiving water quality	URBAN WATER JOURNAL												Swales are one type of sustainable drainage system (SuDS) which contribute to the management of water quality in receiving waterbodies. Using a semi-quantitative approach, an impact assessment procedure is applied to the residual water quality that is carried forward to surface waters and groundwaters following treatment within a swale. Both volumetric and pollutant distributions are considered as stormwater passes through the swale system. The pollutant pathways followed by TSS, nitrate, chloride, metals (Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn) and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are determined for a swale receiving highway runoff. For TSS, metals and PAHs between 20% and 29% of the total mean influent pollutant load is predicted to be directed to infiltration through the underlying soils compared to between 4% and 16% of chloride and nitrate. Although surface water impacts are deemed possible, the discharges of swales to groundwaters are assessed to represent a negligible impact for effectively maintained systems.																	1573-062X	1744-9006					2017	14	8					839	845		10.1080/1573062X.2017.1279187								WOS:000406135200009

The use of bed sediments in water quality studies and monitoring programs	INTEGRATING MONITORING AND MODELLING FOR UNDERSTANDING, PREDICTING AND MANAGING SEDIMENT DYNAMICS	Proceedings of the International Association of Hydrological Sciences (IAHS)				ICCE Symposium - Integrating Monitoring and Modelling for Sediment Dynamics	JUL 11-15, 2017	Okehampton, ENGLAND	ICCE, Int Assoc Hydrol Sci				In most water quality monitoring programs, either filtered water (dissolved) or suspended sediment (either whole water or separated suspended sediment) are the traditional sample media of choice. This results both from regulatory requirements and a desire to maintain consistency with long-standing data collection procedures. Despite the fact that both bed sediments and/or flood plain deposits have been used to identify substantial water quality issues, they rarely are used in traditional water quality monitoring programs. The usual rationale is that bed sediment chemistry does not provide the temporal immediacy that can be obtained using more traditional sample media (e.g., suspended sediment, water). However, despite the issue of temporal immediacy, bed sediments can be used to address/identify certain types of water quality problems and could be employed more frequently for that purpose. Examples where bed sediments could be used include: (1) identifying potential long-term monitoring sites/water quality "hot spots", (2) establishing a water quality/geochemical history for a particular site/area, and (3) as a surrogate for establishing mean/median chemical values for suspended sediment.																	2199-899X						2017	375						11	17		10.5194/piahs-375-11-2017								WOS:000406401700003

Economic valuation of river restoration: An analysis of the valuation literature and its uses in decision-making	WATER RESOURCES AND ECONOMICS												This paper provides an analysis of existing non-market valuations of river restoration primarily in the United States and Europe. The goals of the river restoration in terms of ecosystem services are identified, as are the valuation methods used. More than two-thirds of the 38 river restorations reviewed sought to restore and protect fish populations, including in many cases threatened or endangered species. River restorations were also frequently undertaken to improve wildlife habitat, and water quality for boating. In terms of the use of non-market valuations in decision making, six of 38 restorations reviewed involved benefit-cost analyses or environmental assessments or equivalent decision documents. While both revealed preference and stated preference methods were used for valuing river restorations, the majority of restoration valuations (27 out of 38, about 70%) utilized stated preference methods such as the contingent valuation method (CVM) and choice experiments (CE). Annual willingness-to-pay per household estimated from the stated preference methods appear logically and positively related to the miles of river restored demonstrating weak scope.																	2212-4284					JAN	2017	17				SI		9	19		10.1016/j.wre.2016.12.001								WOS:000405585100002

Constructed treatment wetlands are low-cost, require minimal maintenance, can be implemented in a decentralized fashion, and contribute to ecosystem preservation. All of these reasons have brought treatment wetlands to the forefront for consideration by communities working to reduce CSOs and improve water quality, especially in small cities with limited resources. Goals of this study were to compare the removal of stormwater pollutants including total suspended solids (TSS), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) through subsurface flow (SSF) and free-water surface (FWS) wetland configurations. Additionally, each wetland system was composed of multiple basins optimized to remove certain stormwater contaminants. Stormwater, pond and synthetic waters were used to test the efficiency of contaminant removal. Over the course of two years, undergraduate students built wetlands and performed experiments to investigate contaminate removal efficiency. Overall, we found that both wetlands were effective in removing TSS, BOD and nitrate. BOD removal (up to 47%) occurred in the basins with highest organic content, and TSS (up to 82%), nitrate (58-88%) and nitrite (up to 50%) removal occurred in the basins with the highest sand content. The FWS configuration was advantageous for nitrate and nitrite removal, but was not significantly more effective than the SSF. We did not observe significant phosphate removal. Follow up studies will consider additional wetland configurations and operational methods.																			978-0-7844-8059-5				2017							10	33										WOS:000405216400002

It is surrounded by local agricultural activities and one seasonal river is terminated to it. Due to recent years the aquatic life of Zarivar Lake was under serious threat. Water quality study is one of the substantial measures that could be carried out since water quantity has been subjected to drought and low precipitation. Field study was planned in structured regular sampling stations in two straight routes and 24 samples in aggregation. Hypoxia potential investigation in closed shallow water body via current standards was done. Results of analysis demonstrate the potential of hypoxia in closed shallow water body. Significant effects of geological characteristics in hypoxia potential in figure out due to matrix analysis. Comparison of the results with the long-term data on water quality led the conclusion toward a suggestion on the effects of water catchments' activities during land use and land cover (LU/LC) changes over the years. Sources of nutrients associated biological parameters and macro indicators like submerged plants continue to verify and strengthen the relationship between the nitrogen loads of the LU/LC changes. The additional findings support the new hypoxia potential indicator in Zarivar Lake.																			978-0-7844-8059-5				2017							511	518										WOS:000405216400047

The World Bank also noted Panama's progress in the last decade by reporting a remarkable decrease in poverty and increase in access to improved water and sanitation (World Bank 2016). Despite improvements at the national level, pockets of extreme poverty persist in rural areas, especially in the comarcas, the indigenous provinces of Panama. The first two authors served with the U.S. Peace Corps as water and sanitation volunteers in two such remote communities on the Comarca Ngabe Bugle. Both observed how the presence of water and sanitation infrastructure could be counted as "coverage" by the national government and bilateral aid agencies. However, without regular water quality testing, system maintenance, or the presence of a regulating body, calculations of "coverage" fail to capture the reality facing Panama's rural poor. Field research focused on how the connectivity between urban and rural spaces affects water and sanitation system functionality, as well as the relationship between micro-watershed management and water quality.																			978-0-7844-8059-5				2017							687	693										WOS:000405216400061

Relative change in stream discharge from a tropical watershed improves predictions of fecal bacteria in near-shore environments	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES												Statistical models poorly predict bacteria in near-shore environments of tropical islands due to inaccuracies in runoff and discharge characterization of storm events. Intense, short duration storms on small, steeply sloped watersheds produce high rates of runoff, resulting in rapid pulses of discharge that influence the physical and physiological conditions of the fate and transport of pathogens. As such, increasing rates of discharge are expected to have a different influence on sediment transport and pathogen load compared to decreasing rates of discharge. Regression modeling was used to examine the affect of antecedent streamflow on the interaction between environmental parameters and two fecal indicator bacteria, enterococci and Clostridium perfringens. Including the relative change in discharge incorporates a proximate representation of the energy available to transport particulates, improving predictions of near-shore water quality. Understanding factors that influence pathogen loads improves management of watersheds and protects public health.																	0262-6667	2150-3435					2017	62	9					1381	1393		10.1080/02626667.2017.1310381								WOS:000404851900004

Arsenic Removal Potential Using Naturally Occurring Iron in Groundwater: A Geo-Spatial Assessment of Household Potable Drinking Water in Bangladesh	WORLD ENVIRONMENTAL AND WATER RESOURCES CONGRESS 2017: GROUNDWATER, SUSTAINABILITY, AND HYDRO-CLIMATE/CLIMATE CHANGE					17th Annual World Environmental and Water Resources Congress	MAY 21-25, 2017	Sacramento, CA	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Environm & Water Resources Inst				Arsenic removal from drinking water by co-precipitation with naturally occurring iron is considered a low-cost water treatment option at the household level but its efficiency depends on the concentration of iron as well as other competing phosphate and silicate salts present in water. This study utilizes the available household-level potable water quality data to estimate upazilla-wise arsenic removal efficiency applying a previously developed competitive sorption model. Assuming a neutral pH and no competing anions, for varying arsenic and iron concentration combinations in potable water, a removal efficiency ranging from 6.34% to 100% is estimated. But considering the interference of phosphate and silicate salts the maximum removal efficiency can potentially be reduced to 71.38%. Consequently, the population exposure in Bangladesh to arsenic contamination above WHO guideline value of 10 ppb, which is currently 32.59%, can only be reduced to 27.77% if interference of phosphate and silicate salts are taken into consideration. These estimates show that treatment of arsenic-contaminated water by co-precipitation with naturally occurring iron will only be marginally efficient for Bangladesh given the prevailing groundwater composition.																			978-0-7844-8061-8				2017							147	160										WOS:000404787300015

Evaluation of Soil Mixes in Shallow Bioretention Systems	WORLD ENVIRONMENTAL AND WATER RESOURCES CONGRESS 2017: GROUNDWATER, SUSTAINABILITY, AND HYDRO-CLIMATE/CLIMATE CHANGE					17th Annual World Environmental and Water Resources Congress	MAY 21-25, 2017	Sacramento, CA	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Environm & Water Resources Inst				Bioretention systems have become common in stormwater management. Bioretention typically requires a large footprint to accommodate required water quality volumes, which may not be feasible in high traffic areas such as ferry terminals, bridges, and other urban areas. Shallow, portable planters with sandy loam and compost were evaluated for zinc and copper retention using synthetic stormwater. The addition of vermiculite, tree bark, and plants (tufted hairgrass) were evaluated. The mass of zinc retained was consistently greater than 90% for both the vermiculite and tree bark systems, and greater than 80% for all planters in every test. Copper and zinc retention varied with each simulated storm event in the control and tufted hairgrass systems. To better understand copper and zinc distribution within the bioretention systems, simulations were conducted in Hydrus 2D. Model simulations showed copper and zinc accumulating near the surface, indicating physical processes are likely the primary mechanism of metal retention in the planters. Our results indicate that shallow bioretention systems, which have a relatively small footprint, effectively retain copper and zinc.																			978-0-7844-8061-8				2017							212	222										WOS:000404787300021

The activated sludge process is a complex process involving physical, chemical and biological processes. A rapid evaluation of the effluent water quality in activated sludge systems would help engineers improve operation conditions and consequently bring economic benefits to wastewater treatment plant. In this study, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used to inform an activated sludge model (ASM1) for the chemical and biological processes, serving to provide a rapid evaluation of effluent water quality. The CFD-ASM1 was validated with the use of measured data, such as the effluent concentrations of chemical oxygen demand, ammonium, and nitrate, from a full-scale activated sludge tank. This study also studied the impacts of air flow rate and bubble size on air volume fraction distribution in the activated sludge tank using the CFD-ASM1. The model developed in this study can further serve as a tool to optimize operation conditions (e.g., air flow rate and bubble size) of activated sludge systems at a low cost.																			978-0-7844-8063-2				2017							12	23										WOS:000404788200002

The potential impacts of urban stormwater have given rise to solutions such as Low Impact Developments (LID) to remove pollutants from entering river/ocean and provide groundwater replenishment/water supply benefits. The Broadway Neighborhood Stormwater Greenway (Project) is a joint partnership between City of Los Angeles, California State Water Resources Control Board, Water Replenishment District of Southern California, Santa Monica Bay Restoration Commission, and Geosyntec Consultants, to develop a neighborhood system of LID stormwater capture/infiltration in South Los Angeles. The Project is located in public right-of-way and retrofits segments of the Broadway neighborhood with stormwater LID designed to capture, infiltrate and treat stormwater runoff, recharge groundwater, and help address Los Angeles River Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) water quality requirements. Total Project cost was $ 4.9 million and has four levels of LID: parcel based (19 residential rain gardens/infiltration trenches); street-ends (eight dry wells); commercial green streets (four parkway infiltration swales); and subregional infiltration gallery (417,000-gallon underneath parking). Water quality monitoring with continuous flow meters are installed to quantify water quality/groundwater recharge. Design drainage area is approximately 45 acres and benefits from a total of tributary area of 220 acres. With its particular location above the "Los Angeles Forebay", the project is expected to recharge on average 41 acre-feet/year into the underlying Central Groundwater Basin. The Project meets TMDL requirements for the design drainage area through the removal of pollutants such as trash, bacteria, and metals. The Project provides educational, ecological, community benefits leading to a healthier, vibrant neighborhood.																			978-0-7844-8063-2				2017							82	96										WOS:000404788200006

We present a design case study of a multiport diffuser for a 1 MGD dense discharge into a shallow 60-foot wide river. CORMIX mixing zone modeling software was used to design the diffuser to achieve dilution to meet water quality criteria within a mixing zone for regulatory compliance. An iterative design process was employed using the CORMIX mixing zone model and the CorHyd internal diffuser hydraulics model. CORMIX simulates the multiport diffuser as a line source to predict downstream water column dilution values needed for regulatory compliance. CorHyd is used to (i) calculate port and pipe velocities, (ii) verify uniform discharge distribution from the ports, and (iii) determine the diffuser head requirements. To decrease the diffuser-induced near-field acceleration zone and enhance mixing, a fanned unidirectional multiport diffuser was designed. The diffuser riser lengths vary to conform to the river bathymetry. The riser ports were fitted with duckbill valves to maintain high port velocity over a range of effluent discharge rates. The design was optimized for dilutions at the mixing zone with port geometry, exit velocity, and spacing that allows individual plumes to merge by the end of the near-field and minimizes the potential for scouring the river bed.																			978-0-7844-8063-2				2017							97	111										WOS:000404788200007

A pilot wetland facility, in conjunction with a biofilm aeration facility, was constructed at Lake Maryout by Alexandria coast, where primary treated wastewater of 50,000 m(3)/day is being handled. The satisfactory results of water quality parameters of the pilot wetland effluent were compared with the performance of the wastewater-natural treatment facility located at Arcata Bay, CA. The results provide motivations for further large scale wetland applications in the available land of Maryout Valley where fresh water supplies are low. Highlights are presented on use of safe wastewater sludge and bio-solids for restoration of constructed and natural wetlands, which serve for coastal defense; e.g. at the Nile Rosetta headland, San Francisco Bay, and the Central Wetlands in Louisiana, USA.																			978-0-7844-8063-2				2017							126	139										WOS:000404788200009

Estimation of Surface Water Temperature of the Tigris River System in Iraq	WORLD ENVIRONMENTAL AND WATER RESOURCES CONGRESS 2017: WATER, WASTEWATER, AND STORMWATER; URBAN WATERSHED MANAGEMENT; AND MUNICIPAL WATER INFRASTRUCTURE					17th Annual World Environmental and Water Resources Congress	MAY 21-25, 2017	Sacramento, CA	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Environm & Water Resources Inst				Monitoring surface water temperatures (Tw) in lakes, rivers, and reservoirs is a key component of environmental management and influences water quality by affecting bio-geo chemical reaction rates, altering the saturation concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO), and influencing the susceptibility of fish to disease. Temperatures in the Tigris River, one of the largest rivers in the Middle East, are influenced by factors such as heat fluxes at the air-water and human activities such as direct discharge of water to the river. However, modeling and management of water temperature is limited by a paucity of in-situ data, which prevents calibration of models. In this study, we infill data gaps by estimating Tw using the thermal bands of both the Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM+ sensors. These satellite-based estimates, typically measured once or twice a month with 60-120m resolution, are then used to develop a regression model that relates daily water temperature to daily air temperature and river flow. These estimates are used to define the Tw boundary conditions for a hydrodynamic and water quality model of the Tigris River based on a 2D implementation of the CE-QUAL-W2 (W2) numerical model. Initial results suggest that there is a significant agreement between modeled and remotely estimated data of Tw. Results suggest that short-wave solar radiation is the most important factor that controls seasonal Tw variations. However, anthropogenic influence is observed as a result of return irrigation flows and flows from Tharthar Lake.																			978-0-7844-8063-2				2017							223	233										WOS:000404788200016

Several green infrastructure technologies on the Villanova University campus have been recently retrofitted to include real-time control to achieve this improved volume removal goal. These systems utilize the physical processes present in green infrastructure (infiltration, evapotranspiration, etc.) tomanipulate the hydrologic timing to optimize performance through actively controlled inflows and discharges from the system. The control is implemented through a cloud-native platform developed by OptiRTC, a technology firm focused on control of stormwater infrastructure. A modeling study was completed of a real-time controlled green and gray roof system on the Villanova University campus. The study site is comprised of an existing extensive green roof and an adjacent gray roof that has been retrofitted to capture excess runoff from the system. Stored runoff is actively released onto the green roof during dry periods to fully utilize the evapotranspiration potential of the green roof while increasing total capture from the system. The system as a whole demonstrates how forecast information, remote sensing, and self-learning components can be integrated into a green infrastructure system to optimize performance. The long-term continuous simulation compared performance of the green roof system to the performance prior to being retrofitted, allowing for the benefit of the real-time control to be evaluated.																			978-0-7844-8063-2				2017							357	364										WOS:000404788200028

This new type of SBR modified the original tank structure, utilizing fixed weir as the effluent pattern. We made a comparative analysis for effluent water quality between fixed weir SBR and original SBR. As a result, making the water level stable inside of water tank is a good method to raise the water quality of effluent. In conclusion, we believe that the fixed weir SBR can become one replaced type of SBR in the future.																			978-0-7844-8063-2				2017							497	505										WOS:000404788200041

As part of a larger reservoir reoperation study, a continuous simulation model of the Russian River watershed in California, USA, was developed using the Hydrologic Engineering Center's Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS). Modelling focused on quantifying soil moisture and reproducing observed runoff through the wet/dry annual cycles of a 60 year simulation period, 1950 through 2010. The Russian River model simulated soil moisture using the soil moisture accounting (SMA) and deficit and constant loss methods coupled with the Penman-Monteith evapotranspiration method. Model calibration focused on reproducing observed basin runoff signatures including flood flow-frequency, seasonal runoff, and the runoff hydrograph. Performance measures quantified the model's ability to reproduce observations and proved the model useful for subsequent reservoir reoperation analyses. This paper presents model development using HEC-HMS for continuous simulation of the Russian River watershed; steps include forming precipitation and evapotranspiration boundary conditions, initializing and calibrating model parameters, and evaluating results, to arrive at a final useful model.																			978-0-7844-8060-1				2017							12	21										WOS:000404786200002

Four major rivers, many smaller creeks, five wastewater treatment plants, and groundwater discharge to the Chehalis River. Flooding is a major problem in the relatively flat areas surrounding the cities of Chehalis and Centralia. As a result, construction of a flood-control dam in the upper basin has been proposed. One major concern of constructing a dam is the potentially severe impacts to fish health and habitat. The Chehalis River has routinely violated water quality standards for primarily temperature and dissolved oxygen. CE-QUAL-W2, a two-dimensional (longitudinal and vertical) hydrodynamic and water quality model, was used to simulate the Chehalis River, including free flowing river stretches and stratified (in summer) lake-like stretches. The goals of this research were to assess the flood retention structure's impacts to water quality, as well as river responses to potential climate change scenarios. In order to use the model to achieve these goals, calibration to field data for flow, temperature, and water quality constituents was performed for the years 2013 and 2014. Once calibration was complete, model scenarios for future climate conditions and dam operating regimes were conducted. Future conditions showed predictions of warmer water temperatures and slight changes to water quality conditions on the river. As fish in the area prefer cooler water temperatures, this could pose a threat to fish health and habitat. Flood retention structures with the purpose of flood retention only (only operating during times of flooding) gave model predictions for daily maximum temperature higher than structures that employed flood retention and flow augmentation (operating during all times of the year). This suggested the management of flow passage or retention by the dam is important for water quality on the river.																			978-0-7844-8060-1				2017							203	217										WOS:000404786200019

Modeling the Impact of Water Quality and Food Web Structure on Bull Trout in Two Washington Reservoirs	WORLD ENVIRONMENTAL AND WATER RESOURCES CONGRESS 2017: WATERSHED MANAGEMENT, IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE, AND WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT					17th Annual World Environmental and Water Resources Congress	MAY 21-25, 2017	Sacramento, CA	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Environm & Water Resources Inst				Mechanistic models of the hydrodynamics and water quality were developed for Lake Kachess and Lake Keechelus in the Yakima River basin of Eastern Washington. These models were coupled to a fish bioenergetics model and used to explore management strategies to improve water quality in the reservoirs affecting kokanee production. The models were also applied to evaluate the impacts of the proposed implementation of the Kachess Drought Relief Pumping Plant (KDRPP) projects. The public domain model, CE-QUAL-W2 Version 4 (Cole and Wells, 2016) was adapted to model the reservoirs. CEQUAL-W2 is a 2-dimensional (longitudinal-vertical) hydrodynamic and water quality model capable of predicting water surface, velocity, temperature, nutrients, multiple algae, zooplankton, periphyton, and macrophyte species, fish bioenergetics, sediment diagenesis, dissolved oxygen, pH, alkalinity, multiple CBOD groups, multiple suspended solids groups, multiple generic constituents (such as tracer, bacteria, toxics), and multiple organic matter groups, both dissolved and particulate. The model is set up to predict these state variables at longitudinal segments and vertical layers. Comparisons of field data to model predictions were made for water level, temperature, NH4-N, NO3-N, PO4-P, total N, Total P, total organic carbon, alkalinity, zooplankton, pH, chlorophyll a, and dissolved oxygen at multiple reservoir sites at various depths.																			978-0-7844-8060-1				2017							218	232										WOS:000404786200020

Many studies have measured pollutant loads from agricultural or urban landuses and majority of them have focused on total suspended solids (TSS), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) pollutant loading into watershed in a specific region. In some cases, the EMC or export load values reported in each of the studies have a wide range of magnitude for a specific landuse. The sources of the difference in the pollutant loading values for each of the landuses could be due to the region and physical characteristics (e.g. slope and soil type) of watershed, methods of measuring EMCs and loads, the number of samples taken from watershed outlet and rainfall intensity. This paper summarizes and combines some published EMC and load values separately categorized for urban and agricultural lanuses. Then, for each of the landuses, a box and whisker or statistic plots were created using median EMC and load values, which are reported in different literatures. Because the results of this study are supposed to be used as an input for Kentucky Nutrient Model (KYNM), the studies that report EMC and load values in State of Kentucky were incorporated in the data as much as possible. The provided range of EMC and load values could be very useful for the users of water quality models who need to have a holistic idea of pollutant magnitude released from each landuse in watershed outlets.																			978-0-7844-8060-1				2017							273	282										WOS:000404786200024

Estimating Risks for Water-Quality Exceedances of Total-Copper from Highway and Urban Runoff under Predevelopment and Current Conditions with the Stochastic Empirical Loading and Dilution Model (SELDM)	WORLD ENVIRONMENTAL AND WATER RESOURCES CONGRESS 2017: WATERSHED MANAGEMENT, IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE, AND WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT					17th Annual World Environmental and Water Resources Congress	MAY 21-25, 2017	Sacramento, CA	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Environm & Water Resources Inst				The Stochastic Empirical Loading and Dilution Model (SELDM) was used to demonstrate methods for estimating risks for water-quality exceedances of event-mean concentrations (EMCs) of total-copper. Monte Carlo methods were used to simulate stormflow, total-hardness, suspended-sediment, and total-copper EMCs as stochastic variables. These simulations were done for the Charles River basin upstream of Interstate 495 in Bellingham, Massachusetts. The hydrology and water quality of this site were simulated with SELDM by using data from nearby, hydrologically similar sites. Three simulations were done to assess the potential effects of the highway on receiving-water quality with and without highway-runoff treatment by a structural best-management practice (BMP). In the low-development scenario, total copper in the receiving stream was simulated by using a sediment transport curve, sediment chemistry, and sediment-water partition coefficients. In this scenario, neither the highway runoff nor the BMP effluent caused concentration exceedances in the receiving stream that exceed the once in three-year threshold (about 0.54 percent). In the second scenario, without the highway, runoff from the large urban areas in the basin caused exceedances in the receiving stream in 2.24 percent of runoff events. In the third scenario, which included the effects of the urban runoff, neither the highway runoff nor the BMP effluent increased the percentage of exceedances in the receiving stream. Comparison of the simulated geometric mean EMCs with data collected at a downstream monitoring site indicates that these simulated values are within the 95-percent confidence interval of the geometric mean of the measured EMCs.																			978-0-7844-8060-1				2017							313	327										WOS:000404786200028

The model tool contains three main modules; the pre-processing tool based GIS functions, the runoff calculation for water balance and nutrient load based on the theory of Generalized Watershed Loading Functions with a number of enhancements and modifications, and the routing calculation engaging with HEC-RAS model for the hydrodynamics and transport processes in river systems. All components are immersed into an open source GIS MapWindow software (www.mapwindow.org) as plug-ins. The modeling tool is programming in VB.NET, and designed to complement and interoperate with enterprise and full-featured under MapWindow GIS functions. A GIS-based numerical tool makes watershed and water quality studies easier by bringing key data and analytical components under one GIS (Geographic Information System) roof. Through the use of GIS, the model has the flexibility to clip, integrate and display a wide range of information (e.g., basins, streams, weather, land use, soils, point source discharges, water supply, withdrawals, nutrient loads, etc.) at a scale chosen by the user. Minimum data requirements and effective application are advantages of this modeling tool. The model has been verified and validated against available well-known watershed models and observation data obtained from real applications for watershed systems in USA and Vietnam.																			978-0-7844-8060-1				2017							373	383										WOS:000404786200033

In this lake, wind shear is the major driving force for flow hydrodynamics. The flow fields, nutrients and chlorophyll concentration in Beasley Lake were simulated using CCHE2D, a hydrodynamic and water quality model developed at the National Center for Computational Hydroscience and Engineering. The effects of runoff and sediment from upland watershed on the lake water quality were taken into accounted. The simulated results were validated using field measurements. It was found that the chlorophyll concentration is greatly affected by suspended sediment concentration in the lake.

Agricultural Drainage in the Northeastern US: Past History and Future Challenges	WORLD ENVIRONMENTAL AND WATER RESOURCES CONGRESS 2017: WATERSHED MANAGEMENT, IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE, AND WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT					17th Annual World Environmental and Water Resources Congress	MAY 21-25, 2017	Sacramento, CA	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Environm & Water Resources Inst				Agriculture drainage increased from the early 1900s to the early 1980s. During the 1970s and 1980s increasing environmental concerns increasingly viewed agricultural drainage as being against the public's best interests. The Clean Water Act amendments in 1977 and the Food Security Act of 1985 all had an effect on agricultural drainage. Water quality effects of agricultural drainage projects started to be reported in the literature in the 1970s and 1980s. There were a number of projects conducted in the Northeast. To address water quality concerns, some controlled drainage systems were installed on the Delmarva Peninsula in the 1990s. Research has shown subsurface drainage can transport large amounts of nitrogen to surface waters. New York has a large dairy population, so manure is the largest input of nitrogen to surface problems in a number of watersheds. Also of concern is the rapid transport of nitrates and bacteria by preferential flow to subsurface drains when liquid manure is spread on fields. On the Delmarva Peninsula poultry manure has been a great concern for many years of in the Chesapeake Bay and Inland Bays watersheds. With the release of the TMDL by EPA in 2010 for the Chesapeake Bay it has become more of a concern																			978-0-7844-8060-1				2017							439	452										WOS:000404786200038

The Total Phosphorus with Point and Non-Point Inflows to Great Lakes-A Critical Review and GLWQA Targets	WORLD ENVIRONMENTAL AND WATER RESOURCES CONGRESS 2017: WATERSHED MANAGEMENT, IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE, AND WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT					17th Annual World Environmental and Water Resources Congress	MAY 21-25, 2017	Sacramento, CA	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Environm & Water Resources Inst				The occurrence of algae blooms in the US waterbodies has become an annually recurring phenomenon. Lake Erie of the Great Lakes (North America) has been experiencing significant and harmful algae-blooms (HABs) during the mid-July to mid-September for more than ten (10) years now. The watersheds in the US are significantly affected by algae-bloom formations during the summer months, and, this has been a vicious cycle that the point and non-point wastewater effluents contribute nutrients to waterbodies, specifically during the Spring time, and the need to draw those intake waters to effectively treat those complex algal-blooms forming during the summer time in maintaining the uninterrupted supply of the potable water to cities and towns. Good reductions of total phosphorus (TP) loadings to Great Lakes, specifically to the Lake Erie, were accomplished compared to the 1970s; however, the non-point source TP loading to Lake Erie has been significant and varying year-to-year. More effective TP estimation methodology with respect to the phosphorus discharging sources will be required. Additional TP reductions are necessary toward a good water quality of Great Lakes. Interim open water TP concentrations and loadings are in effect since 2012, until updated. The Phosphorus Task Committee has recommended that March to July total Spring phosphorus loads should be reduced, and some of the basins of Lake Erie the nutrient load must be reduced as much as by 40%. The best management practices (BMPs) have been identified and recommended to be put into practice. In this work, authors focused on: Great Lakes' water-asset; nutrient TP loadings to Great Lakes and effects; the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement (GLWQA), on nutrient TP concentration and loading targets; TP including the dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) loading targets to the Lake Erie; a review on Lake Michigan; and, the binational (Ca and USA) action plans for TP reductions and, nutrient and excessive algae-bloom control requirements.																			978-0-7844-8060-1				2017							453	467										WOS:000404786200039

To account for a range of uncertainty in future conditions through 2100, a scenario-based approach was developed using climate projections available from Couple Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate model simulations and sea level rise projections consistent with National Research Council (NRC) and the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Report 5 (AR5). The performance of the Central Valley water system was evaluated for a range of metrics including water deliveries, water quality, hydropower, flood control, recreation, fish, and wildlife habitats, ESA species, flow dependent ecological resiliency and the economic impacts of water supply changes using an integrated model package that simulates the federal Central Valley Project, the State Water Project and local system operations and regulatory requirements. The study also included the development and evaluation of a range of water management actions that can help reduce or manage future risks posed by potential changes in climate and socioeconomic conditions. Seven adaptation portfolios were explored that each consisted of a variety of water management actions. These thematic portfolios were evaluated to determine their effectiveness in adapting to potential risks posed by future socioeconomic and climate changes and to assess tradeoffs between their relative performances.																			978-0-7844-8060-1				2017							558	566										WOS:000404786200048

In coastal areas, natural hazards such as flood can significantly threat the coastal infrastructures' functionality. One way to evaluate the infrastructures performance during flooding is to measure its reliability. Reliability of the system is regarded as the probability of successful operation within the assumed time period. In this study, a framework is presented to analyze the wastewater treatment plants reliability during the time of flooding. The case study is New York City which have had experienced severe storms during the past decades and two major disasters in the last 5 years. Here, the reliability is referring to the ability to maintain water quality standards of effluent in wastewater. In this way, the effluent concentration during flooding is considered as a random variable and it is compared with the discharge standards. The effluent concentration is computed by considering the status of different unit operations of WWTP during the flooding time, which may cause a disturbance and/or reduction in the unit's performance. For effluent concentration, different distributions functions are fitted and the water quality reliability of all different distributions are compared. The expected compliance with the discharge standards is computed by assuming a level of confidence which shows the reliability of the system. Results show the significant value of quantifying reliability to assess the performance of WWTP. The methodology can be applied to other coastal settings that are subject to coastal and inland flooding.																			978-0-7844-8060-1				2017							630	641										WOS:000404786200053

The goal of this research is to develop a modeling ensemble for estimating sediment transport within large-scale mountainous catchments (>1000 km(2)). The results from four sediment modules inserted into a common hydrologic framework are presented to quantify uncertainty and improve predictability. The ensemble includes empirical modules: monovariate rating curve (MRC) and the Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (MUSLE), a stochastic module: multi-variate regression using a generalized linear model (GLM) and a physically-based module: Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM) sediment model. Calibration results from a multi-objective optimization routine are presented that optimize parameters and identify performance tradeoffs. The GLM module had the overall highest performance for both daily (NSE=0.84) and eventbased (NSE=0.99) predictions. The MRC module performed well under both time steps (NSE=0.64, NSE=0.91). The MUSLE module had the highest performance in percent bias (0.56%) of all the modules, though it performed poorly in timing and variability for both time steps (NSE=0.22, NSE=0.49). The DHSVM module performed the poorest under the daily simulation (NSE=-0.24), but the skill was greatly enhanced for event-based predictions (NSE=0.96) reflecting the influence of temporal discretization. This work highlights the tradeoffs in sediment prediction across a range of model structures with key differences in daily versus event-based model performance.

Characteristic Spatiotemporal Scales of Runoff and Sediment at the Plot Scale: Implications to Sediment Transport Modeling	WORLD ENVIRONMENTAL AND WATER RESOURCES CONGRESS 2017: HYDRAULICS AND WATERWAYS AND WATER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS ANALYSIS					17th Annual World Environmental and Water Resources Congress	MAY 21-25, 2017	Sacramento, CA	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Environm & Water Resources Inst				Changing climate and topography gradients are factors that collectively account for the variability in water and sediment fluxes in large agricultural systems. This variability hinders the effective management and monitoring of water quality and nutrient cycling, and emanates from the characteristic spatiotemporal scales of runoff and sediment processes for both the smaller and larger systems. The aim of this study is to describe these characteristic spatiotemporal scales at the plot scale by accounting for the interplay between relevant erosion processes and the forcing characteristics. Two experimental cases with uniform slope are considered, rainfall simulators are used to generate rainfall, and runoff and sediment are continuously measured at a downstream weir. Our results show how the coevolution of the aforementioned processes affect the characteristic spatiotemporal scales of runoff and sediment transport. A qualitative assessment of the coevolution of the dominant processes and their impact on the hydrologic response and landscape evolution at the plot scale, combined with the observed spatial features of the plot throughout the rainfall event provide insight into the interplay between these processes. This study is a step towards understanding patterns of runoff and sediment and the associated propagation across scale, as well as informing sediment transport modeling.																			978-0-7844-8062-5				2017							429	438										WOS:000404784900039

Problems that needed priority attention included contaminated sediment, poor water quality, and lost or altered habitat. The transport of nutrients, sediments and contaminants plays an important role on the biogeochemistry, ecology and health of the bay. Local, state and federal agencies have studied the problems caused by excessive nutrients and contaminated sediments. In 1989 Gottlieb et al. deployed tracked drifters from six locations in the bay to map flow patterns. In 2015 Hamidi et al. examined the role of circulation and heat fluxes in the formation of stratification and hypoxia in the bay. Their hydrodynamic model calculates horizontal dispersion using the Smagorinsky turbulence closure model. In 2014 Nguyen et al. used a hydrodynamic model to examine circulation and exchange in the Saginaw Bay-Lake Huron system. Their model was tested against data from a Lagrangian drifter experiment. For this study drifters were deployed in the bay in 2014. Locations of drifters were tracked using GPS transmitters, and those locations were used to calculate one-point dispersion statistics. A Lagrangian particle-tracking model was used to simulate the drifter trajectories. Cross-bay and along-bay velocities were used to compute diffusivities in those directions for observed and simulated drifter tracks. Diffusivity values were estimated using statistical analysis of particles released from a point source in isotropic turbulent flow. The field-data validated diffusivities will be used to improve predictions of the transport and fate of nutrients and sediments in the bay.																			978-0-7844-8062-5				2017							439	448										WOS:000404784900040

The quality of water delivered in a WDS is difficult to maintain and monitor, as water quality can degrade within a water distribution system's pipes. A network of online monitoring stations designed to sample water quality in real-time, and to be strategically placed in a water distribution system has proven an effective method to monitor water quality and provide early warning of a contaminant intrusion. A difficult task for an online monitoring station is to distinguish natural variability in water quality from variability caused by the presence of a contaminant in the water. Prior studies have shown how common water quality indicators (free chlorine, pH, conductivity, total organic carbon) respond to contaminants, and methods to ease the task of recognizing true contaminant presence. This work proposes an objective function incorporating the uncertainty in a monitoring station's detection employed in the framework of a genetic algorithm to place sensors at locations which minimize the expected consequence of a contamination event, and where water quality data are most indicative of true contamination events. Early warning systems composed of fixed water quality stations and inline mobile water quality sensors are designed in a multi-objective framework for a sample water distribution system.

Potential for contaminations and cross connections make it difficult to ensure that the water being delivered to consumers is truly of high quality. The placement of water quality monitoring stations within a WDS system has proven a successful method to prevent the delivery of contaminated water. The locations of monitoring stations in a WDS is critical to the performance of a water quality monitoring station network (early warning system or EWS); ideally sensors will be placed at a limited number of locations which can quickly detect all contamination events. Designing a EWS to protect against every possible contamination event is computationally infeasible; however it is crucial that high impact contamination events will be detected. In this study a contamination event is defined as an intrusion taking place at a specific junction and time in a WDS. A probability distribution is generated according to the portion of a network's population served by water that flows "downstream" from a specific junction at a specific time, within a defined interval of time; this portion of population would be most at risk to exposure of the corresponding junction and time. The newly generated probability distribution is then used for sampling a set of contamination events used to design an EWS. The downstream nodes are calculated using breadth first search and the nodal populations are calculated according to the temporal demands. The relative consequence of a junction being contaminated is calculated using steady state and dynamic hydraulic models; elevating the need to perform numerous complex water quality simulations. Monitoring station networks designed using the proposed importance sampling technique and traditional random sampling are compared.

This study presents a new analysis approach based on clustering insights of water distribution networks connectivity for enhancing its security. Clustering is utilized herein for dynamically exploring the system behavior. Through clustering formations, addition of network components such as pipes and tanks for the layout problem, and valves for its operation - contamination spreading is controlled and contained. The developed methodology is demonstrated on several example applications, showing its capabilities to provide a decision support tool for contaminant control and containment in water distribution systems.

A critical component of CWS, online quality monitoring, involves a network of sensors that assess water quality and alert an operator of contamination. Utilities developing these monitoring systems are faced with the decision of what locations are optimal for deployment of sensors. The TEVA-SPOT software was developed to analyze the vulnerability of systems and aid utilities in designing sensor networks. However, many small utilities do not have the technical or financial resources needed to effectively use TEVA-SPOT. As a result, a sensor placement algorithm (i. e. Water Quality Sensor Placement Tool -WQSPT) was developed and implemented in a commercial network distribution modeling software (i.e. KYPIPE) as a simple tool to aid small utilities in sensor placement. The developed tool was validated using 12 small distribution system models and multiple contamination scenarios for the placement of one and two sensors. Results were compared with data from identical simulations runs in TEVA-SPOT to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Because the proposed algorithm uses a simple complete enumeration strategy for sensor placement, the algorithm was able to select the same or superior nodes to those selected by TEVA-SPOT.																			978-0-7844-8062-5				2017							534	548										WOS:000404784900050

While widely used, the approach has not been examined fully on how it impacts the modeling fidelity. This study intends to evaluate these consequences in a typical water distribution system. We first analyzed tracer test data at 13 locations using a calibrated EPANET model with generalized water demand patterns. Modeling results agree with actual measurements in six locations with high water demand and flow velocity near the storage tank, while fail to replicate the variations in network abundant of dead- ends and Tee/ Cross junctions. Then we further investigated the causes of model inaccuracy using real- time water demand data covering similar to 35% water users. This paper compares several levels of pipe skeletonization and water demand aggregation in water age simulation, and shows significant impacts on water age results because of discrete water demand at pipe nodes. The analysis reveals varying flow properties and the movement of highly aged water parcels in two types of pipe configurations. These results have the implications on network modeling and further studies of water quality simulations.																			978-0-7844-8062-5				2017							593	601										WOS:000404784900055

In the case of a contamination event the contaminated section of the water distribution system should be located, isolated and cleaned before it can be returned to regular service. Depending on the specific contaminant, the cleaning process mainly includes flushing and disinfection. All of the disinfection methods (for example: tablet, continuous and slug) require that the disinfectants will have minimal contact time (T) in a predefined concentration (C) with the pipes and the system's apparatuses. The regulatory agencies, such as the Ministry of Health in Israel or the American Water Work Association, publishes procedures for the disinfection of water systems in which usually only a single water main is considered and no specific procedures are given for larger portions of the water system. This paper presents an optimal operation plan for the disinfection of water distribution systems using the slug feed method while considering the injection times, flow rates and drainage locations while keeping variable disinfection C*T values in different areas of the network. The method is a two stage GA-EPANET procedure. It is demonstrated on a small real-world network section.

It's necessary to establish of a set of water quality early warning system which can quickly and accurately identify contamination. The existing anomaly detection methods are either simple fusion of abnormal judgment results from single index [1], or correlation analysis of multiple parameters at the cost of high time complexity. Aimed to solve these problems, this paper describes a multivariate correlation analysis method based on the longest common subsequence (LCSS) analysis combined with Dempster- Shafer (D- S) evidence theory. The proposed method utilizes adaptive sliding window scale to acquire water quality parameter time sequence, LCSS to describe similarity between different water quality series fluctuation, and D- S evidence theory to calculate abnormal probabilities. The ROC curve is introduced to verify the algorithm performance. Tested by data from the laboratory contaminant injection experiment, this approach shows nice ability in dealing with time series deformation problem rapidly, which to a certain extent can improve the reliability of multi- index correlation degree analysis, and ultimately reduce the abnormal water contamination event detection false alarm rate.																			978-0-7844-8062-5				2017							624	636										WOS:000404784900059

To tackle these challenges, new sustainable water management strategies, like water sensitive urban design (WSUD), have been gaining increasing interest in the last couple of years. The software tool UrbanBEATS (Urban Biophysical Environments and Technologies Simulator) supports decision makers in the planning and implementation of such WSUD strategies, by combining and processing spatial and non-spatial data (e.g. land use, population, elevation, rainfall/ climate). In the field of water distribution system (WDS) analysis, the implementation of decentralized rainwater harvesting or gray water reuse measures can strongly influence the water quality performance of an existing central pipe system. Here, we show how demand reduction scenarios modelled with UrbanBEATS through the implementation of different water efficiency or water use restrictions impact WDS quality analysis undertaken in Epanet2.					rathnayaka, suranji/0000-0001-5454-8336; Zischg, Jonatan/0000-0002-7506-1073; Bach, Peter/0000-0001-5799-6185; Sitzenfrei, Robert/0000-0003-1093-6040														978-0-7844-8062-5				2017							692	702										WOS:000404784900064

P.; Rai, Subash Prasad			A novel approach for river health assessment of Chambal using fuzzy modeling, India	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												The water quality (WQ) status of water bodies is highly uncertain and subjective in nature. The present paper addresses a "Fuzzy River Health Index" (FRHI) which is capable of dealing with subjectivities and uncertainties concerning river health at various sites of the Chambal River, India. By considering the parameters like temperature, total solids (TS), pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), biological oxygen demand (BOD), total coliform (TC), phosphate (P) and nitrate (N), the fuzzy model is established. The model uses triangular membership functions for fuzzification and centroid method for defuzzification. The proposed proficient method includes a fuzzy model which include IF-THEN ideas that help to determine River health using WQ parameters. The comparative performance models used are Carlson's trophic index (C-TSI),and Ecological health index (EHI). This study reveals that FRHI provides fairly good results; therefore, it concludes that the health of Chambal River is within excellent range (FRHI > 80). However, there is an urgent need to develop an effective and sustainable WQ monitoring for this study site, this proposed FRHI provides the flexibility for decision making in an integrated WQ management policies.

In this paradigm, the general uncertainty model represented by coprime factor uncertainty (CFU) description is able to cover both unmodeled dynamics and physical parameter variations at all frequencies. By using 2-DOF H-infinity loop-shaping technique, the designers can shape the frequency response of the original model into the desired shape which satisfies both transient response and robustness against various uncertainties. Top brine temperature and recycle brine flow rate have been chosen to stand for MSF plant performance. The simulation results demonstrate that the achieved controller has high stability margin, excellent abilities of disturbances and noises attenuations. In fact, it can deal with approximately 60% of parameter variations, reject at least 84% of exogenous disturbances, and 80% of sensor noises. Note that most currently used controllers reported cannot cope with those high levels of plant uncertainties and disturbances. Thus, it is necessary to implement the advanced control schemes for effectively controlling MSF plants, ensuring high water quality and optimizing water monitoring system. Finally, this robust control method with reduced-order can help prevent machine faults, stabilize MSF plants, optimize energy usage, and lower water production costs, with overcoming various limitations of some conventional controllers.

J	Bayram, A				Bayram, Adem			Water quality of the Degirmendere stream, drinking water source of Trabzon Province, Turkey	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												Trabzon Province with a total population of 757,898 is the biggest city on the Southeastern Black Sea Coast. Domestic water demand of the city is supplied by the Degirmendere and Galyan streams after treatment at the drinking water treatment plants of the Trabzon Metropolitan Municipality. The main purpose of this study is to monitor and assess drinking water quality of these surface water resources before treatment with reference to 30 water-quality indicators. The monitoring results covering 1-year period revealed that each stream had high-quality water except for total Kjeldahl nitrogen, orthophosphate phosphorus, and total iron, by which each stream was classified as slightly polluted according to the Turkish Surface Water Quality Regulation. The results for the untreated stream waters were well below the permissible levels mandated or proposed by national and international references except for total iron. However, the post-treatment quality and safety of the stream waters used for drinking purposes matched the standards as indicated in the drinking water-quality reports of the Trabzon Metropolitan Municipality.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				JAN	2017	62						120	139		10.5004/dwt.2017.1761								WOS:000403566800013

The results of the tracer tests in an actual domestic water treatment plant showed that modifying the hydraulic structure of the distribution channel could improve the evenness of the flow distribution by similar to 50%. The results of turbidity measurements for each sedimentation basin also showed that a more even flow distribution reduces the turbidity of the settled water by more than 25%.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				JAN	2017	61						120	125		10.5004/dwt.2016.1763								WOS:000403566100014

The main flow gradient of groundwater in the region is from a brackish aquifer in the east, to one of Israel's main freshwater aquifers (the coastal aquifer) in the west. To prevent salinization of the freshwater aquifer, a buffer zone has been created in-between the two aquifers, comprised of approximately 40 wells. These wells act as a barrier to salinization by pumping the brackish water before it reaches the coastal aquifer. This brackish water feeds the Granot BWRO and Lahat BWRO desalination plants. This aquifer rehabilitation project consists of three main parts: (1) a line of wells along the boundary between the two aquifers, (2) the BWRO desalination plants, and (3) a unique, exceptionally long (30 km) brine disposal pipeline to the Mediterranean Sea. From the outset, this project was designed to accommodate expansions in the production capacity of the system as well as to cope with increasing salinity of the source water. Accordingly, since 2004 there has been a gradual expansion over the years, in the number of desalination units within the Granot Plant. Currently, three desalination units are in operation, and a fourth unit is targeted to initiate production in June 2015. The total capacity at the Granot plant will be 41,600 m(3) d(-1) in 2015, and subsequent to the planned fifth unit, production is expected to reach 52,900 m(3) d(-1). This paper discusses the optimal design of the desalination plant, including considerations of RO membrane type, configuration, and post-treatment processes. This design is chosen to meet the permeate water quality regulations, and to minimize energy consumption. The design and construction of the Granot Plant meets all of the regulations of the Israeli Water Authority and the Israeli Ministry of Health, including respective boron and chloride concentration limits in the permeate, of 0.35 ppm and 20 ppm, respectively. Mekorot has also overcome several issues in the design phase as a result of an expected increase TDS and silica concentrations which might increase the scaling tendency. TDS and silica concentrations (and consequently, scaling) are expected to increase further by more than 20% during the coming decade. Experiments were carried out to address the challenge of preventing scaling on the RO membrane and within the brine disposal pipeline. These experiments have led to adjustments in the design features of the desalination units, including the operational conditions and chemical usage.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				JAN	2017	61						206	214		10.5004/dwt.2016.11135								WOS:000403566100023						
J	Li, XX; Zhang, YJ; Zhao, XL; Liu, C				Li, Xiaoxiao; Zhang, Yuejun; Zhao, Xiaolei; Liu, Cheng			The performance of several enhanced treatment processes for treatment of algae-containing raw water in typical seasons	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												The turbidity and algae removal effects of enhanced treatment processes, including the pre-chlorination process and the enhanced coagulation process using composite coagulants composed of poly-aluminum chloride and poly-dimethyldiallyl ammonium chloride (PDMDAAC) for algae-containing raw water in Taihu Lake, were investigated through jar tests in situ in this paper. And the dependence of the treatment effects on both the water quality in the typical seasons and the working mechanism of enhanced processes was analyzed and summarized. The results indicated that the pre-chlorination improved the treatment effect of conventional coagulation process in both the turbidity and algae removal effect for the raw water with the characteristics of high temperature, high algae and organic pollutants content in summer, and it improved also the algae removal effects, but weakened the turbidity removal effects for the raw water with the characteristics of low temperature, low algae content and tiny organic pollutants in winter. However, the enhanced coagulation process using composite coagulants improved even more remarkably the treatment effect of the conventional process using poly-aluminum chloride (PAC) only, for the algae-containing raw water both in summer and in winter. Especially, the improvement extent of the effects of using composite coagulants for algae-containing raw water in summer was more obviously than that in winter due to the characteristics of PDMDAAC and raw water. Besides, the turbidity and algae removal effects of enhanced coagulation process using composite coagulants could not only exceed that of the combined process of pre-chlorination and conventional coagulation using inorganic coagulants, but also indubitably replace the function of pre-chlorination for reducing the risks caused by excessively used chlorine.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				JAN	2017	60						1	10		10.5004/dwt.2017.1198990								WOS:000403564800001						
J	Dehnoei, A; Taheri, R				Dehnoei, Ali; Taheri, Reza			A new strategy to reduce factors number in water quality measurements using Taguchi method - case study: the Karaj River	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												For water quality assessment, there are several water quality indices, such as National Sanitation Foundation-Water Quality Index (NSF-WQI). These indices are determined by measuring several parameters in different samplings. Because the value of some of the measured parameters is constant during the different samplings; hence, these parameters can be measured in the earlier samplings and be used in the later one. The identification of these parameters can reduce the time as well as the cost of water quality evaluation. In this study, a new strategy by Taguchi method was used to propose a method (proposed method) to determine the mentioned parameters in a case study of Karaj River, Iran. For demonstrating capability of this strategy, water quality was calculated by standard (NFS-WQI), adjusted, and proposed methods and then the results were compared. Nine measured parameters in standard method were reduced to four by using the proposed method. In contrast to standard and adjusted methods that showed significant differences (p < 0.1), there were no differences between proposed and standard method results. Therefore, the proposed method may be recommended for water quality evaluation with reduction of the cost and the time.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				JAN	2017	60						106	113		10.5004/dwt.2017.1477								WOS:000403564800009

First, a batch test was performed to compare the turbidity removal efficiency with and without flocculation. Results showed that flocculation could be omitted under specific conditions using hydraulic energy in the DAF process. Next, the turbidity removal efficiency, according to the hydraulic loading rate, was compared for the following cases: without flocculation, installation of baffles in the contact zone without flocculation, inclusion of a flocculator in the contact zone without flocculation, and inclusion of a flocculator with flocculation. The results showed that application of conventional flocculation, operation of a flocculator in the contact zone, installation of baffles in the contact zone, and elimination of flocculation are highly efficient. In particular, when the hydraulic loading rate was as low as 6, the efficiency of the process was >90%. When the hydraulic loading rate was 10, as in current water treatment plants, installation of either a flocculator or baffles in the contact zone resulted in over 90% efficiency. The hydraulic energy is high due to the injection of pressurized water into the contact zone, and appropriate installations in the contact zone lead to a decrease in the load of flocculation in DAF.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				JAN	2017	59						89	93		10.5004/dwt.2016.1211								WOS:000403563700011

This paper discusses the monitoring of acid conductivity at the inlet of the demineralization plant for assessing the output of the ion exchangers. An observation of data collected over a period of 14 months shows a strong correlation between output between regeneration (OBR) and acid conductivity. OBR is inversely proportional to acid conductivity with a correlation coefficient of -0.907. A drastic change in acid conductivity was observed when water level of the freshwater reservoir went below a depth of 3.8 m. The present study was undertaken with the intention to develop a simple and rugged method to measure the performance of ion exchangers in service and to find out the root cause of change in water quality after the freshwater reservoir level drops below a certain depth.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				JAN	2017	59						123	126		10.5004/dwt.2016.0337								WOS:000403563700015

For this purpose, EPANET hydraulic and water quality software was applied to a certain section of Antalya WDN using data sets obtained from SCADA and GIS. The model calibration and verification were carried out using both on-site manual and online measurements of flow rates, water pressures and free residual chlorine concentrations.

Surface water resources vulnerability was assessed for a benchmark year (2000) using the function and indicator models and for modelled future climate scenarios using only the function assessment model.

Integrated evaluation of urban groundwater hydrogeochemistry in context of fractal behaviour of groundwater level fluctuations	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES												The present study was carried out as part of a complex survey of urban groundwater quality and quantity in Szeged, southeast Hungary. The concentrations of 12 inorganic contaminants in 28 shallow groundwater monitoring wells were determined over a 2-year period (2010-2012). The evaluation of concentrations indicates remarkable contamination all over the city. Discriminant analysis (DA) was used to evaluate the spatial changes of groundwater quality. The groundwater levels were measured over a 14-year period (2000-2013). The fractal properties of water level fluctuations time series characterizing the groundwater system and Tisza River were investigated using rescaled range (R/S) analysis. The resulting Hurst exponents clearly showed the persistency and thus long memory effects of both the groundwater and the river flow. Comparison of the results of DA with the results of R/S analysis thus implies that the geological conditions and the changing groundwater quantities are not related to groundwater quality.																	0262-6667	2150-3435					2017	62	8					1216	1229		10.1080/02626667.2017.1306861								WOS:000403800000003

Water samples were collected from precipitation, glacier melt, streams and karst springs for H-2 and tritium analysis during 2012 and 2013. High tritium values were observed in winter precipitation and low values in summer precipitation. The variation of tritium in karst springs was similar to that of the streams, whereas glacier melt showed lower tritium values. The MRT of cold karst springs was shorter than that of warm karst springs. The tracer breakthrough curves (TBC) retrieved for different springs suggested a short travel time for groundwater and possibly conduit flow. Deterioration of water quality and variation in flux magnitude are the two main practical consequences of the short travel time of karst groundwater in the region. <disp-quote>EDITOR D.

An evaluation of the hysteresis in chemical concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships from drained, intensively managed grasslands in southwest England	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES												This study examined the hysteresis exhibited in concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships in the runoff from four hydrologically separated fields (catchments) at an intensively managed grassland. The objectives were to examine C-Q relationships constructed from high-resolution time series of flow, temperature, pH, conductivity, nitrate and turbidity, and their implications for hydrological processes. High-resolution datasets from the quality assured records of the Rothamsted Research North Wyke Farm Platform in the UK were examined using a graphical method and cross-correlation statistics. The study found that storm events based C-Q hysteresis reflects the cross-correlation that is generally hidden in time series analysis of large datasets, and that although Q and water quality variables can be effectively influenced by catchment size, the C-Q relationship is less significantly influenced. The dominant C-Q relationships of the water variables in the study area reflect that saturated overland flow was prevalent during the study period in the catchments, while the CCF results indicate coupled transfer of sediments and solute in the area at lag 0.<disp-quote>EDITOR D.

Hydrological modelling of the Vistula and Odra river basins using SWAT	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES												This paper presents a large-scale application of the SWAT model for water balance and natural streamflow simulation in the entire basins of the Vistula and the Odra, covering most of the territory of Poland. A tailored calibration approach was designed to achieve satisfactory goodness-of-fit across a range of catchment sizes. Model calibration and evaluation driven by high-resolution climate data showed overall good behaviour for 80 benchmark catchments divided into eight clusters, and spatial evaluation for 30 gauges showed that the designed regionalization scheme performed well (median KGE of 0.76).

Lake Reserv Manage. 33:103-107.Experience from more than 4 decades of phosphorus inactivation research, projects, and follow up monitoring has led to improved understanding of mechanisms and results that enhance the ability of lake managers to control P availability in lake water and sediment. Recent advances derived largely from monitoring lakes treated with aluminum or lanthanum over an extended time have shed light on important factors in dose determination, binding efficiency, application processes, benefits of treatment, and duration of benefits. Advances are embodied in 10 articles in this issue of Lake and Reservoir Management that, along with important literature from the last 2 decades cited in those papers, documents improvement in our knowledge and application of P inactivation as a tool in lake management.																	1040-2381	2151-5530					2017	33	2			SI		103	107		10.1080/10402381.2017.1316064								WOS:000403102200001

Effectiveness of alum in a hypereutrophic lake with substantial external loading	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Brattebo SK, Welch EB, Gibbons HL, Burghdoff MK, Williams GN, Oden JL. 2017. Effectiveness of alum in a hypereutrophic lake with substantial external loading. Lake Reserv Manage. 33:108-118.Water quality conditions in hypereutrophic Lake Ketchum improved to mesotrophic conditions after alum treatments in 2014 and 2015. From 2013 pre-treatment conditions, summer mean epilimnetic total phosphorus (TP) declined from 289 to 34 mu g/L in 2014 and then to 15 mu g/L in 2015 (a total reduction of 95%). Hypolimnetic TP declined 99% overall, and chlorophyll a dropped 70% while there was 135% improvement in transparency over the 2years. Toxic cyanobacteria blooms, a chronic problem in the lake, disappeared in 2015. Maintenance treatment in 2016 continued water quality improvements. The primary driver of water quality changes was a decrease in internal P loading from a mean rate of 25mg/m(2) per day to zero (negative rate) after the alum treatments. The improvements occurred despite application problems with the 2014 treatment, which had to be halted with only 66% of the planned dose (aluminum: 28mg/L or 83.7g/m(2)) applied. The remaining 34% of the original alum dose plus an annual maintenance water column dose and an additional 15% was applied in March 2015. The water quality improvements were achieved even with continuation of a highly enriched (TP: >450 mu g/L) external input from a legacy agricultural source. The changes were consistent with or exceeded predictions of a 2-layer, seasonal mass balance TP model used to evaluate restoration alternatives. These results show that alum treatments can eliminate high internal loading and, when coupled with annual maintenance treatments, provide sustained water quality improvements despite continued external loading.																	1040-2381	2151-5530					2017	33	2			SI		108	118		10.1080/10402381.2017.1311390								WOS:000403102200002

Nine years of phosphorus management with lanthanum modified bentonite (Phoslock) in a eutrophic, shallow swimming lake in Germany. Lake Reserve Manage. 33:119-129.Eutrophication is threatening shallow lakes, their functioning and ecosystem services. In recent years, lanthanum modified bentonite (LMB) has been increasingly applied to eutrophic lakes to enforce recovery processes by increasing sediment phosphorus (P)-sorption capacity and reducing P in the water column. In this long-term study, we examined the water quality characteristics of a polymictic, eutrophic swimming lake in central Germany, Lake Barensee, an artificial, excavated lake suffering from frequent cyanobacterial blooms caused by nutrient enrichment, mostly from swimmers, runoff, and P release from the sediments. Barensee was first treated with LMB in 2007. This restoration method is based on the strong ionic bond formed between lanthanum (La) and phosphate (PO4), which results in the formation of rhabdophane (LaPO(4)nH(2)O) in the sediment. Smaller reapplications of LMB were conducted in 2010 and 2013 when P concentrations exceeded a defined level as a result of frequent nutrient inputs, primarily by swimmers. The intensity of mineralization processes decreased, preventing large algal and cyanobacterial blooms. Post-treatment chlorophyll a, total nitrogen, and ammonium concentrations indicate that the productivity of the lake has been limited by recurrent small treatments with LMB. Because of this P management, the lake could be used continuously for swimming and recreation.																	1040-2381	2151-5530					2017	33	2			SI		119	129		10.1080/10402381.2016.1263693								WOS:000403102200003						
J	Huser, BJ				Huser, Brian J.			Aluminum application to restore water quality in eutrophic lakes: maximizing binding efficiency between aluminum and phosphorus	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Huser BJ. 2017. Aluminum application to restore water quality in eutrophic lakes: maximizing binding efficiency between aluminum and phosphorus. Lake Reserv Manage. 33:143-151.Aluminum (Al), typically added to lakes to reduce internal cycling of legacy phosphorus (P) in sediment, was added to the littoral zone of Lake Harriet (Minnesota) to inhibit the uptake of sediment P by buoyancy regulating species of plankton. Analytical results from sediment collected over an 11-year period showed that the added Al (32 g/m(2)) started to move outside the treatment zone almost immediately after treatment, with <5% remaining within the treatment area after 6 months. Although the original treatment design failed, the application method was, unexpectedly, a success with respect to binding efficiency between Al and P in the sediment. As the Al drifted to deeper areas of the lake, internal P release in non-treated, deeper areas of the lake declined and the binding ratio between Al and Al-bound P decreased, reaching 2.1 (molar) in profundal sediments 10years after treatment. The increased contact with available (mobile) sediment P increased binding efficiency, resulting in a 163-581% increase of P bound per unit Al compared to previous whole-lake aluminum treatments. The binding efficiency exceeded expectations showing that, in addition to the amount of Al added, treatment location and subsequent translocation of the Al floc can substantially affect binding efficiency and treatment effectiveness.

A newly developed injection method for aluminum treatment in eutrophic lakes: Effects on water quality and phosphorus binding efficiency	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Schutz J, Rydin E, Huser BJ. 2017. A newly developed injection method for aluminum treatment in eutrophic lakes: Effects on water quality and phosphorus binding efficiency. Lake Reserv Manage. 33:152-162.Application of aluminum (Al) salts has been used to reduce phosphorus (P) concentrations in lakes since the 1960s. Al is typically applied to the water column where Al-hydroxides form, settle to the sediment surface, and bind P in sediment. Al can be transported to other, non-target areas of the lake, however, potentially limiting treatment effectiveness. To alleviate this problem, a new method has been developed in which the Al salt is injected directly into the sediment as a liquid. In this study, the binding efficiency and application costs were calculated for 2 lakes in Sweden that received injection applications of polyaluminum chloride (PAC). Binding efficiency was similar to previous water column applications, implying there is little difference between the 2 application methods. Other factors, however, such as dissolved organic matter and type of Al salt used (PAC vs. Al sulfate), can also affect binding efficiency. Thus, Al injection may have improved the amount of P bound per unit Al in the study lakes given the in-lake conditions and Al salt used. Treatment cost (cost per kilogram of P bound to Al) for the injection method compared to previous water column treatments was somewhat higher due to increased costs for buffered PAC and time needed for application. Both mobile sediment P and internal loading remained reduced compared to pre-treatment conditions, showing that the Al injection treatments continued to control sediment P release. More study is needed, however, to determine the relative effectiveness of this method in different types of lakes.

J	Nurnberg, GK				Nurnberg, Gertrud K.			Attempted management of cyanobacteria by Phoslock (lanthanum-modified clay) in Canadian lakes: water quality results and predictions	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Nurnberg GK. 2017. Attempted management of cyanobacteria by Phoslock (lanthanum-modified clay) in Canadian lakes: water quality results and predictions. Lake Reserv Manage. 33:163-170.When internal phosphorus (P) loading from the bottom sediments outweighs external P inputs to lakes, lake water quality and cyanobacteria blooms will not respond to external measures alone and therefore require an in-lake restoration treatment. Lake characteristics and governmental regulations do not permit a random choice of such methods. A treatment developed by an Australian research institute (CSIRO) more than 15years ago has recently been introduced to Canada and is licensed in Ontario. The lake water treatment consists of the application of a phosphate adsorbing and sediment capping agent called Phoslock in North America, a clay (bentonite) that has been systematically amended by the phosphate adsorbing element lanthanum. When applied, Phoslock sinks to the lake bottom where it intercepts the upward flux of internal load from sediment P release. Although the number of monitored Canadian applications is still small, suggestions to optimize restoration effects can be made, including the avoidance of high flushing during application, system isolation, and timing to coincide with high levels of inorganic P in the lake water. Initial results in at least 2 cases (Swan Lake, City of Markham, Greater Toronto Area; and Henderson Lake, Lethbridge, Alberta) were promising despite the unexpected external P input from waterfowl and possibly other external sources. Other applications are planned in a Quebec lake and are being discussed in several other provinces.

Aluminum treatments to control internal phosphorus loading in lakes on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Lake Reserv Manage. 33:171-186.Ten lakes on Cape Cod, Massachusetts have been treated with aluminum since 1995, with 2 of those lakes receiving a second treatment. Elimination of cyanobacterial blooms was the goal in each case. Cape Cod lakes are mostly kettleholes with long detention times. Precipitation and groundwater dominated hydrologic inputs, but internal load contributed a major portion of the total phosphorus (TP) load to treated lakes. Aluminum sulfate and sodium aluminate were used in treatments with the intent to maintain a near-neutral pH in low alkalinity waters. Aluminum doses ranged from 10 to 100 g/m(2), depending on mobile P concentrations in the upper 10cm of sediment. Results varied, although all treatments lowered TP, provided relief from blooms, increased water clarity, and reduced oxygen demand for multiple years. Important lessons learned over 2 decades include how to apply aluminum to prevent fish mortality, options for dose calculation, and expectations for duration of benefits. To control internal loading and minimize cyanobacterial blooms at the lowest cost, treatment of Cape Cod lakes should apply aluminum at a concentration at least 10times the mobile P concentration in the upper 10cm of sediment exposed to anoxia and at concentrations that leave no more than 100 mg/kg of iron-bound P in laboratory inactivation assays. Cost of treatment in 2016 dollars averaged $150/g/m(2) of applied aluminum per ha treated. Aluminum treatment has been demonstrated as a valued lake management tool to improve water quality and reduce nuisance algal blooms in Cape Cod lakes.																	1040-2381	2151-5530					2017	33	2			SI		171	186		10.1080/10402381.2017.1308449								WOS:000403102200008

Distribution of aluminum and phosphorus fractions following alum treatments in a large shallow lake	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Welch EB, Gibbons HL, Brattebo SK, Corson-Rikert HA. 2017. Distribution of aluminum and phosphorus fractions following alum treatments in a large shallow lake. Lake Reserve Manage. 33:198-204.Alum was added to the middle 40% of 5200ha Grand Lake St. Marys (mean depth 1.6m) in western Ohio during 2 successive years. About <8% to 2% of the added aluminum (Al) remained in the water column immediately after treatment, and aluminum-phosphorus (Al-P) was effectively formed in the targeted treated sediment. Sediment Al and Al-P were significantly higher inside than outside the treated area with an Al-added to Al-P-formed ratio of 51, double the initial effectiveness expected (102) from the 2year Al dose of 95g/m(2). Sediment total P was also higher inside than outside the treatment area. The source of P that formed Al-P was more likely undetermined soluble reactive P diffused from deeper sediment and to a lesser extent external P loading. Mobile iron-P (Fe-P), usually the principal mobile fraction, was relatively low with no noticeable depletion (inside-outside), and loosely sorbed P was undetectable. Biogenic P (living algae and detritus) was also relatively low and showed no noticeable depletion. Some of the greater variability in sediment Al outside than inside the treated area may have been caused by resuspension and redistribution of the alum floc. Two of the 3 outside sites on the lee side of the treated area had higher sediment Al, whereas 2 of 3 outside sites on the windward side had lower Al. Nevertheless, the alum floc remained largely in the treated area for at least 3months to >1year, forming sediment Al-P.																	1040-2381	2151-5530					2017	33	2			SI		198	204		10.1080/10402381.2016.1276653								WOS:000403102200010

Employing indicators for prioritization of fish assemblage with a view to manage freshwater fish diversity and ecosystem health in the tributaries of Ganges basin, India	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												The major tributaries of the river Ganges basin are currently threatened by various anthropogenic activities which are hampering the ecosystem stability and fish biodiversity of the basin. Multiple indicators were used to prioritize the fish assemblages in the tributaries and to develop an index that is responsive to human-induced environmental changes. A high percentage of invasive species was described with the orgin index at the most disturbed sites of rivers Gomti and Betwa which also represented a substantial amount of biological disturbance. The Fisheries Assessment Integrity Index based on ecological integrity of different segments of the rivers was used to prioritize different sampling sites of the tributaries. Some of the sampling sites in Gomti and Betwa rivers are reflecting disturbed fish assemblages, a very low Fisheries Assessment Integrity Index score, few threatened species, and a high proportion of invasive species. Principal components analysis of the sampling sites, along with fish assemblage, reflected the influence of the habitat parameters on structuring the assemblage pattern. This study identified depth, flow, water quality and land uses in shaping fish assemblages. The combination of various indices in this study should provide more accurate measures in identifying sites of high conservation value.																	1463-4988	1539-4077				JAN-JUN	2017	20	1-2			SI		21	29		10.1080/14634988.2017.1270146								WOS:000400410800004

Studies on ecology, fish diversity and fisheries of Ken-Betwa rivers (India): Proposed for inter-linking	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												The Ken and Betwa rivers traversing through Central India are the major tributaries of the river Yamuna. Both rivers originate above 550m above sea level in the Vindhya region. An interlinking project proposed for the rivers envisages diversion of water from Ken basin to the Betwa. The river sediment is alkaline and dominated by sand (78-89%) in both rivers. Oxygen-rich alkaline water and moderate values of chemical parameters show the pollution free and productive nature of both the rivers. There was no statistically significant difference in water quality between the Ken and Betwa rivers, except for total alkalinity. The biotic parameters were observed in similar ranges and moderate condition. A total of 61 planktonic forms were recorded from the rivers out of which 55 were phytoplankton. For the first time, 89 fish species belonging to 10 orders, 26 families, and 62 genera have been recorded in the river Ken, while 81 species classified under 10 orders, 24 families, and 55 genera were found in the Betwa. Exotic fish species were also observed in the downstream stretches of both rivers. Out of the total fish species, 77 were common to both rivers, 12 were found only in the Ken River, and 4 species were restricted to the Betwa. Analysis of relative abundance showed dominance of Labeo boggut in the Ken and Osteobrama cotio in the Betwa River. On comparison of the Shannon-Wiener Diversity and Evenness Indices of fish diversity, these indicated slightly higher values in the Ken (3.76 and 0.842) than the Betwa (3.66 and 0.835). A total of nine near-threatened fish species was recorded in the rivers. Both rivers have already been obstructed by many developmental projects; the proposed interlinking would further negatively impact the ecology and fisheries.																	1463-4988	1539-4077				JAN-JUN	2017	20	1-2			SI		71	85		10.1080/14634988.2017.1261576								WOS:000400410800008

AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												The Damodar and Subarnarekha Rivers are the first and second largest running waters of Jharkhand, having variable river bed morphology with naturally hard substrates. The riverine biodiversity is outstanding, as it includes endemic taxa on species and subspecies levels. Aquatic habitats are mostly colonized by native species. Macrozoobenthic animals are important bioindicators of the habitat quality of the river and are used for rapid assessment of river quality globally. In order to have preliminary information on the biodiversity of macrobenthos, the first survey was undertaken to find the impact of domestic pollution, mining, and thermal power plants on the aquatic life of the Damodar in May 2004. On the basis of our observations and species records, systematic field sampling for macro-benthic invertebrates in the Damodar and Subarnarekha Rivers was conducted from 2007 to 2012 during different hydrological conditions to cover the seasonal variation. Synoptic sampling was done to allow comparison between the two rivers. Aquatic invertebrate fauna has been inventoried with 124 identified taxa. The highest proportion of functional feeding groups recorded were detritivores, followed by carnivores and herbivores, respectively. This present study demonstrates the seasonal disappearance of macrozoobenthic invertebrates caused by urban and industrial pollution and that the fauna of the two main rivers of Jharkhand are similar in species inventory. This reflects the ecological conditions of the shared ecoregion known as Chota Nagpur Dry Forests. The results of the present research provide an essential database to evaluate the future environmental impact of restoration and changes in water quality.																	1463-4988	1539-4077				JAN-JUN	2017	20	1-2			SI		116	129		10.1080/14634988.2017.1300041								WOS:000400410800011

Effect of river connectivity on hydrochemistry, sediment enzyme activity and biotic communities of wetlands	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Wetlands associated with floodplains of the Ganges and Brahmaputra river systems cover an estimated 0.2million ha and play a vital role in the fisheries, rural economy and environment. In recent years, most wetlands in the states of Bihar, Assam and West Bengal in India have lost connectivity with their parent rivers due to natural and anthropogenic changes. These changes are causing rapid shrinkage of valuable wetlands and threatening their biodiversity and ecological function. The present study was conducted to assess the effect of river connectivity on the hydrochemistry, sediment enzyme activity, and biotic communities of these wetlands. One wetland area having link channels (open) connecting the main river, and another without link channels (closed), were selected from each of the Ganges and Brahmaputra basins for the study. Comparative analysis of open and closed, ecologically distinct wetlands of the Ganges basin revealed greater seasonal reduction in water depth and higher water conductivity (p < 0.04), nutrients (Ca+2, Mg+2, SiO3-Si), sediment microbial activity (p < 0.004), phosphorous cycling enzymes (p < 0.001), carbon cycling enzymes (p < 0.01), organic matter, conductivity, and plankton and macrozoobenthos (p < 0.01) density in the closed wetland. However, the open wetland showed higher diversity of plankton and macrozoobenthos. A profound impact of connectivity on wetland fisheries was observed in the Brahmaputra basin in Assam, where a higher percentage of catch comprised of indigenous fish species with lower fish yield was noted in the open wetland.																	1463-4988	1539-4077				JAN-JUN	2017	20	1-2			SI		140	150		10.1080/14634988.2017.1301095								WOS:000400410800013

The river drains 45.64km(3) of annual run-off and a series of dams was proposed to hold some of its water resources for multipurpose use. Currently, three dams have been built in Madhya Pradesh and one is under construction in Gujarat. A comparison of pre- and post-impoundment eco-environment and fisheries revealed changes in water quality, productivity, and aquatic flora and fauna of the river system. Among the fish, species like Tor tor, Labeo fimbriatus and Labeo dyocheilus suffered most. The percentage contributions to total yield of Carp, Catfish, and miscellaneous groups have significantly changed, indicating falls of 17%, 36% and an increase of 410%, respectively. Percentage contributions to catches of Macrobrachium rosenbergii and Tenualosa ilisha have also declined by 46% and about 75% in the estuarine stretch of the river system.

In addition to 25 sampling sites along the main stream of the River Krishna, sampling was also done in 13 important tributaries at sites upstream of the confluence point. Dams, barrages and anicuts have visible impacts on all of the observed physical and chemical properties of water and soil.

Despite a generally high level of drinking water safety, contamination events do occur. We address the question whether demographic change may cause a spatial mismatch between installed capacities at the supply side and actual demand by water users, thereby increasing risks of microbiological contamination. Our investigation is based on a quantitative analysis using the largest publically available data-set on drinking water quality in Germany. We found that the number of reported contamination events in areas affected by population decrease was about twice as high as in areas with a stable or growing population. The relative frequency of microbiological contamination was found to be significantly correlated with rapidly depopulating areas. We conclude that in regions with negative population development, a statistically higher risk of microbiological drinking water contamination may coincide with a greater risk of recontamination during a longer passage in the distribution network.																	1573-062X	1744-9006					2017	14	6					621	629		10.1080/1573062X.2016.1240809								WOS:000399647000007						
J	Zafra, C; Temprano, J; Tejero, I				Zafra, Carlos; Temprano, Javier; Tejero, Inaki			The physical factors affecting heavy metals accumulated in the sediment deposited on road surfaces in dry weather: a review	URBAN WATER JOURNAL												The main objective of this review is to identify and analyse physical factors (PF) involved in the heavy metal accumulation phenomenon in the road-deposited sediment (RDS) in dry weather. Electronic databases were used to establish an order of prevalence by establishing quartiles (Q-citation frequency) for the PF identified. The results show that the eleven PF can most likely be classified into three categories: climatic-anthropogenic-morphometric. The studies most frequently referenced land use (Q1), rainfall (Q2), particle size (Q2) and vehicles (Q3) as key PF. There is a similar behaviour between the concentrations of Zn-Pb-Cu associated with the RDS in dry weather and the dissolved fraction washed from the surface in road runoff. The size fraction <250 mu m is representative of RDS to characterize the metals. The review expands knowledge about the influences of the PF in the processes of deposition-suspension-interception-removal of the metals load in road environments.

The geochemistry of hydraulic fracturing fluids	15TH WATER-ROCK INTERACTION INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM, WRI-15	Procedia Earth and Planetary Science				15th Water-Rock Interaction International Symposium (WRI)	OCT 16-21, 2016	Evora, PORTUGAL					The inorganic geochemistry of hydraulic fracturing fluids is reviewed with new insights on the role of entrapped formation waters in unconventional shale gas and tight sand formations on the quality of flowback and produced waters that are extracted with hydrocarbons. The rapid increase of the salinity of flowback fluids during production, combined with geochemical and isotopic changes, indicate mixing of the highly saline formation water with the injected water. The salinity increase suggests that the volume of the injected water that is returned to the surface with the flowback water is much smaller than previous estimates, and thus the majority of the injected water is retained within the shale formations. The high salinity of the flowback and produced water is associated with high concentrations of halides, ammonium, metals, metalloids, and radium nuclides that pose environmental and human health risks upon the release of the hydraulic fracturing fluids to the environment.

The target shales of the Elko Formation are unique fresh-water hydrocarbon reservoirs with relatively dilute source water (8.5 g/L total dissolved solids [TDS]). Additionally, the Elko Formation is underlain by a freshwater carbonate aquifer (0.2-0.3 g/L TDS) that outcrops downgradient of the exploration area. The water quality and isotopic data were used to evaluate pre-hydraulic fracturing conditions in this undeveloped area. The same data were also collected for groundwater and surface-water sites about two months and one year after exploration hydraulic fracturing. No systematic differences in water chemistry were observed between pre- and post-hydraulic fracturing samples. Based on water chemistry of shallow groundwater, surface water, and from the production zone, the most useful constituents identified for monitoring for potential future incursion of reservoir-associated fluids into the near-surface environment are TDS (or electrical conductivity), chloride, propane, methanol, ethanol, and 2-butoxyethanol. Groundwater flow and transport models were developed to evaluate the potential movement of hydrocarbons and hydraulic fracturing fluids from the targeted zones, which are about 1800 to 3600 m beneath the land surface, to shallow groundwater (< 300 m below land surface). Model simulations indicate that hydraulic fracturing fluid remains contained within the target shales for at least 1,000 years for most development scenarios. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published B.V.

Bioassays took place with water samples before and after the treatment system and in the river, once treated water is discharged. Due to the high toxicity of the water collected at the mouth of the mine (before the treatment plant), the bioassay was designed and developed with respect to the exposed organism and the characteristics of the water. The results obtained in the screening experiment show the high efficiency of the treatment plant in terms of ecotoxicity, using Artemia sp. toxicity test. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Assessment of wastewater contaminants retention for a Soil-Aquifer Treatment system using soil-column experiments	15TH WATER-ROCK INTERACTION INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM, WRI-15	Procedia Earth and Planetary Science				15th Water-Rock Interaction International Symposium (WRI)	OCT 16-21, 2016	Evora, PORTUGAL					Soil-Aquifer Treatment systems are increasingly seen as a relatively inexpensive and complementary water quality enhancement process, which may be particularly relevant in water scarcity scenarios. In this context, a set of soil-column experiments were conducted aiming to replicate the conditions of infiltration basins using soil as a depuration media for wastewater quality increment previous to managed aquifer recharge. The results showed a decrease in a set of contaminants analysed, when comparing to the inflow concentrations, showing that retention and degradation are occurring inside the experimented soil. Ultimately a set of conclusions were achieved that allowed to define the composition of a reactive layer to be installed in real scale infiltration basins that will act as a complementary wastewater treatment method.

Impacts of climate change, climate variability and management on soil and water quality in wetlands of South Australia	15TH WATER-ROCK INTERACTION INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM, WRI-15	Procedia Earth and Planetary Science				15th Water-Rock Interaction International Symposium (WRI)	OCT 16-21, 2016	Evora, PORTUGAL					Wetland systems worldwide have been influenced by anthropic change, such that finding a natural baseline is rare. The consequences for ecosystem biodiversity and resilience at landscape scale have been enormous. The compounding effects of climate change and variability, knowledge gaps in landscape connectivity and feedbacks make the task of managing wetlands as part of a larger landscape difficult. This paper presents a summary of the impacts of natural and anthropic factors on contaminant mobilisation in sulfidic wetland systems of Australia. It highlights the role of water-soil/sediment interactions, acid-neutralizing and buffering mechanisms, and the irreversibility of some changes during the drying and wetting of sub-aqueous wetland soils.

It is characterized by the scarcity of water resources including groundwater, which can be threatened by pollution. Therefore, degradation of water quality is growing because the human activity is increasing. The agricultural, urban and industrial activities have contributed in recent decades to increase the potential contamination of water resources. The aim of this project is to assess the vulnerability of groundwater to pollution in the PreSaharan zones (case of Tafilalet plain), so it will be an important tool for making decision in the water management sector. The method applied in this work is the DRASTIC method based on the integration of several hydrogeological parameters in a multicriteria analysis. The results of this study show that the moderate class of vulnerability is the most dominant; it represents 56% of the aquifer area, followed by low vulnerability class with 40%, and the high vulnerability don't exceed 4%, while the very low and very high vulnerability classes are not encountered in the area study.

Water quality and chemistry of the groundwater have been investigated by a systematic screening operation of tube wells in a locality in West Bengal (India). Groundwater is predominantly of Ca-HCO3-type and is occasionally enriched with Na and Cl- in shallow wells (15-20 m) which may be an indicator of local pollution source. The groundwater As distribution and their relationship with land-use characteristics suggest that As release is also influenced by local land use conditions (e.g., sanitation, surface water bodies and agricultural practices). The interconnectivity of these land use conditions with the aquifer underneath often facilitates As release creating heterogeneity in their distribution. (C) 2017 The Authors.

The environmental concerns related to hydraulic fracturing has been greatly attracted. One of most important environmental concerns is regional water quality which may be contaminated by produced waters through induced and natural fractures and wastewater discharge. At present, the baseline water quality must be firstly obtained to identify potential pollution of the activity and monitoring indicators should be studied for better environmental monitoring. We sampled shallow groundwater, produced waters, shale rock and soil in the Jiaoshiba shale-gas region, SW China and measurements have included water chemistry and isotopes. Preliminary results show that the present shallow karst groundwater quality is pretty good with the total dissolved solids (TDS) ranging from 129 to 343 mg/L and with water chemistry type of HCO3-Ca, However, some groundwaters have been polluted by agricultural activities. Produced waters have relatively high salinity with TDS ranging from 2 to 14 g/L. Laboratory experiment of fracturing liquid and shale rock interaction at simulated reservoir conditions shows that TDS in the flowback fluid increases 10 times and Ca2+, Na+, Cl- and SO42- make dominant contributions. The main geochemical reactions are inferred to be pyrite oxidation and the dissolution of calcite, dolomite and plagioclase, resulting in increases of major ions in the flowback fluid. The inorganic geochemical monitoring indicators for shale gas exploration of the Silurian Longmaxi formation has been determined. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. The Authors.

These mineral waters discharge with a temperature between 17 and 20 degrees C, show a very alkaline pH (up to 11.8), and have: Na-Cl/Ca-OH facies; dry residuum approximate to 200 mg/L; C-total < 3.0 mg/L; and extremely low Mg2+ and silica concentrations (< 0.3 and 6.5 mg/L, respectively). CH4 isotopic composition (-24.4 parts per thousand < delta C-13-CH4 < -14.0 parts per thousand and 285 parts per thousand < delta H-2-CH4 < -218 parts per thousand) falls in the range of typical abiotic gas. In the case of Cabeco de Vide mineral waters, the understanding of the resource will help to preserve the mineral water quality, creating public interest. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Health and environmental concerns cross society as well as research; water-quality questions are important issues, and those related to selenium are increasingly so. Many discussions focus on the permissible quantities and value of the standard for drinking water of 10 mu g.L-1, because the safety margin between nutritional requirements and toxic effects is complex to establish. Transdisciplinary approaches integrating current scientific issues to provide consistent answers to the multiple questions arising on Se origins, mechanisms and toxicity are needed. New approaches involve multi-scales studies of Se dynamics and transfer processes from host rock to groundwater and, through the soil and drinking water, to the human population and an evaluation of its effects from deficiency to excess. Finally, the measures required to achieve water standards or recover quality in water bodies should also be assessed to evaluate the solutions from the indirect human health, economic and environmental aspects.

The presence of calcite in fractures of local rocks maintains an alkaline pH in all the mass water. Oxygenation condition inside reservoir is almost constant. According to the bathymetry, the mass balance displays a variation of properties which are seasonally controlled by hydrological events. High loads of elements were detected in solution during dry season (November 2015): sulfates present a load of 11,378.65 tons, confirming that main inlets in the reservoir are mine drainages. The Arsenic has a similar behavior: a greater load in solution during dry season, with 9.85 tons compared with other periods (less or equal to 0.5 tons). The greatest loads of iron and manganese are present in rainy season (20.43 and 9.15 tons respectively). This suggests the existence of a mobilization of precipitated minerals on the channel that feeds the mass water and reach the bottom of the reservoir where reducing conditions are dominant, favoring their release to the aqueous phase. Oxygen concentration decreases by half between the seasons due to organic matter oxidation. This trend continued in November, because quantities in solution were very high. (C) 2017 The Authors.

This system is localized at south of Chiapas state, SE Mexico. It is considered one of most beauties landscapes of the country. Main importance is due to climatic and hydrological regulation of this region. However anthropic activities as deforestation and waste water spills begin to produce risky conditions to water quality. This work presents spatial and temporal variability of water quality considering the study of ten lagoons through three sampling periods. Two of these periods of field work, (april and september 2013) consider sampling of only one point at surface in each lagoon. A very extensive sampling was developed in august 2014 in ten lagoons. Results show that this karstic system can be divided in two groups of water quality. First group of lakes contains calcic-magnesic-bicarbonated-sulfated waters and second group contains calcic-magnesic-bicarbonated waters. At first group, is possible to identify impacts related to inlet of waters high in sulfates and chlorides, these solutes dilutes along two first lagoons. An independent flow system rich in sulfates, probably of groundwater that circulates deeply was identified. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Formation of waste-rock drainage water on massive sulfide deposits of the Urals (Russia)	15TH WATER-ROCK INTERACTION INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM, WRI-15	Procedia Earth and Planetary Science				15th Water-Rock Interaction International Symposium (WRI)	OCT 16-21, 2016	Evora, PORTUGAL					The waste-rock stockpiles of copper pyrite mines are enriched by sulphide minerals; therefore their dissolution is the reason for the acidic waters formation. Hydrochemical processes responsible for the water quality of the formed waste-rock stockpiles are studied using several sites of the Urals as the examples. Sulphide mineralization causes the sulfate composition of water, iron, aluminum and magnesium to prevail among the cations. The comparison of mine and waste-rock drainage composition shows that waste-rock waters are more mineralized: TDC is 3-5 times higher and the aluminum, iron, copper and zinc concentrations are 4-8 times higher. The composition of rocks forming mine drainage and waste rock drainage is similar, thus it can be hypothesized that the hydrogeochemical processes of mine drainage and of the waste-rock piles waters do not have significant differences. However, the degree of rock disintegration and a temperature gradient in dumps is higher, while the rate of water interchange is lower. The set of hydrodynamic, geomechanical and temperature factors promote the formation of more acidic mineralized waters of the dump body. Computer simulation (Visual MINTEQ ver. 3.0/3.1) has shown that with the rate of sulphides oxidation of 3.6.10(3) mol/hour, the sulphides mass in the dumps would produce acidic leach-water in several hundred years.

The construction of these residual lakes, their filling with water from nearby rivers and their water quality management are real challenges in terms of regional water management. These lakes pose challenges, but also offer opportunities for humans as well as for nature. They are to be one of several nuclei in the development of a post-mine region. It is the task of all water management actors to make this become a reality. Another water-related challenge is the management of mine drainage water. As groundwater rises and seeps into the overburden dumps, the results of the oxidation of geogenic pyrites will influence the chemical water composition, leading to higher concentrations of sulphates and iron as well as to a limited reduction of the pH value. Different countermeasures are already being taken, so that outside the mines it is in general the sulphate concentrations that are of relevance. To ensure that this does not affect natural habitats such as rivers or the public water supply, additional countermeasures will have to be taken in future. The tasks that have been caused by lignite mining activities are performed by the mining company. The associated costs can be reliably assessed and covered thanks to appropriate mining provisions.																	0043-0978						2017	107	4					20	29		10.1007/s35147-017-0026-3								WOS:000398756000003

It was analyzed 16,625 data collected between 2002 and 2011 by the water quality monitoring program carried out by the Instituto Mineiro de Gestao das Aguas (Institute of Water Management of Minas Gerais - IGAM). Statistical tests, multivariate and non-parametric tests were used to assess 11 physical, chemical and microbiological variables of 29 monitoring stations. The results of Mann-Kendall/Sazonal MannKendall trend tests indicated that most of the watercourses in the region showed stable values of the parameters over the study period, with changes associated with thermotolerant coliforms, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), nitrate and water quality index (IQA) mainly near large urban centers. The Cluster analysis identified three major groups of monitoring stations, grouped according to the quality of its waters, corresponding to high levels of pollution, moderate pollution and low pollution. However, throughout all the sub-basin, it was observed the degradation of the water quality, mainly related to the release of wastewater.

Water samples were collected quarterly in a stretch of 80 km of the river, from September 2013 to June 2014. After analysis, these parameters were compared with values established by the CONAMA Resolution 357/2005 (Class 2). Multivariate analysis (correlation, Kruskal-Wallis and cluster hierarchical) showed that the only parameter that varied spatially was the dissolved oxygen (DO) (p<0.05), due to the strong influence of the stretch reaeration. On the other hand, the other parameters - color, turbidity, electrical conductivity, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), NH3, P, pH, SO4, Mg, Cl-, thermotolerant coliforms (TC), Escherichia coli and chlorophyll-a - showed only significant temporal variation (p<0.05). We conclude that variation of the TSI ranged from oligotrophic, mesotrophic until ultraoligotrophic. Color, TC and E. coli parameters presented non-compliance with legislation, suggesting relative, but significant, influence, both of hydrological and environmental impacts (urban, industries and hydroelectric plant of Santo Antonio do Jari). Both factors explain not only the seasonal variation of TC, E. coli and color during the rainy season (p< 0.05), but also the correlation among color, turbidity, temperature, DO, Cl-, NH3, Mg, DBO, SO4, pH, E. coli, TC and chlorophyll-a, along the hydrological cycle and its seasonal dynamics (p<0.05), indirectly influencing the behavior of the TSI (p<0.05).																	1413-4152	1809-4457				JAN-FEB	2017	22	1					45	56		10.1590/S1413-41522016144803								WOS:000396344100006						
J	Burg, A; Gavrieli, I; Guttman, J				Burg, Avihu; Gavrieli, Ittai; Guttman, Joseph			Concurrent Salinization and Development ofAnoxic Conditions in a Confined Aquifer, Southern Israel	GROUNDWATER												An ancient, brackish, anoxic, and relatively hot water body exists within the Yarqon-Tanninim Aquifer in southern Israel. A hydrogeological-geochemical conceptual model is presented, whereby the low water quality is the outcome of three conditions that are met simultaneously: (1) Presence of an organic-rich unit with low permeability that overlies and confines the aquifer; the confining unit contains perched horizons with relatively saline water. (2) Local phreatic/roofed conditions within the aquifer that enable seepage of the organic-rich brackish water from above. The oxidation of the dissolved organic matter in the seeping water consumes the dissolved oxygen and continues through bacterial sulfate reduction, with H2S as a product. These exothermic reactions result in some heating. (3) The seeping water comprises a relatively large portion of the water volume. In the presented case study, the latter condition first developed in the Late Pleistocene following climate change, which led to a dramatic decline in recharge. Consequently, water flow in the local basin has nearly ceased, as evident by old water ages, specific isotopic composition, and nearly equipotential water levels. The continuous seepage from above into the almost stagnant water body has resulted in degraded water quality. Seepages of organic-rich brackish water exist at other sites throughout the aquifer but have limited impact on the salinity and redox conditions due to the dynamic water flow, which flushes the seeping water, that is, the third condition is not met. The coexistence of the above three conditions may explain the development of anoxic and saline groundwater in other aquifers worldwide.																	0017-467X	1745-6584					2017	55	2					183	198		10.1111/gwat.12474								WOS:000395640200007	27727479

Permeable Asphalt: A New Tool to Reduce Road Salt Contamination of Groundwater in Urban Areas	GROUNDWATER												Chloride contamination of groundwater in urban areas due to deicing is a well- documented phenomenon in northern climates. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of permeable pavement on degraded urban groundwater. Although low impact development practices have been shown to improve stormwater quality, no infiltration practice has been found to prevent road salt chlorides from entering groundwater. The few studies that have investigated chlorides in permeable asphalt have involved sampling directly beneath the asphalt; no research has looked more broadly at surrounding groundwater conditions. Monitoring wells were installed upgradient and downgradient of an 860m(2) permeable asphalt parking lot at the University of Connecticut (Storrs, Connecticut). Water level and specific conductance were measured continuously, and biweekly samples were analyzed for chloride. Samples were also analyzed for sodium (Na), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg). Analysis of variance analysis indicated a significantly (p< 0.001) lower geometric mean Cl concentration downgradient (303.7 mg/L) as compared to upgradient (1280 mg/L). Concentrations of all alkali metals increased upgradient and downgradient during the winter months as compared to nonwinter months, indicating that cation exchange likely occurred. Despite the frequent high peaks of chloride in the winter months as well as the increases in alkali metals observed, monitoring revealed lower Cl concentrations downgradient than upgradient for the majority of the year. These results suggest that the use of permeable asphalt in impacted urban environments with high ambient chloride concentrations can be beneficial to shallow groundwater quality, although these results may not be generalizable to areas with low ambient chloride concentrations.																	0017-467X	1745-6584					2017	55	2					237	243		10.1111/gwat.12454								WOS:000395640200012	27576128

The model has been applied for straight-through flow manholes and for manholes with a difference in the level of the inlet and outlet pipes. The model is applicable to dissolved substances, i.e. the model has not been validated for high sediment concentrations (above 1 g/l) and care should be taken in such cases. Simulation results from the new model are compared with laboratory measurements and are further compared to conventional modelling techniques currently available in commercial software specially developed for modelling the water quality in sewers. The results prove that the new model produces considerably better results compared to the traditional assumption of full mixing in a manhole. The new model compares well to the laboratory measurements and hence improves the accuracy of modelling soluble pollutant transport in sewers. The applicability of the new modelling approach is discussed and further studies are recommended.																	1573-062X	1744-9006					2017	14	5					443	451		10.1080/1573062X.2016.1179335								WOS:000396045200001

However, the connection between roof harvested rainwater and health is not well documented especially in developing countries. Understanding the application of locally available treatment methods provides insight into this problem. This paper reports on experimental investigations where rainwater collected from a typical domestic roof in Mekelle, Ethiopia was treated using Moringa stenopetala seed, sand filter and boiling. The quality of the raw and treated roof harvested rainwater were compared against the Ethiopian and World Health Organization drinking water standards to investigate its suitability as a supplement for potable water supply. The pollutants analysed were total coliforms and turbidity. A significant improvement of turbidity and total coliforms was observed. This implies that application of plant coagulant followed by filtration can sufficiently treat rainwater and can be used as a low-cost treatment option in water scarce areas.																	1573-062X	1744-9006					2017	14	5					460	466		10.1080/1573062X.2016.1176225								WOS:000396045200003

Estimating flow data in urban drainage using partial least squares regression	URBAN WATER JOURNAL												Flow monitoring in wastewater systems is used for system operation or for billing purposes, among others. Given the difficult measurement conditions, gaps in measurement series occur frequently and stakeholders need an appropriate method to estimate missing data. In data scarcity situations, mathematical modelling of the underlying physical processes may not be feasible and other methods are required. Partial least squares (PLS) regression is a multivariate statistical method suited to correlated data and has been frequently used for water quality estimates. PLS suitability for hourly and daily flow estimations was tested, based on previous flow and precipitation data, which urban water utilities currently monitor. Results were evaluated using proposed performance criteria and classes. The estimation errors were comparable to the ones obtained in physical process modelling. The application of the proposed method for flow estimation in sewers, in two common scenarios of wet and dry weather flows, is presented and discussed.

Forty drainage ditches in the TGR from multiple land use types were extensively investigated for 10 parameters of water quality. The results showed that the concentrations of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) in the TGR drainage ditches were generally far higher than the internationally recognized eutrophication threshold. Based on this study, both ditch water and sediments from residential land and roadside land had the highest concentrations of nutrients. Possible sources of these nutrients include sewage water and septic tank overflow. Forestland had significantly lower concentrations of nutrients. Residential ditches had higher values of electrical conductivity (EC) and total dissolved solid (TDS) values and lower dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations. Forestland had lower values of EC and TDS values and higher DO concentrations. The results indicate that the nutrients that have accumulated in the sediments have significant impacts on the water quality in adjacent ditches. A long-term plan must be developed to more strictly control the external loading of nutrients from surrounding land. Action plans to promote the growth of wetland plants in drainage ditches are important for increasing agrochemical retention in the TGR drainage ditches. TGR drainage ditches from residential zones must be actively managed by cleaning and sediment removal to control the risk of nutrients being released into the reservoir.

The reservoir was monitored for four years: initially (from 2004 to 2007) for cyanobacterial cells and physicochemical parameters and, subsequently (in 2007 and 2008), for Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts and Giardia spp. cysts in four sampling stations. The concentrations of Escherichia coli were also measured in 2007 and 2008, wich allowed the characterization of each sampling point according to the National Environment Council (CONAMA) no. 274/ 2000. Results indicated concentrations of Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp. (oo)cysts ranging from 0 to 0.8 (oo) cysts. L-1, and higher concentrations of cyanobacteria cells, from 0.0 to 4.5 x 10(5) cells. mL(-1), thus indicating potential risks to human health, if the water from the reservoir is not properly treated before consumption. The group of cyanobacteria was not found during the dry season, returning soon after destratification. The rainy season was characterized by a higher ocurrence of cyanobacteria and predominance of picoplanktonic species (Aphanocapsa spp.), over the Microcystis spp. previously found and presented the highest variations in dissolved oxygen, turbidity, total phosphorous, orthophosphate, ammonia, nitrite and nitrate. The change observed within the group of cyanobacteria (Aphanocapsa spp. over Microcystis spp.) may be indicative of changing characteristics in the water source. All the sampling points were classified as adequate for primary contact recreation, given the E. coli concentrations, according to the CONAMA Resolution no. 274/ 2000.

The quality parameters were modeled biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), dissolved oxygen (DO), total phosphorus, nitrogen and thermotolerant coliforms. The flow data were obtained through the application of the hydrological model Modelo de Grandes Bacias/IPH (MGB-IPH). The quality model was calibrated using data from stations monitoring the water quality of the Instituto Mineiro de Gestao das Aguas (IGAM). The curves of BOD, DO and total phosphorus showed good adherence to data from monitoring campaigns. The parameters organic nitrogen, ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, and coliforms were underestimated by the model. Most streams have the quality of its waters compatible with Class 4.

From January to December 2011 water samples were monthly collected from upstream, downstream and inside the Sao Pedro city, and exposed to D. magna in laboratory for 48 hours to evaluate mobility effects. Conductivity, phenols, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, surfactants, pH, and TSI were measured. Values of the first five parameters showed low water quality downstream of the city. Chlorophyll a values were within the range permitted by the Brazilian environmental legislation and thus the TSI in Samambaia Creek was classified as ultra-oligotrophic for most sites and months. Water samples collected from January to April downstream of Sao Pedro were toxic to D. magna. The physical chemical analysis and the toxicity test indicate low quality of water from Samambaia Creek downstream the city of Sao Pedro.																	1413-4152	1809-4457				JAN-FEB	2017	22	1					195	201		10.1590/S1413-41522017130372								WOS:000396344100021

However, WTPs face numerous potential obstacles, including changes in source water quality and quantity, financial burdens related to operations and upgrades, and stringent water quality regulations. Moreover, these challenges may be exacerbated by climate change in the form of long-term climatic perturbations and the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. To help WTPs overcome these issues, decision support systems (DSSs), which are used to aid and enhance the quality and consistency of decision-making, have been developed. This paper reviews the scientific literature on the development and application of DSSs for water treatment, including physically-based models, statistical models, and artificial intelligence techniques, and suggests future directions in the field. We first set the context of how water quality is impacted by climate change and extreme weather events. We then provide a comprehensive review of DSSs and conclude by offering a series of recommendations for future DSS efforts for WTPs, suggesting that these tools should (1) more accurately reflect the practical needs of WTPs, (2) represent the tradeoffs between the multiple competing objectives inherent to water treatment, (3) explicitly handle uncertainty to better inform decision makers, (4) incorporate nonstationarity, especially with regard to extreme weather events and climate change for long-term planning, and (5) use standardized terminology to accelerate the dissemination of knowledge in the field.

Unlike static infrastructure, which cannot adapt its operation to individual storms or changing land uses, "smart" stormwater systems will use system-level coordination to maximize watershed pollutant removal and treatment. We illustrate that this vision is not limited by technology, which has matured to the point at which it can be ubiquitously deployed. Rather, the challenge is much more fundamental and rooted in a system-level understanding of environmental science. Once distributed stormwater systems become highly instrumented and controlled, how should they be operated to achieve desired watershed outcomes? The answer to this question demands the development of a theoretical framework for smart stormwater systems. In this paper, we lay out the requirements for such a theory. Acknowledging that the adoption of these systems may still be years away, we also present a modeling framework to allow for the simulation of controlled stormwater systems before they become commonplace. We apply this control framework to two simulated case studies in which stormwater sites are controlled to reduce nitrate loads to downstream water bodies.

J	Wang, J; Chua, LHC; Shanahan, P				Wang, Jia; Chua, Lloyd H. C.; Shanahan, Peter			Evaluation of pollutant removal efficiency of a bioretention basin and implications for stormwater management in tropical cities	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY												Non-point source pollution is a prevalent problem throughout the world. Bioretention basins have been deployed worldwide to treat stormwater runoff and alleviate eutrophication in downstream water resources. However, basin performance in the tropics is poorly understood. Given the distinctly different rainfall-runoff characteristics of tropical climates, whether basins that are built according to temperate design guidelines are effective is questionable. There have been no field studies based on continuous, high-resolution, long-term monitoring in the tropics. In this study, 96 storms were monitored in the first bio-retention basin in Singapore. Of these, flow measurements were made during 80 events and samples were collected and analyzed for 15 water quality parameters (including nitrogen and phosphorus species, total suspended solids, and chemical oxygen demand) during six events. The mean removal rates were 25%, 46%, and 53% for total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and total suspended solids respectively. Results show that a lack of storage capacity and resulting high overflow reduce pollutant removal efficiency for high-rainfall-depth events. The transition from efficient to non-efficient removal occurs at a rainfall depth between 10 and 30 mm. Low EMC (event mean concentration) and weak first flush as a result of frequent and intense rainfall in the tropics also contribute to low removal rate. The results suggest a need to revise bioretention basin design guidelines for the tropics to be based on WQV or WQD (water quality volume or depth) instead of ARI (average recurrence interval). A larger basin volume (WQD between 10 to 30 mm) is recommended.					/0000-0001-8667-8186												2053-1400	2053-1419				JAN 1	2017	3	1					78	91		10.1039/c6ew00285d								WOS:000394270400006

Membrane fouling profiles were quantified by water flux decline and permeate conductivity. Mechanisms of the synergistic effect of combined fouling were revealed by light scattering measurements and infrared spectra of foulant-foulant interaction and foulant- membrane interaction. Membrane fouling morphology and element mapping provided further details of transport of colloidal silica particles and elucidated the mechanisms for silica-induced pore wetting. Specially, gelation of alginate formed an alginate layer on membrane surface and prevented penetration of silica particles into the membrane matrix, which was confirmed by silicon element mapping as well as infrared spectra. Adsorption of BSA protein by colloidal silica aggregates led to a sharp water flux decline and a partial pore wetting. Humic acid, forming a coil structure in high salinity, exhibited limited interaction with colloidal silica that penetrated into the membrane matrix and wetted membrane pores, thereby compromising the product water quality. Results showed that the combined organic fouling with colloidal silica particle not only deteriorated water production, but also compromised product quality by partial membrane wetting.

Imaging Hydrological Processes in Headwater Riparian Seeps with Time-Lapse Electrical Resistivity	GROUNDWATER												Delineating hydrologic and pedogenic factors influencing groundwater flow in riparian zones is central in understanding pathways of water and nutrient transport. In this study, we combined two-dimensional time-lapse electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) (depth of investigation approximately 2m) with hydrometric monitoring to examine hydrological processes in the riparian area of FD-36, a small (0.4km(2)) agricultural headwater basin in the Valley and Ridge region of east-central Pennsylvania. We selected two contrasting study sites, including a seep with groundwater discharge and an adjacent area lacking such seepage. Both sites were underlain by a fragipan at 0.6m. We then monitored changes in electrical resistivity, shallow groundwater, and nitrate-N concentrations as a series of storms transitioned the landscape from dry to wet conditions. Time-lapse ERI revealed different resistivity patterns between seep and non-seep areas during the study period. Notably, the seep displayed strong resistivity reductions (similar to 60%) along a vertically aligned region of the soil profile, which coincided with strong upward hydraulic gradients recorded in a grid of nested piezometers (0.2- and 0.6-m depth). These patterns suggested a hydraulic connection between the seep and the nitrate-rich shallow groundwater system below the fragipan, which enabled groundwater and associated nitrate-N to discharge through the fragipan to the surface. In contrast, time-lapse ERI indicated no such connections in the non-seep area, with infiltrated rainwater presumably perched above the fragipan. Results highlight the value of pairing time-lapse ERI with hydrometric and water quality monitoring to illuminate possible groundwater and nutrient flow pathways to seeps in headwater riparian areas.																	0017-467X	1745-6584				JAN-FEB	2017	55	1					136	148		10.1111/gwat.12461								WOS:000393955900016	27618484

It supports the lifeline of major population in urban and rural areas existing in the river basin. The river is a chief source of water supply, power generation, river-borne transport and expansion of the urban industrial belt. However, the river receives huge amount of untreated wastewater which imbalances the nutrient concentration at many points along the stretch. Therefore, the present study is focused to estimate the water pollution using water quality indices, such as OPI, national sanitation foundation index (NSFWQI), comprehensive pollution index (CPI) and heavy metal pollution index (HPI), and identify the imbalance nutrients (i. e. NO3, PO4, heavy metals, etc.) in the river. Also, the probability of health risk that might occur by drinking the river water has been classified using risk assessment index (RAI). The water samples were collected in post-and pre-monsoon months in year 2014-2015, from nine sampling locations between Haridwar and Garhmukteshwar. The results indicate that the water quality of River Ganga is unsuitable for drinking during sampling months, because the average NSFWQI was found to be 53.44 and 43.56, while CPI was 2.71 and 2.82 in post-and pre-monsoon, respectively. The river water has been found to be severely contaminated due to heavy metals (i. e. HPI > 3) and indicates the human health risk (i. e. RAI > 1). Therefore, it has been suggested that the river water must be treated to balance the nutrient concentration before used for drinking. Further, by a comparative analysis of indices, NSFWQI and CPI have been found as the better suitable indices to classify the status of water quality.																	1571-5124	1814-2060					2017	15	1					53	60		10.1080/15715124.2016.1205078								WOS:000396675800005

In this study, feedforward artificial neural networks are used to model the WQI in Perak River basin Malaysia due to its capability in modelling nonlinear systems. The results show that the developed single feedforward neural network model can predict WQI very well with the coefficient of determination R2 and mean squared error (MSE) of 0.9090 and 0.1740 on the unseen validation data, respectively. In addition to that, the aggregation of multiple neural networks in predicting the WQI further improves the prediction performance on the unseen validation data. Forward selection and backward elimination selective combination methods are used to combine multiple neural networks and both methods lead to 6 and 5 networks being combined with R2 and MSE of 0.9340, 0.9270 and 0.1156, 0.1256, respectively. It is clearly shown that combining multiple neural networks does improve the performance for WQI prediction.

Water quality degradation was mainly caused by high faecal coliform bacteria (FCB) and suspended solids in the North; high nitrate-nitrogen and total phosphorus in the Northeast; and high biochemical oxygen demand and FCB, and low dissolved oxygen in the Central Plains. FCB was a major parameter affecting water quality in the East, the West, and the South. High correlations among water quality and land use variables were detected. Management guidelines are provided to improve overall water quality.																	0790-0627	1360-0648					2017	33	1					132	151		10.1080/07900627.2016.1142862								WOS:000395008900009

The augmented two-reactant (2RA) model is shown to be the simplest model to accurately describe effects of rechlorination dose/timing on bulk chlorine decay, in combination with effects of initial concentration and temperature over long periods. The two-reactant (2R) and variable reaction-coefficient (VRC) models provided predictions of comparable accuracy under higher and successive rechlorination doses at constant temperature. However, the 2RA model provides a more general basis for strategy development, as the VRC model cannot describe the effect of temperature variation. The minimal data-set required for 2RA calibration was similar for all cases considered. The 2RA model is readily applied by incorporation into system modelling software such as the multi-species extension (MSX) to EPANET software.																	1573-062X	1744-9006					2017	14	4					361	368		10.1080/1573062X.2016.1148180								WOS:000394665300004

Multifactorial analysis was conducted to determine the microbial and toxic metals load in drinking water of the investigated towns. The obtained results revealed that the fecal coliform bacteria (FCB), Salmonella, Shigella and Staphylococci were the highest in MAK followed by MK and GB. The toxic metals concentrations and their intake load in the study area was in the order: Cd > Pb > Cu > Zn. However, the concentrations of toxic elements were within the permissible limits set by the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (PAK EPA). The study area had a higher load of enteric pathogens such as the Shigella sp., fecal coliform and Staphylococci in the potable water wells. The redundancy analysis (RDA) illustrated that total viable count TVB, Cu, Staphylococci and FCB were higher in MAK, fungi and Shigella sp. in GB and the Pb concentration was higher in MK. It is concluded that water in the study area is fecally contaminated and can cause health hazards. It is recommended that there should be a proper monitoring of water quality in the area to improve the existing quality and prevent further contamination of drinking water in the study area.																	1573-062X	1744-9006					2017	14	4					394	400		10.1080/1573062X.2016.1173218								WOS:000394665300008

The Impact of Shokarski Stormwater Canal on the Quality of the Bulgarian Black Sea Bathing Waters in the Area of Discharge(1)	WATER RESOURCES												The impact of Shokarski stormwater canal on the bathing waters quality of Varna Bay located in the northern Bulgarian Black Sea was investigated during 2007-2014. A total of five monitoring stations were selected: three city beaches near the area of discharge of the stormwater canal and two nearby resorts beaches. The water quality was assessed following the requirements of the old EU Bathing Water Directive (BWD) 76/160/EEC and the new BWD 2006/7/EC. The resort beaches exhibited excellent water quality through the whole period. The situation at the city beaches was worst. The "Officers Beach" situated exactly at the area of discharge of Shokarski stormwater canal exhibited concentrations of ammonium and nitrates significantly above the guide value in most of the cases,the lowest compliance with the total coliforms and faecal coliforms guide values and the highest concentrations of Escherichia coli and intestinal enterococci.

Communities around the world are motivated to sustain and restore freshwater resources and are interested in processes controlling nutrient inputs. We studied the environment where streams flow into lakes, referred to as the stream-lake interface (SLI), for a channelized and unmodified stream outlet. Channelization is done to protect infrastructure or recreational beach areas. We collected hydraulic and nutrient data for surface water and shallow groundwater in two SLIs to develop conceptual models that describe characteristics that are representative of these hydrologic features. Water, heat, and solute transport models were used to evaluate hydrologic conceptualizations and estimate mean residence times of water in the sediment. A nutrient mass balance model is developed to estimate net rates of adsorption and desorption, mineralization, and nitrification along subsurface flow paths. Results indicate that SLIs are dynamic sources of nutrients to lakes and that the common practice of channelizing the stream at the SLI decreases nutrient concentrations in pore water discharging along the lakeshore. This is in contrast to the unmodified SLI that forms a barrier beach that disconnects the stream from the lake and results in higher nutrient concentrations in pore water discharging to the lake. These results are significant because nutrient delivery through pore water seepage at the lakebed from the natural SLI contributes to nearshore algal communities and produces elevated concentrations of inorganic nutrients in the benthic zone where attached algae grow.

A coupled three-dimensional hydrodynamic model for predicting hypolimnetic oxygenation and epilimnetic mixing in a shallow eutrophic reservoir	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Artificial mixing and hypolimnetic oxygenation are two common methods for improving water quality in reservoirs. To examine the effects of their operation on the thermal structure of the water column, we used a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model coupled with a newly developed water-jet model and an existing linear bubble-plume model in conjunction with whole-reservoir in situ mixing experiments in a drinking-water reservoir. This reservoir has a side-stream supersaturation (SSS) hypolimnetic oxygenation system and a bubble-plume epilimnetic mixing (EM) system installed to reduce hypolimnetic hypoxia and algal blooms. The results show that the SSS successfully adds dissolved oxygen to the hypolimnion without destratifying the reservoir, whereas the EM, located at the lower metalimnetic boundary, deepens this boundary and partially mixes the metalimnion and epilimnion. The newly developed water-jet model coupled with the hydrodynamic model can successfully predict the variation of the thermal structure in the reservoir. The extent to which the SSS and EM systems affect the thermal structure of the reservoir is also quantified by further application of the coupled hydrodynamic model.

We developed a one-dimensional, fluid flow and solute transport model that quantifies the influence of tidal pumping on nitrate removal and applied it to the tidal freshwater zone (TFZ) of White Clay Creek (Delaware, USA). In field observations and models, both oxygenated river water and anoxic groundwater deliver nitrate to carbon-rich riverbed sediment. A zone of nitrate removal forms beneath the aerobic interval, which expands and contracts over daily timescales due to tidal pumping. At high tide when oxygen-rich river water infiltrates into the bed, denitrification rates decrease by 25% relative to low tide. In the absence of tidal pumping, our model predicts that the aerobic zone would be thinner, and denitrification rates would increase by 10%. As tidal amplitude increases toward the coast, nitrate removal rates should decrease due to enhanced oxygen exchange across the sediment-water interface, based on sensitivity analysis. Denitrification hot spots in TFZs are more likely to occur in less permeable sediment under lower tidal ranges and higher rates of ambient groundwater discharge. Our models suggest that tidal pumping is not efficient at removing surface water nitrate but can remove up to 81% of nitrate from discharging groundwater in the TFZ of White Clay Creek. Given the high population densities of coastal watersheds, the reactive riverbeds of TFZs play a critical role in mitigating new nitrogen loads to coasts.

Integrated modeling in urban hydrology: reviewing the role of monitoring technology in overcoming the issue of 'big data' requirements	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER												Increasingly, the application of models in urban hydrology has undergone a shift toward integrated structures that recognize the interconnected nature of the urban landscape and both the natural and engineered water cycles. Improvements in computational processing during the past few decades have enabled the application of multiple, connected model structures that link previously disparate systems together, incorporating feedbacks and connections. Many applications of integrated models look to assess the impacts of environmental change on physical dynamics and quality of landscapes. Whilst these integrated structures provide a more robust representation of natural dynamics, they often place considerable data requirements on the user, whereby data are required at contrasting spatial and temporal scales which can often transcend multiple disciplines. Concomitantly, our ability to observe complex, natural phenomena at contrasting scales has improved considerably with the advent of increasingly novel monitoring technologies. This has provided a pathway for reducing model uncertainty and improving our confidence in modeled outputs by implementing suitable monitoring regimes. This commentary assesses how component models of an exemplar integrated model have advanced over the past few decades, with a critical focus on the role of monitoring technologies that have enabled better identification of the key physical process. This reduces the uncertainty of processes at contrasting spatial and temporal scales, through a better characterization of feedbacks which then enhances the utility of integrated model applications.

Coagulation efficiency of Dicerocaryum eriocarpum (DE) plant	WATER SA												A study was conducted to investigate coagulation efficiency of the plant Dicerocaryum eriocarpum (DE) in the removal of turbidity from raw water. Widespread poor land use practices contribute to high turbidity in river water, making turbidity management or removal critical, particularly before the water is used for drinking or subjected to chemical treatment. In this study, mucilage from DE was extracted with deionized water and different chloride solutions. A coagulation efficiency of 99% using modified mucilage coagulant was achieved. The modified mucilage of potassium crude extract and sodium crude extract displayed higher coagulation efficiencies than unmodified mucilage of deionized water crude extract. An increase in coagulant dosage and initial turbidity influenced the coagulation efficiency of DE coagulant. A large reduction in turbidity levels of the treated water samples resulted in an improvement in water quality.

Impact of temporary desiccation on the mobility of nutrients and metals from sediments of Loskop Reservoir, Olifants River	WATER SA												South Africa is prone to droughts and is heavily dependent on stored water resources. Few studies in South Africa have investigated the impact of drought on water quality when rainfall resumes and reservoir sediments are rewet. Other research has shown that several negative impacts may occur with rewetting, including eutrophication, and acidification with increased metal solubility. In this study, the impact of drying and rewetting sediments on the mobility of nutrients and metals is explored using sediments from Loskop Reservoir. Rarely exposed sediments were collected from three sites, dried at 35 degrees C for 36 days, and then rewet under aerobic conditions. Filtered water samples were collected on Days 1, 2,4, 7, 11 and 16 following rewetting, and analysed for NH4+, NO3-, NO2-, total N, total P, PO43-, dissolved Al, Fe, Mn, and SO42-. Results were expressed as mass/m(2), and were compared to reference (non-drought) treatments that were maintained under saturated conditions. Acute toxicity tests were performed using Daphnia magna to establish if toxic effects were associated with changes in water quality following sediment rewetting. Following rewetting, elevated SO42-indicated the mobilisation of acid from sulfide oxidation, with an associated reduction in pH. Nitrification was evident as high quantities of organic N and NH4+ were initially released, followed by increases in NO2-+ NO3-. Total P increased, but PO43-reduced. This was attributed to complexes formed between PO43-and Fe (FePO4) and Al (AlPO4). Amounts of Fe and Al released were lower following rewetting due to the formation of relatively immobile (hydr) oxides. In contrast, Mn increased substantially reaching maximum values > 2 300 mg/m(2) (14 000 mu g/L). There were no acute toxic effects observed to D. magna. This study highlights the potential for acidification, mobilisation of nutrients, SO42-, and Mn following rewetting of reservoir sediments under aerobic conditions. This information may be incorporated into reservoir and catchment management plans in the form of revised water quality guidelines and a better ability to predict how drought impacts water quality in our stored water resources.																	0378-4738	1816-7950				JAN	2017	43	1					7	16		10.4314/wsa.v43i1.02								WOS:000396502100002

Circulation induced by diffused aeration in a shallow lake	WATER SA												Field surveys were carried out to investigate the surface jet flows and the resulting circulation patterns generated by diffused aeration in a shallow lake. In conrast to previous studies, the experimental conditions included point-source bubble plumes with very high air flow rates (100-400 L/min) relative to the shallow water depth (1.5 m). The results indicate that the surface jet velocity can be described by linear profiles. The decay of this velocity with distance displayed a similar behaviour to that reported in the literature, but the surface jet spread much faster under the present conditions. Combining our results with published data allowed for the generation of dimensionless correlations for the velocity and depth of the surface jet. A good agreement between the total circulation flow rates predicted by using the proposed correlations and integral modelling was also obtained. Lastly, a simple returning flow model was proposed to describe the circulation flow patterns induced by the bubble plumes. The results were also applied to assess the impact of circulation on vertical algae migration, which is important for water quality management.

Effects of land use change on streamflow and stream water quality of a coastal catchment	WATER SA												This study aimed to link land cover/use change to water quality in an important water supply coastal catchment. The approach followed a spatial and temporal analysis of historical catchment land use change to assess how changes influenced water quality and river flow in the Touws and Duiwe Rivers, southwestern Cape, South Africa. Each sub-catchment has unique characteristics which influence land use and water quality and the purpose was to analyse each one separately. Historical water quality and flow analysis were based on the records available (Duiwe River: 1998-2013; Touws River: 1980-2013) together with rainfall data. Records were analysed to detect trends over time, which were linked to changes in land use activities. Agriculture intensified rapidly in the Duiwe River catchment with most arable land cultivated by 1960 and water storage as farm dams escalating. Concentrations of nutrients and electrical conductivity were higher in the Duiwe River than in the more natural Touws River, and were positively correlated to river flows. Mean values for total nitrogen and electrical conductivity were 0.03 mg/L and 16.7 mg/L, respectively, in the Touws River and 0.25 mg/L and 127 mg/L, respectively, in the Duiwe River. Nutrient concentrations decreased in the Duiwe River after 2006 as fertilizer applications to pastures were reduced. The South African Target Water Quality Ranges were exceeded at times and in the Touws catchment this appears to have been due to extensive fires. For instance, sodium concentrations reached a maximum of 1 874.5 mg/L in 1996 compared to a usual average concentration of 20.8 mg/L where the guidelines are between 0 and100 mg/L. The link between land cover/use and water quality was demonstrated and when spatial heterogeneity of the catchments was altered by human or natural events, this was reflected in changes in the water quality.																	0378-4738	1816-7950				JAN	2017	43	1					139	152		10.4314/wsa.v43i1.16								WOS:000396502100016

This two and half-year study covering several wet and dry seasons evaluated the impacts of small headwater dams without a base flow on downstream herbaceous dynamics. Results showed herb aerial cover and diversity below dams (new stream sources) are unique and different to original stream sources as well as to a comparable unregulated reach. The geomorphological habitats formed subsequent to damming did not show major influence on aerial cover of herbs; nevertheless, diversity showed a clear dependence. Downstream of dams were dominated by Acorus gramineus, which had >40% aerial cover, and this figure increased up to 60% within 2years (in between a major flood event). Simultaneously, downstream herb diversity decreased by 33%. However, diversity and aerial cover of the unregulated reach and original sources remained more or less the same. Herb pulling tests (simulating an uprooting mechanism during a flood) showed A.gramineus can withstand an eightfold higher force than the other herbs, especially in concrete surfaces and rock/sand pools. The estimated shear force on bed during the major flood was several folds less than the observed. This suggests downstream of dams behave opposite to the conventional understanding that large floods are considered as an agent of restoration.																	1936-0584	1936-0592				JAN	2017	10	1							e1774	10.1002/eco.1774								WOS:000393870100014

Macroinvertebrate responses to flow and stream temperature variability across regulated and non-regulated rivers	ECOHYDROLOGY												Flow regulation via impoundments threatens lotic ecosystems and the services they provide globally. Impoundments drastically alter flow and stream temperature variability within fluvial environments, but efforts to quantify ecohydrological and ecothermal responses to flow regulation in conjunction have been sparsely explored to date. This study examined macroinvertebrate community responses to antecedent flow (discharge) and stream temperature variability across paired regulated and non-regulated systems associated with three reservoirs located in adjacent catchments. Community abundances, functional traits, and biomonitoring indices were examined, and ecological differences between non-regulated and regulated sites were quantified, with the most sensitive faunal response being correlated against a suite of flow and thermal indices. Regulated sites exhibited reduced low-flow variability and rapid increases in discharge during peak flows that regularly exceeded those conveyed by non-regulated sites, while stream temperature variability was highly congruent between sites. Macroinvertebrate functional traits were particularly sensitive to flow regulation, and incorporating biomonitoring indices marginally improved the ecological discrimination between regulated and non-regulated sites. Unlike community abundances, functional traits did not vary spatially between catchments, highlighting that such information could guide the implementation of regional environmental flows. Macroinvertebrate communities responded significantly to various hydrological parameters, particularly those associated with the timing of extreme flows, but were less sensitive to thermal controls. Future research should explore ecological responses to antecedent hydrological and stream temperature variability associated with flow regulation to provide a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving biotic alterations, which could guide future environmental flow methodologies.

The common objective considered in WDSs design is providing required water with the minimum construction cost. Less attention is paid to "water quality" as an objective in optimal design of WDSs. The aim of this paper is to include a water quality based objective in WDS design alongside other common objectives. For this purpose, the water quality reliability index developed based on "chlorine residual" and "water age", is used. EPANET2.0 is applied for WDS simulation and ACO (Ant-Colony-Optimization) has been used as the optimization algorithm. Head-Driven-Simulation-Method (HDSM) is also considered. The proposed model is applied to Jahrom (a city in the south of Iran) WDS. The outputs show that the proposed model would result in less construction costs in comparison to the original design and 4-10 % of construction cost can be reduced depending on the considered objectives and selected optimal solution by managers and decision makers while the resulted solutions include high water quality reliability (ranging from 93 to 99 %). Also using HDSM method for hydraulic analysis of WDS instead of DDSM can lead to solutions with less construction cost (U$10,000 in average) and acceptable water quality reliability.

Information on spatial variation and level of anomalous concentration is crucial also for management of the available water resources. In the present study an attempt is made using geographic information systems (GIS) to identify and demarcate zones and levels of pollution. Groundwater quality zoning is carried out based on spatial analysis of groundwater quality data acquired from 51 wells of three administrative blocks of Udaipur district, Rajasthan (India). Concentrations of various natural chemical constituents of groundwater in the study area have been compared with the guidelines of the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) and the World Health Organisation (WHO) for drinking water and irrigation water. The study has revealed that groundwater in many parts of the region is unsuitable either for drinking or for irrigation. Extreme high concentrations of hardness, fluoride, nitrate and calcium are observed in different parts of all the three administrative blocks. Mineralogy of the vadose zone and aquifer formations appear to be the chief controller of the groundwater quality. However, land-use/land-cover and agricultural practices such as use of fertilisers and pesticides may also have significant influence on the groundwater quality.

Presently, the reconnaissance drought index (RDI), which is considered as a powerful index of meteorological drought, is acquisitioning approval primarily in semi-arid and arid climatologic areas. Because RDI is based on precipitation (P) and evapotranspiration (ET), it assesses the ET estimation effects on the characterisation of drought severity computed by RDI. The current study sheds light on the impact of the ET methods, and the elevation and climate conditions on the RDI annual results, (particularly, the alpha form of the index (RDI alpha 12)), using three of the most widespread experimental ET estimates with low data requirements. These techniques are known as Thornthwaite, Hargreaves, and Blaney-Criddle, and are utilised in addition to the Food and Agriculture Organization Penman-Monteith reference technique. Data from 24 stations for the period from 1979 to 2014 cover different elevations and climatic conditions. No significant (P > 0.05) impacts on both the standardised (RDIst) and normalised (RDIn) forms of the RDI were detected by applying the considered ET methods at various elevations for various climatic conditions. However, the RDI alpha 12 is directly influenced with a significant (P < 0.05) deviation that has been observed by various ET methods at different elevations and climate conditions. Accordingly, consideration should be paid to the ET estimation methodologies, in particular at high elevations. The use of various approaches may lead to flaws in availability of water resources and water quality forecasts.																	0920-4741	1573-1650				JAN	2017	31	1					531	548		10.1007/s11269-016-1546-9								WOS:000393777100033						
J	Flores, M; Nunez, J; Oyarzun, J; Freixas, G; Maturana, H; Oyarzun, R				Flores, Mauricio; Nunez, Jorge; Oyarzun, Jorge; Freixas, Gustavo; Maturana, Hugo; Oyarzun, Ricardo			Surface water quality in a sulfide mineral-rich arid zone in North-Central Chile: Learning from a complex past, addressing an uncertain future	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												This study presents an analysis of up to 30years of hydrological variables and selected water quality parameters (pH, SO4, Fe, Cu, and As) in the upper area of the Elqui River basin in North-Central Chile. A correlation analysis determined statistically significant positive relationship for SO4-Cu, Fe-As, and Fe-Cu. In terms of historical behaviour, no statistically significant trends were detected for precipitation or temperature. In contrast, for flow, there is an overall decreasing pattern for the entire area of study, although only in one case this trend was statistically significant. Along with the aforementioned analysis, a characterization of the flow-water quality relationships is considered for the time period analyzed. Although erratic behaviours were confirmed, a negative (i.e., inverse) flow-concentration relationship was identified for SO4, a positive (i.e., direct) relationship for Fe, and undefined relationships for As and Cu were obtained. From these analyses and based on previous studies on projections regarding climate change for the Andean region, and in particular for the upper Elqui zone, an estimation of the possible effects of the change in water regimes on water quality in the area of study is developed. It is likely that a decrease in surface flow, as a consequence of climate change could translate into improvements in water quality in terms of Fe and eventually As and Cu, but into an impairment in the case of SO4. In any case, this is a complex situation that demands special attention in the face of industrial activities that could be developed in tributaries like the Claro River, which currently play an important role in depurating or diluting contaminants in the waters of the Elqui River. Finally, it should be noted that this study addresses an issue that goes beyond the local interest and could be used as a reference to compare other transitional environments containing sulphide ores or areas of hydrothermal alterations, which are considered to be highly vulnerable to climate change and variability.																	0885-6087	1099-1085				JAN	2017	31	3					498	513		10.1002/hyp.11086								WOS:000393558900001

Continuous field estimation of dissolved organic carbon concentration and biochemical oxygen demand using dual-wavelength fluorescence, turbidity and temperature	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality and quantity is not measured routinely in-situ limiting our ability to quantify DOM process dynamics. This is problematic given legislative obligations to determine event based variability; however, recent advances in field deployable optical sensing technology provide the opportunity to address this problem. In this paper, we outline a new approach for in-situ quantification of DOM quantity (Dissolved Organic Carbon: DOC) and a component of quality (Biochemical Oxygen Demand: BOD) using a multi-wavelength, through-flow fluorescence sensor. The sensor measured tryptophan-like (Peak T) and humic-like (Peak C) fluorescence, alongside water temperature and turbidity. Laboratory derived coefficients were developed to compensate for thermal quenching and turbidity interference (i.e., light attenuation and scattering). Field tests were undertaken on an urban river with ageing wastewater and stormwater infrastructure (Bourn Brook; Birmingham, UK). Sensor output was validated against laboratory determinations of DOC and BOD collected by discrete grab sampling during baseflow and stormflow conditions. Data driven regression models were then compared to laboratory correction methods. A combination of temperature and turbidity compensated Peak T and Peak C was found to be a good predictor of DOC concentration (R-2=0.92). Conversely, using temperature and turbidity correction coefficients provided low predictive power for BOD (R-2=0.46 and R-2=0.51, for Peak C and T, respectively). For this study system, turbidity appeared to be a reasonable proxy for BOD, R-2=0.86. However, a linear mixed effect model with temperature compensated Peak T and turbidity provided a robust BOD prediction (R-2=0.95). These findings indicate that with careful initial calibration, multi-wavelength fluorescence, coupled with turbidity, and temperature provides a feasible proxy for continuous, in-situ measurement of DOC concentration and BOD. This approach represents a cost effective monitoring solution, particularly when compared to UV - absorbance sensors and DOC analysers, and could be readily adopted for research and industrial applications.

The cost of irrigation sources and water treatment in greenhouse production	IRRIGATION SCIENCE												Uncertainty about the cost of water treatment is a potential barrier to adoption of irrigation treatment and recycling. The objective of this study was to estimate the cost of irrigation-water filtration and sanitation based on a survey of 11 greenhouse operations. Screen filtration of ebb-and-flood irrigation water cost ($0.02-$0.17 per 1000 gal) less than filtration using synthetic fiber rolls ($0.08-$2.97 per 1000 gal). Technologies to control pathogens and biofilm ranged between $0.07 per 1000 gal for chlorine gas to $1.00 per 1000 gal for a copper ionization system. Irrigation water sources ranged in cost from $0.02 per 1000 gal for pond water to $6.43 per 1000 gal for municipal water. Sanitation increased this cost by $0.07-$1.00, and water-soluble fertilizers added $3.80. Case studies of three growers illustrated that water quality issues such as equipment clogging or plant pathogens can increase production cost, and in many cases, water treatment and recirculation provide economic savings. Our analysis emphasizes that the cost and quality of the initial water source, the cost of production losses from quality issues, and the cost of treatment should all be considered to make informed decisions on irrigation water sources and system design.																	0342-7188	1432-1319				JAN	2017	35	1					43	54		10.1007/s00271-016-0517-5								WOS:000393636900004

An analytic formulation is presented, showing that the minimum required trench length for flood control can be determined directly from parameters that characterize the design rainfall, catchment, trench, and porous medium surrounding the trench. It is also shown that the minimum required trench length for water-quality control can be determined directly from the design water-quality depth, exfiltration time that is credited to water-quality control, and parameters that characterize the trench and catchment. Using these analytic relationships, a six-step procedure is presented for sizing trenches that simultaneously meet both flood-control and waterquality control objectives. Implementation of the design methodology is illustrated for both conventional and partially saturated trenches.

Multiobjective, Socioeconomic, Boundary-Emanating, Nearest Distance Algorithm for Stormwater Low-Impact BMP Selection and Placement	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT												Stormwater low-impact development (LID) has become an important method for the reduction of stormwater runoff emanating from impervious surfaces to local water bodies. The extra runoff from human-made impervious surfaces overloads water bodies with polluted runoff. Since many LID best management practices (BMPs) exist, and many areas have multiple subcatchments, it is important to carefully select which BMPs to place in each subcatchment and its placement in order to minimize cost, but also to give the highest chance of owner BMP maintenance. LID BMPs are often constructed on private land and maintenance can be at the owner's expense and, therefore, not guaranteed. A new algorithm, entitled multi-objective, socio-economic, boundary-emanating, nearest distance (MOSEBEND), that is easily used by practitioners is introduced and demonstrated here for a road in a community showing that the algorithm allows the selection of the set of BMPs on the various subcatchments with the lowest cost, highest runoff restoration to natural values, and highest likelihood of private-owner maintenance. The BMP selection and location starts at the downstream watershed boundary and propagates upstream, and then works in the upstream-to-downstream direction from the upstream watershed boundary. The multiple objectives addressed are cost-benefit ratio (CBR) and maintenance probability factor (MPF). The optimal solution is considered to be the one closest to the origin on a plot of CBR and MPF. It was found that the new algorithm resulted in a solution that is (1) low cost, (2) high benefit, and (3) more likely to be built and maintained than an analysis of any subset of these three objectives. The option with the highest cost-benefit-ratio is that in which LID BMPs are implemented in the upper and steeper portion of the catchment, for the watershed that the algorithm is demonstrated herein. However, that option has a less likely chance to be maintained and, therefore, is not ranked first by the MOSEBEND algorithm proposed here.

The variations in branch and loop combinatorics across large pipe network data sets are ideal for exploring graph-based structural patterns and linkages with engineered performance. To facilitate this exploration, a library of 10,001 lattice-like pipe networks is developed. Each network is equipped with hydraulic, water quality, and diurnal demand information for extended period simulations. Results show strong correlations exist among graph theory metrics (e.g., geodesic, spectral, and combinatorics-based) and performance measures (e.g., maximum hourly unit headloss, average water age, and average chemical concentration). These trends are extended with performance predictions using parametric and semiparametric statistical models. Predictive accuracies are evident for processes that follow diffusion-like behaviors, indicating coupled applications of graph theory and statistical methods may have strong abilities to characterize WDSs at lower computational and analytical costs. Evidence also reveals features from percolation theory, with sharp phase transitions in WDS performance at certain probabilistic thresholds of pipe network connectivity. This may support future probabilistic studies on WDS performance with percolation-like transitions.

The Impacts of Natural Flood Management Approaches on In-Channel Sediment Quality	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Natural Flood Management (NFM) techniques aim to reduce downstream flooding by storing and slowing the flow of stormwater to river channels. These techniques include a range of measures, including setback stormwater outfalls and the physical restoration of channels and floodplains, to improve the natural functioning of catchments. An additional benefit of NFM measures is the potential reduction in sediment and pollutant delivery to the channel. Urban development releases a variety of heavy metal and nutrient pollutants that enter rivers through stormwater outfalls with adverse effects on the aquatic ecosystem. In this study, the influence of channel modification and quality of the river habitat on the sediment quality surrounding stormwater outfalls was assessed. Sediment samples were taken at several outfalls within the Johnson Creek catchment, Oregon, USA, and analysed for a variety of urban pollutants. The level of river habitat quality and modification at each site were assessed using a semi-quantitative scoring methodology. Significant increases in pollutant levels were observed at outfalls, with a greater and more variable increase at direct compared to setback outfalls. Removal efficiency of certain pollutants was found to be significantly correlated to the level of habitat quality or modification (for Fe, Ba, Sn, Mg, P, K) indicating that more natural reaches had greater potential for pollutant removal. The findings highlight the multiple benefits associated with NFM and river restoration approaches in relation to sediment quality and pollutant content.

Water Quality Changes Shortly After Low-Head Dam Removal Examined With Cultural and Microbial Source Tracking Methods	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Short-term effects of low head dam removal on water quality of urbanized stream were evaluated, focusing on fecal pollution indicators. Composite river samples were analyzed for Escherichia coli concentrations, nitrates, phosphates, turbidity and human-specific marker (HF183) and antibiotic resistance marker (tetQ) before and after dam removal during dry weather conditions. The sampled Olentangy River water in summer before the dam removal showed poor water quality with mean E. coli concentration of 439 colony forming unit (CFU)/100mL, mean turbidity of 10 NTU and mean nutrient concentrations of 0.61 and 0.41mg/L for nitrate and phosphate, respectively. Surprisingly, even one month after the dam removal, E. coli numbers doubled and nitrate concentration tripled compared to pre-removal concentrations. Although the detected HF183 concentrations were below the quantifiable levels, they did not correlate with E. coli concentrations, suggesting E. coli from other than human fecal origin. The correlation between turbidity and E. coli during dry weather further suggests E. coli accumulation in impoundment sediments and release once dam was removed. These short-term effects of dam removal on water quality should be further evaluated, especially if recreation and other beneficial uses of water in the area are expected.

Effect of Thermal Stratification on Phytoplankton and Nutrient Dynamics in a Regulated River (Saar, Germany)	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												The weir pool Serrig is the deepest one along the impounded river Saar. Damming caused massive changes in the river's hydrodynamics. We analyzed the spatio-temporal variability of thermal density stratification in the weir pool and its effect on phytoplankton and nutrient dynamics. In the analysis, continuous measurements from the years 2014 and 2015 were combined with three two-day sampling campaigns in spring 2015. Thermal stratification occurred regularly in the downstream section of the weir pool during spring and summer and showed a diurnal rhythm. Temperature differences >1K between the 1 and 2m water layer were observed during 34 out of 217days (16%) in 2014, with maximum temperature gradients up to 3.71K. Whereas the influence of thermal stratification on phytoplankton biomass and distribution was low during the algal bloom in early spring, stratification events between May and July promoted temporary algal blooms in the surface layer with chlorophyll a concentrations up to 98 mu g Chla l(-1) and a maximum difference between the 1 and 2m water layer of 36 mu g Chla l(-1). Some of the stratification events resulted in reduced concentrations of dissolved nutrients in the surface layer as a result of increased uptake by algae, with maximum gradients between the surface and the 8m water layer of 0.070mg ortho-PO43--P l(-1), 0.136mg NH4+-N l(-1) and 0.24mg NO3--Nl(-1). These vertical gradients should be considered in sampling protocols for the assessment of the water quality of temporarily stratified river sections.

Data analytics methodology for monitoring quality sensors and events in the Barcelona drinking water network	JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS												Water quality management is a key area to guarantee drinking water safety to users. This task is based on disinfection techniques, such as chlorination, applied to the drinking water network to prevent the growth of microorganisms present in the water. The continuous monitoring of water quality parameters is fundamental to assess the sanitary conditions of the drinking water and to detect unexpected events. The whole process is based on the assumption that the information retrieved from quality sensors is totally reliable, but due to the complexity of the calibration and maintenance of these chemical sensors, several factors affect the accuracy of the raw data collected. Consequently, any decision might be based on a non-solid base. Therefore, this work presents a data analytics monitoring methodology based on temporal and spatial models to discover if a sensor is detecting a real change in water quality parameters or is actually providing inconsistent information due to some malfunction. The methodology presented anticipated by 12.4 days, on average, the detection of a sensor problem before the fault was reported by the water utilities expert using knowledge accumulated with visual analysis. The proposed methodology has been satisfactorily tested on the Barcelona drinking water network.

Nitrogen Dynamics in Two Created Riparian Wetlands over Space and Time	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING												Temporal and spatial variations of nitrogen (N) soil storages and fluxes were examined at two 1-ha created riverine wetlands in the U.S. Midwest. Soil N content (total N, organic-N, NO3-N, and NH4-N), N accumulation rates, and soil C:N ratios were compared between the two wetlands constructed 15 years earlier (one was planted and the other left to naturally colonize). Differences in wetland soil N content and accumulation were also examined in relation to proximity of river input and relative to a range of topographic features related to wetland water depth. The planted and naturally colonized wetlands showed similar rates of N accumulation. However, differences were detected related to the content of mineralized forms of N (NO3-N and NH4-N) that may relate to the history of vegetation communities at these wetlands. Significant spatial variation of N accumulation was detected within the wetlands, with the highest rates found in the deeper open water communities compared to shallow emergent marsh/edge vegetation communities (23.5 +/- 2.0 versus 17.3 +/- 1.3/18.2 +/- 1.4 g N m(-2) y(-1)). Nitrogen budgets comparing two ages of the wetlands illustrate higher N accumulation rates (by 19%), higher N reduction in the surface water (47 to 52% reduction), and increased denitrification rates (by 13%) from year 10 to year 15. We also found out that nitrogen accumulation in the soil was 7.1 to 7.5% higher than were denitrification rates in these young wetlands. We discuss the importance of efforts such as this to support better understanding of N pathways in both created and natural wetlands, while providing critical data needed to improve modelling efforts and assess the long-term effectiveness of wetlands for improving water quality.

Low rainfall across the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) of Australia resulted in an unprecedented water level decline in the Lower Lakes (Lakes Alexandrina and Albert) at the downstream end of the river system. A comprehensive data covering pre-drought (2004-2006), drought (2007-2010) and post-drought (2010-2013) was firstly used to unravel drought effects on water quality in the contrasting main parts and margins of the two Lakes, particularly following water acidification resulting from acid sulfate soil oxidation. Salinity, nutrients and Chl-a significantly increased during the drought in the Lake main waterbody, while pH remained stable or showed minor shifts. In contrast to the Lake Alexandrina, total dissolved solid (TDS) and electrical conductivity (EC) during the post-drought more than doubled the pre-drought period in the Lake Albert as being a terminal lake system with narrow and shallow entrance. Rewetting of the exposed pyrite containing sediment resulted in very low pH (below 3) in Lake margins, which positively contributed to salinity increases via SO42- release and limestone dissolution. Very acidic water (pH 2-3) was neutralised naturally by lake refill, but aerial limestone dosing was required for neutralisation of water acidity during the drought period. The Lower Lakes are characterized as hypereutrophic with much higher salinity, nutrient and algae concentrations than guideline levels for aquatic ecosystem. These results suggest that, in the Lower Lakes, drought could cause water quality deterioration through water acidification and increased nutrient and Chl-a concentrations, more effective water management in the lake catchment is thus crucial to prevent the similar water quality deterioration since the projected intensification of droughts. A comparative assessment on lake resilience and recovering processes should be undertaken with a post-drought monitoring program. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, there is only limited information, and even fewer physical measurements, assessing the rate of sediment accumulation in reservoirs behind dams. Many of the dams within the Great Lakes Watershed were constructed between 100 and 120 years ago, and there is reasonable concern that these dams and their associated reservoirs may be reaching capacity with respect to sediment storage. As a reservoir reaches its sediment storage capacity, there are numerous risks. Excess sediment can compromise the water intake for supply systems. Dam failure or removal can potentially allow large quantities of impounded sediment to migrate downstream, negatively impacting fish habitat and water quality. This research investigates the historical function of dams as sediment storage points. Also, this research assesses the effect of anthropogenic influences including land use change and dam construction on sediment yield and accumulation within the Lake Rockwell and Ballville Dam watershed. To better understand the historical and current sediment yield within the Lake Erie watershed, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) models of the Lake Rockwell and Ballville Dam watersheds were developed. The resulting model suggests that the average of sediment accumulation rate within Lake Rockwell Dam reservoir varies between the minimum of 1.6 and the maximum of 4.6 g/cm(2)/yr from 1988 to 2007. Within the Ballville Dam reservoir, the rate varies between the minimum of 2.6 and the maximum of 23.2 g/cm(2)/yr from 1980 to 1999. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, calibration of the agricultural-hydrological system models is challenging because of model complexity, the existence of strong parameter correlation, and significant computational requirements. Therefore, only a limited number of simulations can be allowed in any attempt to find a near-optimal solution within an affordable time, which greatly restricts the successful application of the model. The goal of this study is to locate the optimal solution of the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM2) given a limited simulation time, so as to improve the model simulation and help make rational and effective agricultural-hydrological decisions. To this end, we propose a computationally efficient global optimization procedure using sparse-grid based surrogates. We first used advanced sparse grid (SG) interpolation to construct a surrogate system of the actual RZWQM2, and then we calibrate the surrogate model using the global optimization algorithm, Quantum-behaved Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO). As the surrogate model is a polynomial with fast evaluation, it can be efficiently evaluated with a sufficiently large number of times during the optimization, which facilitates the global search. We calibrate seven model parameters against five years of yield, drain flow, and NO3-N loss data from a subsurface-drained corn-soybean field in Iowa. Results indicate that an accurate surrogate model can be created for the RZWQM2 with a relatively small number of SG points (i.e., RZWQM2 runs). Compared to the conventional QPSO algorithm, our surrogate based optimization method can achieve a smaller objective function value and better calibration performance using a fewer number of expensive RZWQM2 executions, which greatly improves computational efficiency.

J	Gagnon, P; Chretien, F; Theriault, G				Gagnon, Patrick; Chretien, Francois; Theriault, Georges			Land leveling impact on surface runoff and soil losses: Estimation with coupled deterministic/stochastic models for a Quebec agricultural field	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Land leveling impact on water quality had not received much attention for fields in humid continental climate. The objectives of this study were to isolate the impact of land leveling, performed on an agricultural field (Quebec, Canada) in spring 2012, on runoff and TSS load and to make recommendations to attenuate adverse environmental impacts of land leveling, if any. A total of 66 runoff events, including 22 with total suspended sediments (TSS) load estimates, from 2010 to 2014 were analyzed. To this end, deterministic models were coupled to an adaptive Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to estimate the unknown distribution of the parameters representing the most important effects, namely land leveling, tillage, and crop cover. Simulated runoff events were generated by the hydrological model SWMM version 5 while simulated TSS loads were generated by an empirical equation based on the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation version 2 (RUSLE2). Thanks to the algorithm used, it was demonstrated that land leveling significantly decreased total runoff volume at least for the two following years. The impact on peak flow was mixed: land leveling significantly decreased peak flow for a typical stratiform rainfall event but the effect was unclear for a typical convective rainfall event. Based on 90% confidence interval, TSS load increased from 10 to 1000 times immediately after land leveling"(spring 2012) compared to pre-land leveling events. The TSS load increase remained significant one year after land leveling, with TSS loads 5-20 times higher compared to pre-land leveling events. It would thus be recommended to grow crops with high ground coverage ratios coupled with cover crops during the year when land leveling is done. Sediment retention structures could also be installed at the beginning of the land leveling process to provide protection against the short term and delayed impact on water quality.

Monitoring the seasonal dynamics of physicochemical parameters from Atoyac River basin (Puebla), Central Mexico: multivariate approach	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Spatiotemporal variations of ten physicochemical parameters in the water quality of Atoyac River basin, Central Mexico, were obtained from 22 sampling sites (66 samples in total) located all along the basin for three different seasons (dry, rainy and winter). Multivariate statistical techniques such as correlation matrix, factor analysis (FA) and cluster analysis (CA) were used as a tool to understand the process. Physicochemical parameters such as temperature (T), pH, conductivity (lambda), dissolved oxygen (DO), spectral absorption coefficient (SAC), oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), turbidity, 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total suspended solids (TSS) were analyzed. Extremely high values of pH (10.24), conductivity (1870 mu S/cm) and reduced redox potential (-370.1 mV) were observed in the dry season, whereas elevated TSS of 2996 mg/L was detected during the rainy season. The results elucidated high influence from the adjoining industrial, agricultural and urban zones, making the river unsuitable for life. FA generated varifactors, which accounted for cumulative % of 75.04 (dry), 76.22 (rainy) and 79.96 (winter) clearly grouping the external factors responsible for these significant values indicating the source of contamination. Cluster analysis facilitated the ease of classifying the sampling sites based on the similarities of physicochemical parameters. This study carried out in different seasons using multivariate statistical techniques would definitely prove to be an efficient tool for the restoration and establishing the real-time monitoring stations along this important river basin of Mexico.

J	Baba, A; Gunduz, O				Baba, Alper; Gunduz, Orhan			Effect of Geogenic Factors on Water Quality and Its Relation to Human Health around Mount Ida, Turkey	Water												Water-rock interactions strongly influence water quality. Waters originating from highly altered zones affect human health. Mount Ida region in western Anatolia is an example for such geogenic interactions and additional anthropogenic impacts. A water quality monitoring study was held and a total of 189 samples were collected from 63 monitoring stations to characterize the quality of water resources and its relation with human health. The results indicated that waters originating from altered volcanic rocks that are mainly used for drinking purposes have low pH, high conductivity and elevated trace element levels. In addition, a number of acidic mining lakes were formed in the open pits of abandoned mine sites in the study area and pyrite oxidation in altered volcanic rocks resulted in extremely acidic, high mineral content and toxic waters that demonstrate an eminent threat for the environmental health in the area. Overall, the water quality constituents in Mount Ida region had a spatially variable pattern and were locally found to exceed the national and international standards, mainly due to geogenic alteration zones and anthropogenic intervention.

Without an aerator, the dissolved oxygen in ponds comes primarily from mass transfer at the water-ambient atmosphere interface. As sediment can seriously affect water quality, this study used indoor experiments to examine the nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) release mechanisms and fluxes from sediment in aquaculture ponds with moving water but no aeration. The results showed that the ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) concentration in the overlying water was inversely proportional to flow velocity and that a higher flow velocity tended to result in a lower concentration in the overlying water, a steeper vertical gradient of concentration within the bed sediments, and a faster release rate from the sediments. The sediment disturbed by flowing water released more nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) and nitrite nitrogen (NO2-N) into the overlying water and NO2-N could become oxidized into NO3-N. In still water, NO3-N was released gradually and some anaerobic NO3-N was nitrified into NO2-N. Phosphorus release from the sediments was controlled by the adsorption-desorption balance, with the phosphorus concentration in the overlying water dropping gradually to a steady value from its initial maximum. The relationship between NH3-N release flux and flow rate is described by a cubic function.

J	Ge, M; Wu, FP; You, M				Ge, Min; Wu, Feng-Ping; You, Min			Initial Provincial Water Rights Dynamic Projection Pursuit Allocation Based on the Most Stringent Water Resources Management: A Case Study of Taihu Basin, China	Water												Clarification of initial water rights is the basis and prerequisite for a water rights trade-off market and also an effective solution to the problem of water scarcity and water conflicts. According to the new requirements for the most stringent water resources management in China, an initial provincial water rights allocation model is proposed. Firstly, based on analysis of multiple principles for initial provincial water rights allocation including total water use, water use efficiency, water quality of water function zones, regional coordination and sharing, an index system of initial provincial water rights allocation is designed. Secondly, according to dynamic projection pursuit technique, an initial provincial water rights allocation model with the total water use control is set up. Moreover, the self-adaptive chaotic optimization algorithm is applied to tackle the model. Finally, a case study of Taihu Basin is adopted. Considering the multiple scenarios of three different water frequencies (50%, 75% and 90%) and planning year 2030, the empirical results show Jiangsu Province always obtains the most initial water rights. When the developing situation of provinces are given more consideration, Shanghai should acquire more initial water rights than Zhejiang Province; but when the dynamic increment evolving trend of provinces is taken more into account, Shanghai should obtain less initial water rights than Zhejiang Province. The case about Taihu Lake further verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model and provides a multiple-scenarios decision making support for entitling the initial water rights with the most stringent water resources management constrains in Taihu Basin.

J	Jetoo, S				Jetoo, Savitri			The Role of Transnational Municipal Networks in Transboundary Water Governance	Water												The transboundary nature of stressors impacting shared water bodies has been traditionally recognized in agreements between nation states. Several developments have led to new layers of cross border environmental actors, including regional and city level interactions. This proliferation of non-state actors is witnessed in two large water bodies, the Baltic Sea and the North American Great Lakes. In both regions, transboundary water governance was led by nation states in agreements to improve heavily contaminated waters, the Helsinki Convention (1974) and the North American Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement (1972), respectively. Whilst there has been much research on transnational regional networks, especially in Europe, there has been less theoretical work done on transnational municipal transboundary water networks due to the delay of recognition of the legitimacy of these local government actors. This paper aims to examine the role of the transnational municipal networks in transboundary water governance by looking at the case studies of the Union of Baltic cities in the Baltic Sea region and the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Cities Initiative in the North American Great Lakes Basin. It does this by assessing the role of these transnational municipal networks in bridging water governance gaps in these regions.																	2073-4441					JAN	2017	9	1							40	10.3390/w9010040								WOS:000392939900040

An experiment was performed in an outdoor large-scale mesocosm three times from 2011 to 2012 by comparing the responses to adjustment as a function of the volume of JFS in the control and experimental groups. Analysis results of the environmental monitoring over three periods indicated only minor differences in the physicochemical characteristics of the water quality and phyto-and zoo-plankton biomass, thereby enabling a comparative analysis of the feeding ecology. However, the water temperature exhibited large fluctuations, ranging from 16.4 to 27.6 degrees C, and high water temperature conditions (Period 1, 25.6 +/- 2.0 degrees C) enhanced the predation activity of the piscivorous fish Coreoperca herzi (C. herzi, size 89 +/- 4 mm). Statistically, the survival rates of the prey fish, Rhynchocypris oxycephalus (R. oxycephalus, size 29 +/- 1 mm), with JFSs were greater by 35.9%-46.7%, and improved as the patch volume of JFS increased. Based on both experimental observations and statistical analysis, the JFS developed in this study could reduce the chances of predator-prey encounters, minimize prey vulnerability, and thereby increase prey survival rates.																	2073-4441					JAN	2017	9	1							36	10.3390/w9010036								WOS:000392939900036

Here, we present and analyse 30 years of chemical and biological data from the shallow and 16 ha large Lake Vaeng, Denmark, which has been biomanipulated twice with a 20-year interval by removing roach (Rutilus rutilus) and bream (Abramis brama). After both biomanipulations, Lake Vaeng shifted from a turbid, phytoplankton-dominated state to a clear, water macrophyte-dominated state. Chlorophyll a was reduced from 60-80 mu g.L-1 to 10-30 mu g.L-1 and the coverage of submerged macrophytes, dominated by Elodea canadensis, increased from <0.1% to 70%-80%. Mean summer total phosphorus was reduced from about 0.12 to 0.07 mg.L-1 and total nitrogen decreased from 1.0 to 0.4 mg.L-1. On a seasonal scale, phosphorus and chlorophyll concentrations changed from a summer maximum during turbid conditions to a winter maximum under clear conditions. The future of Lake Vaeng is uncertain and a relatively high phosphorus loading via the groundwater, and the accumulation of a mobile P pool in the sediment make it likely that the lake eventually will return to turbid conditions. Repeated fish removals might be a relevant management strategy to apply in shallow lakes with a relatively high external nutrient loading.																	2073-4441					JAN	2017	9	1							43	10.3390/w9010043								WOS:000392939900043

The Impact of Para Rubber Expansion on Streamflow and Other Water Balance Components of the Nam Loei River Basin, Thailand	Water												At present, Para rubber is an economical crop which provides a high priced product and is in demand by global markets. Consequently, the government of Thailand is promoting the expansion of Para rubber plantations throughout the country. Traditionally, Para rubber was planted and grown only in the southern areas of the country. However, due to the Government's support and promotion as well as economic reasons, the expansion of Para rubber plantations in the northeast has increased rapidly. This support has occurred without accounting for suitable cultivation of Para rubber conditions, particularly in areas with steep slopes and other factors which have significant impacts on hydrology and water quality. This study presents the impacts of Para rubber expansion by applying the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrological model on the hydrology and water balance of the Nam Loei River Basin, Loei Province. The results showed that the displacement of original local field crops and disturbed forest land by Para rubber production resulted in an overall increase of evapotranspiration (ET) of roughly 3%. The major factors are the rubber canopy and precipitation. Moreover, the water balance results showed an annual reduction of about 3% in the basin average water yield, especially during the dry season.																	2073-4441					JAN	2017	9	1							1	10.3390/w9010001								WOS:000392939900001

This review examines fish welfare in relation to rearing water quality, fish feed and fish waste and faeces to develop a sustainable aquaponic system where the co-cultured organisms, fish, bacteria in biofilters and plants, should be considered holistically in all aquaponics operations. Water quality parameters are the primary environmental consideration for optimizing aquaponic production and for directly impacting fish welfare/ health issues and plant needs. In aquaponic systems, the uptake of nutrients should be maximised for the healthy production of the plant biomass but without neglecting the best welfare conditions for the fish in terms of water quality. Measures to reduce the risks of the introduction or spread of diseases or infection and to increase biosecurity in aquaponics are also important. In addition, the possible impacts of allelochemicals, i.e., chemicals released by the plants, should be taken into account. Moreover, the effect of diet digestibility, faeces particle size and settling ratio on water quality should be carefully considered. As available information is very limited, research should be undertaken to better elucidate the relationship between appropriate levels of minerals needed by plants, and fish metabolism, health and welfare. It remains to be investigated whether and to what extent the concentrations of suspended solids that can be found in aquaponic systems can compromise the health of fish. Water quality, which directly affects fish health and well-being, is the key factor to be considered in all aquaponic systems.

J	Zhou, JJ; Zhang, WJ; Liu, D; Wang, Z; Li, S				Zhou, Jingjing; Zhang, Wenjing; Liu, Dan; Wang, Zhuo; Li, Shuo			Influence of Humic Acid on the Transport and Deposition of Colloidal Silica under Different Hydrogeochemical Conditions	WATER												The transport and deposition of colloids in aquifers plays an important role in managed aquifer recharge (MAR) schemes. Here, the processes of colloidal silica transport and deposition were studied by displacing groundwater with recharge water. The results showed that significant amounts of colloidal silica transport occurred when native groundwater was displaced by HA solution. Solution contains varying conditions of ionic strength and ion valence. The presence of humic acid could affect the zeta potential and size of the colloidal silica, which led to obvious colloidal silica aggregation in the divalent ion solution. Humic acid increased colloidal silica transport by formation of non-adsorbing aqueous phase silica-HA complexes. The experimental and modeling results showed good agreement, indicating that the essential physics were accurately captured by the model. The deposition rates were less than 10(-8) s(-1) in deionized water and monovalent ion solution. Moreover, the addition of Ca2+ and increase of IS resulted in the deposition rates increasing by five orders of magnitude to 10(-4) s(-1). In all experiments, the deposition rates decreased in the presence of humic acid. Overall, the promotion of humic acid in colloidal silica was strongly associated with changes in water quality, indicating that they should receive greater attention during MAR.																	2073-4441					JAN	2017	9	1							10	10.3390/w9010010								WOS:000392939900010						
J	Arslan, H				Arslan, Hakan			Determination of temporal and spatial variability of groundwater irrigation quality using geostatistical techniques on the coastal aquifer of Carsamba Plain, Turkey, from 1990 to 2012	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The present study was conducted to investigate variations in groundwater quality parameters between 1990 and 2012, and to assess the suitability of groundwater for irrigation. Groundwater samples were taken in the summers of 1990 and 2012, and hydrochemical characteristics were investigated through Piper and USSL diagrams. The electrical conductivity (EC), sodium percentage (% Na), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), magnesium hazard (MR), potential salinity (PS), and Kelly's ratios (KI) were used as the indicators for the water quality. Water quality parameters were assessed through geostatistical techniques and geographical information systems. Initially, semivariograms were determined for each water quality index, and spatial distribution maps were created for each sampling period through ordinary kriging techniques. Results revealed excessive increases in EC, Na, and Cl values with time. EC values of groundwater were over 1.25 dS/m in 4.64% of the study area in 1990. The area increased to 37.38% in the year 2012. With regard to the Kelly Index, there were not any problems in the study area in 1990, but problems were encountered over 5.75% of the study area in the year 2012. While the ratio of problematic sites with regard to RSC was 2.44% in 1990, the ratio increased to 12.13% in the year 2012. Similar increases were also observed in other water quality parameters except for MR. Higher deteriorations were observed in water quality parameters through the eastern sections of the study area. From 1990 to 2012, increased deteriorations were observed in water quality parameters, and excessive groundwater withdrawal and resultant seawater intrusion were considered as the basic reasons for such deteriorations. Therefore, groundwater withdrawals along the coastal lines should be performed in a controlled fashion, and water quality should continuously be monitored.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JAN	2017	76	1							38	10.1007/s12665-016-6375-x								WOS:000392286300038

The threat to groundwater contamination is increasing day by day due to rapid increase in industrialization and urbanization. The present study aims at assessing the groundwater quality contamination threat around industrial cluster at Rajasthan State Industrial Development and Investment Corporation (RIICO) in Jaipur district of Rajasthan, India. The cluster does not have common effluent treatment plant, and very few units have their effluent treatment plants. Groundwater samples were collected around the industrial cluster and its vicinity and analyzed for major cations, anions and trace elements. The water quality data indicate that total dissolved solids exceed the drinking water standard set by the Bureau of Indian Standards in few samples, and trace elements of health significance are not detected in any sample. The soil analysis indicates that only the top surface near the point of disposal of the treated effluent is affected. In view of the thick alluvium of 60-80 m and the water table above 30 m, the effluents are retarded significantly before reaching the water table. The sodium adsorption ratio of water samples indicates its suitability for irrigation and falls in the category of fairly suitable to excellent. Piper plot reveals that dominant cations are Na+, K++ and Mg++ and dominant anions are HCO3- and CO3-. The Gibbs plot indicates that rock-water interactions influence the groundwater quality. The study reveals that the groundwater quality from most of the sources meets the requirements of drinking water standards, and there is enough environmental space available for the expansion of industrial belt in this RIICO hub.

Reconstructing the formation of a costal aquifer in Nampula province, Mozambique, from ERT and IP methods for water prospection	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												In continental margin basins, the hydrogeological setting is complex due to transgression/regression events that removed old sediments in the basin and formed new geologic units. Due to the geological complexity, the use of vertical electrical sounding has proven to be insufficient for groundwater explorations. The lack of understanding the geological underground has resulted in many boreholes with low yield or poor water quality. By performing electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and induced polarization (IP) measurements in 11 villages in Mongicual district, three different layers covering the basement were identified: a weathered autochthon layer, a weathered allochthon layer (paleo-coastal dune) and eolian white sand layer. The drilling at successful boreholes penetrates formations where the resistivity value is between 220 and 770 Omega m, whereas at unsuccessful boreholes the lower parts of the drilled range have resistivity values higher than 770 Omega m. Also, the thickness ratio of the weathered and semi-weathered layer in the unsuccessful boreholes is less than 1/3, whereas in all successful boreholes the ration is higher than 1/2. The difference between autochthon and allochthon layers was detected by heavy minerals content in the red eolian sand layer (Tupuito formation) that increased the chargeability value. The groundwater with a conductivity higher than 2000 mu S/cm is linked to the white eolian sand. The surface extension of white eolian sand layer is small to be mapped; therefore, bymapping the eolian white sand formation and the use of ERT and enhanced with IP method would lower the failure rate.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JAN	2017	76	1							36	10.1007/s12665-016-6364-0								WOS:000392286300036

This study has been done according to available information in the databank of Khuzestan Water and Power Authority and also new measures in the area. Based on available data, the water quality of Kheirabad and Zohre River in sampling stations is not suitable for drinking. The study area is located on Khuzestan Province-Behbahan city, Iran. The hardness of water samples is in the category of very hard (over 300 ppm CaCO3), and Fe, Mn and Pb values are more than standards. In new sampling and 12-month monitoring of anions, cations, heavy metals and microbial parameters indicate that Hg, Cd, Cr, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn, OC, T-coliforms and fecal coliforms in all stations for agricultural purposes and surface waters are more than standards and the sewage factories near the river have a noticeable effect on these contaminations. Furthermore, the high values of phosphate, ammonia and nitrate of some stations in wet seasons can be generated from agriculture wastes near the villages of the study area. In addition, because of outcrops of Gachsaran Formation in some stations, the concentration of ions is more than standards. So the results of Schuler diagrams indicate the water surface in the most cases is not suitable for drinking and based on Wilcox diagram all stations are located in C4S4 class.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JAN	2017	76	1							15	10.1007/s12665-016-6291-0								WOS:000392286300015

Surface water pathways and fluxes of metals under changing environmental conditions and human interventions in the Selenga River system	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												This paper presents the results of novel field campaigns in the extensive (447,000 km(2)) Selenga River basin, through which 304 samples of river water and 308 samples of suspended matter were collected during high and low water periods between 2011 and 2013. The Selenga River is the largest tributary (more than 50% of the inflow) to the Lake Baikal. Due to ongoing hydroclimatic change and human pressures under conditions of economic growth, the rivers of the area experience significant change in water quality. A key issue for improved understanding of regional impacts of the environmental change is to disentangle the influence of climate change from that of other pressures within the catchment. Our research aims to evaluate the pathways and mass flows of heavy metals and metalloids both in dissolved and suspended forms, taking a basin- scale perspective that previously has not been fully pursued in the Lake Baikal region. Results showed quality deterioration over short distances due to strong impact of hot spots from urban and industrial activities, including mining. The determined enrichment of dissolved metals in waters of Selenga River as well as the spatial and temporal variability of water and suspended sediment composition is further analyzed in the context of climatic, hydrological and land use drivers.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JAN	2017	76	1							1	10.1007/s12665-016-6304-z								WOS:000392286300001

Leather processing and its possible impact on groundwater quality in Silk Road sites: a case study from Chennai, India	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Water plays an important role in human civilisation. Since ancient times people started to settle in regions with ensured water availability. Trade was an important factor for the development of civilisation. Silk Road is an important route used for the trading between China and other countries across Eurasia. Not only silk, many goods including leather were exchanged during trading. Leather was processing lead to release of large amount of wastewater. This study was carried out to understand how the leather processing would have affected the groundwater quality in Silk Road sites by studying the current scenarios of groundwater quality near tanning industries. Chennai and nearby cities such as Ranipet and Vaniyambadi are chosen for case studies. Groundwater quality around the tanneries was poor due to high electrical conductivity and concentration of chromium. This is due to the effluents released by the tanneries into the ground or open drains without proper treatment.

Some of these geothermal resources have been used for power generation and direct heating. Most of the high enthalpy geothermal systems are located in western part of Turkey. Alasehir is the most important geothermal site in western part of Turkey. Many geothermal wells have been drilled in Alasehir Plain to produce the geothermal fluid from the deep reservoir in the last 10 years. A blowout accident happened during a geothermal well drilling operation in Alasehir Plain, and significant amount of geothermal fluid surfaced out along the fault zone in three locations. When drilling string entered the reservoir rock about 1000 m, blowout occurred. As the well head preventer system was closed because of the blowout, high-pressure fluid surfaced out along the fault zone cutting the Neogene formation. In order to understand the geothermal fluid effects on groundwater chemistry, physical and chemical compositions of local cold groundwater were monitored from May 2012 to September 2014 in the study area. The geothermal fluid was found to be of Na-HCO3 water type, and especially, arsenic and boron concentrations reached levels as high as 3 and 127 mg/L, respectively. The concentrations of arsenic and boron in the geothermal fluid and groundwater exceeded the maximum allowable limits given in the national and international standards for drinking water quality. According to temporally monitored results, geothermal fluid has extremely high mineral content which influenced the quality of groundwater resources of the area where water resource is commonly used for agricultural irrigation.

J	Varanka, S; Hjort, J				Varanka, Sanna; Hjort, Jan			Spatio-temporal aspects of the environmental factors affecting water quality in boreal rivers	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												River water quality is the outcome of multiple processes and factors, which vary spatially and temporally. In this study, the key spatial and temporal scales and the most important environmental factors explaining river water quality at these scales were analysed by generalized additive models (GAMs). Water quality was studied through total phosphorus (median = 61.9 mu g l(-1)) and nitrogen (1388.1 mu g l(-1)), pH (6.7) and water colour (143.3 mg Pt l(-1)). Environmental factors covered variables from land use/cover, climate and other landscape characteristics. The spatial scales used were the closest 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1000 m buffer zones around the river channel, in addition to the entire catchment area. Temporality was studied through the entire year and four periods, which were determined by the natural variation in discharge. In the comparison of spatial scales of environmental factors, the variation in phosphorus, nitrogen and water colour was best explained using environmental data from the broadest scale, the entire catchment. In contrast, the variation in pH was best explained using data from the closest (50 m) buffer zone, the riparian area. In modelling temporal scales, the variation in water quality variables was best explained during discharge maximum periods and when the environmental data covering the entire year were considered. Nutrients were related specifically to agriculture, water colour to lake percentage and pH to pastures. The results showed the suitability of GAMs in water quality studies.

J	Ye, M; Sun, HW; Hallas, K				Ye, Ming; Sun, Huaiwei; Hallas, Katie			Numerical estimation of nitrogen load from septic systems to surface water bodies in St. Lucie River and Estuary Basin, Florida	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Nitrogen pollution is one of the most prevalent and challenging environmental problems worldwide. Wastewater treatment using onsite sewage treatment and disposal systems (aka septic systems) is one source of nitrogen sources in the environment. This study presents a numerical study for estimating nitrogen load from septic systems to surface water bodies in the St. Lucie River and Estuary Basin, Florida, USA. The load estimation is conducted using an ArcGIS-based nitrogen load estimation toolkit, a screening-level modeling software that considers key mechanisms (i.e., advection, dispersion, and denitrification) controlling nitrogen transport as well as spatial variability of model parameters (e.g., hydraulic conductivity, porosity, septic system locations, and surface water bodies). The simulated nitrogen plumes and load estimates demonstrate the importance of considering spatial variability in the load estimation for nitrogen pollution management. The load estimates are strongly correlated with nitrogen concentrations in surface water quality data, suggesting that septic systems are an important factor for water quality deterioration in the St. Lucie River. The estimates can be used directly to support Basin Management Action Plan (BMAP). Evaluating the load estimates in the BMAP context indicates that nitrogen load from septic systems is a significant nitrogen source in the St. Lucie River and Estuary Basin. It is found in this study that the load estimates depend on lengths of flow paths, groundwater flow velocities, and soil drainage conditions. These findings are useful for nitrogen pollution management in similar areas facing nitrogen pollution problems.

A holistic assessment of discolouration processes in water distribution networks	URBAN WATER JOURNAL												Reducing discolouration events in aging water supply networks is a major challenge facing water utilities worldwide as they are required to comply with increasingly stringent water quality regulations in a proactive and cost-effective manner. Emerging control methods for dynamic reconfiguration of network topologies could reduce the risk of discolouration by regulating hydrodynamic conditions to facilitate the implementation of self-cleaning networks. This review paper provides a holistic assessment of mechanisms and pathways which govern discolouration processes, associated models and the impact of system hydraulics so that control rules can be formulated. The possible role of biofilms in conditioning the wall-bound cohesive layers is identified and methods for their effective removal are discussed. The information presented identifies key variables and research gaps to facilitate the development of near real-time hydraulic and network topology control for the long-term and proactive management of discolouration risk.																	1573-062X	1744-9006					2017	14	3					263	277		10.1080/1573062X.2015.1111912								WOS:000392208900005

Stormwater control measure (SCM) maintenance considerations to ensure designed functionality	URBAN WATER JOURNAL												Great investment is made in the design and installation of stormwater control measures (SCMs). Substantial research investment, too, is made to optimise the performance of SCMs. However, once installed, SCMs often suffer from lack of maintenance or even outright neglect. Key maintenance needs for wet ponds, constructed stormwater wetlands, bioretention, infiltration practices, permeable pavement, swales, and rainwater harvesting systems are reviewed with many tasks, such as the cleaning of pre-treatment areas and the preservation of infiltration surfaces, being common maintenance themes among SCMs. Consequences of lacking maintenance are illustrated (mainly insufficient function or failure). Probable reasons for neglect include insufficient communication, unclear responsibilities, lack of knowledge, financial barriers, and decentralised measures. In future designs and research, maintenance (and lack thereof) should be considered. Assessing the performance of SCMs conservatively and including safety factors may prevent consequences of under-maintenance; and requiring regular inspection may help to enforce sufficient maintenance.																	1573-062X	1744-9006					2017	14	3					278	290		10.1080/1573062X.2015.1111913								WOS:000392208900006						
J	Wang, SW; Li, ZW; Yu, QL				Wang, Shunwu; Li, Ziwang; Yu, Qinglong			Kinetic degradation of guar gum in oilfield wastewater by photo-Fenton process	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Guar gum is considered as a main component of oilfield wastewater. This work is intended to optimize the experimental conditions (H2O2 dosage, Fe2+ dosage, initial concentration of organics, initial pH and temperature) for the maximum oxidative degradation of guar gum by Fenton's reagent. The kinetics of guar gum removal were evaluated by means of the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and the absorbance measurements. The batch experiment results showed that the optimum conditions were: H2O2 dosage, 10,000 mg/L; Fe2+ dosage, 2,000 mg/L; initial concentration of organics, 413 mg/L; pH, 3 and temperature, 35 degrees C, under which the COD removal could reach 61.07% and fairly good stability could be obtained. Under the optimum experimental conditions, using UV irradiation to treat the wastewater, the photo-Fenton systems can successfully eliminate COD from guar gum solution. The COD removal always obeyed a pseudo-first-order kinetics and the degradation rate (k(app)) was increased by 25.7% in the photo-Fenton process compared to the Fenton process. The photo-Fenton system needed less time and consequently less quantity of H2O2 to obtain the same results as the Fenton process. The photo-Fenton process needs a dose of H2O2 20.46% lower than that used in the Fenton process to remove 79.54% of COD. The cost of the photo/ Fenton process amounted to RMB9.43/m(3), which was lower than that of the classic Fenton process alone (RMB10.58/m(3)) and the overall water quality of the final effluent could meet the class. national wastewater discharge standard for the petrochemical industry of China.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				JAN	2017	75	1					11	19		10.2166/wst.2016.470								WOS:000392391100002	28067641

The response of phytoplankton and microlayer-adapted bacteria to monolayer application in a humic, eutrophic irrigation dam	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Repeat applications of artificial monolayers to farm irrigation dams to reduce evaporative loss may adversely affect water quality by enhancing populations of microlayer-adapted bacteria and blue-green algae. The microlayer, subsurface and water column of a 16 ha dam were monitored every two weeks for 18 months, to benchmark the seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton and microlayer-adapted bacteria prior to monolayer application. Results for Secchi depth, total P, total N, chlorophyll a, phytobiovolume and UV254 absorbance, characterise Logan's Dam as humic and hypereutrophic. Seasonal peaks in the cyanobacterial species Microcystis aeruginosa and Anabaena sp. associated with regular thermal stratification periods over summer, exceeded the Queensland algal bloom alert level. Dissolved organic matter derived from aromatic char in the black soil used to construct the dam was the main substrate for microlayer-adapted bacteria. Intermittent monolayer application over seven weeks in late summer temporarily increased surface pressure, indicating a condensed monolayer had formed, with no increase in chemical oxygen demand or in populations of cyanobacteria or microlayer-adapted bacteria. The increase in dissolved organic carbon was well below the concentration recorded after a pump ingress event in late spring. In this humic hypereutrophic irrigation dam, repeat applications of the experimental monolayer formulation did not adversely affect water quality.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				JAN	2017	75	2					322	327		10.2166/wst.2016.515								WOS:000392395800009	28112659					
J	Li, YL; Zhang, Q; Werner, AD; Yao, J; Ye, XC				Li, Yunliang; Zhang, Qi; Werner, Adrian D.; Yao, Jing; Ye, Xuchun			The influence of river-to-lake backflow on the hydrodynamics of a large floodplain lake system (Poyang Lake, China)	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Backflow, the temporary reversal of discharge at the outlet of a lake, is an important mechanism controlling flow and transport in many connected river-lake systems. This study used statistical methods to examine long-term variations and primary causal factors of backflow from the Yangtze River to a laterally connected, large floodplain lake (Poyang Lake, China). Additionally, the effects of backflow on the lake hydrology were explored using a physically based hydrodynamic model and a particle-tracking model. Although backflow into Poyang Lake occurs frequently, with an average of 16 backflow events per year, and varies greatly in magnitude between years, statistical analysis indicates that both the frequency and magnitude of backflow reduced significantly during 2001-2010 relative to the previous period of 1960-2000. The ratio of Poyang Lake catchment inflows to Yangtze River discharge can be used as an indication of the daily occurrence of backflow, which is most likely to occur during periods when this ratio is lower than 5%. Statistical analysis also indicates that the Yangtze River discharge is the main controlling factor of backflow during July to October, rather than catchment inflows to the lake. Hydrodynamic modelling reveals that, in general, backflow disturbs the normal northward water flow direction in Poyang Lake and transports mass similar to 20 km southward into the lake. The effects of backflow on flow direction, water velocities and water levels propagate to virtually its upstream extremity. The current study represents a first attempt to explore backflow and causal factors for a highly dynamic floodplain lake system. An improved understanding of Poyang Lake backflow is critical for guiding future strategies to manage the lake, its water quality and ecosystem value, given proposals to modify the lake-river connectivity.

Mixing zones receiving acid drainage are critical sites where changes in pH and chemical environment promote the formation and dissolution of iron and aluminum oxy/hydroxides. These particles can significantly change the speciation of toxic metals and metalloids throughout drainage networks via sorption, desorption, and settling processes. However, little is known about the behavior of particle size distributions (PSDs) in streams affected by acid drainage and their relationship to metal speciation. This work studied: (a) the PSDs for a wide range of mixing ratios found at a fluvial confluence affected by acid drainage, and (b) the response of PSDs and arsenic speciation to environmental changes found when the particles approach complete mixing conditions. The confluence between the Azufre River (pH similar to 2, high concentration of dissolved metals) and Caracarani River (pH = 8.6, low concentration of dissolved metals) was used as a representative model for study. Field measurements show a bimodal PSD with modal diameters of similar to 50 and 300 mu m. At shorter distances from the junction, the smaller modes with smaller particle volumes were dominant across the stream cross-sections. A systematic shift towards larger particle sizes and larger particle volumes occurred downstream. The analysis of laboratory PSDs for Azufre/Caracarani mixing ratios between 0.01 and 0.5 (pH from 6.2 to 2.3) showed a bimodal trend with similar to 15 and 50 mu m characteristic diameters; larger particles formed at pH>4. When particle suspensions were transferred in laboratory experiments from very low pH to full mixing conditions (pH similar to 2.8 and mixing ratio similar to 0.25) particle sizes varied, and the dissolved arsenic concentration decreased. The observed reaction kinetics were slow compared to the time scale of advective transport, creating opportunities for engineered controls for arsenic. This work contributes to a better understanding of the chemical-hydrodynamic interactions in watersheds affected by mining, and identifying opportunities to improve water quality at points of use.

Upper Susquehanna watershed and New York State improvements in nitrogen and phosphorus mass balances of dairy farms	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												States in the Chesapeake Bay watershed (CBW) are required to reduce nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) loads from agriculture to achieve water quality goals for 2025. Assessing nutrient mass balances (NMBs) on farms over multiple years allows for evaluation of trends in nutrient accumulation and potential losses in geographic regions. Between 2004 and 2013, 570 NMBs were conducted for 189 dairy farms in NewYork, including 91 farms (293(.) NMBs) in the Upper Susquehanna watershed (USW), headwaters of the CBW. The average NMBs per hectare and per megagram of milk were lower for farms in the USW than statewide. Data showed a decline in NMBs per hectare over 10 years that ranged from 29% to 42% (statewide) and from 29% to 51% (for the USW dairies), depending on the nutrient, while milk production remained constant in both regions. Reductions in NMBs resulted primarily from reductions in nutrient imports, particularly through feed management. These source reductions reflect increased efficiency of production and reduced risk of N and P loss to the CBW. Extrapolation of comparisons in NMBs between 2004 and 2013 suggest that dairies in the USW reduced total N and P imports by 30% and 20%, respectively, contributing to a 29% to 50% decrease in total N pool and 51% decrease in P pool. We conclude that USW dairy farms can deliver up to 49% of their 2013 N pool and up to 72% of their 2013 P pool at the edge of the farms (their NMB) and still meet the total maximum daily load (TMDL) for N and P set for 2025 for New York agriculture. This study illustrates that significant nutrient source reduction can be obtained by implementing nutrient conservation practices, such as precision feeding and fertilizer management, combined with annual assessment of whole farm balances. Such a reduction in nutrient imports onto farms results in a reduction of the pool of nutrients available for accumulation in the soil or direct loss to water bodies and the atmosphere.																	0022-4561	1941-3300				JAN-FEB	2017	72	1					1	11		10.2489/jswc.72.1.1								WOS:000391160500003

Relationship between suspended sediment concentration and turbidity at construction sites	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Stormwater runoff from construction sites can transport eroded sediment to nearby water bodies, degrading water quality and impairing biotic communities. Turbidity is a relatively easy characteristic to measure and can be used to estimate sediment loads from construction sites if reliable relationships between turbidity and total suspended solids (TSS) are established. These relationships are investigated in this study for construction sites in Minnesota. Laboratory protocols have been developed herein for studying the factors that impact turbidity from construction site soils. Experimental procedures include the use of a rainfall simulator to generate runoff and turbidity values from soils carefully packed in appropriate test boxes. Turbidity characteristics of 14 different soils from construction sites were investigated using the laboratory protocols. Trends in turbidity with sediment concentrations were well represented by power functions. The exponent of these power functions was relatively constant between soils. The log-intercept, or scaling parameter, varied substantially among the different soils. Multiple soil properties were evaluated for each soil. An extensive regression analysis resulted in a model using percentage silt, interrill erodibility, and maximum abstraction that best represented the intercept term. A power value of 7/5 was chosen to represent all soils..																	0022-4561	1941-3300				JAN-FEB	2017	72	1					26	35		10.2489/jswc.72.1.26								WOS:000391160500005						
J	De Girolamo, AM; Barca, E; Pappagallo, G; Lo Porto, A				De Girolamo, Anna Maria; Barca, Emanuele; Pappagallo, Giuseppe; Lo Porto, Antonio			Simulating ecologically relevant hydrological indicators in a temporary river system	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Hydrological indicators (HIs) are commonly used in eco-hydrological studies (i.e. environmental flow and hydrological status assessment). Their computation is based on streamflow data, and if measured data are not available, hydrological models can be used to generate flow data. The present paper describes a study that aimed to predict streamflow in a temporary river and to analyze the general reliability of some hydrological indicators evaluated by using simulated data instead of measured flow data. The SWAT model was used to predict daily streamflow in a river section of the Celone river (Puglia, Italy). Several HIs characterizing the patterns of river flow or specific hydrological components were evaluated using observed and simulated streamflow. The results show that the SWAT model is able to simulate streamflow in temporary river systems, but its performance under extreme low flow conditions may be a weak point. When simulated streamflow time series were used, the replicability of the His evaluated using a rigorous statistical methodology ranged from good to limited. Good performance was found for the magnitude of discharge in wet months (average monthly flow from November to May), for the high flow indicators (annual maxima, 1-, 3-, 7-, 30-, 90-day mean flow) and timing, while limited performance was detected for low flow indicators (annual minimum 1-, 3-, 7-, 30-, 90-day mean flow) and the number of zero flow days. Better performance for low flow indicators was found after introducing the zero-flow threshold. This type of eco-hydrological study may contribute to characterizing the flow regime and its alterations in regions with scarce data. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Simulating hydrological and nonpoint source pollution processes in a karst watershed: A variable source area hydrology model evaluation	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												An ecohydrological watershed model can be used to develop an efficient watershed management plan for improving water quality. However, karst geology poses unique challenges in accurately simulating management impacts to both surface and groundwater hydrology. Two versions of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), Regular-SWAT and Topo-SWAT (which incorporates variable source area hydrology), were assessed for their robustness in simulating hydrology of the karstic Spring Creek watershed of Centre County, Pennsylvania, USA. Appropriate representations of surface water - groundwater interactions and of spring recharge - discharge areas were critical for simulating this karst watershed. Both Regular-SWAT and Topo-SWAT described the watershed discharge adequately with daily Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies (NSE) ranging from 0.77 to 0.79 for calibration and 0.68-0.73 for validation, respectively. Because Topo-SWAT more accurately represented measured daily streamflow, with statistically significant improvement of NSE over Regular-SWAT during validation (p-value = 0.05) and, unlike Regular-SWAT, had the capability of spatially mapping recharge/infiltration and runoff generation areas within the watershed, Topo-SWAT was selected to predict nutrient and sediment loads. Total watershed load estimates (518 t nitrogen/year, 45 t phosphorus/year, and 13600 t sediment/year) were within 10% of observed values (-9.2% percent bias for nitrogen, 6.6% for phosphorous, and 5.4% for sediment). Nutrient distributions among transport pathways, such as leaching and overland flow, corresponded with observed values. This study demonstrates that Topo-SWAT can be a valuable tool in future studies of agricultural land management change in karst regions.

This study investigated spatial and temporal variability in sediment and nutrient loads and load reductions achieved by implementing conservation practices to understand the implications of landscape heterogeneity and seasonal land-phase hydrologic variation on the effectiveness of the practices. Field-scale effects of nine conservation practices were evaluated in an agricultural watershed in the Midwest using the SWAT model. Results show that the conservation practice effectiveness, and the variability of the practice effectiveness at different locations, vary widely. Most practices are more effective in reducing nutrients in particulate than soluble forms. Practices applied to fields with higher nutrient loads do not necessarily lead to greater load reduction, indicating that an assumption of a proportional relationship between load and expected load reduction on which common targeting strategies for conservation practice placement are based may not be valid for nutrient, in particular soluble forms. The variation of the practices by fields and seasons suggests that achievement of water quality improvement requires careful selection of conservation practices and target areas considering hydrologic variations.

Agricultural production, water use and food availability in Pakistan: Historical trends, and projections to 2050	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Forty seven percent of the population of Pakistan is food insecure, access to food is uneven and malnutrition is widespread. In addition, food production depends greatly on irrigation, including the use of substantial volumes of water from already stressed aquifers. Our aim in this paper is to examine the implications of continued population growth on the required production of food and the implied water demand. We examine the historical trends of crop production, water use, food availability and population growth in Pakistan, and project them forward to 2050. Food availability has improved over recent decades, mostly as a result of increasing the area and water use of crops and fodder, and partly as a result of importing more pulses and cooking oils. We show that a continuation of current trends leads to nearly a doubling of the (already unsustainable) groundwater use. There is uncertainty in the magnitude of climate change impacts, but climate change may further exacerbate matters. To avoid further increases of groundwater use, some combination,would be required of: more dams and other irrigation infrastructure; increasing crop yields (particularly yields per unit volume of water) at a greater rate than in the past; a change in crop mix away from high water use crops like rice and sugarcane, to crops that use less water; and, exporting less and importing more food. The alternatives appear difficult to implement quickly, so it appears likely that in the short to medium term more groundwater will be consumed, with attendant problems of water quality and sustainability. Our analysis provides new perspectives on past trends and future food and water (including groundwater) challenges. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Coats, ER; Brinkman, CK; Lee, S				Coats, Erik R.; Brinkman, Cynthia K.; Lee, Stephen			Characterizing and contrasting the microbial ecology of laboratory and full-scale EBPR systems cultured on synthetic and real wastewaters	WATER RESEARCH												The anthropogenic discharge of phosphorus (P) into surface waters can induce the proliferation of cyanobacteria and algae, which can negatively impact water quality. Enhanced biological P removal (EBPR) is an engineered process that can be employed to efficiently remove significant quantities of P from wastewater. Within this engineered system, the mixed microbial consortium (MMC) becomes enriched with polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs). To date much knowledge has been developed on PAOs, and the EBPR process is generally well understood; nonetheless, the engineered process remains underutilized. In this study, investigations were conducted using qPCR and Illumina MiSeq to assess the impacts of wastewater (synthetic vs. real) on EBPR microbial ecology. While a strong relationship was demonstrated between EBPR metrics (P:C; influent VFA:P) and excellent P removal across diverse EBPR systems and MMCs, no such correlations existed with the specific MMCs. Moreover, MMCs exhibited distinct clusters based on substrate, and qPCR results based on the putative PAO Accumulibacter did not correlate with BLASTN eubacterial results for either Accumulibacter or Rhodocyclaceae. More critically, PAO-based sequences aligned poorly with Accumulibacter for both eubacterial and PAO primer sets, which strongly suggests that the conventional PAO primers applied in FISH and qPCR analysis do not sufficiently target the putative PAO Accumulibacter. In particular, negligible alignment was observed for PAO amplicons obtained from a MMC performing excellent EBPR on crude glycerol (an atypical substrate). A synthetic wastewater-based MMC exhibited the best observed BLASTN match of the PAO amplicons, raising concerns about the potential relevance in using synthetic substrates in the study of EBPR.

J	Chaudhary, A; Hantush, MM				Chaudhary, Abhishek; Hantush, Mohamed M.			Bayesian Monte Carlo and maximum likelihood approach for uncertainty estimation and risk management: Application to lake oxygen recovery model	WATER RESEARCH												Model uncertainty estimation and risk assessment is essential to environmental management and informed decision making on pollution mitigation strategies. In this study, we apply a probabilistic methodology, which combines Bayesian Monte Carlo simulation and Maximum Likelihood estimation (BMCML) to calibrate a lake oxygen recovery model. We first derive an analytical solution of the differential equation governing lake-averaged oxygen dynamics as a function of time-variable wind speed. Statistical inferences on model parameters and predictive uncertainty are then drawn by Bayesian conditioning of the analytical solution on observed daily wind speed and oxygen concentration data obtained from an earlier study during two recovery periods on a eutrophic lake in upper state New York. The model is calibrated using oxygen recovery data for one year and statistical inferences were validated using recovery data for another year. Compared with essentially two-step, regression and optimization approach, the BMCML results are more comprehensive and performed relatively better in predicting the observed temporal dissolved oxygen levels (DO) in the lake. BMCML also produced comparable calibration and validation results with those obtained using popular Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique (MCMC) and is computationally simpler and easier to implement than the MCMC. Next, using the calibrated model, we derive an optimal relationship between liquid film-transfer coefficient for oxygen and wind speed and associated 95% confidence band, which are shown to be consistent with reported measured values at five different lakes. Finally, we illustrate the robustness of the BMCML to solve risk-based water quality management problems, showing that neglecting cross-correlations between parameters could lead to improper required BOD load reduction to achieve the compliance criteria of 5 mg/L.

In this study multiple approaches including targeted sampling and monitoring of host-specific Bacteroidales markers were used to identify the impact of septic systems on microbial water quality. Twenty four watersheds with septic density ranging from 8 to 373 septic units/km(2) were monitored for water quality under baseflow conditions over a 3-year period. The levels of the human-associated HF183 marker, as well as total and ruminant Bacteroidales, were quantified using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Human-associated Bacteroidales yield was significantly higher in high density watersheds compared to low density areas and was negatively correlated (r = -0.64) with the average distance of septic systems to streams in the spring season. The human marker was also positively correlated with the total Bacteroidales marker, suggesting that the human source input was a significant contributor to total fecal pollution in the study area. Multivariable regression analysis indicates that septic systems, along with forest cover, impervious area and specific conductance could explain up to 74% of the variation in human fecal pollution in the spring season. The results suggest septic system impact through contributions to groundwater recharge during baseflow or failing septic system input, especially in areas with >87 septic units/km(2). This study supports the use of microbial source tracking approaches along with traditional fecal indicator bacteria monitoring and land use characterization in a tiered approach to isolate the influence of septic systems on water quality in mixed-use watersheds.

J	Reichwaldt, ES; Ho, WY; Zhou, WX; Ghadouani, A				Reichwaldt, Elke S.; Ho, Wei Y.; Zhou, Wenxu; Ghadouani, Anas			Sterols indicate water quality and wastewater treatment efficiency	WATER RESEARCH												As the world's population continues to grow, water pollution is presenting one of the biggest challenges worldwide. More wastewater is being generated and the demand for clean water is increasing. To ensure the safety and health of humans and the environment, highly efficient wastewater treatment systems, and a reliable assessment of water quality and pollutants are required. The advance of holistic approaches to water quality management and the increasing use of ecological water treatment technologies, such as constructed wetlands and waste stabilisation ponds (WSPs), challenge the appropriateness of commonly used water quality indicators. Instead, additional indicators, which are direct measures of the processes involved in the stabilisation of human waste, have to be established to provide an in-depth understanding of system performance. In this study we identified the sterol composition of wastewater treated in WSPs and assessed the suitability of human sterol levels as a bioindicator of treatment efficiency of wastewater in WSPs. As treatment progressed in WSPs, the relative abundance of human faecal sterols, such as coprostanol, epicoprostanol, 24-ethylcoprostanol, and sitostanol decreased significantly and the sterol composition in wastewater changed significantly. Furthermore, sterol levels were found to be correlated with commonly used wastewater quality indicators, such as BOD, TSS and E. coli. Three of the seven sterol ratios that have previously been used to track sewage pollution in the environment, detected a faecal signal in the effluent of WSPs, however, the others were influenced by high prevalence of sterols originating from algal and fungal activities. This finding poses a concern for environmental assessment studies, because environmental pollution from waste stabilisation ponds can go unnoticed. In conclusion, faecal sterols and their ratios can be used as reliable indicators of treatment efficiency and water quality during wastewater treatment in WSPs. They can complement the use of commonly used indicators of water quality, to provide essential information on the overall performance of ponds and whether a pond is underperforming in terms of stabilising human waste. Such a holistic understanding is essential when the aim is to improve the performance of a treatment plant, build new plants or expand existing infrastructure. Future work should aim at further establishing the use of sterols as reliable water quality indicators on a broader scale across natural and engineered systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Bonhomme, C; Petrucci, G				Bonhomme, Celine; Petrucci, Guido			Should we trust build-up/wash-off water quality models at the scale of urban catchments?	WATER RESEARCH												Models of runoff water quality at the scale of an urban catchment usually rely on build-up/wash-off formulations obtained through small-scale experiments. Often, the physical interpretation of the model parameters, valid at the small-scale, is transposed to large-scale applications. Testing different levels of spatial variability, the, parameter distributions of a water quality model are obtained in this paper through a Monte Carlo Markov Chain algorithm and analyzed. The simulated variable is the total suspended solid concentration at the outlet of a periurban catchment in the Paris region (2.3 km(2)), for which high-frequency turbidity measurements are available. This application suggests that build-up/wash-off models applied at the catchment-scale do not maintain their physical meaning, but should be considered as "black-box" models. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This study compares stormwater management in two cities: Singapore and Berlin, Germany. In comparing the strategies for stormwater management, we illustrate how differences in geography (e.g., land and water availability), urban infrastructure, regulatory regimes, legislation and intensives between the two cities have led to different solutions for stormwater management. Singapore, faced with a serious issue of water scarcity, has placed an increasing emphasis on stormwater management through developing a comprehensive network of drains and canals, mainly with the aim of controlling flooding and potable water supply. In contrast, in Berlin, concerns for the protection of surface water quality and non-potable water supply in the urban areas have resulted in a shift in management goals towards a low impact solution based on source control. The cost analysis indicated that the decentralized rainwater harvesting as practiced in Berlin leads to a higher economic efficiency where potable water can be substituted by stormwater, compared to the centralized drainage system in Singapore. Additionally, green roofs result in energy savings by serving as mitigation strategies against the effect of urban heat islands and global warming. In the near future, it is envisioned that a combination of both conventional and decentralized urban stormwater management will prove to be the most practical solution for most cities.

Simulations of homogeneous soil blocks with hydraulic properties ranging from sand to clay showed that infiltration capacities vary greatly for the different soil types observed in glacial till. The inclusion of heterogeneities dramatically increased infiltration volume by a factor of 22 for a soil with structural changes above and below the CaCO3 boundary. Infiltration increased further by 8% if tectonic fractures were included and by another 61% if earthworm burrows were added. Comparison of HydroGeoSphere infiltration hydrographs with a simple soakaway model (Roldin et al., 2012) showed similar results for homogeneous soils but indicated that exclusion of small scale soil physical features may greatly underestimate hydraulic performance of infiltration based SUDS.

Mesocosm study of enhanced bioretention media in treating nutrient rich stormwater for mixed development area	URBAN WATER JOURNAL												A well-designed engineered soil for bioretention is important as it ensures that pollutant removal requirements are met. This laboratory study investigated the nutrient removal efficiency of bioretention media enhanced with 10% (by volume) additives from various waste materials (cockle shell, newspaper, printed paper, coconut husk and tyre crumb) and planted with Red Hot Chinese Hibiscus (Hibiscus rosasinensis), a common landscape shrub in tropical countries. The results showed that media enhanced with shredded newspaper demonstrated a significant improvement in total nitrogen (TN) removal (80.4%), compared to standard bioretention media (57.5%) without compromising total suspended solids (TSS) and total phosphorus (TP) removal, when dosed with actual runoff. The thick root system and rapid growth rate of the plant was proven to contribute to TN removal. This study concluded that shredded newspaper can be a potential addition to enhance bioretention media performance in treating stormwater, especially nutrient rich runoff from mixed development areas.

While complex computer simulation models can be used to identify these areas, resources needed for using such models are beyond reach for most water resources managers. Soil and water conservationists need simple, spatially explicit tools such as the USDA-NRCS's Soil Vulnerability Index (WI) to evaluate the inherent vulnerability of soils and the risk they pose to water quality when used for row crop agriculture. In this study, the SVI was evaluated in the Goodwater Creek Experimental Watershed (GCEW), a claypan watershed in Missouri, using three methods: professional judgment, comparison to the Conductivity Claypan Index (CCI) developed specifically for claypan soils, and comparison to model results. Factors affecting the critical areas identified by each method were assessed and classified areas were compared. Slope and depth to claypan had the most variability in GCEW and were found to be influential in determining area classification by each index. While the original definition of SVI included the soil type representative slope from the USDA SSURGO database, slope values provided by a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) improved the index usefulness by classifying visibly degraded and non-degraded areas in different categories. High and moderately high vulnerability areas identified with SVI, CCI and model results with DEM slopes were consistent and matched professional judgment. Additional testing of SVI is recommended in areas characterized by soils of different permeability and under different climates.

The pollution of water by human and animal wastes can be a source of hazardous pathogens, which may pose serious health risks. In this study, we evaluated the microbiological water quality in the southern Ganghwado Bay area, South Korea. A total of 30 samples ( 14 discharge water samples from the drainage area and 16 sea water samples from the adjacent area) were analyzed for the concentrations of total coliforms ( TC) and fecal coliforms ( FC) in November 2013. The highest concentration of FC ( 28,000 MPN/100 mL) was found at site L1 ( inland). The highest mean concentrations of coliforms were found at sites W9 ( sea water) and W11 ( sea water), with TC and FC concentrations of 33 MPN/100 mL.

Innovative modeling framework for combined sewer overflows prediction	URBAN WATER JOURNAL												Combined sewer overflows ( CSOs) and street flooding are undesirable consequences of insufficient capacity of sewer networks and wastewater systems. These conditions degrade the water quality of the receiving waters, potentially damage infrastructure, and threaten public health. Significant efforts to prevent CSOs and alleviate flooding have been undertaken in Chicago, with the construction of the tunnel and reservoir plan ( TARP). This study analyses the hydraulic response of the first tunnel built in Chicago "The Lawrence Avenue Tunnel" through a framework of hydrological and hydraulic models. This framework proved effective in CSO's volume, frequency and duration predictions as it yields simulation results of existing conditions that match well with available records.
