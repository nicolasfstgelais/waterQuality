In summer, during a period of marked stratification with low dissolved oxygen near the bottom, the organisms avoided the deepest layers, and migration was nocturnal or undetectable, in both periods. On other occasions, with partial or total circulation in the lake, a weak twilight migration of copepodites and adults in 1985 was replaced by the reverse in 1999. Differences were found among stages, with the weakest or undetectable migration being observed for nauplii. The migratory pattern change for copepodites and adults might be related with a recent predation pressure increase by Chaoborus larvae on copepods, after the virtual disappearance of their main cladoceran prey.},

  abstract = {Temporal variability in lake phytoplankton is controlled largely by a complex interplay between hydrodynamic and chemical factors, and food web interactions. We explored mechanisms underlying phytoplankton interannual variability in Lake Washington (USA), using a 25-yr time series of water quality data (1975-1999). Time-series analysis and PCA were used to decompose chlorophyll data into modes of variability. We found that phytoplankton dynamics in Lake Washington were characterized by four seasonal modes, each of which was associated with different ecological processes. The first mode coincided with the period when the system was light limited (January-March) and phytoplankton patterns were driven by the amount of available solar radiation. The second mode (April-June) coincided with the peak of the spring bloom and the subsequent decline of phytoplankton biomass, and was largely controlled by total phosphorus levels and grazing pressure from cladoceran zooplankton. Evidence of co-dependence and tight relationship between phytoplankton and cladoceran dynamics were also found from July to October when a large portion of the phosphorus supply in the mixed layer was provided by zooplankton excretion. The fourth mode (November-December) was associated with the transition to thermal and chemical homogeneity and the winter phytoplankton minima (2-2.5 microg/l). Finally, we examined the effects of meteorological forcing and large-scale oceanic climate fluctuations (ENSO and PDO) on phytoplankton dynamics and assessed the significance of their role on the interannual variability in the lake.},

Here, we study parasitism in natural populations of the zooplankton host Daphnia magna investigating their individual and population level effects during a 2-year field study. Our results revealed a rich and highly prevalent community of parasites, with eight endoparasite species (four microsporidia, one amoeba, two bacteria and one nematode) and six epibionts (belonging to five different taxa: Chlorophyta, Bacillariophyceae, Ciliata, Fungi and Rotifera). Several of the endoparasites were associated with a severe overall fecundity reduction of the hosts, while such effects were not seen for epibionts. In particular, infections by Pasteuria ramosa, White Fat Cell Disease and Flabelliforma magnivora were strongly associated with a reduction in overall D. magna fecundity. Across the sampling period, average population fecundity of D. magna was negatively associated with overall infection intensity and total endoparasite richness. Population density of D. magna was negatively correlated to overall endoparasite prevalence and positively correlated with epibiont richness. Finally, the reduction in host fecundity caused by different parasite species was negatively correlated to both parasite prevalence and the length of the time period during which the parasite persisted in the host population. Consistent with epidemiological models, these results indicate that parasite mediated host damages influence the population dynamics of both hosts and parasites.},

  abstract = {The Oxyurida comprises some 850 known species that occur in the intestine of arthropods and vertebrates (one species in annelids). Important arthropod hosts include Diplopoda, Blattodea, Gryllotalpoidea, Passalidae, Scarabaeida and Hydrophilidae. The major vertebrate hosts are lizards, tortoises, primates, rodents and lagomorphs. An underlying characteristic of the group is haplodiploid reproduction and like many haplodiploid groups, pinworms tend to have life histories that involve high levels of inbreeding. Unlike Strongylida, Ascaridida and Spirurida, which have diversified in tissue site and life cycle as well as hosts, pinworms show little variation in these features and have radiated only across host groups. Two explanations are advanced for this. Haplodiploidy and its concomitant inbreeding may act to canalise evolutionary change, although diverse groups such as the Hymenoptera belie this. Alternatively, Strongylida, Ascaridida and Spirurida are presumed to have arisen from skin-penetrating ancestors that were forced to undergo a tissue migration before reaching their primitive tissue site, the gut. This migration demanded they adapt to a variety of tissue sites and thus acted as a preadaptation to further diversification. The Oxyurida, in contrast, probably arose using oral contaminative transmission. The lack of exposure to other tissue sites may therefore have relegated pinworms to their position in the posterior gut.},

  abstract = {In food-web studies, parasites are often ignored owing to their insignificant biomass. We provide evidence that parasites may affect trophic transfer in aquatic food webs. Many phytoplankton species are susceptible to parasitic fungi (chytrids). Chytrid infections of diatoms in lakes may reach epidemic proportions during diatom spring blooms, so that numerous free-swimming fungal zoospores (2-3 microm in diameter) are produced. Analysis shows that these zoospores are rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids and sterols (particularly cholesterol), which indicates that they provide excellent food for zooplankters such as Daphnia. In life-table experiments using the large diatom Asterionella formosa as food, Daphnia growth increased significantly in treatments where a parasite was present. By grazing on the zoospores, Daphnia acquired important supplementary nutrients and were able to grow. When large inedible algae are infected by parasites, nutrients within the algal cells are consumed by these chytrids, some of which, in turn, are grazed by Daphnia. Thus, chytrids transfer energy and nutrients from their hosts to zooplankton. This study suggests that parasitic fungi alter trophic relationships in freshwater ecosystems and may be the important components in shaping the community and the food-web dynamics of lakes.},

  abstract = {The study of vertical migrations in aquatic organisms has a long and colourful history, much of it to do with the effects of changing sampling technology on our understanding of the phenomenon. However, the overwhelming majority of such studies carried out today still depend on detecting differences in vertical distribution profiles during some course of time, or acoustic echoes of migrating bands of organisms. These can not distinguish migratory activity of individual organisms, but can only assess net results of mass transfers of populations, which may integrate many individual migrations. This is an important distinction, for without knowing the actual movements of individuals it seems unlikely that we will be able to understand their causes, nor the effects of vertical migrations on the environment or on the migrators themselves. This review examines evidence for individual vertical movements gathered from 'tracers', mainly gut contents, and reviews the evidence for the hypothesis that such movements are in fact driven by hunger and satiation. The more recently appreciated vertical migrations of phytoplankters and their similarities in form and driving forces to those of zooplankton and nekton are also discussed. Finally, the role of vertical migrators in vertical fluxes of materials is discussed, along with the consequences of satiation-driven descent for such estimates.},

  abstract = {Many planktonic species show spectacular bursts ("blooms") in population density. Though viral infections are known to cause behavioural and other changes in phytoplankton and other aquatic species, yet their role in regulating the phytoplankton population is still far from being understood. To study the role of viral diseases in the planktonic species, we model the phytoplankton-zooplankton system as a prey-predator system. Here the prey (phytoplankton) species is infected with a viral disease that divides the prey population into susceptible and infected classes, with the infected prey being more vulnerable to predation by the predator (zooplankton). The dynamical behaviour of the system is investigated from the point of view of stability and persistence both analytically and numerically. The model shows that infection can be sustained only above a threshold of force of infection, and, there exists a range in the infection rate where this system shows "bloom"-like stable limit cycle oscillations. The time series of natural "blooms" with different types of irregular oscillations can arise in this model simply from a biologically realistic feature, i.e., by the random variation of the epidemiological parameter (rate of infection) in the infected prey population. The difference in mean strength of infection alone can lead to the different types of patterns observed in natural planktonic blooms.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chemoreception is vitally important for all animals, yet little is known about the genetics of chemoreception in aquatic organisms. The keystone species Daphnia pulex, a well known crustacean, is the first aquatic invertebrate to have its genome sequenced. This has allowed us the initial investigation of chemoreceptor genes in an aquatic invertebrate, and to begin the study of chemoreceptor evolution across the arthropod phylum. RESULTS: We describe 58 Grs (gustatory receptors), belonging to the insect chemoreceptor superfamily, which were identified bioinformatically in the draft genome of the crustacean waterflea Daphnia pulex. No genes encoding proteins similar to the insect odorant receptors (Ors) were identified. These 58 Grs form 3 distinctive subfamilies of 37, 12, and 5 genes, as well as a highly divergent singleton (Gr58). In addition, Grs55-57 share distinctive amino acid motifs and cluster with the sugar receptors of insects, and may illuminate the origin of this distinctive subfamily. ESTs, tiling array, and PCR amplification results support 34 predicted gene models, and preliminary expression data comparing the sexes indicates potential female-biased expression for some genes. CONCLUSION: This repertoire of 58 chemoreceptors presumably mediates the many chemoperception abilities of waterfleas. While it is always possible that the entire Or gene lineage was lost at some point in the history of Daphnia pulex, we think it more likely that the insect Or lineage is indeed a relatively recently expanded gene lineage concomitant with the evolution of terrestriality in the insects or their hexapod ancestors.},

Theory readily predicts that parasites can promote host diversity through mechanisms such as disruptive selection. Yet, despite these predictions, empirical evidence for parasite-mediated increases in host diversity remains surprisingly scant. RESULTS: Here, we document parasite-mediated disruptive selection on a natural Daphnia population during a parasite epidemic. The mean susceptibility of clones collected from the population before and after the epidemic did not differ, but clonal variance and broad-sense heritability of post-epidemic clones were significantly greater, indicating disruptive selection and rapid evolution. A maximum likelihood method that we developed for detecting selection on natural populations also suggests disruptive selection during the epidemic: the distribution of susceptibilities in the population shifted from unimodal prior to the epidemic to bimodal after the epidemic. Interestingly, this same bimodal distribution was retained after a generation of sexual reproduction. CONCLUSION: These results provide rare empirical support for parasite-driven increases in host genetic diversity, and suggest that this increase can occur rapidly.},

We hypothesize here that resource quality can also strongly influence disease dynamics: epidemics can be inhibited when resource quality for hosts is too poor and too good. In three lakes, resource quality for the zooplankton host (Daphnia dentifera) was poor when fungal epidemics (Metschnikowia bicuspidata) commenced and increased as epidemics waned. Experiments using variation in algal food showed that resource quality had conflicting effects on underlying epidemiology: high-quality food induced large production of infective propagules (spores) and high birth rate but also reduced transmission. A model then illustrated how these underlying correlations can inhibit the start of epidemics (when spore production/birth rate are too low) but also catalyse their end (when transmission becomes too low). This resource quality mechanism is likely to interface with other ones controlling disease dynamics and warrants closer evaluation.},

  abstract = {1. Hybridization between species is a common phenomenon in plants and animals. If parasite prevalence differs for hybrids and parental species (i.e. taxa) there may be considerable consequences for relative hybrid fitness. Some studies have investigated hybrid complexes for infection, and complex-specific differences in parasite prevalence have been detected. 2. Based on the results of a field study on a hybridizing Daphnia population from a single lake, it has been hypothesized that permanently over- or under-infected hybrids do not exist. The observed field-patterns can only be temporal because taxa, in addition to single genotypes, might be the subject of parasite driven host frequency-dependent selection. Thus, parasites will track any common taxon within a hybrid complex. 3. In the present study, hybridizing Daphnia populations from 43 lakes were screened for parasite infections to obtain indirect evidence for coevolutionary cycles. It was hypothesized that, due to time lags between the evolution of resistance in host populations and the evolution of the parasite towards tracking of a common host taxon, the same Daphnia taxon will be over-infected in some lakes, while being under-infected in others. 4. Two of the four parasite species were specialists: their prevalence differed among coexisting Daphnia taxa. The varying infection patterns detected across spatially segregated hybridizing Daphnia populations are consistent with theoretical predictions for coevolutionary cycles. Thus the infection patterns, as observed under natural conditions, are temporal and unstable. 5. Additionally, the spatial distribution of the four parasite species was analysed with respect to habitat differences. The results show that the presence of a particular parasite on a host taxon was determined not only by the host-specificity of the parasite, but also by host-habitat relations.},

No viable offspring developed from infected clutches, but 78\% of the infected females produced healthy offspring after releasing the infected brood while molting. Neither those offsprings' development success nor their mothers' reproductive potential was affected by the brood parasite. However, infected Daphnia had a reduced life-span and suffered an increased susceptibility to another parasite, an unidentified bacterium. Additionally, we studied the prevalence of this brood parasite and the unidentified bacterium in a natural Daphnia assemblage in a pre-alpine lake, across changing demographic and environmental conditions. The brood parasite epidemic seemed to be host-density dependent. Our results show that the brood parasite's impact on the host population is enhanced when combined with the unidentified bacterium.},

Secondary analyses of literature data (28 studies, n = 239-393) revealed a significant positive influence of food concentration on Daphnia clearance rate at low food levels, i.e., evidence of an overall Type III functional response. This result was not an artifact of including data from Daphnia that were exhausted from prolonged food deprivation (more than three hours at very low food). Meta-analysis of Daphnia clearance rate vs. food concentration across a range of low food concentrations (eight studies) showed a significantly positive slope across studies, which also supports the presence of a Type III response. Congruent with these analyses of published data, the feeding experiment showed clear evidence of a Type III functional response for D. pulicaria feeding on Ankistrodesmus falcatus. Food levels at which Daphnia clearance rate declined with decreasing food were near the minimum resource requirement for Daphnia population maintenance at steady state (R*). We suggest that Type III responses are more common than previously believed, perhaps because of the relative paucity of observations at low food levels, and that reduced prey mortality at low phytoplankton densities could be a stabilizing mechanism for Daphnia-phytoplankton systems under resource scarcity.},

  abstract = {Understanding the drivers and consequences of disease epidemics is an important frontier in ecology. However, long-term data on hosts, their parasites, and the corresponding environmental conditions necessary to explore these interactions are often unavailable. We examined the dynamics of Daphnia pulicaria, a keystone zooplankter in lake ecosystems, to explore the long-term causes and consequences of infection by a chytridiomycete parasitoid (Polycaryum laeve). After quantifying host-pathogen dynamics from vouchered samples collected over 15 years, we used autoregressive models to evaluate (1) hypothesized drivers of infection, including host density, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, host-food availability, and lake mixing; and (2) the effects of epidemics on host populations. Infection was present in most years but varied widely in prevalence, from $\backslash$textless 1\% to 34\%, with seasonal peaks in early spring and late fall. Within years, lake stratification strongly inhibited P. laeve transmission, such that epidemics occurred primarily during periods of water mixing. Development of the thermocline likely reduced transmission by spatially separating susceptible hosts from infectious zoospores. Among years, ice duration and cumulative snowfall correlated negatively with infection prevalence, likely because of reductions in spring phytoplankton and D. pulicaria density in years with extended winters. Epidemics also influenced dynamics of the host population. Infected D. pulicaria rarely ($\backslash$textless 1\%) contained eggs, and P. laeve prevalence was positively correlated with sexual reproduction in D. pulicaria. Analyses of D. pulicaria density-dependent population dynamics predicted that, in the absence of P. laeve infection, host abundance would be 11-50\% higher than what was observed. By underscoring the importance of complex physical processes in controlling host-parasite interactions and of epidemic disease in influencing host populations, our results highlight the value of long-term data for understanding wildlife disease dynamics.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In lakes with a deep-water algal maximum, herbivorous zooplankton are faced with a trade-off between high temperature but low food availability in the surface layers and low temperature but sufficient food in deep layers. It has been suggested that zooplankton (Daphnia) faced with this trade-off distribute vertically according to an "Ideal Free Distribution (IFD) with Costs". An experiment has been designed to test the density (competition) dependence of the vertical distribution as this is a basic assumption of IFD theory. RESULTS: Experiments were performed in large, indoor mesocosms (Plankton Towers) with a temperature gradient of 10 degrees C and a deep-water algal maximum established below the thermocline. As expected, Daphnia aggregated at the interface between the two different habitats when their density was low. The distribution spread asymmetrically towards the algal maximum when the density increased until 80 \% of the population dwelled in the cool, food-rich layers at high densities. Small individuals stayed higher in the water column than large ones, which conformed with the model for unequal competitors. CONCLUSION: The Daphnia distribution mimics the predictions of an IFD with costs model. This concept is useful for the analysis of zooplankton distributions under a large suite of environmental conditions shaping habitat suitability. Fish predation causing diel vertical migrations can be incorporated as additional costs. This is important as the vertical location of grazing zooplankton in a lake affects phytoplankton production and species composition, i.e. ecosystem function.},

The key advantages of the Daphnia-parasite system are the propagation of the host as iso-female lines, that is clonal, but at the same time the possibility to cross lines. Furthermore, Daphnia have diverse parasites, including bacteria, fungi, microsporidia and helminths, which can be kept in culture with the hosts. For two parasites of Daphnia magna, coevolution has been demonstrated phenotypically. Coevolution in D. magna and the bacterium Pasteuria ramosa is consistent with model predictions of coevolution by negative frequency dependent selection, the Red Queen hypothesis. The genetic mechanisms have not yet been elucidated.},

  abstract = {Because host-parasite interactions are often specific to the host and parasite genotype, it may be important whether a host reproduces by selfing or outcrossing. The latter is associated with higher genetic diversity among the offspring and may reduce parasite success. Here, we test whether outbred offspring of Daphnia magna have an advantage over selfed offspring in the presence of a parasite transmitted from mothers to offspring. Using outdoor mesocosms, we set up monoclonal and polyclonal host populations of D. magna infected with a prevalence of 100\% with the horizontally and vertically transmitted microsporidian parasite Octosporea bayeri. These populations diapaused after sexual reproduction and hatchlings were screened for signs of O. bayeri. Parasite prevalence was 98.9\% for hatchlings from the monoclonal treatment, but only 85.2\% among the hatchlings from the polyclonal populations, indicating a short-term benefit for outbreeding. This benefit occurs, we hypothesize, not owing to inbreeding depression, but because the vertically transmitted parasite is less able to establish itself in the relatively new genetic environment of the outbred offspring, as compared to the more stable environment when transmitted to selfed offspring. To quantify the fitness consequences of this 14\% prevalence difference, we studied the within-season epidemiology of O. bayeri, using an epidemiological model. We then examined whether descendants of outbred offspring produce more resting eggs than the descendants of selfed offspring. The data and our model show that Daphnia which are uninfected at the beginning of the growth season have a large advantage when the entire season is considered. Our data support the Red Queen hypothesis which states that in the presence of coevolving parasites, outbreeding is favoured in the host.},

Ctenophores were found below 5 m depth only. Results of the investigation indicate that mass occurrence of B. vitrea could have a great impact on the Kotor Bay ecosystem. Their predation on copepods would reduce grazing pressure on phytoplankton, favouring an uncommon bloom of the latter. It is evident that B. vitrea are capable of altering rapidly the composition and biomass of coastal plankton communities when present in large masses. This first evidence of such events for this species may indicate changes in the functioning of marine ecosystems of the southern Adriatic.},

  abstract = {We tested the hypotheses that benthic macroinvertebrates, especially chironomid larvae in the Tribe Chironomini, from small oligotrophic arctic lakes are only weakly linked to pelagic food sources, and that they are trophically linked to biogenic methane. All offshore benthic macroinvertebrates sampled from 20 lakes were depleted in 13C compared with nearshore benthic macroinvertebrates. Nearshore macroinvertebrates had δ13C consistent with feeding on periphyton and/or terrestrial detritus. However, δ13C of offshore Chironomini, the dominant macroinvertebrate group, and oligochaetes, was more depleted than that of other offshore macroinvertebrates to a degree that could only be explained by a diet that included carbon derived from biogenic methane. Seston δ13C showed a small shift toward greater depletion in deeper lakes, but δ13C of Chironomini, oligochaetes, and predatory chironomids varied as a function of dissolved oxygen concentration (DO) at the sediment-water interface, which was generally lower in shallow lakes that were deep enough to stratify. In lakes with lower DO in bottom waters, the importance of methane-based carbon to Chironomini was greater. Experimental 15N enrichment of phytoplankton in small- and mid-sized arctic lakes resulted in limited 15N enrichment of most benthic macroinvertebrates, indicating that their productivity was not closely tied to pelagic production. It is likely that aerobic benthic metabolism of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) also is an important energy source for benthic macroinvertebrates in sediments because the link between benthic macroinvertebrate production and contemporary pelagic primary production was weak regardless of dependence on biogenic methane.},

The objective was to investigate the role of weather conditions and lake hydrology in regulating the development of Cyclotella and Fragilaria functional species groups. The different responses of the two species to the environmental variability and their reciprocal relationships were considered. Cyclotella showed a weak relationship with the selected environmental variables and its seasonal development was difficult to interpret, also in relation to its opportunistic behaviour. On the contrary, Fragilaria complex showed a prompt response to environmental variability and its seasonal development appeared to be mainly regulated by hydrological conditions, through nitrate nitrogen and, secondarily, by silica concentrations. Water temperature and thermal stability affected only Fragilaria species, while different nutrient requirements allowed Cyclotella species to grow under conditions of limited resources for Fragilaria. Since Lake Tovel has scarce internal nutrient reserves and its hydrology is strongly affected by precipitation both in winter and summer, diatom phenology seems to be indirectly regulated by weather conditions.},

In the Copepoda, one equation per suborder was computed, and suggestions for future refinements are made. In both groups, a fairly satisfactory agreement was found with literature data where these exist. In both groups, the egg and embryo weight proved to be considerable, relative to the weight of the adult female. In Rotatoria, 4 species could be dealt with in size-classes, and their weight increment per unit length was found to be lower than in the Cladocera and Copepoda. A large number of species were weighed as adults only. A conclusion applicable to the 3 groups is that, as a rule, limnetic species weigh relatively less than littoral, periphytic or benthic species. Even within a species, populations with a more pronounced limnetic way of life weigh less than populations of littoral nature.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: Heterotrophic bacteria are thought to be important components of aquatic ecosystems in several ways. These bacteria remineralize organic materials and convert some organic material into bacterial biomass. We examined data from 70 studies in which estimates of production of heterotrophic bacterial biomass (bacterial production) were reported for fresh- and saltwater ecosystems. In sedi- ments, bacterial production was sigdicantly (p $\backslash$textless0.001), positively correlated to sediment organic C content. Systems which had hlgh rates of benthic primary production (such as coral reefs) had rates of bacterial production greater than those predicted by sediment organic C content alone. In the photic zone of lakes and the ocean, bacterial production was significantly correlated with planktonic primary production, chlorophyll a, or numbers of planktonic bacteria. For all planktonic systems analysed, bacterial production ranged from 0.4 to 150 pg C 1-' d-' and averaged 20 \% (median 16.5 \%) of planktonic primary production. On an area1 basis for the entire water column, bacterial production ranged from 118 to 2439 mg m-2 d-' and averaged 30 \% (median 27 \%) of water column primary production. Heterotrophic bacterial production is, thus, a large component of total secondary production and is roughly twice as large as the production of macrozooplankton for a given level of primary production.

To determine critical N loads that elicited these commu- nity changes, we modeled wet nitrogen deposition rates for the period in which diatom shifts first occurred in each area using deposition data spanning from 1980 to 2007. We determined a critical load of 1.4 kg N ha−1 year−1 wet N deposition to elicit key nutrient enrichment effects on diatom communities in both the eastern Sierra Nevada and the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.},

  abstract = {Water samples from streams, brooks and storm sewer outfall pipes that collect storm waters across the Island of Montréal were analyzed for caffeine, carbamazepine and fecal coliforms. All samples contained various concentrations of these tracers, indicating a widespread sanitary contamination in urban environments. Fecal coliforms and caffeine levels ranged over several orders of magnitude with a modest correlation between caffeine and fecal coliforms (R 2 value of 0.558). An arbitrary threshold of 400ng caffeine L -1 allows us to identify samples with an elevated fecal contamination, as defined by more than 200 colony-forming units per 100mL (cfu 100mL -1) of fecal coliforms. Low caffeine levels were sporadically related to high fecal coliform counts. Lower levels of caffeine and fecal coliforms were observed in the brooks while the larger streams and storm water discharge points contained over ten times more. The carbamazepine data showed little or no apparent correlation to caffeine. These data suggest that this storm water collection system, located in a highly urbanized urban environment, is widely contaminated by domestic sewers as indicated by the ubiquitous presence of fecal contaminants as well as caffeine and carbamazepine. Caffeine concentrations were relatively well correlated to fecal coliforms, and could potentially be used as a chemical indicator of the level of contamination by sanitary sources. The carbamazepine data was not significantly correlated to fecal coliforms and of little use in this dataset. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Growth rates were measured by the incorporation of \$[\^3H]\$thymidine into DNA. Grazing rates on bacteria were determined with small cells produced by a mutant strain of Escherichia coli and made either fluorescent or radioactive to monitor feeding. Bacterial community turnover times calculated from either growth or grazing rates ranged from 1.5 to 16 d. On the basis of these data and results from 29 other studies, most bacterial communities appear to have turnover times substantially $\backslash$textgreater1 d.Our measurements of feeding rates on bacteria frequently exceeded estimates of growth. Limitations of precision and doubts about the accuracy of methods make attempts to balance measurements of bacterial growth and grazing with current techniques unrealistic. The fate of bacterial production depends on planktonic community structure. Flagellates were the primary consumers of bacteria in winter and fall. At other times, Daphnia galeata consumed most of the bacterial production. Ciliates and rotifers were never important bacterial grazers. In Upton Lake large populations of Daphnia effectively "break" the microbial loop and funnel bacterial production to higher consumers.},

  abstract = {1. A positive interspecific relationship between abundance and distribution is widely considered to be one of the most general patterns in ecology. However, the relationship appears to vary considerably across assemblages, from significant positive to significant negative correlations and all shades in between. 2. This variation has led to the suggestion that the abundance-distribution relationship has multiple forms, with the corollary that different patterns may inform about, or have different, causes. However, this variation has never been formally quantified, nor has it been determined whether the observed variation is indicative of sampling error in estimating a single effect or of real heterogeneity in such relationships. Here, we use the meta-analytical approach to assess variation in abundance-distribution relationships, and to test different hypotheses for it. 3. Analysis of 279 relationships found a mean effect size of 0.655, which was both highly significantly different from zero and indicative of a strong positive association between abundance and distribution. However, effect sizes were highly heterogeneous, supporting the contention that this relationship does indeed have multiple forms. 4. Most notably, relationships vary significantly in strength across realms, with the strongest in the marine and intertidal, intermediate relationships for terrestrial and parasitic assemblages, and the weakest relationships in freshwater systems. Effect sizes in all of the aquatic realms are homogeneous, suggesting that realm is an important source of the heterogeneity observed across all studies. We posit that this may be because the different spatial structure of the environment in each realm affects the opportunity for the dispersal of individuals between sites. 5. Some of the remaining heterogeneity in effect sizes for terrestrial assemblages could be explained by partitioning assemblages by habitat, scale, biogeographical region and taxon, but considerable heterogeneity in effect sizes for terrestrial and parasitic assemblages remained unexplained.},

  abstract = {Species enter and persist in local communities because of their ecological fit to local conditions, and recently, ecologists have moved from measuring diversity as species richness and evenness, to using measures that reflect species ecological differences. There are two principal approaches for quantifying species ecological differences: functional (trait-based) and phylogenetic pairwise distances between species. Both approaches have produced new ecological insights, yet at the same time methodological issues and assumptions limit them. Traits and phylogeny may provide different, and perhaps complementary, information about species' differences. To adequately test assembly hypotheses, a framework integrating the information provided by traits and phylogenies is required. We propose an intuitive measure for combining functional and phylogenetic pairwise distances, which provides a useful way to assess how functional and phylogenetic distances contribute to understanding patterns of community assembly. Here, we show that both traits and phylogeny inform community assembly patterns in alpine plant communities across an elevation gradient, because they represent complementary information. Differences in historical selection pressures have produced variation in the strength of the trait-phylogeny correlation, and as such, integrating traits and phylogeny can enhance the ability to detect assembly patterns across habitats or environmental gradients.},

  abstract = {Understanding concentrations and contributions of carbon dioxide (CO2) in aquatic ecosystems is an important part of a comprehensive global carbon budget. Current dogma suggests that world lakes are important emitters of CO2 to the atmosphere. We estimated the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (ρCO2) in 131 agriculturally eutrophic lakes over a 7 year sampling period. Values of ρCO2 in these lakes ranged from 0.1 to 40 392 μatm with a median of 322 μatm (n = 3049). In contrast to previous analyses of CO2 in lakes, 60\% of the eutrophic lake samples were undersaturated with CO2. Correlation analysis implied that nutrient-driven primary production, reflected by high oxygen concentrations, drives CO2 concentrations below atmospheric equilibrium. Multiple regression analysis showed several limnological and catchment characteristics that explained a statistically significant amount of variability in ρCO2 (R2 = 0.32). Important variables included chlorophyll a concentration and the ratio of total nitrogen to total phosphorus. Our estimated ρCO2 values were significantly (p $\backslash$textless 0.0001) lower than a previously published dataset of world lake ρCO2 values derived primarily from oligotrophic–mesotrophic lakes. High-nutrient lakes, especially those that are small and rich in oxygen from primary production, could act as net atmospheric CO2 uptake sites.},

  abstract = {Freshwater ecosystems are strongly influenced by both climate and the surrounding landscape, yet the specific pathways connecting climatic and landscape drivers to the functioning of lake ecosystems are poorly understood. Here we hypothesize that the links that exist between spatial patterns in climate and landscape properties and the spatial variation in lake carbon (C) cycling at regional scales are at least partly mediated by the movement of terrestrial dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the aquatic component of the landscape. We assembled a set of indicators of lake C cycling (bacterial respiration and production, chlorophyll a, production to respiration ratio and partial pressure of CO2 ), DOC concentration and composition, and landscape and climate characteristics for 239 temperate and boreal lakes spanning large environmental and geographic gradients across 7 regions. There were various degrees of spatial structure in climate and landscape features that were coherent with the regionally structured patterns observed in lake DOC and indicators of C cycling. These different regions aligned well, albeit non-linearly along a mean annual temperature gradient; whereas there was a considerable statistical effect of climate and landscape properties on lake C cycling, the direct effect was small and the overall effect was almost entirely overlapping with that of DOC concentration and composition. Our results suggest that key climatic and landscape signals are conveyed to lakes in part via the movement of terrestrial DOC to lakes, and that DOC acts both as a driver of lake C cycling and as a proxy for other external signals.

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Characterizing the diversity of microbial communities and understanding the environmental factors that influence community diversity are central tenets of microbial ecology. The development and application of cultivation independent molecular tools has allowed for rapid surveying of microbial community composition at unprecedented resolutions and frequencies. There is a growing need to discern robust patterns and relationships within these datasets which provide insight into microbial ecology. Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) analysis is commonly used for identifying the linear relationship between two species, or species and environmental factors. However, this approach may not be able to capture more complex interactions which occur in situ; thus, alternative analyses were explored. RESULTS: In this paper we introduced local similarity analysis (LSA), which is a technique that can identify more complex dependence associations among species as well as associations between species and environmental factors without requiring significant data reduction. To illustrate its capability of identifying relationships that may not otherwise be identified by PCC, we first applied LSA to simulated data. We then applied LSA to a marine microbial observatory dataset and identified unique, significant associations that were not detected by PCC analysis. LSA results, combined with results from PCC analysis were used to construct a theoretical ecological network which allows for easy visualization of the most significant associations. Biological implications of the significant associations detected by LSA were discussed. We also identified additional applications where LSA would be beneficial.

  abstract = {Deterministic theories in community ecology suggest that local, niche-based processes, such as environmental filtering, biotic interactions and interspecific trade-offs largely determine patterns of species diversity and composition. In contrast, more stochastic theories emphasize the importance of chance colonization, random extinction and ecological drift. The schisms between deterministic and stochastic perspectives, which date back to the earliest days of ecology, continue to fuel contemporary debates (e.g. niches versus neutrality). As illustrated by the pioneering studies of Robert H. MacArthur and co-workers, resolution to these debates requires consideration of how the importance of local processes changes across scales. Here, we develop a framework for disentangling the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes in generating site-to-site variation in species composition (β-diversity) along ecological gradients (disturbance, productivity and biotic interactions) and among biogeographic regions that differ in the size of the regional species pool. We illustrate how to discern the importance of deterministic processes using null-model approaches that explicitly account for local and regional factors that inherently create stochastic turnover. By embracing processes across scales, we can build a more synthetic framework for understanding how niches structure patterns of biodiversity in the face of stochastic processes that emerge from local and biogeographic factors.},

The lakes are located along an altitudinal gradient (1502-2309 m a.s.l.) in a small study area (35.5 km * 15.5 km) without glaciers. Longitude and latitude accounted for 21.4\% of the variation in water chemistry. Bedrock mineralogy explained 14.5\% of the variation. Vegetation accounted for 13.2\% and slope for 5.5\% of the variation in water chemistry. No correlations were found between exposure and water chemistry. Water chemistry appeared to be mainly determined by (1) chemical weathering of carbonate minerals and (2) in-lake productivity. Carbonate minerals were assumed to be present in all watersheds. Trees and shrubs enhanced chemical weathering. Concentrations of chemical parameters indicating physical weathering were high in lakes with large, steep catchments. Steep watersheds were correlated with enhanced nitrogen concentrations in the lakes. In-lake productivity obscured relationships between chemical parameters and catchment characteristics. Nonetheless, catchment characteristics explained 45\% of the variation in water chemistry, stressing their importance for water chemistry in mountain lakes.},

  abstract = {Aim We investigated the biogeographical patterns of phytoplankton, zooplankton and fish in freshwater ecosystems. We tested whether spatial distance or environmental heterogeneity act as potential factors controlling community composition. Location Northern and central Greece, eastern Mediterranean. Method Data on 310 phytoplankton, 72 zooplankton and 37 fish species were collected from seven freshwater systems. Species occurrence data were used to generate similarity matrices describing community composition. We performed Mantel tests to compare spatial patterns in community composition of phytoplankton, zooplankton and fish. Next, we examined the correlation between geographical distance and the degree of similarity in community composition. The analysis was repeated for different taxonomic, trophic and size-based groups of the microorganisms studied. We assessed different environmental variables (topographic and limnological) as predictors of community composition. Results Phytoplankton community composition showed a strong positive correlation with environmental heterogeneity but was not correlated with the geographical distance between systems. Zooplankton community composition was unrelated to geographical distance and was only weakly correlated with environmental variables. In contrast, fish community similarity decayed significantly with distance. We found no relationship along all pairwise comparisons of the compositional matrices of the three groups. The pairwise comparisons of the different taxonomic, trophic and size-based groups of the microorganism communities studied were in accordance with the results for the entire microorganism community. Main conclusions Our results support the proposition that the biogeography of microorganisms does not demonstrate a distance-decay pattern and further suggest that, in reality, the drivers of distribution depend on the specific community examined. In contrast, the biogeography of macroorganisms was affected by geographical distance. These differences reflect the dispersal abilities of the different organisms. The microorganisms exhibit passive dispersal through the air, with local environmental conditions structuring their community composition. On the other hand, for macroorganisms such as fish, the terrestrial environment could pose barriers to their dispersal; with fish structuring distinctive communities over greater distances. Overall, we suggest that the biogeography of freshwater phytoplankton and zooplankton reflects contemporary environmental conditions, while the biogeographical patterns for fish inhabiting the same systems are related to factors affecting their dispersal ability.},

We demonstrate that, after controlling for increases in taxonomic diversity, functional richness increased incrementally between each time interval with benthic taxa filling progressively more functional space, combined with a significant functional dissimilarity between periods. The modern benthic biota functionally overlaps with fossil biotas but some modern taxa, especially large predators, have new trait combinations that may allow more functions to be performed. From a methodological perspective, these results illustrate the benefits of using multidimensional instead of lower dimensional functional frameworks when studying changes in functional diversity over space and time.},

  abstract = {This paper uses theory and experiments to explore the effects of diversity on stability, productivity, and susceptibility to invasion. A model of resource competition predicts that increases in diversity cause com- munity stability to increase, but population stability to decrease. These opposite effects are, to a great extent, explained by how temporal variances in species abundances scale with mean abundance, and by the differential impact of this scaling on population vs. community stability. Community stability also depends on a negative covariance effect (competitive compensation) and on overyielding (ecosystem productivity increasing with diversity). A long-term study in Minnesota grasslands supports these predictions. Models of competition predict, and ﬁeld experiments conﬁrm, that greater plant diversity leads to greater primary productivity. This diversity–productivity relationship results both from the greater chance that a more productive species would be present at higher diversity (the sampling effect) and from the better ‘‘coverage” of habitat heterogeneity caused by the broader range of species traits in a more diverse community (the niche differentiation effect). Both effects cause more complete utilization of limiting resources at higher diversity, which increases resource retention, further increasing productivity. Finally, lower levels of available limiting resources at higher diversity are predicted to decrease the susceptibility of an ecosystem to invasion, supporting the diversity–invasibility hypothesis. This mechanism provides rules for community assembly and invasion resistance. In total, biodiversity should be added to species composition, disturbance, nutrient supply, and climate as a major controller of population and ecosystem dynamics and structure. By their increasingly great directional impacts on all of these controllers, humans are likely to cause major long-term changes in the functioning of ecosystems worldwide. A better understanding of these ecosystem changes is needed if ecologists are to provide society with the knowledge essential for wise management of the earth and its biological resources.},

  abstract = {The prediction that environmental fluctuations may destabilise populations and yet stabilise aggregate community properties has remained largely untested. We examined population and community stability under constant and fluctuating temperatures in simple planktonic assemblages of differing algal richness. Temperature dependent resource competition produced a highly asymmetric community structure where algal community biomass was dominated by one species. For a given level of species richness, temperature fluctuations induced lower community covariance and thus stabilised community biomass. However, increasing algal species richness increased the variability of population abundance and growth rates, as well as population and community variability. Consumer dynamics were directly destabilised by environmental fluctuations. These results confirm recent theoretical studies suggesting a stabilising effect of environmental fluctuations at the community level. However, they also support the theoretical prediction that increasing species richness may be of limited value for community stability, most especially in asymmetric communities, when competition directly affects population variability.},

  abstract = {The ecological impacts of modern global climate change are detectable in a wide variety of phenomena, ranging from shifts in species ranges to changes in community composition and human disease dynamics1–3. So far, however, little attention has been given to temporal changes in spatial synchrony—the coincident change in abundance or value across the landscape4—despite the importance of environmental synchrony as a driver of population trends and the central role of environmental variability in population rescue and extinction1,5,6. Here we demonstrate that across North America, spatial synchrony of a significant proportion of 49 widespread North American wintering bird species has increased over the past 50 years—the period encompassing particularly intense anthropogenic eects in climate—paralleling significant increases in spatial synchrony of mean maximum air temperature. These results suggest the potential for increased spatial synchrony in environmental factors to be aecting a wide range of ecological phenomena. These eects are likely to vary, but for North American wildlife species, increased spatial synchrony driven by environmental factorsmay be the basis for a previously unrecognized threat to their long-term persistence in the form of more synchronized population dynamics reducing the potential for demographic rescue among interacting subpopulations.},

  abstract = {The dictionary definition of a law is: "Generalized formulation based on a series of events or processes observed to recur regularly under certain conditions; a widely observable tendency". I argue that ecology has numerous laws in this sense of the word, in the form of widespread, repeatable patterns in nature, but hardly any laws that are universally true. Typically, in other words, ecological patterns and the laws, rules and mechanisms that underpin them are contingent on the organisms involved, and their environment. This contingency is manageable at a relatively simple level of ecological organisation (for example the population dynamics of single and small numbers of species), and re-emerges also in a manageable form in large sets of species, over large spatial scales, or over long time periods, in the form of detail-free statistical patterns - recently called 'macroecology'. The contingency becomes overwhelmingly complicated at intermediate scales, characteristic of community ecology, where there are a large number of case histories, and very little other than weak, fuzzy generalisations. These arguments are illustrated by focusing on examples of typical studies in community ecology, and by way of contrast, on the macroecological relationship that emerges between local species richness and the size of the regional pool of species. The emergent pattern illustrated by local vs regional richness plots is extremely simple, despite the vast number of contingent processes and interactions involved in its generation. To discover general patterns, laws and rules in nature, ecology may need to pay less attention to the 'middle ground' of community ecology, relying less on reductionism and experimental manipulation, but increasing research efforts into macroecology.

  abstract = {The use of functional traits to characterize community composition has been proposed as a more effective way to link community structure to ecosystem func-tioning. Organismal morphology, body stoichiometry, and physiology can be readily linked to large-scale ecosystem processes through functional traits that inform on interspecific and species-environment interactions; yet such effect traits are still poorly included in trait-based approaches. Given their key trophic position in aquatic ecosystems, individual zooplankton affect energy fluxes and elemental processing. We compiled a large database of zooplankton traits contributing to carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling and examined the effect of classification and habitat (marine vs. freshwater) on trait relationships. Res-piration and nutrient excretion rates followed mass-dependent scaling in both habitats, with exponents ranging from 0.70 to 0.90. Our analyses revealed surprising differences in allometry and respiration between habitats, with freshwater species having lower length-specific mass and three times higher mass-specific respiration rates. These differences in traits point to implications for ecological strategies as well as overall carbon storage and fluxes based on habitat type. Our synthesis quantifies multiple trait relationships and links organisms to ecosystem processes they influence, enabling a more complete integration of aquatic community ecology and biogeochemistry through the promising use of effect traits.},

  abstract = {Opposing gradients of light and nutrients can create a variety of niche opportunities for lake phytoplankton. Theory predicts that phytoplankton vertical distribution should be associated with these gradients as different taxa maximize resource access, while minimizing competitive interactions using niche partitioning. We examined the relationships between spatial overlap (SO) of four major phytoplankton spectral groups with key biogeochemical and morphometric environmental parameters across 52 north temperate lakes. SO decreased primarily with greater thermal stratification, and where more light was available and nutrient levels lower. When greater SO did occur in highly stratified lakes, taxonomic diversity was favored through increased species evenness, but not richness. Taxonomic richness, on the other hand, increased in lakes with greater light availability, coincident with low SO. Similarly, niche partitioning associated with greater functional diversity in the range of traits present in the communities was detected when SO was low in clear lakes. Overall, our results indicate that the ability of phytoplankton to spatially separate and utilize large portions of the water column is important for augmenting species and functional trait richness related to motility and resource acquisition. However, our study also suggests that community evenness is favored when phytoplankton distributions overlap in deep chlorophyll maxima associated with stratified lakes. Lakes},

  abstract = {Supply of anthropogenic nitrogen (N) to the biosphere has tripled since 1960; however, little is known of how in situ response to N fertilisation differs among phytoplankton, whether species response varies with the chemical form of N, or how interpretation of N effects is influenced by the method of analysis (microscopy, pigment biomarkers). To address these issues, we conducted two 21-day in situ mesocosm (3140 L) experiments to quantify the species- and genus-specific responses of phytoplankton to fertilisation of P-rich lake waters with ammonium (NH(4)(+)), nitrate (NO(3)(-)), and urea ([NH(2)](2)CO). Phytoplankton abundance was estimated using both microscopic enumeration of cell densities and high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) analysis of algal pigments. We found that total algal biomass increased 200\% and 350\% following fertilisation with NO(3)(-) and chemically-reduced N (NH(4)(+), urea), respectively, although 144 individual taxa exhibited distinctive responses to N, including compound-specific stimulation (Planktothrix agardhii and NH(4)(+)), increased biomass with chemically-reduced N alone (Scenedesmus spp., Coelastrum astroideum) and no response (Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, Ceratium hirundinella). Principle components analyses (PCA) captured 53.2-69.9\% of variation in experimental assemblages irrespective of the degree of taxonomic resolution of analysis. PCA of species-level data revealed that congeneric taxa exhibited common responses to fertilisation regimes (e.g., Microcystis aeruginosa, M. flos-aquae, M. botrys), whereas genera within the same division had widely divergent responses to added N (e.g., Anabaena, Planktothrix, Microcystis). Least-squares regression analysis demonstrated that changes in phytoplankton biomass determined by microscopy were correlated significantly (p$\backslash$textless0.005) with variations in HPLC-derived concentrations of biomarker pigments (r(2) = 0.13-0.64) from all major algal groups, although HPLC tended to underestimate the relative abundance of cyanobacteria. Together, these findings show that while fertilisation of P-rich lakes with N can increase algal biomass, there is substantial variation in responses of genera and divisions to specific chemical forms of added N.},

  abstract = {A recent increase in studies of β diversity has yielded a confusing array of concepts, measures and methods. Here, we provide a roadmap of the most widely used and ecologically relevant approaches for analysis through a series of mission statements. We distinguish two types of β diversity: directional turnover along a gradient vs. non-directional variation. Different measures emphasize different properties of ecological data. Such properties include the degree of emphasis on presence/absence vs. relative abundance information and the inclusion vs. exclusion of joint absences. Judicious use of multiple measures in concert can uncover the underlying nature of patterns in β diversity for a given dataset. A case study of Indonesian coral assemblages shows the utility of a multi-faceted approach. We advocate careful consideration of relevant questions, matched by appropriate analyses. The rigorous application of null models will also help to reveal potential processes driving observed patterns in β diversity.},

  abstract = {The relationship between species diversity and ecosystem functioning has been debated for decades, especially in relation to the "macroscopic" realm (higher plants and metazoans). Although there is emerging consensus that diversity enhances productivity and stability in communities of higher organisms; however, we still do not know whether these relationships apply also for communities of unicellular organisms, such as phytoplankton, which contribute approximately 50\% to the global primary production. We show here that phytoplankton resource use, and thus carbon fixation, is directly linked to the diversity of phytoplankton communities. Datasets from freshwater and brackish habitats show that diversity is the best predictor for resource use efficiency of phytoplankton communities across considerable environmental gradients. Furthermore, we show that the diversity requirement for stable ecosystem functioning scales with the nutrient level (total phosphorus), as evidenced by the opposing effects of diversity (negative) and resource level (positive) on the variability of both resource use and community composition. Our analyses of large-scale observational data are consistent with experimental and model studies demonstrating causal effects of microbial diversity on functional properties at the system level. Our findings point at potential linkages between eutrophication and pollution-mediated loss of phytoplankton diversity. Factors reducing phytoplankton diversity may have direct detrimental effects on the amount and predictability of aquatic primary production.},

  abstract = {There is ample evidence for ecological responses to recent climate change. Most studies to date have concentrated on the effects of climate change on individuals and species, with particular emphasis on the effects on phenology and physiology of organisms as well as changes in the distribution and range shifts of species. However, responses by individual species to climate change are not isolated; they are connected through interactions with others at the same or adjacent trophic levels. Also from this more complex perspective, recent case studies have emphasized evidence on the effects of climate change on biotic interactions and ecosystem services. This review highlights the ‘knowns’ but also ‘unknowns’ resulting from recent climate impact studies and reveals limitations of (linear) extrapolations from recent climate-induced responses of species to expected trends and magnitudes of future climate change. Hence, there is need not only to continue to focus on the impacts of climate change on the actors in ecological networks but also and more intensively to focus on the linkages between them, and to acknowledge that biotic interactions and feedback processes lead to highly complex, nonlinear and sometimes abrupt responses.},

In this field, neural network (NN) approaches could improve prediction performance handling in their inputs additional information. In this contribution we propose a jump NN prediction algorithm (horizon 30min) that exploits not only past CGM data but also ingested carbohydrates information. The NN is tuned on data of 10 type 1 diabetics and then assessed on 10 different subjects. Results show that predictions of glucose concentration are accurate and comparable to those obtained by a recently proposed NN approach (Zecchin et al. (2012) [26]) having higher structural and algorithmical complexity and requiring the patient to announce the meals. This strengthen the potential practical usefulness of the new jump NN approach.},

  shorttitle = {Predicting Water Quality at {{Santa Monica Beach}}},
  abstract = {Bathing beaches are monitored for fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) to protect swimmers from unsafe conditions. However, FIB assays take ∼24~h and water quality conditions can change dramatically in that time, so unsafe conditions cannot presently be identified in a timely manner. Statistical, data-driven predictive models use information on environmental conditions (i.e., rainfall, turbidity) to provide nowcasts of FIB concentrations. Their ability to predict real time FIB concentrations can make them more accurate at identifying unsafe conditions than the current method of using day or older FIB measurements. Predictive models are used in the Great Lakes, Hong Kong, and Scotland for beach management, but they are presently not used in California – the location of some of the world's most popular beaches. California beaches are unique as point source pollution has generally been mitigated, the summer bathing season receives little to no rainfall, and in situ measurements of turbidity and salinity are not readily available. These characteristics may make modeling FIB difficult, as many current FIB models rely heavily on rainfall or salinity. The current study investigates the potential for FIB models to predict water quality at a quintessential California Beach: Santa Monica Beach. This study compares the performance of five predictive models, multiple linear regression model, binary logistic regression model, partial least square regression model, artificial neural network, and classification tree, to predict concentrations of summertime fecal coliform and enterococci concentrations. Past measurements of bacterial concentration, storm drain condition, and tide level are found to be critical factors in the predictive models. The models perform better than the current beach management method. The classification tree models perform the best; for example they correctly predict 42\% of beach postings due to fecal coliform exceedances during model validation, as compared to 28\% by the current method. Artificial neural network is the second best model which minimizes the number of incorrect beach postings. The binary logistic regression model also gives promising results, comparable to classification tree, by adjusting the posting decision thresholds to maximize correct beach postings. This study indicates that predictive models hold promise as a beach management tool at Santa Monica Beach. However, there are opportunities to further refine predictive models.},

Using the data of temperature for the year 2008 to 12, researchers have measured Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Dissolved Oxygen (DO) along River Ganga. Both the algorithms, mentioned above, have been compared for their performance. The results show that the algorithm LM gives a better performance as compared to that of GDA.

  abstract = {Users of recreational waters may be exposed to elevated pathogen levels through various point/non-point sources. Typical daily notifications rely on microbial analysis of indicator organisms (e.g., Escherichia coli) that require 18, or more, hours to provide an adequate response. Modeling approaches, such as multivariate linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural networks (ANN), have been utilized to provide quick predictions of microbial concentrations for classification purposes, but generally suffer from high false negative rates. This study introduces the use of learning vector quantization (LVQ) – a direct classification approach – for comparison with MLR and ANN approaches and integrates input selection for model development with respect to primary and secondary water quality standards within the Charles River Basin (Massachusetts, USA) using meteorologic, hydrologic, and microbial explanatory variables. Integrating input selection into model development showed that discharge variables were the most important explanatory variables while antecedent rainfall and time since previous events were also important. With respect to classification, all three models adequately represented the non-violated samples ($>$90\%). The MLR approach had the highest false negative rates associated with classifying violated samples (41–62\% vs 13–43\% (ANN) and $<$16\% (LVQ)) when using five or more explanatory variables. The ANN performance was more similar to LVQ when a larger number of explanatory variables were utilized, but the ANN performance degraded toward MLR performance as explanatory variables were removed. Overall, the use of LVQ as a direct classifier provided the best overall classification ability with respect to violated/non-violated samples for both standards.},

  abstract = {The Optical Plankton Counter (OPC) has been used in a variety of environments since its introduction over decade ago, but its use in freshwater lakes has been limited by high densities of zooplankton and detritus. The newer Laser Optical Plankton Counter (LOPC) has several modifications from its predecessor, and the goal of this study was to examine whether it could be used to measure average size (µm equivalent spherical diameter, ESD), abundance (particles L−1), and biomass (µg dry weight L−1) of zooplankton in samples from 18 lakes in the Eastern Townships region of Quebec, Canada. The LOPC slightly overestimated the size of copepods, and consistently underestimated Daphnia by approximately 25\% ESD. Densities and biomass of net samples were very similar between the LOPC lab version and traditional microscope analyses suggesting that the LOPC can be reliably used to process preserved net samples. When the LOPC was towed in situ vertically in Lake Memphremagog, QC, Canada, estimated zooplankton abundances were ten times net sample values from the same water column, but similar abundances were found between the LOPC and pumped zooplankton samples at 2 m depth. These results indicate that the LOPC may be well suited for analyses of zooplankton abundance and biomass in productive freshwater lakes.},

  abstract = {Conversion of land to grow crops, raise animals, obtain timber, and build cities is one of the foundations of human civilization. While land use provides these essential ecosystem goods, it alters a range of other ecosystem functions, such as the provisioning of freshwater, regulation of climate and biogeochemical cycles, and maintenance of soil fertility. It also alters habitat for biological diversity. Balancing the inherent trade-offs between satisfying immediate human needs and maintaining other ecosystem functions requires quantitative knowledge about ecosystem responses to land use. These responses vary according to the type of land-use change and the ecological setting, and have local, short-term as well as global, long-term effects. Land-use decisions ultimately weigh the need to satisfy human demands and the unintended ecosystem responses based on societal values, but ecological knowledge can provide a basis for assessing the trade-offs.},

How can ecosystem service science be advanced to improve environmental decision-making at all scales? In this paper, I focus on three critical challenges in ecosystem service science that must be addressed to better understand, forecast, and manage ecosystem services. These include (1) understanding the role of nonlinearities, feedbacks, and legacies in the sustainable and resilient provision of ecosystem services; (2) understanding the role and interplay of ecological and social components in the provision of ecosystem services; and (3) employing stakeholder knowledge in co-designing research that better addresses decision-makers’ most pressing questions. Addressing these three challenges will advance ecosystem science and improve the use of ecosystem services in understanding and managing ecosystems.},

  abstract = {A towed optical plankton counter (OPC-1T) developed for automated counting and sizing of marine zooplankton was calibrated for use in fresh water. Zooplankton in lakes are generally smaller in size, more variable in shape, and more abundant than in oceans. Our objectives were to study the conditions and parameters for utilizing the OPC-1T in the relatively high zooplankton concentrations typical of fresh water while maintaining its full capability for measuring large and small organisms. By passing low concentrations of monospecific and mixed zooplankton assemblages through a laboratory OPC-lL, we first verified that the OPC can measure freshwater zooplankton size very accurately. We then compared simultaneously collected plankton net and OPC-1T field samples from Lakes Erie and Ontario in order to quantify the known measurement bias of the OPC caused by coincident effects in the high zooplankton concentrations (up to 212 liter−1) typical of these lakes. The correlation between plankton net and OPC-1T biomass estimates was greatest when each organism detected by the OPC was treated as an ellipsoid with major axis (a) equal to the recorded OPC diameter and minor axis equal to a/1.33. The effect of increasing zooplankton abundance, and hence coincident counts, on zooplankton size measurements of the OPC-1T was also quantified. Results suggest that with proper choice of beam length and calibration algorithms, lake zooplankton biomass, numerical concentrations, and size distributions can be accurately measured at concentrations up to 100 organisms liter−1.},

  abstract = {Skip to Next Section
A rational-based physical descriptive model (PDM) has been developed to predict the levels of Escherichia coli in water at a beach with dynamic conditions in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), Ontario, Canada. Bacteria loadings in the water were affected not only by multiple physical factors (precipitation, discharge, wind, etc.), but also by cumulative effects, intensity, duration and timing of storm events. These may not be linearly related to the observed variations in bacteria levels, and are unlikely to be properly represented by a widely used multiple linear regression model. In order to account for these complex relationships, the amounts of precipitation and nearby creek discharge, the impact of various time-related factors, lag time between events and sample collection, and threshold for different parameters were used in determining bacteria levels. This new comprehensive PDM approach improved the accuracy of the E. coli level predictions in the studied beach water compared to the previously developed statistical predictive and presently used geometric mean models. In spite of the complexity and dynamic conditions at the studied beach, the PDM achieved 75\% accuracy overall for the five case years examined.},

Resulting changes in phytoplankton community structure are expected to have a cascading effect on primary and export production, food web dynamics and the structure of the marine food web as well the biogeochemical cycling of carbon and bio-limiting elements in the sea. A review of current literature indicates cell size and elemental stoichiometry often respond predictably to abiotic conditions and follow biophysical rules that link environmental conditions to growth rates, and growth rates to food web interactions, and consequently to the biogeochemical cycling of elements. This suggests that cell size and elemental stoichiometry are promising ecophysiological traits for modelling and tracking changes in phytoplankton community structure in response to climate change. In turn, these changes are expected to have further impacts on phytoplankton community structure through as yet poorly understood secondary processes associated with trophic dynamics.},

  abstract = {For freshwater pelagic ecosystems, the biodiversity and cascading trophic interaction theories both predict that decreased piscivore populations will result in direct, short-term (a few years) increases in planktivore biomass, reductions in crustacean herbivore biomass, and increases in chlorophyll a concentration and phytoplankton biomass. An Alternate view is offered by the bottom-up:top-down theory, which predicts that in eutrophic lakes changes in piscivore biomasses will have strong impacts on planktivore numbers, weaker but observable impacts on zooplankton biomass, and little or no long-term effects on phytoplankton biomass. A partial winterkill at Lake St. George, Ontario, Canada allowed us to test these predictions. The data set comprised measures of: (1) piscivore and planktivore numbers, (2) zooplankton species composition, size structure, and biomass, (3) chlorophyll a concentration and Secchi depth, and (4) water chemistry from 1980 through 1986. Prior to the winterkill of 1981-1982, the piscivore population was high (1000-2000 piscivores/ha), the planktivore population was intermediate (8000-10 000 planktivores/ha), zooplankton biomass was intermediate (2400 @mg/L), and chlorophyll a concentration was high (5-12 @mg/L). In the year following the winterkill (1982), piscivore and planktivore numbers were low, and zooplankton biomass and chlorophyll a concentration were high. During the next 2 yr (1983-1984) the planktivore population increased rapidly to densities $\backslash$textgreater20 000 individuals/ha, zooplankton biomass density decreased to $\backslash$textless1600 @mg/L and chlorophyll a concentration decreased. During the final 2 yr of the study, piscivores recruited to near prewinterkill levels, planktivores were reduced to $\backslash$textless8000 individuals/ha, zooplankton biomass increased, and chlorophyll a concentration decreased. Over the 7 yr data set, we found a strong negative correlation between numbers of piscivores and planktivores, a weaker correlation between numbers of planktivores and zooplankton biomass, and no between-year correlation between zooplankton biomass and chlorophyll a concentration. There was, however, a positive correlation between total epilimnetic phosphorus and chlorophyll a concentration. These data are consistent with predictions made by the bottom-up:top-down model, and the implication is that at Lake St. George, the trophic cascade uncouples at the zooplankton @[ phytoplankton link. We speculate that this may be due to the combined effects of lake trophy and Daphnia species composition and size. CR - Copyright \&\#169; 1989 Ecological Society of America},

  abstract = {1. Large in situ enclosures were used to study the effects of experimentally induced cyanobacterial blooms on zooplankton communities. A combination of N and P was added to shallow (2 m) and deep enclosures (5 m) with the goal of reducing the TN : TP ratio to a low level (similar to5 : 1) to promote cyanobacterial growth. After nutrient additions, high biomass of cyanobacteria developed rapidly in shallow enclosures reaching levels only observed during bloom events in eutrophic lakes. 2. In the shallow enclosures, particulate phosphorus (PP) was on average 35\% higher in comparison with deep enclosures, suggesting that depth plays a key role in P uptake by algae. Phytoplankton communities in both deep and shallow enclosures were dominated by three cyanobacteria species -Aphanizomenon flos-aquae , Anabaena flos-aquae and Microcystis aeruginosa - which accounted for up to 70\% of total phytoplankton biomass. However, the absolute biomass of the three species was much higher in shallow enclosures, especially Aphanizomenon flos-aquae . The three cyanobacteria species responded in contrasting ways to nutrient manipulation because of their different physiology. 3. Standardised concentrations of the hepatotoxic microcystin-LR increased as a result of nutrient manipulations by a factor of four in the treated enclosures. Increased biomass of inedible and toxin producing cyanobacteria was associated with a decline in Daphnia pulicaria biomass caused by a reduction in the number of individuals with a body length of $\backslash$textgreater1 mm. Zooplankton biomass did not decline at moderate cyanobacteria biomass, but when cyanobacteria reached high biomass large cladocerans were reduced. 4. Our results demonstrate that zooplankton communities can be negatively affected by cyanobacterial blooms and therefore the potential to use herbivory to reduce algal blooms in such eutrophic lakes appears limited.},

The phytoplankton groups data matrix was submitted to a flexible linkage cluster analysis. The resulted six clusters of lakes are distributed along the northest to southwest geographic axis and are related to an ascending density gradient in total phytoplankton, chlorophytes, cyanophytes, and microflagellates. Factor analysis produced five derived environmental factors (hardness-alkalinity, lake depth and tranparency, dystrophy, lake size and salinity-sulphates loading), which explain 73\% of the total variance of the abiotic data matrix. Alkalinity-acidity gradient is the most important factor related to phytoplankton groups and species distribution. Most of the cyanophytes taxa and some chlorophytes are positively related to the hardness-alkalinity and the sulphates loading factors. The abundances of pyrrophytes increases in alkaline lakes subjected to great sulphates loading. Lake morphometry and trophy also influence the phytoplankton distribution. Deep and clear lakes in eastern Quebec are dominated by chrysophycean species. Few species are related to the dystrophy factor. Phytoplankton distribution and relationships with environmental factors in Quebec lakes are compared with studies of the phytoplankton composition in Newfoundland and Labrador lakes.},

Built upon the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model and the geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) model, this article develops a geographically and temporally weighted autoregressive model (GTWAR) to account for both nonstationary and auto-correlated effects simultaneously and formulates a two-stage least squares framework to estimate this model. Compared with the maximum likelihood estimation method, the proposed algorithm that does not require a prespecified distribution can effectively reduce the computation complexity. To demonstrate the efficacy of our model and algorithm, a case study on housing prices in the city of Shenzhen, China, from year 2004 to 2008 is carried out. The results demonstrate that there are substantial benefits in modeling both spatiotemporal nonstationarity and autocorrelation effects simultaneously on housing prices in terms of R2 and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The proposed model reduces the absolute errors by 31.8\% and 67.7\% relative to the GTWR and GWR models, respectively, in the Shenzhen data set. Moreover, the GTWAR model improves the goodness-of-fit of the ordinary least squares model and the GTWR model from 0.617 and 0.875 to 0.914 in terms of R2. The AIC test corroborates that the improvements made by GTWAR over the GWR and the GTWR models are statistically significant.},

  abstract = {1. Using data from 71, mainly shallow (an average mean depth of 3 m), Danish lakes with contrasting total phosphorus concentrations (summer mean 0.02-1.0 mg P L-1), we describe how species richness, biodiversity and trophic structure change along a total phosphorus (TP) gradient divided into five TP classes (class 1-5: $\backslash$textless 0.05, 0.05-0.1, 0.1-0.2, 0.2-0.4, $\backslash$textgreater 0.4 mg P L-1). 2. With increasing TP, a significant decline was observed in the species richness of zooplankton and submerged macrophytes, while for fish, phytoplankton and floating-leaved macrophytes, species richness was unimodally related to TP, all peaking at 0.1-0.4 mg P L-1. The Shannon-Wiener and the Hurlbert probability of inter-specific encounter (PIE) diversity indices showed significant unimodal relationships to TP for zooplankton, phytoplankton and fish. Mean depth also contributed positively to the relationship for rotifers, phytoplankton and fish. 3. At low nutrient concentrations, piscivorous fish (particularly perch, Perca fluviatilis) were abundant and the biomass ratio of piscivores to plankti-benthivorous cyprinids was high and the density of cyprinids low. Concurrently, the zooplankton was dominated by large-bodied forms and the biomass ratio of zooplankton to phytoplankton and the calculated grazing pressure on phytoplankton were high. Phytoplankton biomass was low and submerged macrophyte abundance high. 4. With increasing TP, a major shift occurred in trophic structure. Catches of cyprinids in multiple mesh size gill nets increased 10-fold from class 1 to class 5 and the weight ratio of piscivores to planktivores decreased from 0.6 in class 1 to 0.10-0.15 in classes 3-5. In addition, the mean body weight of dominant cyprinids (roach, Rutilus rutilus, and bream, Abramis brama) decreased two-threefold. Simultaneously, small cladocerans gradually became more important, and among copepods, a shift occurred from calanoid to cyclopoids. Mean body weight of cladocerans decreased from 5.1 mug in class 1 to 1.5 mug in class 5, and the biomass ratio of zooplankton to phytoplankton from 0.46 in class 1 to 0.08-0.15 in classes 3-5. Conversely, phytoplankton biomass and chlorophyll a increased 15-fold from class 1 to 5 and submerged macrophytes disappeared from most lakes. 5. The suggestion that fish have a significant structuring role in eutrophic lakes is supported by data from three lakes in which major changes in the abundance of planktivorous fish occurred following fish kill or fish manipulation. In these lakes, studied for 8 years, a reduction in planktivores resulted in a major increase in cladoceran mean size and in the biomass ratio of zooplankton to phytoplankton, while chlorophyll a declined substantially. In comparison, no significant changes were observed in 33 'control' lakes studied during the same period},

  abstract = {SUMMARY 1. In a comparative study, we examined the potential for fish to structure planktonic food webs in shallow mesotrophic to hypereutrophic Northeast Brazilian reservoirs. The food webs were dominated by three guilds of fish (facultative piscivores, generalist planktivores and omnivores), small herbivorous zooplankton and bloom-forming cyanobacteria, with few littoral macrophytes. 2. A principal component's analysis on data from 13 reservoirs (27 sampling dates in 1995-99) revealed that euphotic depth, the relative density of phytoplankton (i.e. the percentage of overall phytoplankton density) represented by cyanobacteria, and the relative biomass of fish (i.e. percentage of overall biomass) represented by omnivores and facultative piscivores, explained most of the variance in the data. Physico-chemical conditions, lake morphometry and rainfall were secondary factors. 3. Phytoplankton was related to fish guild structure. Chlorophyll concentration increased with total phosphorus and the relative biomass of omnivorous fish, decreased with the relative biomass of facultative piscivores, but was unrelated to the biomass and mean body size of herbivorous zooplankton. Chlorophyll concentration and the densities of filamentous and colonial cyanobacteria decreased with the ratio of the biomass of facultative piscivores to that of omnivores (FP : OM). 4. We propose two complementary mechanisms for the observed relationships between fish and phytoplankton. At a low biomass of facultative piscivores, juvenile zooplanktivorous fishes may induce a trophic cascade on zooplankton in the littoral zone. Regardless of piscivore biomass, piscivores and omnivores may regulate phytoplankton via multichannel omnivory because of the predominance of omnivorous or detritivorous foraging behaviour. 5. Manipulative experiments are needed to explore further whether, depending on priorities in the use of the reservoir, fisheries management could alter the FP : OM ratio either to enhance fish yields or to reduce phytoplankton densities and cyanobacterial blooms.},

  abstract = {Dispersal can limit the ranges of species and the diversity of communities. Despite its importance, little is known about its role in freshwater habitats and its relation to habitat type (lentic vs. lotic), especially for organisms with cryptic dispersal methods such as plankton. Poor dispersers are expected to show more clumped distributions or greater spatial autocorrelation (SA) in community composition than good dispersers. We examined patterns of SA across freshwater taxa with different dispersal modes (active vs. passive) and their association with habitat type (lake vs. stream) using 18 spatially explicit community composition data sets. We found significant relationships between SA and body size among taxa in lake habitats, but not in streams. However, the increase in SA with body size in lakes was driven entirely by fishes-organisms ranging in size from diatoms to macro-invertebrates showed equivalent levels of SA. These results support the idea that large organisms are less effective dispersers in aquatic environments, resulting in greater SA in community structure over broad scales. Streams may be effectively more connected than lakes as patterns of SA and body size were weaker in lotic habitats. Our data suggest that the critical threshold where greater body size increases dispersal limitation seems to come at the juncture between invertebrates and vertebrates rather than that between unicellular and multicellular organisms as has been previously suggested.},

The 'intermediate disturbance hypothesis' suggests that disturbance regimes generate predictable non-linear patterns in species richness. Evidence often contradicts intermediate disturbance hypothesis at small scales, and is generally lacking at large regional scales. Here, we present the largest extent study of human impacts on boreal plant biodiversity to date. Disturbance extent ranged from 0 to 100\% disturbed in vascular plant communities, varying from intact forest to agricultural fields, forestry cut blocks and oil sands. We show for the first time that across a broad region species richness peaked in communities with intermediate anthropogenic disturbance, as predicted by intermediate disturbance hypothesis, even when accounting for many environmental covariates. Intermediate disturbance hypothesis was consistently supported across trees, shrubs, forbs and grasses, with temporary and perpetual disturbances. However, only native species fit this pattern; exotic species richness increased linearly with disturbance.},

This producer-decomposer co-dependency is important in governing ecosystem processes, which implies that the impacts of declining biodiversity on ecosystem functioning should be strongly influenced by this process. Here we show, by simultaneously manipulating producer (green algal) and decomposer (heterotrophic bacterial) diversity in freshwater microcosms, that algal biomass production varies considerably among microcosms (0.0-0.67 mg ml(-1)), but that neither algal nor bacterial diversity by itself can explain this variation. Instead, production is a joint function of both algal and bacterial diversity. Furthermore, the range in algal production in microscosms in which bacterial diversity was manipulated was nearly double (1.82 times) that of microcosms in which bacterial diversity was not manipulated. Measures of organic carbon use by bacteria in these microcosms indicate that carbon usage is the mechanism responsible for these results. Because both producer and microbial diversity respond to disturbance and habitat modification, the main causes of biodiversity loss, these results suggest that ecosystem response to changing biodiversity is likely to be more complex than other studies have shown.},

Lakes receiving high N deposition had suspended organic matter (seston) with significantly elevated carbon:P and N:P ratios, indicative of amplified phytoplankton P limitation. This P limitation appeared to be transferred up the food chain, as the cosmopolitan seston-feeding zooplankton taxa Daphnia and Holopedium had significantly increased APA.

  abstract = {Time-series observations and a phytoplankton manipulation experiment were combined to test the hypothesis that phytoplankton succession effects changes in bacterial community composition. Three humic lakes were sampled weekly May-August and correlations between relative abundances of specific phytoplankton and bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in each time series were determined. To experimentally characterize the influence of phytoplankton, bacteria from each lake were incubated with phytoplankton from one of the three lakes or no phytoplankton. Following incubation, variation in bacterial community composition explained by phytoplankton treatment increased 65\%, while the variation explained by bacterial source decreased 64\%. Free-living bacteria explained, on average, over 60\% of the difference between phytoplankton and corresponding no-phytoplankton control treatments. Fourteen out of the 101 bacterial OTUs that exhibited positively correlated patterns of abundance with specific algal populations in time-series observations were enriched in mesocosms following incubation with phytoplankton, and one out of 59 negatively correlated bacterial OTUs was depleted in phytoplankton treatments. Bacterial genera enriched in mesocosms containing specific phytoplankton assemblages included Limnohabitans (clade betI-A), Bdellovibrio and Mitsuaria. These results suggest that effects of phytoplankton on certain bacterial populations, including bacteria tracking seasonal changes in algal-derived organic matter, result in correlations between algal and bacterial community dynamics.},

  abstract = {1. We sampled along a nearshore transect (10-m bathymetric contour) in Lake Michigan to determine diet, 24-h feeding periodicity, daily ration and food requirements of an invasive fish, the alewife, Alosa pseudoharengus, relative to zooplankton abundance and production. Our objective was to determine whether the alewife controls the abundance of two invasive, predatory cladocerans, Bythotrephes longimanus and Cercopagis pengoi. 2. Bosminidae was the most abundant prey taxon and Chydoridae, Leptodora, Chironom- idae and Bythotrephes were the least abundant. Neither Bythotrephes nor Cercopagis were important prey for small alewives ($\backslash$pounds100 mm). Bythotrephes was eaten by over 50\%of large alewives ($\backslash$textgreater100 mm) and accounted for 10–27\%of the diet weight. Cercopagis was eaten by about 30\% of the large alewives but only accounted 1\% of the diet weight. 3. Food weight in stomachs was highest early in the night for small alewives and lowest at night for large alewives. Chironomidae and large Chydoridae were the preferred prey of small alewives. Bythotrephes and large Chydoridae were the preferred prey for large alewives. 4. Food requirements of alewife were much less than production for most prey taxa, although the consumption of Bythotrephes greatly exceeded production on both dates. Alewives consumed only 3\% of Cercopagis production. High selectivity and food requirements of alewife for Bythotrephes, and low selectivity and food requirements for Cercopagis, probably explain the difference in abundance between these two invasive cladocerans at our nearshore site in Lake Michigan.},

  volume = {12},
  url = {http://plankt.oxfordjournals.org/content/12/5/891.abstract},
  abstract = {Protozoa are an important component of both the nano- and microplankton in marine and freshwater environments and are preyed upon by zooplankton, including suspension-feeding cope pods, some gelatinous zoopiankters and some first-feeding fish larvae. The clearance rates of suspension-feeding zooplankton for ciliates, in particular, are higher than for most phytoplankton. For at least some suspension-feeding zooplankton, protozoans are calculated to be quantitatively an important component of the diet during certain seasons. In laboratory studies, protozoan components in the diet appear to enhance growth and survival of certain life-history stages or enhance fecundity. These data suggest that protozoans are qualitatively as well as quantitatively important in the diets of marine zooplankton. Most studies of predation on Protozoa have focused on the euphotic zone in nearshore waters. Predation on Protozoa is expected, however, to be particularly important both quantitatively and qualitatively in marine environments and seasons in which primary production is dominated by cells $\backslash$textless5 μm in size, such as nearshore environments after the spring phytoplankton bloom, in oligotrophic waters, and in environments dominated by detritus-dominated food webs, such as the deep sea. In detritus-dominated food webs, Protozoa may be a source of essential nutrients and may thus facilitate utilization of bacterial and detrital carbon by metazoan plankton.},

  abstract = {The traditional likelihood-based test for differences in multivariate dispersions is known to be sensitive to nonnormality. It is also impossible to use when the number of variables exceeds the number of observations. Many biological and ecological data sets have many variables, are highly skewed, and are zero-inflated. The traditional test and even some more robust alternatives are also unreasonable in many contexts where measures of dispersion based on a non-Euclidean dissimilarity would be more appropriate. Distance-based tests of homogeneity of multivariate dispersions, which can be based on any dissimilarity measure of choice, are proposed here. They rely on the rotational invariance of either the multivariate centroid or the spatial median to obtain measures of spread using principal coordinate axes. The tests are straightforward multivariate extensions of Levene's test, with P-values obtained either using the traditional F-distribution or using permutation of either least-squares or LAD residuals. Examples illustrate the utility of the approach, including the analysis of stabilizing selection in sparrows, biodiversity of New Zealand fish assemblages, and the response of Indonesian reef corals to an El Niño. Monte Carlo simulations from the real data sets show that the distance-based tests are robust and powerful for relevant alternative hypotheses of real differences in spread.},

Exceeding critical loads for nitrogen and sulfur can cause ecosystem acidification, nitrogen saturation, and biotic community changes. Critical loads are widely used to set policy for resource protection in Europe and Canada, yet the United States has no similar national strategy.We believe that ecosystem science and resource protection policies are sufficiently advanced in the United States to establish critical loads for federal lands. Communication and interaction between federal area managers and scientists will ensure that critical loads are useful for assessing ecosystem conditions, influencing land management decisions, and informing the public about the status of natural resources. Critical loads may also be used to inform air pollution policy in the United States, regardless of whether critical loads are directly linked to air quality regulations and emissions reductions agreements, as they are in Europe.},

  abstract = {Niche and neutral processes drive community assembly and metacommunity dynamics, but their relative importance might vary with the spatial scale. The contribution of niche processes is generally expected to increase with increasing spatial extent at a higher rate than that of neutral processes. However, the extent to what community composition is limited by dispersal (usually considered a neutral process) over increasing spatial scales might depend on the dispersal capacity of composing species. To investigate the mechanisms underlying the distribution and diversity of species known to have great powers of dispersal (hundreds of kilometres), we analysed the relative importance of niche processes and dispersal limitation in determining beta-diversity patterns of aquatic plants and cladocerans over regional (up to 300 km) and continental (up to 3300 km) scales. Both taxonomic groups were surveyed in five different European regions and presented extremely high levels of beta-diversity, both within and among regions. High beta-diversity was primarily explained by species replacement (turnover) rather than differences in species richness (i.e. nestedness). Abiotic and biotic variables were the main drivers of community composition. Within some regions, small-scale connectivity and the spatial configuration of sampled communities explained a significant, though smaller, fraction of compositional variation, particularly for aquatic plants. At continental scale (among regions), a significant fraction of compositional variation was explained by a combination of spatial effects (exclusive contribution of regions) and regionally-structured environmental variables. Our results suggest that, although dispersal limitation might affect species composition in some regions, aquatic plant and cladoceran communities are not generally limited by dispersal at the regional scale (up to 300 km). Species sorting mediated by environmental variation might explain the high species turnover of aquatic plants and cladocerans at regional scale, while biogeographic processes enhanced by dispersal limitation among regions might determine the composition of regional biotas.},

  abstract = {The concept of β-diversity, defined as dissimilarity among communities, has been widely used to investigate biodiversity patterns and community assembly rules. However, in ecosystems with high taxonomic β-diversity, due to marked environmental gradients, the level of functional β-diversity among communities is largely overlooked while it may reveal processes shaping community structure. Here, decomposing biodiversity indices into α (local) and γ (regional) components, we estimated taxonomic and functional β-diversity among tropical estuarine fish communities, through space and time. We found extremely low functional β-diversity values among fish communities ($\backslash$textless1.5\%) despite high dissimilarity in species composition and species dominance. Additionally, in contrast to the high α and γ taxonomic diversities, α and γ functional diversities were very close to the minimal value. These patterns were caused by two dominant functional groups which maintained a similar functional structure over space and time, despite the strong dissimilarity in taxonomic structure along environmental gradients. Our findings suggest that taxonomic and functional β-diversity deserve to be quantified simultaneously since these two facets can show contrasting patterns and the differences can in turn shed light on community assembly rules.},

In the category of passive dispersers, large-bodied groups showed stronger spatial patterning than small-bodied groups suggesting an increasing impact of dispersal limitation with increasing body size. Metacommunities of organisms with the ability to fly (i.e. insect groups) showed a weaker imprint of dispersal limitation than passive dispersers with similar body size. In contrast, dispersal movements of vertebrate groups (fish and amphibians) seemed to be mainly confined to local connectivity patterns. Our results reveal that body size and dispersal mode are important drivers of metacommunity structure and these traits should therefore be considered when developing a predictive framework for metacommunity dynamics.},

The number of crustacean zooplankton species in a lake is significantly correlated with lake size, average rate of photosynthesis (parabolic function), and the number of lakes within 20 km. A multiple linear regression model, using these three independent variables, explains approximately 75\% of the variation in log species richness. Prediction of species richness was not enhanced by knowledge of lake depth, salinity, elevation, latitude, longitude, or distance to the nearest lake.

  volume = {64},
  isbn = {0012-9615},
  abstract = {In primary succession following deglaciation at Glacier Bay, Alaska, we tested the hypothesis that the major effect of initial nitrogen-fixing colonizers is to facilitate establishment of late-successional dominants and that other possible causes of successional change (e.g., life history factors governing seed rain and competitive interactions among species) need not be invoked. Environment changed dramatically through the first 200 yr of succession. Soil organic matter increased 10-fold in the upper mineral soil with corresponding increases in soil moisture, total nitrogen (N), and capacity to support plant growth and declines in bulk density, pH, and total phosphorus (P). Plant growth in pioneer soils tended to be simultaneously limited by both N and P, as well as by unknown factors (perhaps lack of mycorrhizae), whereas only P limited growth in older soils. Light availability to seedlings declined through succession. Early-successional species (Epilobium latifolium, Dryas drummondii) had smaller seeds, younger age at first reproduction, shorter life-span, and shorter height at maturity than did mid-successional (alder, Alnus sinuata) and late-successional species (sitka spruce, Picea sitchensis). Seed rain of alder and spruce was negligible in the pioneer stage, increased prior to the stage in which a species was dominant, and was greatest in the stage in which a species dominated. Vegetation in each successional stage inhibited germination and initial establishment of sown alder and spruce seeds (except a tendency of the ”black-crust” algal/microbial community in the pioneer stage to enhance survivorship). Removal of the surface litter layer generally enhanced germination and survivorship, particularly of alder. Comparisons of germination in the greenhouse and the field indicated that climatic or indirect vegetation effects (e.g., differential seed predation) and allelopathy also reduced germination and establishment in vegetated communities. Naturally occurring spruce seedlings grew most rapidly in the Dryas and alder stages and most slowly in the spruce stage. Similarly, growth of spruce seedlings transplanted into each successional stage was facilitated by the Dryas (nonsignificantly) and alder stages but inhibited by the spruce stage, relative to earlier successional stages. Facilitation of growth of natural and transplanted spruce seedlings by Dryas and alder stages was associated with higher N and P uptake and tissue nutrient concentrations, whereas nutrient uptake and concentration in spruce seedlings declined in the spruce stage. By contrast, transplanted alder seedlings grew rapidly and accumulated most nutrients in the pioneer stage and were strongly inhibited by subsequent stages. The facilitative effect of Dryas and alder comes primarily from inputs of organic matter and associated N. Addition of alder litter stimulated nutrient uptake and growth of transplanted spruce seedlings in the pioneer and Dryas stages, whereas shading had no effect on growth of spruce seedlings. Root trenching and planting of spruce near isolated alders indicated that, although the net effect of alder is facilitative, alder also inhibits growth of spruce seedlings through competition for soil resources. Strong root competition also occurs in the spruce stage. Alder competitively inhibits Dryas, primarily by shading but also through the physical and allelopathic effects of its litter. In general, both at Glacier Bay and elsewhere, life history traits determine the pattern of succession. Changes in competitive balance accompanying successional changes in environment provide the mechanism for changes in species dominance. Initial site conditions (and facilitation, where present) influence the rate of change and final state of community composition and productivity. We conclude that no single factor or mechanism fully accounts for primary succession at Glacier Bay.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY 1. Metacommunity ecology addresses the situation where sets of local communities are connected by the dispersal of a number of potentially interacting species. Aquatic systems (e.g. lentic versus lotic versus marine) differ from each other in connectivity and environmental heterogeneity, suggesting that metacommunity organisation also differs between major aquatic systems. Here, we review findings from observational field studies on metacommunity organisation in aquatic systems. 2. Species sorting (i.e. species are ‘filtered' by environmental factors and occur only at environmen- tally suitable sites) prevails in aquatic systems, particularly in streams and lakes, but the degree to which dispersal limitation interacts with such environmental control varies among different systems and spatial scales. For example, mainstem rivers and marine coastal systems may be strongly affected by ‘mass effects' (i.e. where high dispersal rates homogenise communities to some degree at neighbouring localities, irrespective of their abiotic and biotic environmental conditions), whereas isolated lakes and ponds may be structured by dispersal limitation (i.e. some species do not occur at otherwise-suitable localities simply because sites with potential colonists are too far away). Flow directionality in running waters also differs from water movements in other systems, and this differ- ence may also have effects on the role of dispersal in different aquatic systems. 3. Dispersal limitation typically increases with increasing spatial distance between sites, mass effects potentially increase in importance with decreasing distance between sites, and the dispersal ability of organisms may determine the spatial extents at which species sorting and dispersal processes are most important. 4. A better understanding of the relative roles of species sorting, mass effects and dispersal limitation in affecting aquatic metacommunities requires the following: (i) characterising dispersal rates more directly or adopting better proxies than have been used previously; (ii) considering the nature of aquatic networks; (iii) combining correlative and experimental approaches; (iv) exploring temporal aspects of metacommunity organisation and (v) applying past approaches and statistical methods innovatively for increasing our understanding of metacommunity organisation.},

  abstract = {We sampled 100 small lakes in Finland for bacterio-, phyto-, and zooplankton. The lakes were located in five drainage systems, 20 lakes for each system. We tested two main predictions: that the correlation between community similarity and geographical distance (spatial distance decay) is stronger at the across-drainage than at the within-drainage system scale, and that spatial distance decay is strongest for zooplankton and weakest for bacteria. We used a combination of direct ordination, multivariate statistical tests, and distance-based approaches to examine spatial patterns in our data. Our analyses confirmed both of our predictions. Spatial distance decay was scale-dependent\&semi; communities were overall weakly spatially structured within the drainage systems, yet distance decay was significant for all planktonic groups across drainage systems. Spatial distance decay was stronger for zooplankton, with higher slopes and shorter halving distances, than for phytoplankton and bacteria. These results provide evidence that distance decay of similarity is related to study scale, environment, and organism characteristics. Planktonic communities may be controlled by both dispersal-driven assembly and local ecological determinism, with the balance between these two forces depending on study scale.},

  abstract = {AbstractNutrients in the environment are coupled over broad timescales (days to seasons) when organisms add or withdraw multiple nutrients simultaneously and in ratios that are roughly constant. But at finer timescales (seconds to days), nutrients become decoupled if physiological traits such as nutrient storage limits, circadian rhythms, or enzyme kinetics cause one nutrient to be processed faster than another. To explore the interactions among these coupling and decoupling mechanisms, we introduce a model in which organisms process resources via uptake, excretion, growth, respiration, and mortality according to adjustable trait parameters. The model predicts that uptake can couple the input of one nutrient to the export of another in a ratio reflecting biological demand stoichiometry, but coupling occurs only when the input nutrient is limiting. Temporal nutrient coupling may, therefore, be a useful indicator of ecosystem limitation status. Fine-scale patterns of nutrient coupling are further modulated ...},

Residual variation around the fitted straight lines (corresponding to a theoretical steady state) was least for the large, oligotrophic Lake Superior and the North Pacific Gyre and greatest for eutrophic Saginaw Bay and shallow Lake Erie, suggesting progressive departure from steady-state conditions with increasing system productivity. The slopes of the normalized spectra decrease with increasing eutrophy, indicating that nannoplankton abundances are similar in all communities studied, but that associated zooplankton abundances vary by 2.5 orders of magnitude. Our results suggest that parameterization of particle-size models for prediction of potential fish production must be adjusted according to the size and productivity of the ecosystem, and that routine monitoring of communities by the normalized biomass spectrum could providd early warning of nutrient or toxic stress in aquatic ecosystems.},

However, despite previous attempts to clarify trait terminology and its application, selecting ecologically meaningful traits that mechanistically link levels of biological organization remains a challenge in aquatic ecology. Response traits can be used to capture community assembly processes along environmental gradients, while effect traits hold the potential to predict ecosystem functions. Although effect traits related to organismal physiology and body composition best allow for extrapolation from individuals to ecosystem processes, such traits are still rarely incorporated within plankton functional approaches or classifications for numerous reasons. Synthesizing current knowledge on effect traits in zooplankton, we call for a better implementation of such metrics as descriptors of community structure. We then capitalize on concepts of bioenergetics and ecosystem ecology to propose a hierarchical framework for zooplankton trait classification, identifying key traits fulfilling organismal functions and linking these to ecosystem processes likely to be influenced. Our framework provides insight regarding trait trade-offs, with implications for feedbacks to ecosystems, aiming to bridge the gap between plankton community ecology and aquatic biogeochemistry.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: Although tropical oceans are generally assumed to have low zooplankton biomass throughout the year, high copepod abundance coupled with fast growth rates can result in a significant amount of crustacean zooplankton production. Here, we use the crustacean moulting enzyme chitobiase to obtain routine estimates of community-level crustacean productivity over a 3-mo period in Guanabara Bay, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Chitobiase-based daily production to biomass ratios (P/B) and production rates were compared to values derived from more traditional global predictive models. We examined the abiotic and biotic factors most strongly influencing copepod biomass, daily P/B, and production rates. Mean copepod biomass was 24.0 mg C m-3 over the sampling period, while daily P/B ranged between 0.15 and 1.20. Copepod biomass was negatively related to dissolved oxygen and tidal amplitude, characteristic of the highly eutrophic waters from the inner bay. Mean crustacean productivity over our sampling period was 22.0 mg C m-3 d-1, varying more over monthly timescales compared to weekly or daily variations. No relationship was found between production rates and biomass, suggesting that biomass, alone, does not explain productivity in Guanabara Bay. Chitobiase-based daily P/B and crustacean production rates were almost always higher than production estimates from global models. Results from this study highlight the need for accurate estimates of crustacean production rates in order to fully understand trophic relationships given that biomass, alone, did not explain the short-term variability in crustacean production. Ultimately, this study reveals that small, fast-growing copepods can contribute just as much, if not more, energy to higher trophic levels in eutrophic tropical estuaries compared to temperate regions.},

  abstract = {Shallow lakes have become the archetypical example of ecosystems with alternative stable states. However, since the early conception of that theory, the image of ecosystem stability has been elaborated for shallow lakes far beyond the simple original model. After discussing how spatial heterogeneity and fluctuation of environmental conditions may affect the stability of lakes, we review work demonstrating that the critical nutrient level for lakes to become turbid is higher for smaller lakes, and seems likely to be affected by climatic change too. We then show how the image of just two contrasting states has been elaborated. Different groups of primary producers may dominate shallow lakes, and such states dominated by a particular group may often represent alternative stable states. In tropical lakes, or small stagnant temperate waters, freefloating plants may represent an alternative stable state. Temperate shallow lakes may be dominated alternatively by charophytes, submerged angiosperms, green algae or cyanobacteria. The change of the lake communities along a gradient of eutrophication may therefore be seen as a continuum in which gradual species replacements are interrupted at critical points by more dramatic shifts to a contrasting alternative regime dominated by different species. The originally identified shift between a clear and a turbid state remains one of the more dramatic examples, but is surely not the only discontinuity that can be observed in the response of these ecosystems to environmental change.},

  abstract = {By coupling synoptic data from a basin-wide assessment of streamwater chemistry with network-based geostatistical analysis, we show that spatial processes differentially affect biogeochemical condition and pattern across a headwater stream network. We analyzed a high-resolution dataset consisting of 664 water samples collected every 100 m throughout 32 tributaries in an entire fifth-order stream network. These samples were analyzed for an exhaustive suite of chemical constituents. The fine grain and broad extent of this study design allowed us to quantify spatial patterns over a range of scales by using empirical semivariograms that explicitly incorporated network topology. Here, we show that spatial structure, as determined by the characteristic shape of the semivariograms, differed both among chemical constituents and by spatial relationship (flow-connected, flow-unconnected, or Euclidean). Spatial structure was apparent at either a single scale or at multiple nested scales, suggesting separate processes operating simultaneously within the stream network and surrounding terrestrial landscape. Expected patterns of spatial dependence for flow-connected relationships (e.g., increasing homogeneity with downstream distance) occurred for some chemical constituents (e.g., dissolved organic carbon, sulfate, and aluminum) but not for others (e.g., nitrate, sodium). By comparing semivariograms for the different chemical constituents and spatial relationships, we were able to separate effects on streamwater chemistry of (i) fine-scale versus broad-scale processes and (ii) in-stream processes versus landscape controls. These findings provide insight on the hierarchical scaling of local, longitudinal, and landscape processes that drive biogeochemical patterns in stream networks.},

This has raised questions about the causes and the likelihood of further increases. A number of drivers have been proposed, including temperature, hydrology, as well as SO42 - and Cl (-) deposition. The data reported so far, however, have been insufficient to define the relative importance of different drivers in landscapes where they interact. Thirty-five years of monthly measurements of absorbance and chemical oxygen demand ( COD), two common proxies for OM, from 28 large Scandinavian catchments provide an unprecedented opportunity to resolve the importance of hypothesized drivers. For 21 of the catchments, there are 18 years of total organic carbon (TOC) measurements as well. Despite the heterogeneity of the catchments with regards to climate, size and land use, there is a high degree of synchronicity in OM across the entire region. Rivers go from widespread trends of decreasing OM to increasing trends and back again three times in the 35-year record. This synchronicity in decadal scale oscillations and long-term trends suggest a common set of dominant OM drivers in these landscapes. Here, we use regression models to test the importance of different potential drivers. We show that flow and SO42 - together can predict most of the interannual variability in OM proxies, up to 88\% for absorbance, up to 78\% for COD. Two other candidate drivers, air temperature and Cl (-) , add little explanatory value. Declines in anthropogenic SO42 - since the mid-1970s are thus related to the observed OM increases in Scandinavia, but, in contrast to many recent studies, flow emerges as an even more important driver of OM variability. Stabilizing SO42 - levels also mean that hydrology is likely to be the major driver of future variability and trends in OM.},

In addition, mesocosm experiments were performed in the three lakes to examine the effects of nutrient enrichment and zooplankton biomass and size on algal nutrient status. In situ indicators of N and P availability were inversely related in magnitude and transitions between N and P limitation were abrupt. Physiological bioassay results did not indicate simultaneous limitation by N and P. However, limited responses to single-nutrient enrichment and pronounced responses to simultaneous N and P addition in enrichment experiments suggested that potential limitation by the secondary nutrient was usually in close proximity to limitation by the primary nutrient. Transitions between N and P limitation closely accompanied major shifts in the zooplankton community. The importance of the zooplankton community in regulating the relative degree of N or P limitation was confirmed by the mesocosm experiments, which demonstrated that transitions between algal N or P limitation could be induced by manipulations of zooplankton biomass or size. This result supports a hier-archical view of the function of planktonic systems, in which biotic interactions structure the response of the algal community to a given nutrient load.},

Ecological stoichiometry has recently provided a new potential mechanism linking resource (light and nutrient) supply gradients to grazer performance via elemental food-quality mechanisms. More specifically, it predicts that light and nutrient gradients should determine the relative dominance of P-rich taxa, such as Daphnia, in grazer assemblages. We tested this hypothesis in pond mesocosms (cattle tanks) by creating gradients of resource supply and predation risk, to which we added diverse assemblages of algal producer and zooplankton grazer species. We then characterized the end-point composition of grazer assemblages and quantity and elemental food quality of edible algae. We found that somatically P-rich Daphnia only dominated grazer assemblages in high-nutrient, no-predator treatments. In these ecosystems, P sequestered in producers exceeded a critical concentration.

  abstract = {Classification and regression trees are ideally suited for the analysis of complex ecological data. For such data, we require flexible and robust analytical methods, which can deal with nonlinear relationships, high-order interactions, and missing values. Despite such difficulties, the methods should be simple to understand and give easily interpretable results. Trees explain variation of a single response variable by repeatedly splitting the data into more homogeneous groups, using combinations of explanatory variables that may be categorical and/or numeric. Each group is characterized by a typical value of the response variable, the number of observations in the group, and the values of the explanatory variables that define it. The tree is represented graphically, and this aids exploration and understanding. Trees can be used for interactive exploration and for description and prediction of patterns and processes. Advantages of trees include: (1) the flexibility to handle a broad range of response types, including numeric, categorical, ratings, and survival data; (2) invariance to monotonic transformations of the explanatory variables, (3) ease and robustness of construction; (4) ease of interpretation; and (5) the ability to handle missing values in both response and explanatory variables. Thus, trees complement or represent an alternative to many traditional statistical techniques, including multiple regression, analysis of variance, logistic regression, log-linear models, linear discriminant analysis, and survival models. We use classification and regression trees to analyze survey data from the Australian central Great Barrier Reef, comprising abundances of soft coral taxa (Cnidaria: Octocorallia) and physical and spatial environmental information. Regression tree analyses showed that dense aggregations, typically formed by three taxa, were restricted to distinct habitat types, each of which was defined by combinations of 3-4 environmental variables. The habitat definitions were consistent with known experimental findings on the nutrition of these tars. When used separately, physical and spatial variables were similarly strong predictors of abundances and lost little in comparison with their joint use. The spatial variables are thus effective surrogates for the physical variables in this extensive reef complex, where information on the physical environment is often not available. Finally, we compare the use of regression trees and linear models for the analysis of these data and show how Linear models fail to find patterns uncovered by the trees.},

  abstract = {What are the relative contribution of temperature and solar irradiance as types of energy deliveries for species richness at the ecosystem level? In order to reveal this question in lake ecosystems, we assessed zooplankton species richness in 1891 Norwegian lakes covering a wide range in latitude, altitude, and lake area. Geographical variables could largely be replaced by temperature-related variables, e.g. annual monthly maximum temperature or growth season. Multivariate analysis (PCA) revealed that not only maximum monthly temperature, but also energy input in terms of solar radiation were closely associated with species richness. This was confirmed by stepwise, linear regression analysis in which lake area was also found to be significant. We tested the predictive power of the "metabolic scaling laws" for species richness by regressing Ln of species richness over the inverse of the air temperature (in Kelvin), corrected for the activation energy (eV) as predicted by the Boltzmann constant. A significant, negative slope of 0.78 for ln richness over temperature, given as 1/kT, was found, thus slightly higher than the range of slopes predicted from the scaling law (0.60-0.70). Temperature basically constrained the upper bound of species number, but it was only a modest predictor of actual richness. Both PCA-analysis and linear regression models left a large unexplained variance probably due to lake-specific properties such as catchment influence, lake productivity, food-web structure, immigration constraints or more stochastic effects. © 2007 The Authors.},

In several aquatic environments in Brazil the introduction of Oreochromis niloticus (tilapia) was followed by changes in water quality. Yet, because of its rapid and easy growth, this fish has been used in many aquaculture programmes around the country. 2. To measure the effects of tilapia on the phytoplankton community and on water conditions of a large tropical reservoir in south-eastern Brazil (Furnas Reservoir), we performed two in situ experiments using three controls (no fish) and three tilapia enclosures (high fish density). Abiotic and biotic parameters were measured at 4†day intervals for 28†days. 3. Fish presence increased nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) availability (ammonium 260 and 70\% mean increase 2013 first and second experiment; and total phosphorus 540 and 270\% mean increase) via excretion. Nutrient recycling by fish can thus be significant in the nutrient dynamics of the reservoir. The higher chlorophyll a concentration in the experimental fish tanks (86 and 34†03BCg†L22121, first and second experiment, respectively) was the result of a positive bottom-up effect on the phytoplankton community (approximately 2†03BCg†L22121 in the reservoir and control tank). 4. Because tilapia feed selectively on large algae (mainly cyanobacteria and diatoms), several small-sized or mucilaginous colonial chlorophyceans proliferated at the end of the experiments. Thus, the trophic cascade revealed strong influences on algal composition as well as on biomass. 5. Tilapia can contribute to the eutrophication of a waterbody by both top-down and bottom-up forces. In particular, by supplying considerable amount of nutrients it promotes the increase of fast growing algae. Tilapia must be used cautiously in aquaculture to avoid unexpected environmental degradation.},

However, estimates of biomass production rates (BP) for entire crustacean zooplankton communities are lacking, because conventional field methodology is difficult to apply at the community level. We measured community-level BP using the chitobiase method in an area extending from the west coast of British Columbia, Canada, across the Bering and Chukchi Seas and into the western Beaufort Sea (July 2008, October 2008, and July 2009). Our objective was to measure zooplankton productivity on a scale that was sufficiently broad to allow us to assess the sensitivity of the method to a wide variety of conditions. Overall, variations in temperature and phytoplankton biomass explained 67\% of the observed variation in BP. Crustacean zooplankton BP values estimated during July 2008 and 2009 on the Bering Sea shelf were comparable to estimates from one of the very few community-level estimates for this expansive region. Our estimates of the average individual growth rate (daily P/B) for crustacean zooplankton were also comparable to model predictions and direct estimates for the biomass-dominant copepod species in the northern Gulf of Alaska. These observations suggest that the chitobiase method can be used to measure useful estimates of community-level crustacean zooplankton productivity under a broad range of conditions and also provides the basis for further refinement of the technique. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

In the former, percentage wetland cover in the watershed was positively correlated with total phosphorus (TP, r(2) = 0.78, primarily bog), total nitrogen (TN, r(2) = 0.50), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC, r(2) = 0.74) concentrations. Rich fens appeared to sequester both TP and TN. In upland-dominated lakes, the ratio of catchment area to lake volume (CA/LV) was the strongest watershed correlate of TP concentration (r(2) = 0.56), whereas most limnetic nitrogen and DOC were generated in situ. Colour concentration, being highest in wetland lakes, was correlated with the ratio of isotopically defined effective drainage basin area to lake volume (eDBA/LV, r(2) = 0.63). Drainage basin slope was only weakly associated with water quality, likely because of low topographic relief (less than or equal to 11\%).

  abstract = {Existing general definitions of beta diversity often produce a beta with a hidden dependence on alpha. Such a beta cannot be used to compare regions that differ in alpha diversity. To avoid misinterpretation, existing definitions of alpha and beta must be replaced by a definition that partitions diversity into independent alpha and beta components. Such a unique definition is derived here. When these new alpha and beta components are transformed into their numbers equivalents (effective numbers of elements), Whittaker's multiplicative law (alpha x beta = gamma) is necessarily true for all indices. The new beta gives the effective number of distinct communities. The most popular similarity and overlap measures of ecology (Jaccard, Sorensen, Horn, and Morisita-Horn indices) are monotonic transformations of the new beta diversity. Shannon measures follow deductively from this formalism and do not need to be borrowed from information theory; they are shown to be the only standard diversity measures which can be decomposed into meaningful independent alpha and beta components when community weights are unequal.},

  doi = {10.1890/08-0588.1},
  abstract = {The distribution of the diversity and abundance of life on Earth is thought to be shaped by the patterns of plant growth (net primary production, NPP) in the oceans and on land. The well-known latitudinal gradient of species diversity reaches its maximum in tropical rain forests, which are considered to be the most productive ecosystems on the planet. However, this high tropical productivity on land is the opposite of the well-documented distribution of marine productivity, which is greatest in the high-latitude oceans around the poles. This paradox can be resolved by a reevaluation of the terrestrial productivity gradient. Compilations of direct measurements of forest NPP show that annual NPP in tropical forests is no different than annual NPP in temperate forests, contrary to recent syntheses and to the output of global vegetation models. Other properties of forest ecosystems, such as basal area of trees, wood density, and the ratio of wood to leaf production, as well as animal properties such as body size, population density, and reproductive rates, support the conclusion that ecologically relevant terrestrial productivity is actually highest in the temperate latitudes, reaching a maximum between 30° and 50° before declining toward the poles. This ?reversal? of the latitudinal productivity gradient, if substantiated by a systematic global sampling effort, will necessitate a major reevaluation of ecological and evolutionary theory, as well as conservation strategies and international development policies.},

We present a hierarchical Bayesian regression model for predicting transient fecal indicator bacteria contamination episodes in urban waterways. Canals, creeks, and rivers of the New York City harbor system are used to examine the model. The model configuration facilitates the hierarchical structure of the underlying system with weekly observations nested within sampling sites, which in turn were nested inside of the harbor network. Models are compared using cross-validation and a variety of Bayesian and classical model fit statistics. The uncertainty of predicted enterococci concentration values is reflected by sampling from the posterior predictive distribution. Issuing predictions with the uncertainty reasonably reflected allows a water manager or a monitoring agency to issue warnings that better reflect the underlying risk of exposure. A model using only antecedent meteorological conditions is shown to correctly classify safe and unsafe levels of enterococci with good accuracy. The hierarchical Bayesian regression approach is most valuable where transient fecal indicator bacteria contamination is problematic and drainage network data are scarce.},

  abstract = {Efforts to improve public health protection in recreational swimming waters have focused on obtaining real-time estimates of water quality. Current monitoring techniques rely on the time-intensive culturing of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) from water samples, but rapidly changing FIB concentrations result in management errors that lead to the public being exposed to high FIB concentrations (type II error) or beaches being closed despite acceptable water quality (type I error). Empirical predictive models may provide a rapid solution, but their effectiveness at improving health protection has not been adequately assessed. We sought to determine if emerging monitoring approaches could effectively reduce risk of illness exposure by minimizing management errors. We examined four monitoring approaches (inactive, current protocol, a single predictive model for all beaches, and individual models for each beach) with increasing refinement at 14 Chicago beaches using historical monitoring and hydrometeorological data and compared management outcomes using different standards for decision-making. Predictability (R2) of FIB concentration improved with model refinement at all beaches but one. Predictive models did not always reduce the number of management errors and therefore the overall illness burden. Use of a Chicago-specific single-sample standard-rather than the default 235 E. coli CFU/100 ml widely used-together with predictive modeling resulted in the greatest number of open beach days without any increase in public health risk. These results emphasize that emerging monitoring approaches such as empirical models are not equally applicable at all beaches, and combining monitoring approaches may expand beach access. © 2010.},

  abstract = {The relationships between water quality and the phytoplankton community within Lake Loskop were studied during the late summer and autumn of 2008 to evaluate the impacts of acid mine drainage and high nutrient concentrations. The higher concentrations of metal ions and sulphate had adverse effects on certain phytoplankton species in the inflowing riverine zone of Lake Loskop, in comparison to the reference site in the lacustrine zone of the lake, which was dominated by the larger and slower growing late summer species of Coelastrum reticulum N??geli, Straurastrum anatinum Meyen ex Ralfs and Ceratium hirundinella M??ller. The high nutrient concentrations (nitrogen: 17mgl-1 and orthophosphate: 0.7mgl-1) during the mid-summer peak of the rainy season were associated with the development of a bloom of the cyanobacterium Microcystis. Water quality data associated with the development of the Microcystis bloom suggest that the aquatic system of Lake Loskop has now entered an alternate, hypertrophic regime. This change overshadowed the adverse effects of high concentrations of heavy metal ions and low pH. Throughout this study, the reference site in the lacustrine zone of Lake Loskop had lower concentrations of metal ions and sulphate, and higher pH values. The response of phytoplankton bioassays on integrated water samples from the different sampling sites did provide potential answers to the reasons for the absence of the algal group Chlorophyceae in the phytoplankton community structure in the riverine zone of the lake. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

The composition of the microplankton community showed a dominance by bacterioplankton, followed by mixotrophic sind potentially mixotrophic phytoplankton, heterotrophic nanoflagellates, and autotrophic phytoplankton. Bacterioplankton was P limited for most of the ice-free period, and phytoplankton biomass and primary production mostly increased after enrichment with N, but not with P. The dominant group of phytoplankton, the mixotrophic flagellates, was stimulated by N bur not by P, while obligate autotrophic species were stimulated only by P+N. It is suggested that N limitation in mixotrophic species is induced by grazing of P-rich bacteria. The results suggest that primary productivity in humic lakes can be limited by N and indicate the importance of phagocytosis as a means of nutrition in phytoplankton. A link is suggested to exist in humic lakes whereby heterotrophic bacterioplankton, which use humic compounds as their principal energy source, can transfer energy and nutrients to potentially autotrophic organisms, with subsequent utilization by other components of the food web.},

Diatom assemblage composition in Slipper Lake recorded a marked change in the top 5.0 cm (ca. mid-1800s) of the core with a clear shift to a more planktonic diatom assemblage characterized by higher percentages of the Cyclotella stelligera complex. Possible causative factors, such as recent anthropogenic acidification, nutrient enrichment, or atmospheric deposition of contaminants, do not appear sufficient to explain these species changes. Instead, these recent assemblage shifts are consistent with limnological changes occurring with climatic warming, such as a shorter duration of ice cover, a longer growing season, and/ or stronger thermal stratification patterns.},

Unlike the standard GWR model, GTWR integrates both temporal and spatial information in the weighting matrices to capture spatial and temporal heterogeneity. The GTWR design embodies a local weighting scheme wherein GWR and temporally weighted regression (TWR) become special cases of GTWR. In order to test its improved performance, GTWR was compared with global ordinary least squares, TWR, and GWR in terms of goodness-of-fit and other statistical measures using a case study of residential housing sales in the city of Calgary, Canada, from 2002 to 2004. The results showed that there were substantial benefits in modeling both spatial and temporal nonstationarity simultaneously. In the test sample, the TWR, GWR, and GTWR models, respectively, reduced absolute errors by 3.5\%, 31.5\%, and 46.4\% relative to a global ordinary least squares model. More impressively, the GTWR model demonstrated a better goodness-of-fit (0.9282) than the TWR model (0.7794) and the GWR model (0.8897). McNamara's test supported the hypothesis that the improvements made by GTWR over the TWR and GWR models are statistically significant for the sample data.},

  abstract = {We examined the determinants of zooplankton and phytoplankton metacommunity structure across 25 boreal wetland ponds. Our objective was to determine whether plankton metacommunities exhibit spatial structuring, thus suggesting neutrality, or are merely structured by local environmental features, suggesting that they are under niche-based control. According to Redundancy Analysis (RDA), zooplankton community structure was primarily controlled by concentration of major ions and geographical location of the pond, while phytoplankton community structure was primarily controlled by major ion concentration, nitrogen concentration, and geographical location. According to variance partitioning in RDA, zooplankton community structure was attributed more to pure spatial position of the pond (16.7\% of variance) than to pure environmental factors (4.7\% of variance). For phytoplankton, community composition was controlled by both spatial and environmental factors, although the effect of pure spatial position (11.1\% of variance) on phytoplankton community structure was somewhat weaker than for zooplankton. For zooplankton, community similarity was negatively (P $\backslash$textless 0.01) related to both geographical and environmental distance. For phytoplankton, community similarity was negatively (P $\backslash$textless 0.05) related only to geographical distance. Finally, cluster analyses showed that zooplankton and phytoplankton communities formed highly dissimilar groupings, thus implying low community concordance. Our results suggest that both zooplankton and phytoplankton comply with both neutral and niche-based models. Our results further imply that even across small spatial scales and even for small organisms such as plankton, communities might be strongly spatially structured. The finding that spatial configuration was even more important than local environmental factors in controlling zooplankton community composition suggests that zooplankton may be dispersal-limited within relatively small spatial scales or that zooplankton metacommunities might be related to mass effects. Résumé : Nous avons examiné les déterminants de la structure des métacommunautés de zooplancton et de phytoplancton dans 25 étangs boréaux. Notre objectif était de déterminer si les métacommunautés de plancton démontraient une structure spatiale suggérant la neutralité ou si elles étaient simplement structurées par les facteurs locaux de l'environnement suggérant alors un contrôle basé sur les niches. Selon une analyse de redondance, la structure des communautés de zooplancton était principalement contrôlée par la concentration des ions les plus importants et par l'emplacement géographique. Dans le cas de la structure des communautés de phytoplancton, le contrôle provenait de la concentration des principaux ions et de l'azote ainsi que de l'emplacement géographique de l'étang. Une répartition de la variance dans l'analyse de redondance a indiqué que la structure des communautés de zooplancton était plus attribuable à la position seule de l'étang (16,7 \% de la variance) qu'aux seuls facteurs de l'environnement (4,7 \% de la variance). Dans le cas du phytoplancton, la composition de la communauté était contrôlée à la fois par les facteurs spatiaux et environnementaux mais la position seule de l'étang (11,1 \% de la variance) avait un effet un peu plus faible que dans le cas du zooplancton. La similarité des communautés de zooplancton était reliée négativement (P $\backslash$textless 0,01) à la fois à la distance géographique et à celle environnementale, alors que pour le phytoplancton, la similarité des communautés était reliée négativement (P $\backslash$textless 0,05) seulement à la distance géographique. Finalement, des analyses typologiques ont démontré que les communautés de zooplancton et de phytoplancton formaient des regroupements très dissimilaires ce qui implique une faible concordance des communautés. Nos résultats démontrent que le zooplancton et le phytoplancton se conforment tous les deux à la fois au modèle neutre et à celui basé sur les niches. Nos résultats démontrent de plus que même à de petites échelles spatiales et pour un organisme aussi petit que le plancton, les communautés peuvent être fortement structurée au niveau spatial. Le fait que la configuration spatiale était plus importante que les facteurs locaux de l'environnement dans le contrôle de la composition des communautés de zooplancton démontre que ce dernier est peut être limité dans sa dispersion à des échelles spatiales relativement petites ou que les métacommunautés de zooplancton peuvent être reliées à des effets de masse.

  abstract = {Campbell et al. (Deep Sea Research II 48 (2001) 531) have shown that there was a localized starvation event affecting Calanus finmarchicus on the southern flank of Georges Bank in April 1997. Growth and molting rates of this dominant copepod were reduced. We have used the morphology of tooth development in field-collected samples to show that this starvation affected animals living continuously in the field, as well as those in Campbell et al.'s experimental tanks. Assuming a point of reserve saturation (PRS) response of Calanus to food limitation, and correspondence between PRS and advance from the postmolt jaw facies, the proportion of individuals with postmolt jaws should increase in all copepodite stages under starvation. Individuals that have developed past PRS should molt to the next stage, acquiring postmolt facies. Thus, the fraction of postmolt jaws should increase, while the fraction of jaws in later phases should decrease. This was observed for a drifter-marked station over five days. Numerical simulations of jaw phase distributions expected under full nutrition, and both total and patchy starvation were generated from individual-based models of development. Proportions of copepodites in postmolt phase do not increase with full nutrition. A simulation of a total starvation event showed a marked increase in postmolts during food limitation, but the increase was more extreme than the field data. A modification of the starvation simulation, representing patchy feeding conditions, matched the level of increase of postmolt individuals in all stages that was observed in the field samples. ?? 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

MST is used to assess recreational water quality and associated human health risk, and total maximum daily load allocations. Many methods rely on signature molecules (markers) such as DNA sequences of host-associated microorganisms. Human sewage pollution is among the greatest concerns for human health due to (1) the known risk of exposure to human waste and (2) the public and regulatory will to reduce sewage pollution; however, methods to identify animal sources are receiving increasing attention as our understanding of zoonotic disease potential improves. Here, we review the performance of MST methods in initial reports and field studies, with particular emphasis on quantitative PCR (qPCR). Relationships among human-associated MST markers, fecal indicator bacteria, pathogens, and human health outcomes are presented along with recommendations for future research. An integrated understanding of the advantages and drawbacks of the many MST methods targeting human sources advanced over the past several decades will benefit managers, regulators, researchers, and other users of this rapidly growing area of environmental microbiology.},

  abstract = {The implementation of a conservation program since the early 1980s resulted in a reduction in phosphorus concentrations in Lake Geneva. However, in the 1990s, phytoplankton biomass increased again, almost reaching the high values recorded during the period of greatest P loading. The structural changes in the phytoplankton of Lake Geneva over the past 25 yr have been analyzed using a recently developed statistical method based on hierarchical clustering and Bayesian probabilities. This method has been used to identify phytoplankton assemblages and to map annual and interannual successional patterns simultaneously. Characteristic species were identified for each cluster after calculation of their relative species fidelity and specificity indices. Six distinct phytoplankton assemblages were identified, and although the way species are organized into communities remains unclear, the seasonal patterns of succession are consistent with the C-S-R adaptive strategies and are characteristic of temperate lakes. This pattern broadly recurred over the years, but was markedly influenced by both human activity and regional climatic changes: The warmer winters and springs recorded in Europe since 1988 led to an earlier clear-water phase. In the 1990s, the earlier and deeper depletion of dissolved inorganic phosphorus led to colonization in the summer by large species tolerant of low light levels and that could develop deeper in the water column, where phosphorus was still abundant. Their size made them less vulnerable to grazing losses, which favors their accumulation and lead to an unexpected high biomass in recent years},

Heterocystohms cyanobacteria were dominant at low totai P (TP) (∼0.25 rng P∼L-') and nonheteroeystous cyanobacteria at intermediate TP (0.25-0.8 mg POL-'), while chlorophytes often were dominant at high TP ($\backslash$textgreaterI mg P.L-'). In contrast with many earlier findings, heterocystous cyanobacteria were not dominant at low total N (TN):TP or low inorganic N concentrations; chlorophytes were dominant at extremely high pH, and the shift from cyanobacterial to chlorophyte dominance could not be explained by a change in the photic none to mixing zone ratio. We suggest that chlorophyte dominance in hypertrophic shallow lakes is attributable to continuous input of nutrients and carbon from the sediment and external sources. This renders the fast-growing chlorophytes a superior competitor compared with the relatively slow-growing cyanobacteria, even when inorganic nutrient concentration is low and pH high. New predictive models relat- ing phytoplankton dominance to TP in shallow lakes were developed, as former models failed to predict our observations satisfactorily.},

  abstract = {We examined the utility of delta O-18(2) measurements in estimating gross primary production (P), community respiration (R), and net metabolism (P : R) through diel cycles in a productive agricultural stream located in the midwestern U. S. A. Large diel swings in O-2 (+/- 200 mu mol L-1) were accompanied by large diel variation in delta O-18(2) (+/- 10\%(0)). Simultaneous gas transfer measurements and laboratory- derived isotopic fractionation factors for O-2 during respiration (alpha(r)) were used in conjunction with the diel monitoring of O2 and delta O-18(2) to calculate P, R, and P : R using three independent isotope- based methods. These estimates were compared to each other and against the traditional "open-channel diel O-2-change” technique that lacked delta O-18(2). A principal advantage of the delta O-18(2) measurements was quantification of diel variation in R, which increased by up to 30\% during the day, and the diel pattern in R was variable and not necessarily predictable from assumed temperature effects on R. The P, R, and P : R estimates calculated using the isotope- based approaches showed high sensitivity to the assumed system fractionation factor (alpha r). The optimum modeled ar values (0.986 - 0.989) were roughly consistent with the laboratory-derived values, but larger (i. e., less fractionation) than ar values typically reported for enzyme- limited respiration in open water environments. Because of large diel variation in O-2, P : R could not be estimated by directly applying the typical steady- state solution to the O2 and O-18-O-2 mass balance equations in the absence of gas transfer data. Instead, our results indicate that a modified steady- state solution (the daily mean value approach) could be used with time- averaged O-2 and delta O-18(2) measurements to calculate P : R independent of gas transfer. This approach was applicable under specifically defined, net heterotrophic conditions. The diel cycle of increasing daytime R and decreasing nighttime R was only partially explained by temperature variation, but could be consistent with the diel production/ consumption of labile dissolved organic carbon from photosynthesis.},

  abstract = {We analyzed data from 81 shallow European lakes, which were sampled with standardized methods, for combined effects of climatic, physical, and chemical features of food-web interactions, with a specific focus on zooplankton biomass and community structure. Multiple-regression analysis showed that total phosphorus (TP) generally was the most important predictor of zooplankton biomass and community structure. Climate was the next most important predictor and acted mainly through its effect on pelagic zooplankton taxa. Benthic and plant-associated taxa (typically almost half the total zooplankton biomass) were, however, affected mainly by rnacrophyte coverage. Neither climate nor TP affected the relation between small and large taxa, and we found only a weak trend with increasing TP of increasing mean crustacean body mass. Dividing the data set into three climate zones revealed a pronounced difference in response to lake productivity between cold lakes, with long periods of ice cover, and the two warmer lake types. These "ice" lakes differed from the others with respect to the effect of TP on chlorophyll a, the zooplankton: chlorophyll a ratio, the chlorophyll a: TP ratio, and the proportion of cyclopoids in the copepod community. Our data suggest that bottom-up forces, such as nutrient concentration, are the most important predictors of zooplankton biomass. In addition, climate contributes significantly-possibly by affecting top-down regulation by fish-and may interact with productivity in determining the zooplankton standing biomass and community composition. Hence, the present study suggests that food-web dynamics are closely linked to climatic features.},

Here, we test the efficacy of a trait-based model in predicting gross primary production (GPP) in lake ecosystems. We incorporated data from .1000 United States lakes along with laboratory-generated phytoplankton trait data to build a trait- based model of GPP and then validated the model with GPP observations from a separate set of globally distributed lakes.

Therefore a classification system has to be established in each European country, in order to assess their water bodies. For the German coastal waters of the Baltic Sea, a classification system for phytoplankton based on the abundance of Cyanophyceae and Chlorophyceae was already presented. This system has been successfully adapted in regions with low salinity levels ($\backslash$textless10 PSU). With this study, we present the results trying to develop a classification system for our German region of the Baltic Sea characterized by higher salinity ($\backslash$textgreater15 PSU). All present taxonomic groups, most common species and functional groups were tested. It could be shown that all tested correlations to nitrogen concentration as eutrophication descriptor are relatively week. Nevertheless, the biovolume of Cryptophyceae was found to be the most reliable phytoplankton composition indicator, which could serve as future assessment criterion. Furthermore, as proposed by some experts, the use of maximal dissolved winter nitrogen concentration as eutrophication descriptor might be an advantage over using the total nitrogen concentrations in summer.},

  abstract = {Over the past several decades, a rapidly expanding field of research known as biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has begun to quantify how the world's biological diversity can, as an independent variable, control ecological processes that are both essential for, and fundamental to, the functioning of ecosystems. Research in this area has often been justified on grounds that (1) loss of biological diversity ranks among the most pronounced changes to the global environment and that (2) reductions in diversity, and corresponding changes in species composition, could alter important services that ecosystems provide to humanity (e.g., food production, pest/disease control, water purification). Here we review over two decades of experiments that have examined how species richness of primary producers influences the suite of ecological processes that are controlled by plants and algae in terrestrial, marine, and freshwater ecosystems. Using formal meta-analyses, we assess the balance of evidence for eight fundamental questions and corresponding hypotheses about the functional role of producer diversity in ecosystems. These include questions about how primary producer diversity influences the efficiency of resource use and biomass production in ecosystems, how primary producer diversity influences the transfer and recycling of biomass to other trophic groups in a food web, and the number of species and spatial /temporal scales at which diversity effects are most apparent. After summarizing the balance of evidence and stating our own confidence in the conclusions, we outline several new questions that must now be addressed if this field is going to evolve into a predictive science that can help conserve and manage ecological processes in ecosystems.},

However, making time for such efforts is difficult, particularly for early-career graduate students who are often focused on an independent and self-driven research program. Here, we introduce the concept of the Research Derby, a collaborative and semi-competitive workshop where teams are given 24 hours to complete a research project. This ‘pressure-cooker' environment is designed to give scientists a fun and short-term opportunity to conduct research outside their primary field, promote skills exchange within the research group, and ultimately produce high-quality scientific publications. In this manuscript we outline the goals of the Research Derby, explain how to set up such an event, and recount our experiences running a Derby within our research group at Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, B.C., Canada. We argue that Research Derbies have the potential to achieve creative and collaborative high-impact science, and are a fun and productive research activity.},

  abstract = {AimOur aims were to determine whether cross-taxon congruence of species composition patterns varies across regions and human disturbance levels and to infer whether these patterns relate to the size of the regional species pool and the sorting of species along a gradient of human disturbance. LocationAlberta's Boreal and Grassland Natural Regions, Canada. MethodWe compiled presence-absence data of four biological groups (birds, vascular plants, bryophytes and mites) from low and high disturbance sites in upland habitat. The cross-taxon congruence across ecoregion and disturbance levels was analysed using Mantel and Procrustes tests. We applied resampling without replacement to generate confidence intervals to test for significant differences in strength of congruency between disturbance levels and ecoregions. We performed indicator species analysis to highlight how the species-level response to high and low disturbance influences the pattern in community-level cross-taxon congruence. ResultsCross-taxon congruence was stronger when all sites were considered than when high and low disturbance sites were considered separately. Congruency was relatively stronger in high than low disturbance sites in the Boreal ecoregion, but the pattern was reversed in the Grassland ecoregion. More species were indicators of undisturbed habitat than of highly disturbed habitats for all biological groups except for birds. Overall, biological groups that were poorly represented in a region and/or with few characteristic indicator species showed weak congruence in those sites. Main conclusionsWe conclude that a longer disturbance gradient can promote cross-taxon congruence by increasing the species pool characteristic of low or high disturbance levels. Moreover, regional context can influence (or even reverse) the relative strength of cross-taxon congruence in high and low disturbance sites, which may explain the inconsistent strength of cross-taxon congruence along the disturbance gradient. To use biodiversity surrogates across biogeographical regions, it is therefore important to account for the regional and disturbance-level dependence of cross-taxon congruence.},

We reviewed experiments, observations, and syntheses on the effects of species richness on six ecosystem services: forage, timber, fisheries, climate regulation, agricultural pest control, and water quality. Establishing a direct link from biodiversity to ecosystem-service provision has often been precluded by limited data (i.e., the amount, consistency, or generality of the data) and a mismatch between the variables measured and the final ecosystem service that is relevant to stakeholders. We suggest that encompassing syntheses and a network of interdisciplinary experiments under realistic conditions could fill these gaps and could inform the outcomes of alternative management and policy scenarios within IPBES.},

The long-term effects of the insecticide chlorpyrifos on the invertebrate community and the dissolved oxygen (DO)-pH-alkalinity- conductivity syndrome, in outdoor experimental ditches, are used as example data. The new method, which we have named the principal response curve method (PRC), is based on redundancy analysis (RDA), adjusted for overall changes in community response over time, as observed in control test systems. This allows the method to focus on the time-dependent treatment effects. The principal component is plotted against time, yielding a principal response curve of the community for each treatment. The PRC method distills the complexity of time-dependent, community-level effects of pollutants into a graphic form that can be appreciated more readily than the results of other currently available multivariate techniques. The PRC method also enables a quantitative interpretation of effects towards the species level.},

  abstract = {We conducted laboratory experiments with 85 assembled phytoplankton communities composed of species from four predefined functional groups (chlorophytes, diatoms, cyanobacteria, chrysophytes) to distinguish the relative importance of species diversity from functional group diversity on carbon uptake. We separated the observed diversity effects on carbon uptake into those caused by species with particularly important traits (selection effect) and those caused by positive interactions among species (e.g., complementary resource use or facilitation [complementarity effect]). Additionally, we measured the composition of photosynthetically active pigments and light absorbance in communities and monocultures, and related them to species and functional diversity effects on carbon accrual. Biodiversity effects were weak or even absent in pure cyanobacterial and diatom communities compared to strong effects in chlorophytes. Complementarity effects and light absorbance increased as functional (i.e., phylogenetic) diversity increased. There was a positive correlation between complementarity effects on carbon accrual and light absorbance. These findings support hypotheses regarding biodiversity-productivity relationships in phytoplankton communities based on niche separation along spectral light gradients.},

Recent techniques, such as general dominance weights and relative weights, have shown great promise for guiding evaluations of predictor importance. Nevertheless, questions remain regarding how one should investigate relative importance in the presence of a multidimensional criterion variable. The purpose of this article is to extend understanding of relative importance statistics to multivariate designs. The authors review the concept of relative importance and discuss a new procedure for calculating estimates of importance in the presence of multiple correlated criteria. Finally, a published correlation matrix is reanalyzed and a Monte Carlo simulation conducted to compare the new procedure with another technique for estimating importance. Unlike canonical solutions, which are often uninterpretable, the proposed multivariate relative weights provide an intuitive index regarding the relationship between predictors and criteria. Implications for organizational researchers are discussed., (C) 2008 by the American Psychological Association},

  abstract = {Abstract Hypothesis-testing methods for multivariate data are needed to make rigorous probability statements about the effects of factors and their interactions in experiments. Analysis of variance is particularly powerful for the analysis of univariate data. The traditional multivariate analogues, however, are too stringent in their assumptions for most ecological multivariate data sets. Non-parametric methods, based on permutation tests, are preferable. This paper describes a new non-parametric method for multivariate analysis of variance, after McArdle and Anderson (in press). It is given here, with several applications in ecology, to provide an alternative and perhaps more intuitive formulation for ANOVA (based on sums of squared distances) to complement the description provided by McArdle and Anderson (in press) for the analysis of any linear model. It is an improvement on previous non-parametric methods because it allows a direct additive partitioning of variation for complex models. It does this while maintaining the flexibility and lack of formal assumptions of other non-parametric methods. The test-statistic is a multivariate analogue to Fisher's F-ratio and is calculated directly from any symmetric distance or dissimilarity matrix. P-values are then obtained using permutations. Some examples of the method are given for tests involving several factors, including factorial and hierarchical (nested) designs and tests of interactions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Daily bathing water quality predictions are posted on electronic variable message signs at 10 beach locations networked to a central communication centre and updates are simultaneously made on the SEPA website, phone and text message service. Antecedent rainfall and subsequent river flow can significantly increase the concentrations of faecal indicator organisms in bathing waters. The SEPA signage prediction tool, an Excel spreadsheet based model, was developed and used to set site-specific criteria for rainfall and river flow to predict bathing water quality based on historical data. Real-time predictions against the current EU Bathing Water Directive were correct or precautionary on 99\% of days and correct for 82\% of compliance samples during 2007, and 81\% of compliance samples during the 2008 season. The revised 2006 Directive sets out more stringent bathing water quality standards which require increased model performance. New predictive models are now being trailed using decision tree statistical software and are intended to replace the existing prediction tool by 2012.},

One reason for the belated adoption of informatics approaches in ecology is the breadth of ecologically pertinent data (from genes to the biosphere) and its highly heterogeneous nature. The variety of formats, logical structures, and sampling methods in ecology create significant challenges. Cultural barriers further impede progress, especially for the creation and adoption of data standards. Here we describe informatics frameworks for ecology, from subject-specific data warehouses, to generic data collections that use detailed metadata descriptions and formal ontologies to catalog and cross-reference information. Combining these approaches with automated data integration techniques and scientific workflow systems will maximize the value of data and open new frontiers for research in ecology.},

  abstract = {Traditional expectations for how widely and how often freshwater invertebrates disperse differ from empirical data. Freshwater invertebrates have been characterized as frequent, widespread dispersers, particularly those that are transported passively. Our review finds that this characterization may describe the potential for dispersal in some taxa, but it is not an accurate generalization for actual dispersal rates. High variance among habitats and taxonomic groups is a consistent theme. Advances in population genetics may help resolve these issues, but underlying assumptions should be carefully tested. Further, even unbiased estimates of gene flow may not equate with individual movement, because not all dispersers survive and reproduce. Some freshwater invertebrates may exist in classic Levins metapopulations. However, other species fit into a broader metapopulation definition, where temporal dispersal via diapause is functionally equivalent to spatial dispersal. In the latter case, local extinctions and rescue effects may be rare or absent. Finally, limited dispersal rates in many taxa suggest that theories of freshwater community assembly and structure can be made more robust by integrating dispersal and local processes as joint, contingent regulators. Recent research on freshwater invertebrate dispersal has substantially advanced our basic and applied understanding of freshwaters, as well as evolutionary ecology in general.},

  abstract = {We studied production by three key pelagic energy mobilizer communities, phytoplankton (PP), heterotrophic bacteria (HB), and methanotrophic bacteria (MOB), in five boreal lakes of varying size and concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Production by PP was responsible for most ($\backslash$textgreater55\%) of the total pelagic energy mobilization in all five lakes. Production by HB and PP estimated for the whole water column during the ice-free period were positively correlated, but with the exception of the clearest and most eutrophic lake PP apparently could not support the total carbon demand of bacteria. However, the DOC concentration did not explain the variability of heterotrophic bacterial production (HBP) within or between the lakes. Thus, our results provide circumstantial evidence for the “priming effect” whereby labile organic matter from autochthonous production enhances decomposition of allochthonous DOC. However, HBP was only 10–23\% of the total pelagic energy mobilization in the lakes, suggesting that only a minor fraction of allochthonous DOC became available for higher trophic levels. High MOB activity was detected in the water columns of the stratified lakes when the molar ratio of CH4:O2 varied between 0.5 and 12. In the small stratified lakes (area $\backslash$textless 0.01 km2), MOB production contributed 13–52\% of the total pelagic energy mobilization, being greatest during the autumn mixing period. Our results indicate that in small stratified lakes (area $\backslash$textless 0.01 km2) bacteria, especially MOB, are potentially quantitatively important supplementary food resources for zooplankton. However, in larger lakes primary producers are the most important ($\backslash$textgreater70\%) potential food source for zooplankton.},

Patterns in smaller dimictic lakes and variation through time (hourly and monthly) are less well established. Currents, chlorophyll and predators are all factors that vary through time, potentially affecting zooplankton distribution in stratified waters. Along an intermediate-length transect extending from the littoral area to the pelagic zone, we measured crustacean zooplankton size and horizontal position, as well as chlorophyll, currents and predators. We also assessed zooplankton vertical distribution patterns near each transect end. Horizontally, zooplankton were highly spatially structured in high summer, especially during daytime, when they preferred pelagic regions. A regular diel vertical migration pattern in early summer was replaced by an inverse one, suggesting a strong role for predation. Chlorophyll and zooplankton were inversely related, indicating a strong grazing interaction. The weakest signal was detected for currents. Results indicate that there can be large spatial fluctuations in zooplankton abundance apparently driven by predation. Furthermore, zooplankton distribution correlates inversely with chlorophyll only in the absence of a higher trophic level. We expect that plankton distribution in many small dimictic lakes will similarly be dominated by biotic factors, indicating that spatial variation should be taken into account when trophic interactions are considered.},

  abstract = {Recently, community ecologists are focusing on the relative importance of local environmental factors and proxies to dispersal limitation to explain spatial variation in community structure. Albeit less explored, temporal processes may also be important in explaining species composition variation in metacommunities occupying dynamic systems. We aimed to evaluate the relative role of environmental, spatial and temporal variables on the metacommunity structure of different organism groups in the Upper Paraná River floodplain (Brazil). We used data on macrophytes, fish, benthic macroinvertebrates, zooplankton, periphyton, and phytoplankton collected in up to 36 habitats during a total of eight sampling campaigns over two years. According to variation partitioning results, the importance of predictors varied among biological groups. Spatial predictors were particularly important for organisms with comparatively lower dispersal ability, such as aquatic macrophytes and fish. On the other hand, environmental predictors were particularly important for organisms with high dispersal ability, such as microalgae, indicating the importance of species sorting processes in shaping the community structure of these organisms. The importance of watercourse distances increased when spatial variables were the main predictors of metacommunity structure. The contribution of temporal predictors was low. Our results emphasize the strength of a trait-based analysis and of better defining spatial variables. More importantly, they supported the view that "all-or-nothing" interpretations on the mechanisms structuring metacommunities are rather the exception than the rule.},

Procrustes analysis and the Mantel test are two approaches that often meet this objective and are considered analogous in many situations especially when used as a statistical test to assess the statistical significance between multivariate data tables. Here we call the attention of ecologists to the advantages of a less familiar application of the Procrustean framework, namely the Procrustean association metric (a vector of Procrustean residuals). These residuals represent differences in fit between multivariate data tables regarding homologous observations (e.g., sampling sites) that can be used to estimate local levels of association (e.g., some groups of sites are more similar in their association between biotic and environmental features than other groups of sites). Given that in the Mantel framework, multivariate information is translated into a pairwise distance matrix, we lose the ability to contrast homologous data points across dimensions and data matrices after their fit. In this paper, we attempt to familiarize ecologists with the benefits of using these Procrustean residual differences to further gain insights about the processes underlying the association among multivariate data tables using real and hypothetical examples.},

  abstract = {Environmental variability is the main driver for the variation of biological characteristics (life-history traits) of species. Therefore, life-history traits are particularly suited to identify mechanistic linkages between environmental variability and species occurrence and can help in explaining ecological patterns. For ground beetles, few studies directly related species traits to environmental variables. This study aims to analyse how life-history traits of alluvial ground beetles are controlled by environmental factors. I expected that the occurrence of species and the occurrence of specific traits are closely related to hydrological and disturbance parameters. Furthermore I expected most of the trait-variation to be explained by a combination of environmental variables, rather than by their isolated effects. Ground beetles were sampled in the year 2005 in floodplain grassland along the Elbe River in Germany. I used redundancy analysis to quantify the effects of hydrological, sediment, and disturbance related parameters on both species occurrence and species traits. I applied variation partitioning to analyse which environmental compartments explain most of the trait variation. Species occurrence and trait variation were both mainly controlled by hydrological and flood disturbance parameters. I could clearly identify reproductive traits and body size as key traits for floodplain ground beetles to cope with the environmental variability. Furthermore, combinations of hydrological, habitat disturbance, habitat type, and species diversity parameters, rather than their isolated effects, explained large parts of ground beetle trait variation. Thus, a main conclusion of this study is that ground beetle occurrence is mainly determined by complex, multi-scale interactions between environmental variability and their life-history traits.},

  abstract = {An important goal for community ecology is the characterization and prediction of changes in community patterns along environmental gradients. We aimed to identify the major environmental correlates of diatom distribution patterns in boreal running waters. We classified 197 stream sites based on their diatom flora. Direct ordination methods were then used to identify the key environmental determinants of this diatom- based streamtypology. Finally, we testedwhether a regional classification scheme based on terrestrial landscapes (ecoregions) provides a reasonable framework for a regional grouping of streams based on their diatom flora. Two-way indicator species analysis produced 13 site groups, which were primarily separated by chemical variables, mainly conductivity, total P and water colour. In partial CCA, the environmental and spatial factors accounted for 38\% and 24\%, respectively, of explained variation in community composition. A high proportion (almost 40\%) of variation explained by the combined effect (spatially-structured environmental) indicated that diatom communities of boreal streams incorporate a strong spatial component. At the level of subecoregions, classification strength was almost equally strong for all sites as for near-pristine reference sites only. Procrustes analysis indicated that spatial factors and patterns in diatom community structure were strongly concordant. Our data support the argument that diatom communities are strongly spatially structured, with distinctly different communities in different parts of the country. Because of the strong spatial patterns of community composition, bioassessment programs utilising lotic diatoms would clearly benefit from regional stratification. A combination of regional stratification and the prediction of assemblage structure from local environmental features might provide the most robust framework for diatom-based assessment of the biological integrity of boreal streams.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Modern data acquisition based on high-throughput technology is often facing the problem of missing data. Algorithms commonly used in the analysis of such large-scale data often depend on a complete set. Missing value imputation offers a solution to this problem. However, the majority of available imputation methods are restricted to one type of variable only: continuous or categorical. For mixed-type data, the different types are usually handled separately. Therefore, these methods ignore possible relations between variable types. We propose a non-parametric method which can cope with different types of variables simultaneously. RESULTS: We compare several state of the art methods for the imputation of missing values. We propose and evaluate an iterative imputation method (missForest) based on a random forest. By averaging over many unpruned classification or regression trees, random forest intrinsically constitutes a multiple imputation scheme. Using the built-in out-of-bag error estimates of random forest, we are able to estimate the imputation error without the need of a test set. Evaluation is performed on multiple datasets coming from a diverse selection of biological fields with artificially introduced missing values ranging from 10\% to 30\%. We show that missForest can successfully handle missing values, particularly in datasets including different types of variables. In our comparative study, missForest outperforms other methods of imputation especially in data settings where complex interactions and non-linear relations are suspected. The out-of-bag imputation error estimates of missForest prove to be adequate in all settings. Additionally, missForest exhibits attractive computational efficiency and can cope with high-dimensional data. AVAILABILITY: The package missForest is freely available from http://stat.ethz.ch/CRAN/.

  abstract = {Whether diversity and composition of avian communities is determined primarily by responses of species to the floristic composition or to the structural characteristics of habitats has been an ongoing debate, at least since the publication of MacArthur and MacArthur (1961). This debate, however, has been hampered by two problems: 1) it is notoriously time consuming to measure the physiognomy of habitat, particularly in forests, and 2) rigorous statistical methods to predict the composition of bird assemblages from assemblages of plants have not been available. Here we use airborne laser scanning (lidar) to measure the habitat (vegetation) structure of a montane forest across large spatial extents with a very fine grain. Furthermore, we use predictive co-correspondence and canonical correspondence analyses to predict the composition of bird communities from the composition and structure of another community (i.e. plants). By using these new techniques, we show that the physiognomy of the vegetation is a significantly more powerful predictor of the composition of bird assemblages than plant species composition in the field and as well in the shrub/tree layer, both on a level of p $\backslash$textless 0.001. Our results demonstrate that ecologists should consider remote sensing as a tool to improve the understanding of the variation of bird assemblages in space and time. Particularly in complex habitats, such as forests, lidar is a valuable and comparatively inexpensive tool to characterize the structure of the canopy even across large and rough terrain. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Detection of optical brighteners by fluorometry combined with ultraviolet light (UV) exposure has been proposed as an inexpensive method for detection of human fecal contamination, but has received limited testing. This study evaluated the approach in southern California by applying it to a variety of detergents, sewage and septage samples from the region, as well as to natural stream water as a negative control. The concept of using UV exposure to differentiate fluorescence from natural organic matter proved valid, as the method produced no false positives. However, the method failed to detect half of the detergents tested in natural stream water at 5 μL/L, due to its conservative thresholds. This study identified a method modification that provides greater sensitivity by taking advantage of differences in the shape of photodecay curves between optical brighteners and natural organic matter. This method modification resulted in detection of all detergents, sewage at 1:10 dilution and septage at 1:100 dilution. Several caveats for its use remain, including our observation that the optical brightener signal degraded rapidly in strong sunlight. Additionally, there was low sensitivity for some environmentally friendly detergents, which does not present a problem on a community basis where a mix of detergents are used, but could be of concern for assessing septic inputs from individual homes. Still, the method is simple to employ in the field, yields rapid results and is useful as a low-cost initial screening tool.},

In the ponds which had Chaoborus but not fish, small- and medium-sized cladocerans and calanoid copepods were eliminated while rotifers became abundant. A large-sized cladoceran Daphnia longispina, whose juveniles had high helmets and long tailspines as anti-predator devices, escaped from Chaoborus predation and increased. In the ponds which had fish but not Chaoborus, the large-sized Daphnia was selectively predated by the fish while small-and medium-sized cladocerans and calanoid copepods predominated. In the ponds containing both Chaoborus and fish, the fish reduced the late instar larvae (III and IV) of Chaoborus but increased the early instar larvae (I and II). Small- and large-sized cladocerans were scarcely found. The former might have been eliminated by predation of the early instar larvae of Chaoborus, while the latter was probably predated by fish. Consequently, the medium-sized cladocerans, which may have succeeded in escaping from both types of predator, appeared abundantly. The results suggest that various combinations of vertebrate and invertebrate predators are able to drive various kinds of zooplankton community structure.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 $\backslash$AA for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Researchers are realizing that individual communities and ecosystems are not isolated from each other but rather that they are connected by exchanges of individuals (through dispersal) and materials (through spatial fluxes). From a conceptual perspective, there is a need to develop theories and hypotheses about the roles of these exchanges on different community and ecosystem attributes. Here we focus on the concept of metacommunities, to address how plankton communities are structured and how this may generate patterns of variation in planktonic ecosystems. Our premise is that planktonic systems can be understood in the framework of metacommunities and that the regulation of these metacommunities alter how they work as "complex adaptive systems." We hypothesize that connectivity through dispersal of local communities that are embedded in aquatic metacommunities show a range of dynamic behaviors related to their capacity to respond adaptively to environmental change.},

Here we attempt a reduction to the minimal set of metrics needed to describe biodiversity (often by default taken to be species richness). 1000 model communities with realistic taxonomic composition were synthesised using databases of marine benthic species. A battery of 19 biodiversity indices were calculated for every community and analysed by PCA to show inter-dependence and sensitivity to variation in taxonomic (a surrogate for genetic), functional (based on ecological roles) and structural (based on species abundance) diversity. We found the three major axes of biodiversity were (a) structural complexity, and (b) two different mixtures of taxonomic and functional diversity: it was well approximated by a three-dimensional space of these variables. A scalar distance from the origin of this space could serve as a single valued summary where needed, for example in economic valuations. The most widely used single biodiversity measure - species richness - missed 88.6 of the diversity, emphasising the importance of additional characters and the need for species databases to record functional traits, presence and abundance in communities, and phylogenetic information. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Conventional wisdom holds that either resource availability or dynamical stability limit food-chain length; however, new studies and new techniques challenge the conventional wisdom and broaden the discourse on food-chain length. Recent results suggest that resource availability limits food-chain length only in systems with very low resource availability, and call into question the theoretical basis for dynamical stability as a determinant of food-chain length. Evidence currently points towards a complex and contingent framework of interacting constraints that includes the history of community organization, resource availability, the type of predator-prey interactions, disturbance and ecosystem size. Within this framework, the debate has shifted from a search for singular explanations to a search for when and where different constraints operate to determine food-chain length.},

  abstract = {Species diversity aff ects the functioning of ecosystems, including the effi ciency by which communities capture limited resources, produce biomass, recycle and retain biologically essential nutrients. Th ese ecological functions ultimately support the ecosystem services upon which humanity depends. Despite hundreds of experimental tests of the eff ect of biodiversity on ecosystem function (BEF), it remains unclear whether diversity eff ects are suffi ciently general that we can use a single relationship to quantitatively predict how changes in species richness alter an ecosystem function across trophic levels, ecosystems and ecological conditions. Our objective here is to determine whether a general relationship exists between biodiversity and standing biomass. We used hierarchical mixed eff ects models, based on a power function between species richness and biomass production (Y ϭ a ϫ S b), and a database of 374 published experiments to estimate the BEF relationship (the change in biomass with the addition of species), and its associated uncertainty, in the context of environmental factors. We found that the mean relationship (b ϭ 0.26, 95\% CI: 0.16, 0.37) characterized the vast majority of observations, was robust to diff erences in experimental design, and was independent of the range of species richness levels considered. However, the richness – biomass relationship varied by trophic level and among ecosystems; in aquatic systems b was nearly twice as large for consumers (herbivores and detritivores) compared to primary producers; in terrestrial ecosystems, b for detritivores was negative but depended on few studies. We estimated changes in biomass expected for a range of changes in species richness, highlighting that species loss has greater implications than species gains, skewing a distribution of biomass change relative to observed species richness change. When biomass provides a good proxy for processes that underpin ecosystem services, this relationship could be used as a step in modeling the production of ecosystem services and their dependence on biodiversity.},

The spring bloom was dominated by a single species, Chaetoceros socialis, and associated with low microphytoplankton evenness and Shannon-Wiener indices, whereas the evenness index was high from late spring to winter and associated with the proliferation of pico- and nanophytoplankton cells. We identified 2 species responsible for harmful algal blooms, Phaeocystis globosa, which dominated the community in the northern part of the Seine Bay in May, and Lepidodinium chlorophorum, which dominated the community near the French coast in September. We examined the relationship between microphytoplankton diversity and maximum primary production and productivity. We found a negative parabolic relationship between the diversity indices (evenness and Shannon-Wiener) and maximum primary production, and a positive parabolic relationship between the number of taxa (richness) and maximum primary production. However, we found no relationship between maximum productivity and the evenness or richness indices. High levels of productivity were measured during the increasing abundance of pico and nanophytoplankton cells, highlighting the importance of taking the dominant functional group into account, rather than the degree of diversity, when explaining the level of productivity.},

  abstract = {Background: Quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) is the current method of choice for determining the risk to human health from exposure to microorganisms of concern. However, current approaches are often constrained by the availability of required data, and may not be able to incorporate the many varied factors that influence this risk. Systems models, based on Bayesian networks (BNs), are emerging as an effective complementary approach that overcomes these limitations. Objectives: This article aims to provide a comparative evaluation of the capabilities and challenges of current QMRA methods and BN models, and a scoping review of recent published articles that adopt the latter for microbial risk assessment. Pros and cons of systems approaches in this context are distilled and discussed. Methods: A search of the peer-reviewed literature revealed 15 articles describing BNs used in the context of QMRAs for foodborne and waterborne pathogens. These studies were analysed in terms of their application, uses and benefits in QMRA. Discussion: The applications were notable in their diversity. BNs were used to make predictions, for scenario assessment, risk minimisation, to reduce uncertainty and to separate uncertainty and variability. Most studies focused on a segment of the exposure pathway, indicating the broad potential for the method in other QMRA steps. BNs offer a number of useful features to enhance QMRA, including transparency, and the ability to deal with poor quality data and support causal reasoning. Conclusion: The method has significant untapped potential to describe the complex relationships between microbial environmental exposures and health.},

  abstract = {Bacteria are a primary contaminant in natural surface water. The instream concentration of fecal coliform, a potential indicator of pathogens, is influenced by meteorological conditions and land-use characteristics. However, the relationships between these conditions and fecal coliforms are not fully understood. Furthermore, the sources of large variability in fecal coliform counts, e.g., temporal or spatial sources, remain unexplained, especially at large scales. This study proposes the use of Bayesian overdispersed Poisson models, whereby the combined effects of temperature, rainfall, and land-use characteristics on fecal coliform concentration are quantified with predictive uncertainty, and the sources of variability in fecal coliform concentration are assessed. The models were developed using 8-year weekly observations of fecal coliforms obtained from the Wachusett Reservoir watershed in Massachusetts, USA. The results highlight the importance of interactions among meteorological and land-use characteristics in controlling the instream fecal coliform concentration; the increase in fecal coliform concentration with temperature increase was more drastic when rainfall occurred. Also, the responses of fecal coliforms to temperature increases were more pronounced in forest-dominated than in urban-dominated areas. In contrast, the fecal coliform concentration increased more rapidly with rainfall increases in urban-dominated than in forest-dominated areas. The models also demonstrate that among the sources of variability, the monthly component made the most significant contribution to the variability in fecal coliform concentrations. Our results suggest that seasonally dependent processes, including surface runoff, are critical factors that regulate fecal coliform concentration in streams.},

  abstract = {A daily forecast system of marine beach water quality (WATERMAN) has been developed for Hong Kong. Individual multiple linear regression (MLR) models were developed to forecast daily water quality (lnEC concentration) at each of the 41 beaches. The forecast system was developed through data assimilation with the most recent water quality data, and supported by field studies and deterministic hydrological, hydrodynamic, and water quality models. Model input parameters included three rainfall variables (daily rainfall in the previous three days): the previous day's solar radiation, onshore wind speed, and water temperature; tide level and predicted salinity at sampling time; and the geometric mean of the five most recent E. coli measurements. The forecasts were disseminated through the Internet and smart phone apps. The operational performance of the beach water quality forecast system during 2010-2011 is presented for 16 representative beaches. An overall accuracy of 78-100\% in forecasting compliance or exceedance of the water quality objective (WQO) can be obtained, with correct positives (exceedances) of approximately 30-70\%. A parameter analysis reveals beaches with different characteristics: (1) beaches dominated by nonpoint pollution sources; (2) beaches affected by nearby point source pollution; and (3) clean beaches that are relatively free of pollution. As compared with the current beach advisory based entirely on sparsely sampled data, the number of incorrect forecasts of WQO exceedances (beach incorrectly open) can be significantly reduced by 25\% using the forecast system. The corresponding reduction of excess illnesses attributable to the incorrect open forecasts can be estimated to be approximately 30\%. The forecast system is able to enhance protection of public health while allowing maximum beach access.

  abstract = {At public beaches, it is now common to mitigate the impact of water-borne pathogens by posting a swimmer's advisory when the concentration of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) exceeds an action threshold. Since culturing the bacteria delays public notification when dangerous conditions exist, regression models are sometimes used to predict the FIB concentration based on readily-available environmental measurements. It is hard to know which environmental parameters are relevant to predicting FIB concentration, and the parameters are usually correlated, which can hurt the predictive power of a regression model. Here the method of partial least squares (PLS) is introduced to automate the regression modeling process. Model selection is reduced to the process of setting a tuning parameter to control the decision threshold that separates predicted exceedances of the standard from predicted non-exceedances. The method is validated by application to four Great Lakes beaches during the summer of 2010. Performance of the PLS models compares favorably to that of the existing state-of-the-art regression models at these four sites. ?? 2012.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a framework for analyzing the economic, health, and recreation implications of swim closures related to high fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) levels. The framework utilizes benefit transfer policy analysis to provide a practical procedure for estimating the effectiveness of recreational water quality policies. Evaluation criteria include the rates of intended and unintended management outcomes, whether the chosen protocols generate closures with positive net economic benefits to swimmers, and the number of predicted illnesses the policy is able to prevent. We demonstrate the framework through a case study of a Lake Michigan freshwater beach using existing water quality and visitor data from 1998 to 2001. We find that a typical closure causes a net economic loss among would-be swimmers totaling \$1274-37 030/ day, depending on the value assumptions used. Unnecessary closures, caused by high indicator variability and a 24-h time delay between when samples are taken and the management decision can be made, occurred on 14 (12\%) out of 118 monitored summer days. Days with high FIB levels when the swim area is open are also common but do relatively little economic harm in comparison. Also, even if the closure policy could be implemented daily and perfectly without error, only about 42\% of predicted illnesses would be avoided. These conclusions were sensitive to the relative values and risk preferences that swimmers have for recreation access and avoiding health effects, suggesting a need for further study of the impacts of recreational water quality policies on individuals.},

We used an historical data set from Lake Washington (U.S.A.) to quantify population responses of a calanoid copepod (Leptodiaptomus ashlandi) to long-term changes in temperature and resource availability and explore potential mechanisms for the responses. Increasing water temperatures (annual mean increase of 1.5uC in the upper 10-m water volume) and longer stratification periods (about 4 weeks) were observed between 1962 and 2005, coincident with a pronounced decline in Leptodiaptomus densities. However, production was maintained because of an increase in the production to biomass ratio and a life cycle shift in Leptodiaptomus from an annual to a 6-month cycle. Cross-wavelet analyses demonstrated that the annual thermal forcing of copepod recruitment observed during the first two decades of the study weakened substantially, leading to more stochastic population dynamics during the past two decades. This shift from one to two generations per year was most likely produced by a longer and warmer growing period combined with changing fluctuations in resource (phytoplankton) availability. Climate change can lead to higher-frequency voltinism in ectothermic organisms and to temporal reorganization of their population dynamics.},

  abstract = {Top-down control of phytoplankton by crustacean mesozooplankton is a cornerstone of freshwater ecology. Apparently, trophic cascades are more frequently reported from freshwater than from marine plankton. We argue that this difference is real and mainly caused by biological differences at the zooplankton-phytoplankton link: cladocerans (particularly Daphnia) in the lakes and copepods in the sea. We derive these conclusions from recent literature and a number of own, similarly designed mesocosm experiments conducted in a lake, a brackish water and a marine site. In all experiments, phytoplankton were exposed to gradients of experimentally manipulated densities of zooplankton, including freshwater copepods and cladocerans, and marine copepods and appendicularians. The suggested reasons for the difference between lake and marine trophic cascades are: (1) Both copepods and cladocerans suppress only part of the phytoplankton size spectrum: cladocerans the small and copepods the large phytoplankton. (2) If not controlled by grazing, small phytoplankton may increase their biomass faster than large phytoplankton. (3) Copepods additionally release small phytoplankton from grazing pressure by intermediate consumers (protozoa) and competitors (predation on appendicularian eggs), while cladocerans do not release large phytoplankton from grazing pressure by any functional group. (4) Cladocerans sequester more of the limiting nutrient than copepods, leaving fewer nutrients available for compensatory growth of ungrazed phytoplankton.},

  abstract = {Dynamics of prokaryotic and eukaryotic picophytoplankton were investigated over a 2-year time period using flow cytometry and combined with an in situ experiment in Lake Tahoe, USA to better characterize to which extent environmental factors control these communities. Pronounced seasonal patterns and clear temporal and spatial partitioning were observed between picocyanobacteria and picoeukaryotes. Picocyanobacteria dominated in the nutrient deficient upper water column during the stratified season, while picoeukaryotes reached maximum abundance during isothermal conditions and maintained high numbers in deep-water layers during the stratified season. Picocyanobacteria were more sensitive to high solar and UV radiation compared with picoeukaryotes, which were not affected by high solar radiation and nutrient enrichment stimulated their growth. The opposing response of these two populations is consistent with their vertical distribution: picocyanobacteria dominate below the 30\% isolume and above the nitrocline depth, whereas picoeukaryotes increase in the vicinity of the nitrocline and thus increased nutrient concentration. This spatial separation of picophytoplankton groups along environmental gradients in Lake Tahoe is consistent with other deep-oligotrophic lakes and the marine environment, suggesting that these marine and freshwater organisms have similar ecophysiological requirements. These results highlight that the smallest photosynthetic communities show taxon-specific responses to mixing and resource availability, which affect the structure and dynamics of picophytoplankton.},

  abstract = {Interactions between biotic and abiotic processes complicate the design and interpretation of ecological experiments. Separating causality from simple correlation requires distinguishing among experimental treatments, experimental responses, and the many processes and properties that are correlated with either the treatments or the responses, or both. When an experimental manipulation has multiple components, but only one of them is identified as the experimental treatment. erroneous conclusions about cause and effect relationships are likely because the actual cause of any observed response may be ignored in the interpretation of the experimental results. This unrecognized cause of an observed response can be considered a ”hidden treatment.” Three types of hidden treatments are potential problems in biodiversity experiments: (1) abiotic conditions, such as resource levels, or biotic conditions, such as predation, which are intentionally or unintentionally altered in order to create differences in species numbers for ”diversity” treatments; (2) non-random selection of species with particular attributes that produce treatment differences that exceed those due to ”diversity” alone; and (3) the increased statistical probability of including a species with a dominant negative or positive effect (e.g., dense shade, or nitrogen fixation) in randomly selected groups of species of increasing number or ”diversity.” In each of these cases, treatment responses that are actually the result of the ”hidden treatment” may be inadvertently attributed to variation in species diversity. Case studies re-evaluating three different types of biodiversity experiments demonstrate that the increases found in such ecosystem properties as productivity, nutrient use efficiency, and stability (all of which were attributed to higher levels of species diversity) were actually caused by ”hidden trearments” that altered plant biomass and productivity.},

  abstract = {Lake thermocline depth is likely to be altered with climate change. We assessed the response of crustacean zooplankton biomass and productivity to an experimental whole-lake manipulation of thermocline depth. Weekly sampling occurred in Experimental and Reference years and responses were assessed with a before–after-control– impact design. While one of three lake basins remained un-manipulated (control), two others experienced thermocline deepening via: active mixing simulating increased wind-stress (‘mixing with thermocline deepening'); and increased overall heat content, simulating greater water clarity (‘thermocline deepening'). Thus, we simultaneously identified seasonal responses to three treatments: mixing with thermocline deepening, thermocline deepening alone, and an isolated mixing effect. Total crustacean zooplankton biomass was enhanced by all treatment effects, owing to positive responses to thermocline deepening in Bosmina and Daphnia and a positive cyclopoid copepod response to mixing. Enhancement of biomass production rates (BP) occurred only with thermocline deepening, with no effect of mixing alone. The lack of BP response to active mixing was likely due to compositional shifts from fast growing Daphnia to slower growing cylopoids. BP variation was explained by positive and negative relationships with mean water-column temperature and hypolimnetic temperature, respectively. Hypolimnetic warming, occurring naturally with the seasonal thermocline descent was more dramatic for the active mixing manipulation. This loss of hypolimnetic refuge for Daphnia appears to have had a negative effect on the community daily production to biomass ratio (P : Bdaily). Our study indicates a greater likelihood for reduced food-web transfer efficiency under scenarios when mixing and hypolimnetic warming accompany thermocline deepening. TS - CrossRef},

To date, the vast majority of BEF studies have been conducted experimentally, and it is unclear whether their outcomes can be transferred to natural communities and ecosystems. The major challenge faced in the analysis of observational data is to incorporate direct and indirect processes which influence the response variable of interest. Consequently, the statistical methods used to analyze such relationships must accommodate the multivariate nature of these data. One multivariate approach, viz. structural equation modeling, has already been applied to BEF research in terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. In this study, we applied a structural equation model to monitoring data on marine phytoplankton communities, including data on environmental parameters, community structure, and measures of productivity. Our aim was to ascertain whether similar patterns and processes driving BEF relationships as described for other ecosystem types are evident in marine phytoplankton communities. We found that different aspects of biodiversity (richness, evenness) are significantly linked to ecosystem functions (productivity, resource use efficiency). These relationships are embedded in a multitude of direct and indirect links between environmental factors, community diversity, and productivity. Overall, our analysis confirms patterns observed in terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems and highlights the importance of incorporating multivariate methods for a better understanding of BEF processes in natural ecosystems.},

However, despite a wealth of studies into biodiversity's role in maintaining ES (B-ES relationships) across landscapes, we still lack generalities in the nature and strengths of these linkages. Reasons for this are manifold, but can largely be attributed to (i) a lack of adherence to definitions and thus a confusion between final ES and the ecosystem functions (EFs) underpinning them, (ii) a focus on uninformative biodiversity indices and singular hypotheses and (iii) top-down analyses across large spatial scales and overlooking of context-dependency. The biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (B-EF) field provides an alternate context for examining biodiversity's mechanistic role in shaping ES, focusing on species' characteristics that may drive EFs via multiple mechanisms across contexts. Despite acknowledgements of a need for B-ES research to look towards underlying B-EF linkages, the connections between these areas of research remains weak. With this review, we pull together recent B-EF findings to identify key areas for future developments in B-ES research. We highlight a means by which B-ES research may begin to identify how and when multiple underlying B-EF relationships may scale to final ES delivery and trade-offs.},

In both absence and presence of grazers, primary production was positively affected by both light supply and producer diversity. Survival, reproduction, and biomass of herbivores were also positively affected by light supply and producer diversity, with both factors contributing equally to grazer performance.

New studies analysing the simultaneous provision of multiple services at landscape scale should aid the understanding of multiple ES delivery and trade-offs to support policy, management and land planning. 2.Here, we propose a new approach for the analysis, mapping and understanding of multiple ES delivery in landscapes. Spatially explicit single ES models based on plant traits and abiotic characteristics are combined to identify ‘hot' and ‘cold' spots of multiple ES delivery, and the land use and biotic determinants of such distributions. We demonstrate the value of this trait-based approach as compared to a pure land-use approach for a pastoral landscape from the central French Alps, and highlight how it improves understanding of ecological constraints to, and opportunities for, the delivery of multiple services. 3.Vegetative height and leaf traits such as leaf dry matter content were response traits strongly influenced by land use and abiotic environment, with follow-on effects on several ecosystem properties, and could therefore be used as functional markers of ES. 4.Patterns of association among ES were related to the dominant traits underlying different ecosystem properties. The functional decoupling between height and leaf traits provided alternative pathways for high agronomic value, as well as determining hot and cold spots of ES. Traditional land uses such as organic fertilization and mowing or altitude summer grazing were also linked with ES hot spots, because functional characteristics supporting fodder production and quality are compatible with species and functional diversity. 5.Synthesis. Analyses of ES using plant functional variation across landscapes are a powerful approach to understanding the fundamental ecological mechanisms underlying ES provision, and trade-offs or synergies among services. Sustainable management of species and functionally diverse grassland could simultaneously aim at conserving biodiversity and locally important ES by taking advantage of correlations and trade-offs among different plant functional traits.},

Analysing phytoplankton community data from 205 small, mainly oligotrophic Swedish lakes along a 13° latitudinal gradient, we found that the duration of the open-water season (DT $\backslash$textgreater 0) was best related to phytoplankton species richness and biomass, probably because DT $\backslash$textgreater 0 can be used as a proxy for nutrient concentrations, as well as for light and temperature conditions in lakes.2. The relationships between DT $\backslash$textgreater 0 and phytoplankton species richness and biomass were not linear but showed significant shifts, that is, richness suddenly doubled at DT $\backslash$textgreater 0 = 170 days and phytoplankton biomass began to strongly increase at DT $\backslash$textgreater 0 around 220 days.3. The doubling in species richness corresponded to a change in the seasonal plankton succession from one to two peaks per year, and the shift in biomass corresponded to a shift in nutrient concentrations.4. The geographical differences in richness and biomass shifts resulted in an exponential biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationship along a DT $\backslash$textgreater 0 gradient.5. We conclude that phytoplankton species richness and biomass are driven by different environmental factors, resulting in a nonlinear biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationship. The shape of the diversity–functioning relationship varies along with variations in environmental drivers, which is of highest importance for ongoing discussions about impacts of global change on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.},

  abstract = {1. The internal cycling of nitrogen (N) is a critical process in terrestrial ecosystems. Nitrification occurs when soil microbes convert ammonium to nitrate. Nitrification is known to be regulated by abiotic soil properties, but less is known about how plant communities influence this important ecosystem function. 2. Two contrasting hypotheses propose mechanisms for how communities influence ecosystem processes. The 'mass ratio hypothesis' proposes that dominant species control ecosystem processes, e.g. communities dominated by plants with high leaf N content may increase rates of N cycling. The 'diversity hypothesis' proposes that community diversity controls ecosystem processes, e.g. diverse communities may increase rates of N cycling by providing a more consistent supply of organic N as variable litter qualities break down at different rates. Each hypothesis was simultaneously evaluated using structural equation modelling in the context of a ponderosa pine forest. 3. The first principle component extracted from a species-trait matrix captured interspecific covariation in leaf traits such as specific leaf area and leaf N content. This 'leaf economics spectrum' was scaled to the community-level by calculating community-weighted mean leaf trait axis scores. Quadratic entropy was used as the index of understorey functional diversity to capture variation in functional traits within the community. 4. Structural equation modelling results suggest that soil factors, such as pH, temperature, C:N mass ratio and total N were the dominant factors exerting direct control over nitrification potential. Understorey leaf traits were positively associated with nitrification potential, suggesting that high-quality litter inputs increase rates of nitrification. The negative indirect effects of pine abundance on nitrification mediated through soil properties were much stronger than the direct effect of understorey leaf traits. 5. Synthesis. The leaf economics spectrum is an important gradient of functional trait variation that has consequences for internal N cycling. Nitrification potential was more strongly linked to dominant leaf traits than to functional diversity, thereby lending more support to the mass ratio hypothesis. However, functional diversity still explained some of the observed variation in biomass production. Leaf traits can be used to understand how internal N cycling rates will be affected by changes in vegetation structure.},

  abstract = {The global decline in biodiversity is causing increasing concern about the effects of biodiversity loss on ecosystem services such as productivity. Biodiversity has been hypothesised to be important in maintaining productivity of biological assemblages because niche complementarity and facilitation among the constituent species can result in more efficient use of resources. However, these conclusions are primarily based on studies with plant communities, and the relationship between diversity and productivity at higher trophic levels is largely unknown, especially in the marine environment. Here, we used a manipulative field experiment to test the effects of species richness and species identity on biomass accumulation in coral reef fish assemblages at Lizard Island. Small patch reefs were stocked with a total of 30 juveniles belonging to three planktivorous damselfish (genus Pomacentrus) according to three different levels of fish species richness (one, two and three species) and seven different combinations of fish species. Species richness had no effect on the relative growth in this assemblage after 18 days, but relative growth differed among individual fish species and the different combinations of species. Patterns of increase in biomass were best explained by species-specific differences and variable effects of intra- and interspecific competition on growth. These results suggest that niche complementarity and facilitation are not the most influential drivers of total productivity within this guild of planktivorous fishes. Total productivity may be resilient to declining reef fish biodiversity, but this will depend on which species are lost and on the life-history traits of remaining species.},

  abstract = {1. Experimental studies have provided significant knowledge of how biodiversity can influence ecosystem processes. However, there is a growing need to relate these findings to natural communities. 2. Here we identify two major hypotheses for how communities may influence ecosystem processes: the 'diversity hypothesis' (the diversity of organisms in a community influences ecosystem processes through mechanisms such as complementary resource use), and the 'mass ratio hypothesis' (ecosystem processes are determined overwhelmingly by the functional traits of the dominant species). We then test which of these two hypotheses best explain variation in ecosystem properties and processes (biomass pools and fluxes, water use, light interception) in a temperate native grassland. We do this by applying various measures of diversity, functional diversity, and functional identity, whose significant relations with ecosystem processes would support either of the competing hypotheses. 3. Mean trait values best explained variation in five of the eight ecosystem processes examined, supporting Grime's mass ratio hypothesis, which proposes that the functional identities of the dominant species largely determine ecosystem processes. 4. Multi-trait functional diversity indices also explained large amounts of variation in ecosystem processes, while only weak relationships were observed between species richness and ecosystem processes. 5. To explore the mechanistic interactions between variables, we developed structural equation models (SEMs), which indicated that many of the community diversity and trait properties significantly influenced ecosystem processes, even after accounting for co-varying biotic/abiotic factors. 6. Synthesis. Our study is one of the first explicit comparisons of the 'diversity' and 'mass ratio' hypotheses, and our results most strongly support the mass ratio hypothesis, that is, the traits of the dominant species most influenced the ecosystem properties and processes examined. Our results suggest that the management of communities for the maintenance of ecosystem processes should focus on species dominance hierarchies.},

Functional traits are receiving increasing attention as the main ecological attributes by which different organisms and biological communities influence ecosystem services through their effects on underlying ecosystem processes. Here we synthesize concepts and empirical evidence on linkages between functional traits and ecosystem services across different trophic levels. Most of the 247 studies reviewed considered plants and soil invertebrates, but quantitative trait–service associations have been documented for a range of organisms and ecosystems, illustrating the wide applicability of the trait approach. Within each trophic level, specific processes are affected by a combination of traits while particular key traits are simultaneously involved in the control of multiple processes. These multiple associations between traits and ecosystem processes can help to identify predictable trait–service clusters that depend on several trophic levels, such as clusters of traits of plants and soil organisms that underlie nutrient cycling, herbivory, and fodder and fibre production. We propose that the assessment of trait–service clusters will represent a crucial step in ecosystem service monitoring and in balancing the delivery of multiple, and sometimes conflicting, services in ecosystem management.},

Specific selectivities were found to be largely invariant through the growing season. All zooplankters grazed more efficiently on phytoflagellates such as Rhodomonas and Cryptomonas than on coccales such as Chlorella and Scenedesmus, regardless of their relative abundance in the phytoplankton assemblage. Filtering rates did not decrease in the presence of filamentous algae. Certain filamentous species were grazed efficiently, but only by D. hyalina: Anabaena planktonica, Oscillatoria amphigranulata, and Stephanodiscus binderanus. Large diatom colonies like Asterionella formosa and Fragilaria crotonensis were grazed well only by Cyclops sp. Some algal species were consistently selected against: Mougeotia thylespora and Dinobryon sp. The species-specific selectivity coefficients can be used as weighting factors to assess the ‘effective food concentration' relative to Rhodomonas minuta, a reference species for optimal food.},

We studied the allochthony (share biomass of terrestrial origin) in cladoceran, calanoid and cyclopoid micro-crustacean zooplankton from late winter to fall during two years in a small humic lake (Sweden). The use of allochthonous resources was important for sustaining a small population of calanoids in the water column during late winter. However, in summer the calanoids shifted to 100\% herbivory, increasing their biomass several-fold by making efficient use of the pelagic primary production. In contrast, the cyclopoids and cladocerans remained at high levels of allochthony throughout the seasons, both groups showing the mean allochthony of 0.56 (range in mean 0.17-0.79 and 0.34-0.75, for the respective group, depending on model parameters). Our study shows that terrestrial organic matter can be an important resource for cyclopoids and cladocerans on an annual basis, forming a significant link between terrestrial organic matter and the higher trophic levels of the food web, but it can also be important for sustaining otherwise herbivorous calanoids during periods of low primary production in late winter.$\backslash$textless/p$\backslash$textgreater},

  abstract = {Air–water diffusive gas flux is commonly determined using measurements of gas concentrations and an estimate of gas transfer velocity (k600) usually derived from wind speed. The great heterogeneity of aquatic systems raises questions about the appropriateness of using a single wind-based model to predict k600 in all aquatic systems. Theoretical considerations suggest that wind speed to k600 relationships should instead be system-specific. Using data collected from aquatic systems of different sizes, we show that k600 is related to fetch and other measures of ecosystem size. Lake area together with wind speed provided the best predictive model of gas transfer velocity and explained 68\% of the variability in individual k600 measurements. For a moderate wind speed of 5 m·s−1,predicted k600 varied from 6 cm·h−1 in a small 1 ha lake to over 13 cm·h−1 in a 100 km2 system. Wave height is also shown to be a promising integrative predictor variable. The modulating influence of system size on wind speed – gas transfer velocity relationships can have a large impact on upscaling exercises of gas exchange at the whole landscape level.},

However, addressing finer-scale questions is also possible, depending on survey coverage and whether assumptions and limitations are matched to the scale of inferences. Our objective was to determine if the eBird database could be used to develop estimates of bird abundance and diversity comparable to those from standardized shorebird surveys.We compared a year of standardized shorebird surveys by trained observers at Snook Islands Natural Area located in Palm Beach County, Florida, to a year of eBird observations from the same site. Total species richness derived fromeBird (25 species) was higher than that from standardized surveys (20 species). Similarly, we found the Shannon diversity index calculated from eBird was higher (2.81) than the same index calculated from standardized surveys (2.21; P $\backslash$textless 0.001). The higher diversity and species richness may reflect the greater effort of eBird participants (35,289 person-hours) compared to our standard surveys (2126 person-hours).We found only a slight difference in parameter estimates between data obtained fromeBird and fromstandardized surveys. Potential use and value of eBird as a tool for land managers and conservationists may be greater than currently realized, but studies conducted in a wider range of ecosystems and locations are needed to develop generalizations.},

Maxima of zooplankton biomass and community grazing rates (170\% of volume cleared per day) coincided with the greatest transparency. The algal decline was not related to nutrient depletion or climatic events. Before the clear-water phase small phytoplankton contributed up to 88\% of the primary production, but the contribution of large particles was more important after the zooplankton maximum. The effects of herbivory by zooplankton were examined in a series of time-overlapping enclosure experiments. Concentrations of small 35 pm) particles were always higher in the bags lacking zooplankton than in the controls.

  abstract = {1. An examination is made of the relative seasonal timing of the postwinter increase of phytoplankton and zooplankton populations in four English lake basins. It centres upon weekly sampling over 20 years and rough counts of larger Crustacea, as copepods and cladocerans, from filtered samples that were used for chlorophyll a (Chl) estimation. 2. Typically, a spring maximum of phytoplankton, dominated by diatoms and earlier in the shallower lakes, is accompanied or followed by a maximum of copepods and then one of cladocerans dominated by the Daphnia hyalina-galeata complex. Regarding timing, the maximum of copepods has no apparent relation with phytoplankton abundance ( Chl). The maximum of cladocerans appears to be largely independent of variation in the phytoplankton maximum, but is generally associated with a minimum in Chl. Evidence for some direct causality in this inverse correlation after the spring phytoplankton maximum is best displayed by the shallow Esthwaite Water in which the peaks of Chl and cladocerans are separated further than in the deep Windermere basins where phytoplankton growth is delayed. In Esthwaite Water, and possibly often in Windermere, a principal minimum in Chl is ascribable to grazing by Daphnia. 3. The typical inverse relationship of Chl and cladocerans is lost in some years when relatively inedible large phytoplankters ( e. g. colonial chrysomonads, filamentous cyanophytes) are abundant and Chl minima are less pronounced, although maxima of cladocerans still occur. Conversely, available edible phytoplankters include various small forms grouped as mu-algae and Cryptomonas spp.; their probable depletions by Daphnia appear to be sequential and may limit the latter's maxima, whose inception is temperature-dependent. 4. The spring-summer maxima of cladocerans and minima of Chl are generally coincident with a main seasonal maximum of Secchi disc transparency and light penetration - to which removal of non-phytoplankton particles by filtering cladocerans may contribute.},

In parallel, these aquatic ecosystems have been shown to act as CO2 sources to the atmosphere, as expected from the heterotrophic nature of the communities they contain. The prevalence of net heterotrophic aquatic ecosystems indicates that they must receive significant inputs of organic carbon from adjacent ecosystems, assigning an important role to the lateral exchanges of carbon between land and aquatic ecosystems, between coastal and open ocean ecosystems, as well as internal redistribution within large or complex aquatic ecosystems in determining their metabolic status and the gaseous exchange with the atmosphere. The examination of the carbon budget of ecosystems requires, therefore, an integrative approach that accounts for exchanges between compartments often studied in isolation.

  abstract = {Plankton communities in oligotrophic waters are characteristically dominated by the biomass of heterotrophs, including bacteria, micro-, and macrozooplankton. It has been generally assumed that these inverted biomass pyramids are the direct result of high specific production rates of phytoplankton and a tight coupling between producers and consumers. There are, however, at least two alternative hypotheses: (1) heterotrophic biomass turnover is much slower in oligotrophic than eutrophic systems; and (2) oligotrophic planktonic communities are significantly subsidized by allochthonous organic matter, In this study we assessed these hypotheses by establishing the relationship between plankton biomass structure (partition between auto- and heterotrophs), plankton function (plankton primary production and respiration) and whole-lake gas (O-2 and CO2) fluxes in 20 temperate lakes that span a large range in primary production. We show that the balance of phytoplankton production and community respiration (P/R ratio) is always below unity in unproductive lakes where heterotrophic biomass (H) is high relative to autotrophic biomass (A), suggesting that these planktonic food webs function as heterotrophic systems and must be subsidized by allochthonous organic matter. Further, rates of phytoplankton specific production are not highest in communities characterized by dominance of heterotrophic biomass. All except the most productive lakes were supersaturated in CO2 and undersaturated in O-2. Our results support the hypothesis that excess CO2 in lakes originates from the breakdown of terrestrial organic carbon by planktonic organisms. A simple model in which both allochthonous organic matter and phytoplankton production support the metabolism of heterotrophs reproduced the patterns and magnitudes of metabolism P/R ratio, biomass turnover time, and whole-system gas flux among lakes. These patterns of metabolism and structure suggest that inverted biomass pyramids in temperate lakes, and perhaps in other aquatic systems, reflect the heterotrophic nature of these plankton communities rather than turnover rates of autotrophs or heterotrophs.},

  abstract = {Because freshwater covers such a small fraction of the Earth's surface area, inland freshwater ecosystems (particularly lakes, rivers, and reservoirs) have rarely been considered as potentially important quantitative components of the carbon cycle at either global or regional scales. By taking published estimates of gas exchange, sediment accumulation, and carbon transport for a variety of aquatic systems, we have constructed a budget for the role of inland water ecosystems in the global carbon cycle. Our analysis conservatively estimates that inland waters annually receive, from a combination of background and anthropogenically altered sources, on the order of 1.9 Pg C y−1 from the terrestrial landscape, of which about 0.2 is buried in aquatic sediments, at least 0.8 (possibly much more) is returned to the atmosphere as gas exchange while the remaining 0.9 Pg y−1 is delivered to the oceans, roughly equally as inorganic and organic carbon. Thus, roughly twice as much C enters inland aquatic systems from land as is exported from land to the sea. Over prolonged time net carbon fluxes in aquatic systems tend to be greater per unit area than in much of the surrounding land. Although their area is small, these freshwater aquatic systems can affect regional C balances. Further, the inclusion of inland, freshwater ecosystems provides useful insight about the storage, oxidation and transport of terrestrial C, and may warrant a revision of how the modern net C sink on land is described.},

Although there is evidence that terrestrial carbon can be incorporated into the tissues of aquatic consumers, its ability to enhance consumer production has been debated. Our research aims to evaluate the net effect of t-OC input on zooplankton. We used a survey of zooplankton production and resource use in ten lakes along a naturally occurring gradient of t-OC concentration to address these questions. Total and group-specific zooplankton production was negatively related to t-OC. Residual variation in zooplankton production that was not explained by t-OC was negatively related to terrestrial resource use (allochthony) by zooplankton. These results challenge the designation of terrestrial carbon as a resource subsidy; rather, the negative effect of reduced light penetration on the amount of suitable habitat and the low resource quality of t-OC appear to diminish zooplankton production. Our findings suggest that ongoing continental-scale increases in t-OC concentrations of lakes will likely have negative impacts on the productivity of aquatic food webs.},

  abstract = {For 30 Canadian Shield lakes of southeastern Quebec, catchment slope and lake morphometry account for 50–70\% of the variability of chlorophyll a (Chl a), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total phosphorus (TP), NO3 -, and NH4 +. Dissolved organic carbon, TP, Chl a, Ca, and Mg are negatively related to catchment slope, whereas NO3 - and NH4 + increase with increasing slope. Concentrations of more conservative constituents (SO4 2-, Na, K) increase with decreasing elevation as a result of higher evapotranspiration and lower precipitation at low elevations. Catchment variables (slope, drainage area, percent wetlands) are as good predictors of Chl a (r2 = 0.7) as are water chemistry variables (TP, Ca, Mg, and pH). Dominant vegetation (deciduous vs. coniferous) has little or no influence on lake water chemistry. Hydrogeological data for the Canadian Shield suggest that, during periods of high runoff, the development of waterlogged areas and the importance of overland flow on saturated soils are inversely proportional to catchment slope. We propose that the strong influence of catchment slope on water quality is due to slope-dependent seasonal waterlogging, which determines the fate (retention or export to surface waters) of dissolved substances produced within and moving through the forest floor.},

  abstract = {We assessed changes in Lake Ontario zooplankton biomass, production, and community composition before (1987-1991) and after (2001-2005) invasion-induced ecosystem changes. The ecosystem changes were associated with establishment of invasive dreissenid mussels and invasive predatory cladocerans (Bythotrephes and Cercopagis). Whole-lake total epilimnetic plus metalimnetic zooplankton production declined by approximately half from 42.45 (g dry wt·m-2-year-1) during 1987-1991 to 21.91 (g dry wt·m-2-year-1) in 2003 and averaged 21.01 (g dry wt·m-2-year-1) during 2001-2005. Analysis of two independent data sets indicates that the mean biomass and biomass proportion of cyclopoid copepods declined while the same measures increased for the invasive predatory cladocerans. Changes in means and proportions of all other zooplankton groups were not consistent between the data sets. Cyclopoid copepod biomass and production declined by factors ranging from 3.6 to 5.7. Invasive predatory cladoceran biomass averaged from 5.0\% to 8.0\% of the total zooplankton biomass. The zooplankton community was otherwise resilient to the invasion-induced disruption as zooplankton species richness and diversity were unaffected. Zooplankton production was likely reduced by declines in primary productivity but may have declined further due to increased predation by alewives and invasive predatory cladocerans. Shifts in zooplankton community structure were consistent with increased predation pressure on cyclopoid copepods by alewives and invasive predatory cladocerans. Predicted declines in the proportion of small cladocerans were not evident. This study represents the first direct comparison of changes in Lake Ontario zooplankton production before and after the invasion-induced disruption and will be important to food web-scale investigations of invasion effects. © 2010 International Association for Great Lakes Research.},

When two basins of one lake were fertilized with equal amounts of nitrate and sucrose, and phosphorus was also added to one of the basins, the phosphateenriched basin quickly became highly eutrophic, while the basin receiving only nitrogen and carbon remained at prefertilization conditions. These results, and the high affinity of sediments for phosphorus indicate that rapid abatement of eutrophication may be expected to follow phosphorus control measures.},

Benthic biomass increased greatly between 1979 and 1993 because of the presence of dreissenids, and$\backslash$textgreater90\% of benthic production in 1993 came from dreissenids. Biomass of “other” benthos (excluding unionids and dreissenids) did not decline. Dreissenid production was in addition to, and not at the expense of, “other” benthic production. Zooplankton production was close to or within the 95\% confidence interval of that predicted from primary production (photosynthesis) based on the relationship described by Makarewicz and Likens (1979). Deviations from this relationship were correlated with summer zooplankton mean length, suggesting that planktivory was an important factor in the regulation of zooplankton production in the lake. Dreissenids therefore impact zooplankton production by reducing algal biomass and primary production particularly in unstratified regions, by decreasing rotifer abundance and hence biomass and production, and by producing veligers which contribute 10\% to 25\% to zooplankton production. Potential fish biomass which could be supported by the benthic and pelagic foodwebs was estimated from empirical equations. The benthic food chain could potentially support more fish biomass than the pelagic food chain in all basins in 1993, even if dreissenids were excluded from the calculations.},

Predicting this assembly process is hampered because few studies directly incorporate environmental measurements and scale up from species to community level and because the functional traits' significance is environment dependent. We analyzed community assembly by measuring structure, environmental conditions, and species traits of secondary forests in a species-rich tropical system. We found, as hypothesized, that community structure shaped the local environment and that strong relationships existed between this environment and the traits of the most successful species of the regeneration communities. Path and multivariate analyses showed that temperature and leaf traits that regulate it were the most important factors of community differentiation. Comparisons between the trait composition of the forest's regeneration, juvenile, and adult communities showed a consistent community assembly pattern. These results allowed us to identify the major functional traits and environmental factors involved in the assembly of dry-forest communities and demonstrate that environmental filtering is a predictable and fundamental process of community assembly, even in a complex system such as a tropical forest.},

A selected subset of 77 taxa were clustered using a complete-linkage cluster analysis. The final 12 clusters represent the associations of species found occurring together in insular Newfoundland. Physical, chemical, and morphometric data collected with the phytoplankton served to characterize the environment. Factor analysis samplified the original variables, many of which were highly correlated and uninterpretable, into seven derived environmental factors: dystrophy, hardness, salinity, lake size, season, watershed influence, and orthophosphate enrichment. The resulting orthogonally rotated (VARIMAX) scores comprising these seven factors were correlated with species abundances. Spearman correlations showed several relationships between species distributions and the seven derived environmental factors. Although the analysis identified a subset of naturally acidic, dystrophic lakes, it failed to reveal any evidence of anthropogenic acidification in the lakes studied. For the most part, the members from each of the cluster groups demonstrated similar relationships with the derived environmental factors. The evidence suggests that the cluster groups may represent species associations; groups of species that co-occur because of their common requirements for specific environmental conditions. Phytoplankton autecological findings resulting from this study of insular Newfoundland lakes correspond well with conclusions derived independently from a comparable study of 95 headwater lakes in Labrador.},

  abstract = {Resolving current concerns about the role of biodiversity on ecosystems calls for understanding the separate roles of changes in species numbers and of composition. Recent work shows that primary productivity often, but not always, saturates with species richness within single trophic levels. However, any interpretation of such patterns must consider that variation in biodiversity is necessarily associated with changes in species composition (identity), and that changes in biodiversity often occur across multiple trophic levels. Here we present results from a mesocosm experiment in which we independently manipulated species richness and species composition across multiple trophic levels in pond food webs. In contrast to previous studies that focused on single trophic levels, we found that productivity is either idiosyncratic or increases with respect to species richness, and that richness influences trophic structure. However, the composition of species within richness levels can have equally or more marked effects on ecosystems than average effects of richness per se. Indirect evidence suggests that richness and associated changes in species composition affect ecosystem attributes through indirect effects and trophic interactions among species, features that are highly characteristic of natural, complex ecosystems.},

The new method uses pre-existing techniques and computer programs of canonical ordination. The intrinsic spatial component of com- munity structure is partialled out of the species-environment relationship in order to see if the environmental control model still holds. The method is illustrated using oribatid mites in a peat blanket, forest vegetation data, and aquatic heterotrophic bacteria. In this latter example, the new method is shown to be complementary to another approach based on partial Mantel tests. Key},

Five fish species and nine zooplankters were sampled from the lakes. Lakes depth was related to the distribution of zooplankton in that smaller zooplankton species were found in deep lakes and large species in shallow lakes. Neither ionic strength nor chlorophyll was a major factor in zooplankton presence or absence. When fish were present, few, if any, very large zooplankton occurred together. However, the relationship between the presence and density of smaller-sized zooplankton species and the presence of specific species of fish was complex and did not fit anticipated patterns. The diversity of zooplankton in these arctic lakes was not related to chemistry of fish distribution, but species richness increased with increasing lake area and depth. For a few zooplankters (notably Holopedium gibberum), the fraction of lakes containing the zooplankter varied by region.},

We compared temporal abundance distributions of two communities, phytoplankton and fish, in a north temperate lake. We used both 17 years of observed relative abundance data as well as resampled data from Monte Carlo simulations to account for the possible effects of non-detection of rare species. Similar to what has been found in other communities, phytoplankton and fish species that appeared more frequently were generally more abundant than rare species. However, neither community exhibited two distinct groups of "core" (common occurrence and high abundance) and "occasional" (rare occurrence and low abundance) species. Both observed and resampled data show that the phytoplankton community was dominated by occasional species appearing in only one year that exhibited large variation in their abundances, while the fish community was dominated by core species occurring in all 17 years at high abundances. We hypothesize that the life-history traits that enable phytoplankton to persist in highly dynamic environments may result in communities dominated by occasional species capable of reaching high abundances when conditions allow. Conversely, longer turnover times and broad environmental tolerances of fish may result in communities dominated by core species structured primarily by competitive interactions.},

  abstract = {Carbon of terrestrial origin often makes up a significant share of consumer biomass in unproductive lake ecosystems. However, the mechanisms for terrestrial support of lake secondary production are largely unclear. By using a modelling approach, we show that terrestrial export of dissolved labile low molecular weight carbon (LMWC) compounds supported 80\% (34-95\%), 54\% (19-90\%) and 23\% (7-45\%) of the secondary production by bacteria, protozoa and metazoa, respectively, in a 7-km(2) boreal lake (conservative to liberal estimates in brackets). Bacterial growth on LMWC was of similar magnitude as that of primary production (PP), and grazing on bacteria effectively channelled the LMWC carbon to higher trophic levels. We suggest that rapid turnover of forest LMWC pools enables continuous export of fresh photosynthates and other labile metabolites to aquatic systems, and that substantial transfer of LMWC from terrestrial sources to lake consumers can occur within a few days. Sequestration of LMWC of terrestrial origin, thus, helps explain high shares of terrestrial carbon in lake organisms and implies that lake food webs can be closely dependent on recent terrestrial PP.},

  abstract = {The distribution of organisms can be regulated by local environmental factors and regional processes such as dispersal. Here, we review recent work on the role of dispersal for generating population and community structure in freshwater zooplankton. We examine evidence for different mechanisms of dispersal among lakes, for the effects of dispersal limitations on populations and communities, and for the effects of spatial scale on dispersal rates. Zooplankton move via human or animal vectors, flowing surface waters, and wind; the relative importance of the different modes of transport is poorly understood. Several lines of evidence suggest that dispersal among lakes separated over short spatial scales ($\backslash$textless10 km) is sufficiently rapid that local interactions should limit species diversity and composition more than the supply of colonists. However, dispersal limitation over broad scales (tens to thousands of kilometers) might constrain geographic ranges and influence community structure. The current explosion in the incidence of exotic species indicates that such global- or continental-scale dispersal was limiting in the past. The spread of exotic species also provides opportunities to study the scale dependence of zooplankton dispersal. We show how patterns of range expansion can be used to estimate the change in invasion likelihood with distance to a source population. Such dispersal functions provide a crucial link between small-scale experimental studies and broad-scale geographic patterns.

We recognize a common pattern of phylogenetic conservatism in ecological character and highlight the challenges of using phylogenies of partial lineages. We also review phylogenetic approaches to three emergent properties of communities: species diversity, relative abundance distributions, and range sizes. Methodological advances in phylogenetic supertree construction, character reconstruction, null models for community assembly and character evolution, and metrics of community phylogenetic structure underlie the recent progress in these areas. We highlight the potential for community ecologists to benefit from phylogenetic knowledge and suggest several avenues for future research.},

Individual ecosystem functions generally show a positive asymptotic relationship with increasing biodiversity, suggesting that some species are redundant. However, ecosystems are managed and conserved for multiple functions, which may require greater biodiversity. Here we present an analysis of published data from grassland biodiversity experiments, and show that ecosystem multifunctionality does require greater numbers of species. We analysed each ecosystem function alone to identify species with desirable effects. We then calculated the number of species with positive effects for all possible combinations of functions. Our results show appreciable differences in the sets of species influencing different ecosystem functions, with average proportional overlap of about 0.2 to 0.5. Consequently, as more ecosystem processes were included in our analysis, more species were found to affect overall functioning. Specifically, for all of the analysed experiments, there was a positive saturating relationship between the number of ecosystem processes considered and the number of species influencing overall functioning. We conclude that because different species often influence different functions, studies focusing on individual processes in isolation will underestimate levels of biodiversity required to maintain multifunctional ecosystems.},

  abstract = {The global decline of biodiversity caused by human domination of ecosystems worldwide is supposed to alter important process rates and state variables in these ecosystems. However, there is considerable debate on the prevalence and importance of biodiversity effects on ecosystem function (BDEF). Here, we argue that much of the debate stems from two major shortcomings. First, most studies do not directly link the traits leading to increased or decreased function to the traits needed for species coexistence and dominance. We argue that implementing a trait-based approach and broadening the perception of diversity to include trait dissimilarity or trait divergence will result in more realistic predictions on the consequences of altered biodiversity. Second, the empirical and theoretical studies do not reflect the complexity of natural ecosystems, which makes it difficult to transfer the results to natural situations of species loss. We review how different aspects of complexity (trophic structure, multifunctionality, spatial or temporal heterogeneity, and spatial population dynamics) alter our perception of BDEF. We propose future research avenues concisely testing whether acknowledging this complexity will strengthen the observed biodiversity effects. Finally, we propose that a major future task is to disentangle biodiversity effects on ecosystem function from direct changes in function due to human alterations of abiotic constraints.},

  abstract = {Among the most studied relationships in ecology are those of population density with (1) body size and (2) species distribution. The first relationship, in conjunction with metabolic rate, determines the energy flows through species communities, whereas the second relationship shows how local communities are influenced by the species history of dispersal and establishment. Traditionally, these two relationships have been examined separately. Here, I explored how diatom density was affected by cell size (biovolume) and species distribution in benthic and planktonic stream habitats all the way from individual localities and hydrologic systems (regions) to the entire United States. At all scales, density was predominantly a negative function of biovolume and a positive function of distribution. Biovolume was more strongly related to density in the benthos than in the phytoplankton. Partial regressions revealed that biovolume, by itself, explained a substantially higher percentage of the variance in density at local than at regional and continental scales. Conversely, species distribution was a much more important descriptor of density at larger scales and a slightly better predictor than biovolume at local scales. At large scales density was explained primarily by distribution and, to a lesser extent and only in the benthos, by the covariance of distribution and biovolume, whereas biovolume was a marginal predictor in all habitats. This discovery suggests that the strong relationships between density and body size, reported for populations ranging from unicellular algae to mammals, may be less direct than previously thought but mediated by large-scale species distributions.},

  abstract = {Large-scale processes are known to be important for patterns of species richness, yet the ways in which local and larger scale processes interact is not clear. I used metacommunities consisting of five interconnected microbial aquatic communities to examine the manner in which processes at different scales affect local and metacommunity richness. Specifically, I manipulated the potential dispersal rate, whether dispersal was localized or global, and variation in initial community composition. A repeated-measures ANOVA showed that a low dispersal rate and intermediate distance dispersal enhanced local richness. Initial assembly variation had no effect on local richness, while a lack of dispersal or global dispersal reduced local richness. At the metacommunity scale, richness was enhanced throughout the time course of the experiment by initial compositional variation and was reduced by high or global dispersal. The effects of dispersal were contingent on the presence of initial compositional variation. The treatments also affected individual species occupancy patterns, with some benefiting from large-scale processes and others being adversely impacted. These results indicate that the effects of dispersal on species richness have a complex relationship with scale and are not solely divisible into "regional" vs. "local" scales. Finally, predictions of the manner in which dispersal rate structures communities appear dependent upon species compositional variation among communities.},

  abstract = {The increasing availability of phylogenetic data, computing power and informatics tools has facilitated a rapid expansion of studies that apply phylogenetic data and methods to community ecology. Several key areas are reviewed in which phylogenetic information helps to resolve long-standing controversies in community ecology, challenges previous assumptions, and opens new areas of investigation. In particular, studies in phylogenetic community ecology have helped to reveal the multitude of processes driving community assembly and have demonstrated the importance of evolution in the assembly process. Phylogenetic approaches have also increased understanding of the consequences of community interactions for speciation, adaptation and extinction. Finally, phylogenetic community structure and composition holds promise for predicting ecosystem processes and impacts of global change. Major challenges to advancing these areas remain. In particular, determining the extent to which ecologically relevant traits are phylogenetically conserved or convergent, and over what temporal scale, is critical to understanding the causes of community phylogenetic structure and its evolutionary and ecosystem consequences. Harnessing phylogenetic information to understand and forecast changes in diversity and dynamics of communities is a critical step in managing and restoring the Earth's biota in a time of rapid global change.},

  abstract = {In general the pooling of major taxa did not provide a basis for classifying zooplankton communities in 342 large Norwegian lakes, as neither cladocerans nor calanoids varied systematically with lake productivity or fish predation pressure. At the species level, most herbivorous cladocerans and calanoids, which constituted three quarters of the metazoan zooplankton biomass, differed in their preference for lake productivity and fish community and could be distinctly grouped according to these variables by canonical correspondance analysis. The analysis pointed out one oligotrophic and one eutrophic specialist among the herbivorous cladocerans, while two of the calanoids were oligotrophic specialists. The biomasses of cladocerans, calanoids, or daphnids were poorly correlated with both lake productivity and fish predation, whereas shifts in average size and species distribution could be attributed to these variables. At low lake productivity, chemical variables such as pH and Ca, as well as the species' physiological adaptations, appear as the main determinants for the competitive advantage and relative success of herbivorous species. Fish community composition changes with increasing lake productivity, bur only at very high fish predation intensity (cyprinid communities) did the effects of predation become the main determinant of the zooplankton community, superimposed on the lake productivity.},

  abstract = {A simulation model, recent experiments, and the literature provide consistent evidence that megafauna extinctions caused by human hunting could have played as great a role as climate in shifting from a vegetation mosaic with abundant grass-dominated steppe to a mosaic dominated by moss tundra in Beringia at the end of the Pleistocene. General circulation models suggest that the Pleistocene environment of Beringia was colder than at the present with broadly similar wind patterns and precipitation but wetter soils. These and other observations suggest that the steppelike vegetation and dry soils of Beringia in the late Pleistocene were not a direct consequence of an arid macroclimate. Trampling and grazing by mammalian grazers in tundra cause a shift in dominance from mosses to grasses. Grasses reduce soil moisture more effectively than mosses through high rates of evapotranspiration. Results of a simulation model based on plant competition for water and light and plant sensitivity to grazers and nutrient supply predict that either of two vegetation types, grass-dominated steppe or moss-dominated tundra, could exist in Beringia under both current and Pleistocene climates. The model suggests that moss-dominated tundra is favored when grazing is reduced below levels that are in equilibrium with climate and vegetation. Together these results indicate that mammalian grazers have a sufficiently large effect on vegetation and soil moisture that their extinction could have contributed substantially to the shift from predominance of steppe to tundra at the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary. Our hypothesis suggests a mechanism by which the steppe ecosystem could be restored to portions of its former range. We also suggest that mammalian impacts on vegetation are sufficiently large that future vegetation cannot be predicted from climate scenarios without considering the role of mammals.

In so doing we highlight evidence that demonstrates that (1) patterns of trait variation across resource and environmental gradients (light, water, nutrients, and temperature) probably reflect adaptation, (2) plant trait variation typically involves multiple-correlated traits that arise because of inevitable trade-offs among traits and across levels of whole-plant integration and that must be understood from a whole-plant perspective, and (3) such adaptation may be globally generalizable for like conditions; i. e., the set of traits (collections of traits in syndromes) of taxa can be considered as "plant strategies."},

In three different years, we found evidence for a metacommunity structure. We also found that spatial and environmental components act independently of each other due to the small Geographic area and the high dispersal rates in this system. Despite these homogenizing forces. local environmental variables (associated with alternative equilibria in shallow lakes) were strongly related with zooplankton community structure in the studied years. This suggests that, even in this system of highly interconnected ponds, local environmental constraints can be strong enough to structure local communities.},

Since Elton first noted that food-chain length was variable among natural systems, ecologists have considered many explanatory hypotheses, but few are supported by empirical evidence. Here we test three hypotheses that predict food-chain length to be determined by productivity alone (productivity hypothesis), ecosystem size alone (ecosystem-size hypothesis) or a combination of productivity and ecosystem size (productive-space hypothesis). The productivity and productive-space hypotheses propose that food-chain length should increase with increasing resource availability; however, the productivity hypothesis does not include ecosystem size as a determinant of resource availability. The ecosystem-size hypothesis is based on the relationship between ecosystem size and species diversity, habitat availability and habitat heterogeneity. We find that food-chain length increases with ecosystem size, but that the length of the food chain is not related to productivity. Our results support the hypothesis that ecosystem size, and not resource availability, determines food-chain length in these natural ecosystems.},

Our analysis of literature on major functional traits in phytoplankton, such as parameters of nutrient-dependent growth and uptake, reveals physiological trade-offs in species abilities to acquire and utilize resources. These trade-offs, arising from fundamental relations such as cellular scaling laws and enzyme kinetics, define contrasting ecological strategies of nutrient acquisition. Major groups of marine eukaryotic phytoplankton have adopted distinct strategies with associated traits. These diverse strategies of nutrient utilization can explain the distribution patterns of major functional groups and size classes along nutrient availability gradients.},

Factor analysis of the 22 measured physical and chemical variables reduced the data to six derived environmental factors: hardness, dystrophy, lake size, salinity, oligotrophy, and seasonality. The analysis showed that the low-pH lakes are associated with dystrophy and hence are likely to be naturally acidic. There was no evidence of anthropogenic acidification. Eight groups of co-occurring taxa were recognized from the data set, and all but two exhibited relatively consistent habitat preferences. It was suggested that the groups represent "species associations" in the sense that each group contains taxa that occur together because of similar requirements for a specific set of environmental conditions. Several lake types were identified as potentially influencing the distribution of phytoplankton in Labrador: small, dystrophic lakes; clear, softwater lakes; clear, hardwater lakes; large, hardwater lakes; and coloured, hardwater lakes.},

We proposed that relative variation in the abundance of zooplankton would be greatest among regions and lakes and least among years. We also explored how variability differed among functional groups and changed with taxonomic aggregation. Spatial sources of variation dominated the analysis, but a large interaction between lakes and years indicated that time cannot be ignored. Regional variation was half that found among lakes. Relative variance components differed widely among functional groups, which indicates that species will differ in their response to environmental controls and sensitivity to perturbation. Total explained variation also differed widely among zooplankton and decreased with increasing aggregation of taxa. Whether choosing ecological indicators or designing experiments and monitoring programs, these results clearly show that large-scale temporal and spatial variability will be an important consideration.},

  abstract = {Although spatial heterogeneity of zooplankton has been explained by variations in abiotic and biotic factors as well as their cascading interactions, few studies have paid attention to the relative importance of these processes in structuring the vertical and horizontal distribution of zooplankton within a lake. The main objective of this study was to determine the relative importance of abiotic and biotic processes in the regulation of the vertical and horizontal distribution of four size fractions (53-100, 100-202, 202-500, and $\backslash$textgreater500 mu m) of the zooplankton biomass in a bog lake (Lake Geai, Quebec). Spatial heterogeneity of zooplankton biomass was found in both the horizontal and the vertical dimensions of the lake, and spatial patterns were quite similar for all size fractions. On the horizontal axis, spatial heterogeneity was stronger in the epilimnetic stratum. Zooplankton biomass was mainly aggregated in the east side of the lake in an area of higher conductivity and greater density of small chaoborid larvae. On the vertical axis, zooplankton biomass was concentrated in the epilimnetic waters and decreased with depth. This vertical pattern of distribution might be due to the avoidance of cold and anoxic waters and a high density of large chaoborid larvae in the hypolimnion. In general, invertebrate predation has been identified as the primary factor regulating zooplankton biomass distribution in Lake Geai. However, the size structure of chaoborid predators was more important than their density in the control of the spatial distribution of zooplankton},

  abstract = {Six geographic regions along the Laurentian Great Lakes in Ontario, rep- resented by 286 lakes, were examined to identify the existence of regional similarities of fish species composition and their association to geographic location and regional patterns of lake morphology and pH. Lakes differed significantly among regions with respect to surface area, maximum depth, and pH. Species presence/absence data were summarized using correspondence analysis, and the resultant scores were used in multivariate analysis of variance and canonical variates analysis. These results indicated that the fish faunas of the six geographical areas were distinct. Interregional distances based on fish community scores, lake morphology-chemistry data, and geographical distances were contrasted using Mantel's test. Regional faunal similarities were correlated significantly with geographical proximity, but not with lake morphology. We propose that post-glacial dispersal and lake thermal regimes are important determinants in structuring regional patterns of fish assem- blages, whereas environmental conditions such as lake depth and pH assume greater im- portance in determining species compositions of individual lakes.},

MRT forms clusters of sites by repeated splitting of the data, with each split defined by a simple rule based on environmental values. The splits are chosen to minimize the dissimilarity of sites within clusters. The measure of species dis- similarity can be selected by the user, and hence MRT can be used to relate any aspect of species composition to environmental data. The clusters and their dependence on the en- vjronmentaldata are represented graphically by a tree. Each cluster also represents a species assemblage, and its environmental values define its associated habitat. MRT can be used - to analyze complex ecological data that may include imbalance, missing values, nonlinear relationships between variables, and high-order interactions. They can also predict species composition at sites for which only environmental data are available. MRT is compared with redundancy analysis and canonical correspondence analysis using simulated data and a field data set.},

  abstract = {1. A positive interspecific abundance-occupancy relationship is one of the most robust patterns in macroecology. Yet, the mechanisms driving this pattern are poorly understood. Here, we use biological traits of freshwater macroinvertebrates to gain a mechanistic understanding and disentangle the various explanations. We ask whether mechanisms underlying the abundance-occupancy relationship differ between species, and whether information on individual species can be used to explain their contribution to the interspecific relationship. 2. We test the hypothesis that the importance of metapopulation dynamics or niche differences in explaining the relationship differs between species, varying in relation to their habitat breadth. In addition, we analyse how a species' biological traits shape its habitat breadth and its abundance and occupancy. 3. The abundance and occupancy of the 234 different aquatic macroinvertebrate species were strongly and positively related. Marked differences were found between habitat specialists and habitat generalists in the goodness-of-fit of abundance-occupancy relationships. The occupancy-frequency distribution was bimodal for habitat generalists, allowing 'satellite species' to be distinguished from 'core species'. 4. Habitat generalists appeared to be more widespread but less abundant than habitat specialists, suggesting that the jack-of-all-trades may be master-of-none. Species traits (trophic position and other life-history traits) explained a significant part of the variation around the general relationship. Among habitat specialists, more species showed synchronized life cycles, a low dispersal capacity or clustered oviposition, being better adapted to predictable habitats. Among habitat generalists, more species had long-lived adults, spreading reproductive effort in time and space, and were strong dispersers, being better adapted to unpredictable habitats. 5. Interspecific abundance-occupancy relationships can be best understood by examining the contribution of individual species. For habitat specialists, the interplay between niche differences (diet and habitat use) and the underlying spatial distribution of environmental conditions result in competitive displacement and differences in species' success. For habitat generalists, differences in colonization and extinction rates between species are more important. Therefore, both metapopulation dynamics and niche differences can operate simultaneously but apply to different species, thus constituting different endpoints of the same continuum.},

  abstract = {Ecologists have searched for general principles, or assembly rules, which determine how species combine to form communities. Two major strands of research highlight the interaction of assembly rules operating at different levels of community organisation, and within uncertain local and historical contingencies. Here, we review the literature on community assembly within the context of three principal determinants: dispersal constraints, environmental constraints and internal dynamics. This classification separates external factors (dispersal and environmental constraints) from internal processes (internal dynamics). We assert that assembly rules are general, deterministic and mechanistic, and operate on internal dynamics within the constraints imposed by the local environment and the history of species invasions. Several assembly rules have been proposed to operate within and across trophic levels, as well as on whole systems. The rules act through resource dynamics and spatial dynamics to select species or subsets of species that can coexist, and may lead to patterns of increasing biomass and non-random spatial distributions. Environmental constraints restrict species establishment and mediate interactions among successful colonists; a change in environmental constraints, either exogenous or endogenous, may drive community change. Even in systems at equilibrium, environmental constraints influence the outcome of assembly rules. Dispersal constraints determine the pool of potential colonists available at a particular time and place, and are a complex amalgam of species-specific traits, storage effects, landscape ecology, and history. The order and timing of species invasions (dispersal constraints) interact with assembly rules to produce priority effects. The directionality of community assembly may be lost if either the rate of species invasions or the rate of non-selective species extinctions exceeds the rate at which species are selected by assembly rules. The falling apart, or disassembly, of a community through breakdown of species interactions may follow different rules or a different assembly trajectory.

Lake-specific ratios between turbidity (light scattering) and color (light absorption) explained 52\% of the variation (P $\backslash$textless 0.0001) in K(d) x SD values, which ranged as a continuum between 0.52 and 3.83. A clear-water median value of 1.86 (range, 1.13-3.26) is elevated by color to a median of 2.70 (range, 1.81-3.83), whereas turbidity reduces the median value of 0.93 (range, 0.52-2.56). EZD:SD, PAR at the SD depth, and PAR reflection (backscatter) also changed with the turbidity-to-color ratio. The nearly 10-fold ranges between K(d) x SD (0.59-4.09) and EZD:SD (0.89-8.67) values taken from 35 studies on lakes, estuaries, and oceans could be explained by color and turbidity differences. Background attenuation from small amounts of color ($\backslash$textless 10 Pt units) and turbidity ($\backslash$textless 5 NTU) uncoupled SD and SP measurements from changes in Chl a, limiting their use as an index of trophic state. Changes in K(d) x SD can serve, however, as a useful index of system loading by turbid particulate material or organic color.},

Forty-seven CTD stations covering the whole estuary were sampled from 5 to 16 November 2001. At 31 stations, dissolved oxygen concentration, pH, and light intensity at 50 cm depth intervals were recorded in situ; also, samples were taken for measurement of dissolved nutrient levels (nitrate, ammonium, phosphate, and silicate), suspended particulate matter and particulate organic matter loads, chlorophyll (a, b, and c) concentration, and phytoplankton identification. Stations ordination (multi-dimensional scaling, MDS, analysis) on environmental data suggested two main groups (upper-middle and lower estuary) but stressed the gradual change of conditions along the ecosystem. MDS on pigment data suggested a tendency for higher biomass levels in the lower estuary; MDS based on species indicated two main groups corresponding to lower and upper-middle estuarine stations. Spearman rank correlations of environmental and pigment similarity matrices suggested that salinity, the ratio of mixed to photic depth, and nitrates were the variables best explaining pigments distribution; in turn, the variables best explaining species distribution were salinity and seston. Results suggest an overriding importance of salinity-light gradients in modulating biomass levels and species distribution in the R??o de la Plata. This result is consistent with processes known to modulate phytoplankton distribution and production in other highly turbid estuaries. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Previous studies indicate that excessive nutrient loading and warmer conditions promote dominance by cyanobacteria, but evidence from global scale field data has so far been scarce. Our analysis, based on a study of 143 lakes along a latitudinal transect ranging from subarctic Europe to southern South America, shows that although warmer climates do not result in higher overall phytoplankton biomass, the percentage of the total phytoplankton biovolume attributable to cyanobacteria increases steeply with temperature. Our results also reveal that the percent cyanobacteria is greater in lakes with high rates of light absorption. This points to a positive feedback because restriction of light availability is often a consequence of high phytoplankton biovolume, which in turn may be driven by nutrient loading. Our results indicate a synergistic effect of nutrients and climate. The implications are that in a future warmer climate, nutrient concentrations may have to be reduced substantially from present values in many lakes if cyanobacterial dominance is to be controlled.},

  abstract = {Understanding the conditions under which species traits, species-environment relationships, and the spatial structure of the landscape interact to shape local communities requires quantifying the relative contributions of space and the environment on community composition. Using analogous sampling of arboreal and terrestrial oribatid mite communities across a large spatial scale in a temperate rainforest, we quantified the variation in oribatid mite community structure relating to environmental and spatial factors, and tested whether terrestrial and arboreal communities demonstrated a difference in their patterns of community composition based on the assumption of differences in dispersal potential. The expectation that terrestrial oribatid mite communities are spatially structured while arboreal communities are environmentally structured was supported by our analyses at the level of variation in beta diversity, but not by assessing beta diversity itself. We found that terrestrial oribatid mite communities with active, cursorial dispersal demonstrate spatial constraint consistent with reduced long-distance dispersal opportunities and high environmental dissimilarity among sites. Arboreal communities, which potentially disperse long distances via passive aerial vectors, show a spatial signature associated with patterns in beta diversity and a correlation with environmental dissimilarities among sites. In the arboreal community, moisture content of the substrate, total tree height, and average sampled branch height were significant factors explaining beta diversity patterns. For ground-dwelling species, predator abundance and soil type were important local determinants of community variability. Both communities showed clear spatial structuring, suggesting that dispersal limitation continues to influence community composition across multiple forest watershed locations. Our results provide evidence of dispersal-maintained diversity patterns in response to local environmental factors in arboreal and terrestrial communities. The relative importance of stochastic dispersal assembly may be dependent on strong deterministic effects associated with micro-site and macro-site environmental variation, particularly across large spatial scales.},

Based on a survey of a set of recently created ponds in an area of approximately 18 × 25 km, we found multiple indications of dispersal limitation affecting the community assembly of microcrustacean communities. Spatial patterns in the community composition were better explained by the geomorphological structure of the landscape than by mere geographic distances. This suggests that ridges separating the network of valleys act as dispersal barriers, and as such may channel the dispersal routes of the studied taxa and, likely, also of their animal vectors. Dispersal limitation was further supported by a strong positive relationship between species richness and the abundance of neighboring water bodies, suggesting that isolation affects colonization rates. Finally, the apparent dispersal limitation of microcrustaceans is further corroborated by the observation of low colonization rates in newly dug experimental ponds in the study area.},

  abstract = {Aim The scale dependence of many ecological patterns and processes implies that general inference is reliant on obtaining scale-response curves over a large range of grains. Although environmental correlates of richness have been widely studied, comparisons among groups have usually been applied at single grains.Moreover, the relevance of environment–richness associations to fine-grain assemblages has remained surprisingly unclear.We present a first global cross-scale assessment of environment–richness associations for birds, mammals and amphibians from 2000 km down to c. 20 km. Location World-wide. Methods We performed an extensive survey of the literature for well-sampled terrestrial vertebrate inventories over clearly defined small extents. Coarser grain richness was estimated from the intersection of extent-of-occurrence range maps with concentric equal-distance circles around fine-grain assemblage location cen- troids. General linear and simultaneous autoregressive models were used to relate richness at the different grains to environmental correlates. Results The ability of environmental variables to explain species richness decreases markedly toward finer grains and is lowest for fine-grained assemblages. A prominent transition in importance occurs between productivity and tempera- ture at increased grains, which is consistent with the role of energy affecting regional, but not local, richness. Variation in fine-grained predictability across groups is associatedwith their purported grain of space use, i.e. highest for amphib- ians and narrow-ranged and small-bodied species. Main conclusions We extend the global documentation of environment– richness associations to fine-grained assemblages. The relationship between fine- grained predictability of a group and its ecological characteristics lends empirical support to the idea that variation in species fine-grained space use may scale up to explain coarse-grained diversity patterns. Our study exposes a dramatic and taxo- nomically variable scale dependence of environment–richness associations and suggests that environmental correlates of richness may hold limited information at the level of communities.},

  abstract = {1. We explore the relationship between patch occupancy and local abundance in a general model for regional population dynamics. We vary colonization ability and key demographic and habitat characteristics in order to explore the effects on abundance– occupancy relationships. 2. In populations in which colonization rates are very high, new habitat is rapidly colonized and there is a simple asymptotic relationship between occupancy and abund- ance, assuming that habitat quality and abundance are linked. 3. If colonization rates are moderate to low, as in metapopulations, there is similarly a positive relationship between occupancy and abundance, but there is a minimum abund- ance below which the metapopulation becomes extinct. 4. These responses are modulated by the occurrence of Allee effects, demographic sto- chasticity or depensatory effects: when such effects are significant, the metapopulation rescue effect becomes important, and regional occupancy becomes more sensitive to changes in local density. 5. Finally, in populations in which colonization rates are very low, there is no relation- ship between occupancy and abundance. 6. Our results emphasize two aspects of large-scale ecology as being key in generating positive abundance-occupancy relationships: (i) a relationship between average habitat quality and the proportion of habitat that is habitable; and (ii) the nature of colonization. It is important to note that colonization is a function of dispersal, fecundity, and local processes such as Allee effects, as well as the availability and isolation of habitat patches. 7. When an abundance–occupancy relationship exists there is typically a non-linear scaling from local to total population sizes at low population densities, and we discuss how this may be detected in real data, as well as its implications},

One of the most common explanations is variation in species' dispersal ability. However, the purported relationship between dispersal distance and range size has been subjected to few theoretical investigations, and empirical tests reach conflicting conclusions. We attempt to reconcile the equivocal results of previous studies by reviewing and synthesizing quantitative dispersal data, examining the relationship between average dispersal ability and range size for different spatial scales, regions and taxonomic groups. We use extensive data from marine taxa whose average dispersal varies by seven orders of magnitude. Our results suggest dispersal is not a general determinant of range size, but can play an important role in some circumstances. We also review the mechanistic theories proposed to explain a positive relationship between range size and dispersal and explore their underlying rationales and supporting or refuting evidence. Despite numerous studies assuming a priori that dispersal influences range size, this is the first comprehensive conceptual evaluation of these ideas. Overall, our results indicate that although dispersal can be an important process moderating species' distributions, increased attention should be paid to other processes responsible for range size variation.},

Brown's niche-based model, Levins' stochastic immigration-extinction model, and Hanski's core-satellite hypothesis (a modification of Levins' model) differ in relative spatial scales, and degree of stochastic variation in species distribution over time. To test the predictions of these models, we analyzed the regional distribution and temporal dynamics of plant species across 19 sites in tallgrass prairie over an 8-yr period. Spatial patterns of species regional distribution were bimodal each year, a pattern in accord with the core-satellite hypothesis. In addition, temporal patterns of species distribution within a site were also bimodal. The dynamics of the core-satellite hypothesis are driven by patterns of immigration and extinction. Extinction was positively related to richness, however, in contrast to the theory of island biogeography, immigration was not related to species richness. In addition, the variances in the differences in species frequencies from one year to the next were greater than three times the mean, a condition necessary for bimodality in the core-satellite model, for 88 of 135 (65.1\%) species. These results provide strong support in favor of the core-satellite hypothesis and imply that stochastic factors may be the primary determinant of plant species dynamics and plant community structure in grasslands at the scale of several kilometres. Evidence from prairie communities at much larger spatial scales supported the patterns predicted by Brown's niche-based model. Thus, these apparently competing models are, in fact, compatible when viewed at the appropriate spatial scale.},

Assessing the functional diversity of assemblages based on species traits requires the building of a functional space (dendrogram or multidimensional space) where indices will be computed.However, there is still no consensus on the best method for measuring the quality of functional spaces. Innovation Here we propose a framework for evaluating the quality of a func- tional space (i.e. the extent to which it is a faithful representation of the initial functional trait values). Using simulated datasets, we analysed the influence of the number and type of functional traits used and of the number of species studied on the identity and quality of the best functional space. We also tested whether the quality of the functional space affects functional diversity patterns in local assem- blages, using simulated datasets and a real study case. Main conclusions The quality of functional space strongly varied between situa- tions. Spaces having at least four dimensions had the highest quality, while func- tional dendrograms and two-dimensional functional spaces always had a low quality. Importantly, we showed that using a poor-quality functional space could led to a biased assessment of functional diversity and false ecological conclusions. Therefore,we advise a pragmatic approach consisting of computing all the possible functional spaces and selecting the most parsimonious one.},

Such a biotic change is particularly marked in isolated environments such as islands or isolated lakes. Most studies reported drastic changes between before and after human disturbances, but the dynamics of change in assemblage structure through the invasion and extirpation processes are rarely reported. Here we measured the aquatic ecosystem degradation through exotic species introduction and native species extirpation experienced by Lake Erhai (China) during the last 50 years using structural, functional and taxonomic distinctness biodiversity indices. Structural diversity (species richness) did not varied monotonically along the temporal gradient, due to an opposite trend between exotic species increase and a concomitant decline of native species richness. Functional diversity displayed unclear ascending trends driven by the introduction of exotic species having distinct functional traits than natives. Taxonomic distinctness indices exhibited an increase of the average taxonomic distinctness (Δ+), but a decrease of the variation in taxonomic distinctness (Λ+) through time. Structural, functional and distinctness indices providing complementary information on ecosystem degradation, we here proposed a new multifaceted degradation index integrating these three facets of biodiversity. Such an index provided an accurate representation of the faunistic changes experienced by Lake Erhai and might constitute a comprehensive way to measure ecosystem degradation through exotic fish species introductions and native fish species extirpations.},

Whereas most studies focus on small-scale variation in functional traits along environmental gradient, the effect of large-scale environmental filtering is less well understood. Furthermore, it has been rarely tested whether the factors that constrain the niche space limit the total number of coexisting species. We assessed the role of environmental filtering in shaping tree assemblages across North America north of Mexico by testing the hypothesis that colder, drier, or seasonal environments (stressful conditions for most plants) constrain tree trait diversity and thereby limit species richness. We assessed geographic patterns in trait filtering and their relationships to species richness pattern using a comprehensive set of tree range maps. We focused on four key plant functional traits reflecting major life history axes (maximum height, specific leaf area, seed mass, and wood density) and four climatic variables (annual mean and seasonality of temperature and precipitation). We tested for significant spatial shifts in trait means and variances using a null model approach. While we found significant shifts in mean species' trait values at most grid cells, trait variances at most grid cells did not deviate from the null expectation. Measures of environmental harshness (cold, dry, seasonal climates) and lower species richness were weakly associated with a reduction in variance of seed mass and specific leaf area. The pattern in variance of height and wood density was, however, opposite. These findings do not support the hypothesis that more stressful conditions universally limit species and trait diversity in North America. Environmental filtering does, however, structure assemblage composition, by selecting for certain optimum trait values under a given set of conditions.},

Nutrient enrichments of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus exhibited ratios of N:P $\backslash$textgreater 17:1, by atoms, to maintain P limitation. An unmanipulated reference lake, Paul Lake, revealed baseline variability but showed no trends that could confound the interpretation of changes in the nearby manipulated lakes. Herbivorous zooplankton of West Long Lake (piscivorous fishes) were large-bodied Daphnia spp., in contrast to the small-bodied grazers that predominated in Peter Lake (planktivorous fishes). At comparable levels of nutrient enrichment, Peter Lake's areal chlorophyll and areal primary production rates exceeded those of West Long Lake by factors of approximately three and six, respectively. Grazers suppressed pelagic primary producers in West Long Lake, relative to Peter Lake, even when nutrient input rates were so high that soluble reactive phosphorus accumulated in the epilimnions of both lakes during summer. Peter Lake also had higher bacterial production (but not biomass) than West Long Lake. Hydrologic changes that accompanied manipulation of East Long Lake caused concentrations of colored dissolved organic carbon to increase, leading to considerable variability in fish and zooplankton populations. Both trophic cascades and water color appeared to inhibit the response of primary producers to nutrients in East Long Lake. Carbon dioxide was discharged to the atmosphere by Paul Lake in all years and by the other lakes prior to nutrient addition. During nutrient addition, only Peter Lake consistently absorbed CO2 from the atmosphere, due to high rates of carbon fixation by primary producers. In contrast, CO2 concentrations of West Long Lake shifted to near-atmospheric levels, and net fluxes were near zero, while East Long Lake continued to discharge CO2 to the atmosphere.},

  abstract = {Productivity denotes the rate of biomass synthesis in ecosystems and is a fundamental characteristic that frames ecosystem function and management. Limitation of productivity by nutrient availability is an established paradigm for lake ecosystems. Here, we assess the relevance of this paradigm for a majority of the world's small, nutrient-poor lakes, with different concentrations of coloured organic matter. By comparing small unproductive lakes along a water colour gradient, we show that coloured terrestrial organic matter controls the key process for new biomass synthesis (the benthic primary production) through its effects on light attenuation. We also show that this translates into effects on production and biomass of higher trophic levels (benthic invertebrates and fish). These results are inconsistent with the idea that nutrient supply primarily controls lake productivity, and we propose that a large share of the world's unproductive lakes, within natural variations of organic carbon and nutrient input, are limited by light and not by nutrients. We anticipate that our result will have implications for understanding lake ecosystem function and responses to environmental change. Catchment export of coloured organic matter is sensitive to short-term natural variability and long-term, large-scale changes, driven by climate and different anthropogenic influences. Consequently, changes in terrestrial carbon cycling will have pronounced effects on most lake ecosystems by mediating changes in light climate and productivity of lakes.},

  abstract = {In urban and other built environments, management decisions serve as a prominent feedback between biodiversity patterns and human-controlled environmental variables. In this study, we used the metacommunity concept to assess the mechanisms that link zooplankton biodiversity to different management regimes in urban water bodies associated with the Baltimore Ecosystem Study Long-Term Ecological Research site (USA). In the summer of 2011, we sampled zooplankton in 21 ponds built for stormwater management. Ponds were classified as either unmanaged (n= 9) or actively managed (n= 12) for recreation and aesthetic value, where managed ponds received multiple chemical and algaecide applications to improve water clarity. We found managed ponds had higher local (alpha) diversity and lower spatial turnover in community composition (beta-diversity), and thus greater biotic homogenization than ponds that were unmanaged. We developed a lottery-based metacommunity simulation (MCSim) to assess how niche and dispersal dynamics could create the observed biodiversity patterns, and to assess whether biotic homogenization was related to management. A comparison of empirical and simulated diversity patterns suggests the zooplankton pond metacommunity was influenced by both dispersal and niche-based community assembly dynamics. Simulations showed that the observed biotic homogenization effect was expected based on the spatially aggregated distribution of managed ponds, but pond management was not likely exacerbating biotic homogenization in this system. Such insight is essential to understand how environmental management can affect biodiversity at local and regional scales.},

  abstract = {Diatoms are among the most diverse groups of phytoplankton in the ocean. Despite their widely recognized influence on ocean ecosystems and global biogeochemistry, little is known about the impact of this diversity on large-scale processes. Here, we examined the ramifications of between-species diversity by documenting the transcriptional response of three diatoms —Thalassiosira pseudonana, Fragilariopsis cylindrus, and Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries —to the onset of nitrate limitation of growth, a common limiting nutrient in the ocean. The three species shared 5583 clusters of orthologous genes based on OrthoMCL clustering of publically available diatom genomes. These clusters represent 30–54\% of the predicted genes in each diatom genome. Less than 5\% of genes within these core clusters displayed the same transcriptional responses across species when growth was limited by nitrate availability. Orthologs, such as those involved in nitrogen uptake and assimilation, as well as carbon metabolism, were differently expressed across the three species. The two pennate diatoms, F. cylindrus and P. multiseries, shared 3839 clusters without orthologs in the genome of the centric diatom T. pseudonana. A majority of these pennate-clustered genes, as well as the non-orthologous genes in each species, had minimal annotation information, but were often significantly differentially expressed under nitrate limitation, indicating their potential importance in the response to nitrogen availability. Despite these variations in the specific transcriptional response of each diatom, overall transcriptional patterns suggested that all three diatoms displayed a common physiological response to nitrate limitation that consisted of a general reduction in carbon fixation and carbohydrate and fatty acid metabolism and an increase in nitrogen recycling. Characterization of these finely tuned responses will help to better predict which types of diatoms will bloom under which sets of environmental factors.},

  abstract = {Although theoretical mechanisms permitting phytoplankton co-existence have been extensively examined, few empir- ical field tests exist. Competition theory predicts greater diversity when species occupy heterogeneous habitats creating spatial niches. In a whole-lake experiment, we deepened thermoclines in two of three lake basins to examine altera- tions to the degree to which major algal groups showed spatial overlap (SO), in the vertical water column, and the con- sequences for diversity. Deeper thermoclines were expected to lead to less SO if species selected different depth positions in the water column in the absence of a thermal barrier, but to lead to greater SO if increased entrainment of phytoplankton in the mixed layer occurred. Increased diversity was expected to accompany less SO. Phytoplankton SO was determined using spectral group depth profiles from a FluoroProbe, and community diversity was estimated using high-performance liquid chromatography-estimated pigment diversity on daily samples taken over a 3-week focal period during the stratified summer period. SO declined and deep chlorophyll maxima were thicker when thermo- clines were deepened. Unexpectedly, increases in SO preceded increased diversity by 5–7 days in all basins. This re- sponse likely arose from positive growth by most species within the unmanipulated deep chlorophyll maximum. The surprising result of our study, although supported by some theory, stresses the importance of large-scale field tests to validate hypotheses generated by resource-ratio theory.},

We removed fish from four alpine lakes in the Sierra Nevada in which both Hesperodiaptomus shoshone(a calanoid copepod) and Daphnia middendorffianawere historically present but had become locally extinct after fish stocking. After complete fish removal, D. middendorffianareturned to all four lakes, whereas H. shoshone failed to return in any of the lakes, despite diapausing eggs observed in the sediments of two lakes and a few individuals in the water column of one lake during the first summer after fish removal. We estimated the potential magnitude of the Allee effect, as it may have affected the recovery of H. shoshone, by comparing estimates of minimum founding population size of H. shoshone with estimates of actual founding population sizes of D. middendorffiana.It took 4 yr for D. midden- dorffianato recover to detectable levels in one of the four lakes, which we suggest was the result of a very small founding population. The latter was three to four orders of magnitude smaller than the minimum founding population size we calculated for H. shoshone, indicating the potential for a large effect of mate limitation on the copepod's ability to recover. H. shoshone might never return to these lakes without human intervention because of the com- bined effects of mate limitation and low rates of overland dispersal.},

  doi = {10.1002/ece3.1084},
  abstract = {Understanding and disentangling different processes underlying the assembly and diversity of communities remains a key challenge in ecology. Species can assemble into communities either randomly or due to deterministic processes. Deterministic assembly leads to species being more similar (underdispersed) or more different (overdispersed) in certain traits than would be expected by chance. However, the relative importance of those processes is not well understood for many organisms, including terrestrial invertebrates. Based on knowledge of a broad range of species traits, we tested for the presence of trait underdispersion (indicating dispersal or environmental filtering) and trait overdispersion (indicating niche partitioning) and their relative importance in explaining land snail community composition on lake islands. The analysis of community assembly was performed using a functional diversity index (Rao's quadratic entropy) in combination with a null model approach. Regression analysis with the effect sizes of the assembly tests and environmental variables gave information on the strength of under- and overdispersion along environmental gradients. Additionally, we examined the link between community weighted mean trait values and environmental variables using a CWM-RDA. We found both trait underdispersion and trait overdispersion, but underdispersion (eight traits) was more frequently detected than overdispersion (two traits). Underdispersion was related to four environmental variables (tree cover, habitat diversity, productivity of ground vegetation, and location on an esker ridge). Our results show clear evidence for underdispersion in traits driven by environmental filtering, but no clear evidence for dispersal filtering. We did not find evidence for overdispersion of traits due to diet or body size, but overdispersion in shell shape may indicate niche differentiation between snail species driven by small-scale habitat heterogeneity. The use of species traits enabled us to identify key traits involved in snail community assembly and to detect the simultaneous occurrence of trait underdispersion and overdispersion.},

  abstract = {Understanding dominant processes influencing microorganism responses to storm events aids in the development of effective management controls on pathogen contamination in surface water so that they are suitable for water supply, recreation, and aquatic habitat. Despite the urgent needs at present, numerous facets of microbial transport and fate are still poorly understood. Using correlation and multiple regression combined with spatial analyses, this paper evaluates the relationship between antecedent precipitation and discharge, TSS, and E. coli concentrations, and examines correlations between E. coli and TSS, as well as whether and how those relationships change along an urban and rural gradient. The urban watershed exhibited a faster and stronger response of streamflow, TSS, and E. coli to precipitation mainly due to its higher degree of imperviousness. In general, TSS was significantly correlated with E. coli concentrations, which linearly decreased as \% developed area increased, with large variation in regions with a high percentage of development, implying the more complex stormwater infrastructure and more variable pollutant sources of E. coli in the urban watershed. Seasonal differences for E. coli were noted. Specifically, summer showed a higher level of E. coli, which might be attributed to the higher temperature since E. coli is more likely to persist and grow in a warmer environment. Further multiple linear regression analyses showed the best E. coli prediction result for the largest, suburban watershed, using antecedent precipitation, TSS, and temperature as independent variables. The models are capable of explaining 60\% and 50\% of the variability in the E. coli concentration for the dry and wet season, respectively. The study not only provides more detailed and accurate characterization of the storm-period response of E. coli across an urban and rural gradient, but also lays a foundation for predicting the concentration of E. coli in practice, potentially suggesting effective watershed management decisions.},

There are, of course, theoretical difficulties in deciding exactly what we mean by a clearly defined community or a major habitat, and also considerable practical difficulties during ecological survey work in the field in separating genuine inhabitants from accidental visitors, especially as some of the latter may play a real part in the life of the community. The following analysis is made with clear realization that all community surveys to a certain degree set arbitrary limits to the radiating connexions between species. Such partly arbitrary sections of the larger system of interspersed habitats with their communi- ties will nevertheless show something of the typical structure, without supplying a complete story.},

Sampling at eight inland recreational lakes in Ohio was done in order to investigate using predictive models for Escherichia coli and to understand the links between E. coli concentrations, predictive variables, and pathogens. Based upon results from 21 beach sites, models were developed for 13 sites, and the most predictive variables were rainfall, wind direction and speed, turbidity, and water temperature. Models were not developed at sites where the E. coli standard was seldom exceeded. Models were validated at nine sites during an independent year. At three sites, the model resulted in increased correct responses, sensitivities, and specificities compared to use of the previous day's E. coli concentration (the current method). Drought conditions during the validation year precluded being able to adequately assess model performance at most of the other sites. Cryptosporidium, adenovirus, eaeA (E. coli), ipaH (Shigella), and spvC (Salmonella) were found in at least 20\% of samples collected for pathogens at five sites. The presence or absence of the three bacterial genes was related to some of the model variables but was not consistently related to E. coli concentrations. Predictive models were not effective at all inland lake sites; however, their use at two lakes with high swimmer densities will provide better estimates of public health risk than current methods and will be a valuable resource for beach managers and the public.},

  abstract = {Though many processes are involved in determining which species coexist and assemble into communities, competition is among the best studied. One hypothesis about competition's contribution to community assembly is that more closely related species are less likely to coexist. Though empirical evidence for this hypothesis is mixed, it remains a common assumption in certain phylogenetic approaches for inferring the effects of environmental filtering and competitive exclusion. Here, we relate modern coexistence theory to phylogenetic community assembly approaches to refine expectations for how species relatedness influences the outcome of competition. We argue that two types of species differences determine competitive exclusion with opposing effects on relatedness patterns. Importantly, this means that competition can sometimes eliminate more different and less related taxa, even when the traits underlying the relevant species differences are phylogenetically conserved. Our argument leads to a reinterpretation of the assembly processes inferred from community phylogenetic structure.},

  abstract = {Tropical tree communities present one of the most challenging systems for studying the processes underlying community assembly. Most community assembly hypotheses consider the relative importance of the ecological similarity of co-occurring species. Quantifying this similarity is a daunting and potentially impossible task in species-rich assemblages. During the past decade tropical tree ecologists have increasingly utilized phylogenetic trees and functional traits to estimate the ecological similarity of species in order to test mechanistic community assembly hypotheses. A large amount of work has resulted with many important advances having been made along the way. That said, there are still many outstanding challenges facing those utilizing phylogenetic and functional trait approaches to study community assembly. Here I review the conceptual background, major advances and major remaining challenges in phylogenetic- and trait-based approaches to community ecology with a specific focus on tropical trees. I argue that both approaches tremendously improve our understanding of tropical tree community ecology, but neither approach has fully reached its potential thus far.},

Much of what is known today about such relationship has been based on the manipulation of species richness. Other facets of biodiversity, such as functional diversity, have been neglected within this framework, particularly in freshwater systems. We assess the adequacy of different diversity measures, from species richness and evenness, to functional groups richness and functional diversity indices, to predict primary productivity in 19 tropical reservoirs of central Brazil, built to generate hydroelectric energy. We applied linear mixed models (and model selection based on the Akaike's information criterion) to achieve our goal, using chlorophyll-a concentration as a surrogate for primary productivity. A total of 412 species were collected in this study. Overall we found a positive relation between productivity and diversity, with functional evenness representing the only exception. The most parsimonious models never included functional group classifications, with at least one continuous measure of functional diversity being present in many models. The best model included only species richness and explained 24.1\% of variability in productivity. We therefore advise the use of species richness as an indicator of productivity in tropical freshwater environments. However, since the productivity–diversity relationship is known to be scale dependent, we recommend the use of continuous measures of functional diversity in future biodiversity and ecosystem functioning studies, in order to be certain that all functional differences between communities are being accounted for.},

Recently, similar patterns have been described for some groups of microorganisms, but the large-scale biogeographical distribution of freshwater phytoplankton diversity is still largely unknown. We examined the species diversity of freshwater phytoplankton sampled from 540 lakes and reservoirs distributed across the continental United States and found strong latitudinal, longitudinal, and altitudinal gradients in phytoplankton biodiversity, demonstrating that microorganisms can show substantial geographic variation in biodiversity. Detailed analysis using structural equation models indicated that these large-scale biodiversity gradients in freshwater phytoplankton diversity were mainly driven by local environmental factors, although there were residual direct effects of latitude, longitude, and altitude as well. Specifically, we found that phytoplankton species richness was an increasing saturating function of lake chlorophyll a concentration, increased with lake surface area and possibly increased with water temperature, resembling effects of productivity, habitat area, and temperature on diversity patterns commonly observed for macroorganisms. In turn, these local environmental factors varied along latitudinal, longitudinal, and altitudinal gradients. These results imply that changes in land use or climate that affect these local environmental factors are likely to have major impacts on large-scale biodiversity patterns of freshwater phytoplankton.},

The niche is defined as the combination of abiotic and biotic conditions where a species can persist. I argue that most biogeographic patterns are created by niche differences over space, and that even 'geographic barriers' must have an ecological basis. However, we know little about specific ecological factors underlying most biogeographic patterns. Some evidence supports the importance of abiotic factors, whereas few examples exist of large-scale patterns created by biotic interactions. I also show how incorporating biogeography may offer new perspectives on resource-related niches and species interactions. Several examples demonstrate that even after a major evolutionary radiation within a region, the region can still be invaded by ecologically similar species from another clade, countering the long-standing idea that communities and regions are generally 'saturated' with species. I also describe the somewhat paradoxical situation where competition seems to limit trait evolution in a group, but does not prevent co-occurrence of species with similar values for that trait (called here the 'competition-divergence-co-occurrence conundrum'). In general, the interface of biogeography and ecology could be a major area for research in both fields.},

The direct inhibitory effects of high UVR and low temperatures on montane phytoplankton are widely recognized. Yet little is known about the indirect effects of these two abiotic factors on phytoplankton, and more specifically whether they alter zooplankton grazing rates which may in turn influence phytoplankton. Here, we report the results of field microcosm experiments that examine the impact of temperature and UVR on phytoplankton growth rates and zooplankton grazing rates (by adult female calanoid copepods). We also examine consequent changes in the absolute and relative abundance of the four dominant phytoplankton species present in the source lake (Asterionella formosa, Dinobryon sp., Discostella stelligera, and Fragilaria crotonensis). All four species exhibited higher growth rates at higher temperatures and three of the four species (all except Dinobryon) exhibited lower growth rates in the presence of UVR versus when shielded from UVR. The in situ grazing rates of zooplankton had significant effects on all species except Asterionella. Lower temperatures significantly reduced grazing rates on Fragilaria and Discostella, but not Dinobryon. While UVR had no effect on zooplankton grazing on any of the four species, there was a significant interaction effect of temperature and UVR on zooplankton grazing on Dinobryon. Discostella and Dinobryon increased in abundance relative to the other species in the presence of UVR. Colder temperatures, the presence of zooplankton, and UVR all had consistently negative effects on rates of increase in overall phytoplankton biomass. These results demonstrate the importance of indirect as well as direct effects of climate forcing by UVR and temperature on phytoplankton community composition in mountain lakes, and suggest that warmer climates and higher UVR levels may favor certain species over others. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

The splits are chosen to minimize the dissimilarity of sites within clusters. The measure of species dis- similarity can be selected by the user, and hence MRT can be used to relate any aspect of species composition to environmental data. The clusters and their dependence on the en- vjronmentaldata are represented graphically by a tree. Each cluster also represents a species assemblage, and its environmental values define its associated habitat. MRT can be used - to analyze complex ecological data that may include imbalance, missing values, nonlinear relationships between variables, and high-order interactions. They can also predict species composition at sites for which only environmental data are available. MRT is compared with redundancy analysis and canonical correspondence analysis using simulated data and a field data set.},

  abstract = {As human population and resource demands continue to grow, biodiversity conservation has never been more critical. About one-quarter of all mammals are in danger of extinction, and more than half of all mammal populations are in decline. A major priority for conservation science is to understand the ecological traits that predict extinction risk and the interactions among those predictors that make certain species more vulnerable than others. Here, using a new database of nearly 4,500 mammal species, we use decision-tree models to quantify the multiple interacting factors associated with extinction risk. We show that the correlates of extinction risk vary widely across mammals and that there are unique pathways to extinction for species with different lifestyles and combinations of traits. We find that risk is relative and that all kinds of mammals, across all body sizes, can be at risk depending on their specific ecologies. Our results increase the understanding of extinction processes, generate simple rules of thumb that identify species at greatest risk, and highlight the potential of decision-tree analyses to inform conservation efforts.},

We used C and N stable-isotope distributions to define food-web structure in arctic lakes, and we compared that structure with results based on more traditional analyses. Although zooplankton species composition was similar across the eight lakes studied, the food-web structure varied greatly. In some lakes the copepod predator Heterocope fed on the herbivorous copepod Diaptomus as expected in a conventional food web. In most lakes, however, delta-N-15 data were consistent with Heterocope functioning as an herbivore rather than a predator. These inferences were supported by evidence from carbon isotopes and energy-flow data. Our study indicates that only two or three trophic levels exist in the macrozooplankton of these lakes, in comparison to five or six trophic levels reported in temperate lakes. Isotope analyses showed that actual food-web structure is poorly predicted from simple consideration of species lists and potential trophic interactions.},

They exhibit tremendous diversity of traits, ecological strategies and, consequently, impacts on other trophic levels and the cycling of materials and energy. An adequate representation of this diversity in community and ecosystem models is necessary to generate realistic predictions on the functioning of aquatic ecosystems but remains extremely challenging. We propose that the use of trait-based approaches is a promising way to reduce complexity while retaining realism in developing novel descriptions of zooplankton in ecosystem models. Characterizing zooplankton traits and trade-offs will also be helpful in understanding the selection pressures and diversity patterns that emerge in different ecosystems along major environmental gradients. Zooplankton traits can be characterized according to their function and type. Some traits, such as body size and motility, transcend several functions and are major determinants of zooplankton ecological strategies. Future developments of trait-based approaches to zooplankton should assemble a comprehensive matrix of key traits for diverse groups and explore it for general patterns; develop novel predictive models that explicitly incorporate traits and associated trade-offs; and utilize these traits to explain and predict zooplankton community structure and dynamics under different environmental conditions, including global change scenarios.},

These features make this community the most direct and earliest indicator of the impacts of changing nutrient conditions on lake ecosystems. It also makes them particularly suitable for measuring the success of restoration measures following reductions in nutrient loads. This paper integrates a large volume of work on a number of measures, or metrics, developed for using phytoplankton to assess the ecological status of European lakes, as required for the Water Framework Directive. It assesses the indicator strength of these metrics, specifically in relation to representing the impacts of eutrophication. It also examines how these measures vary naturally at different locations within a lake, as well as between lakes, and how much variability is associated with different replicate samples, different months within a year and between years. On the basis of this analysis, three of the strongest metrics (chlorophyll-a, phytoplankton trophic index (PTI), and cyanobacterial biovolume) are recommended for use as robust measures for assessing the ecological quality of lakes in relation to nutrient-enrichment pressures and a minimum recommended sampling frequency is provided for these three metrics.},

Reference lakes were selected based on low pressure from catchment land-use, low population density and the absence of point sources. Reference lakes had low phytoplankton biomass and taxa richness compared to non-reference lakes. In low alkalinity lakes of Northern Europe, the reference communities had high biomass proportions of chrysophytes and low proportions of cyanobacteria; in the Central European high alkalinity lakes, the biomass was distributed more evenly among algal groups. Indicator species analysis and similarity analysis listed 5-29 taxa indicating reference conditions. Indicator taxa differed especially between the low alkalinity and the high alkalinity lakes, but there were also country-specific differences. Most common indicator taxa for the northern reference lakes were chrysophytes (e.g. Bitrichia, Dinobryon). In the Central European reference lakes, diatoms (e.g. Cyclotella) were more characteristic. Despite the differences, there was a general finding that taxa present in reference lakes were often also present in non-reference lakes, but typically in lower biomass proportions; another characteristic of the reference communities is the absence of many taxa typically found in non-reference lakes.},

In this study, we address the hypothesis that this climatic warming affects deep, ice-covered lakes in the region by causing abrupt, threshold-dependent shifts rather than slow, continuous responses. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data show that lakes (one freshwater and four permanently stratified) on Ellesmere Island at the far northern coastline of Canada have experienced significant reductions in summer ice cover over the last decade. The stratified lakes were characterized by strong biogeochemical gradients, yet temperature and salinity profiles of their upper water columns (5–20 m) indicated recent mixing, consistent with loss of their perennial ice and exposure to wind. Although subject to six decades of warming at a rate of 0.5uC decade21, these lakes were largely unaffected until a regime shift in air temperature in the 1980s and 1990s, when warming crossed a critical threshold forcing the loss of ice cover. This transition from perennial to annual ice cover caused another regime shift whereby previously stable upper water columns were subjected to mixing. Far northern lakes are responding discontinuously to climate-driven change via a cascade of regime shifts and have an indicator value beyond the regional scale.},

  abstract = {Cyanobacteria are the Earth's oldest oxygenic photoautotrophs and have had major impacts on shaping its biosphere. Their long evolutionary history (≈ 3.5 by) has enabled them to adapt to geochemical and climatic changes, and more recently anthropogenic modifications of aquatic environments, including nutrient over-enrichment (eutrophication), water diversions, withdrawals, and salinization. Many cyanobacterial genera exhibit optimal growth rates and bloom potentials at relatively high water temperatures; hence global warming plays a key role in their expansion and persistence. Bloom-forming cyanobacterial taxa can be harmful from environmental, organismal, and human health perspectives by outcompeting beneficial phytoplankton, depleting oxygen upon bloom senescence, and producing a variety of toxic secondary metabolites (e.g., cyanotoxins). How environmental factors impact cyanotoxin production is the subject of ongoing research, but nutrient (N, P and trace metals) supply rates, light, temperature, oxidative stressors, interactions with other biota (bacteria, viruses and animal grazers), and most likely, the combined effects of these factors are all involved. Accordingly, strategies aimed at controlling and mitigating harmful blooms have focused on manipulating these dynamic factors. The applicability and feasibility of various controls and management approaches is discussed for natural waters and drinking water supplies. Strategies based on physical, chemical, and biological manipulations of specific factors show promise; however, a key underlying approach that should be considered in almost all instances is nutrient (both N and P) input reductions; which have been shown to effectively reduce cyanobacterial biomass, and therefore limit health risks and frequencies of hypoxic events.},

Total catch of fish per net (CPUE) in multi-mesh gillnets placed in the open water and the littoral zones was positively related with the nutrient level. Trout CPUE was negatively correlated with total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN). Zooplankton seemed largely influenced by fish, as high fish CPUE coincided with low zooplankton and Daphnia biomass, low average weight of cladocerans, low contribution of Daphnia to total cladoceran biomass, low ratio of calanoids to total copepod biomass and low ratio of zooplankton biomass to phytoplankton biomass. However, chlorophyll a was only slightly negatively related to Daphnia biomass and not to zooplankton biomass in a multiple regression that included TN and TP. Ciliate abundance was positively related to chlorophyll a and negatively to Daphnia biomass, but not to total zooplankton biomass, while no relationships were found between heterotrophic nanoflagellates and zooplankton. The relationships between fish abundance and nutrients and fish abundance and zooplankton:phytoplankton ratio and between chlorophyll a and TP largely followed the pattern obtained for 42 north temperate Danish lakes. We conclude that fish, including trout, have a major effect on the zooplankton community structure and biomass in the pelagial of the shallow oligotrophic to slightly eutrophic New Zealand lakes, but that the cascading effects on phytoplankton and protist are apparently modest.},

  abstract = {Published data on mean annual epilimnetic total N (TN) and P (TP) were analyzed to find how TN:TP varies with lake trophic status. TN:TP is high in oligotrophic lakes and very low in eutrophic lakes, declining in a curvilinear fashion with increased TP. Comparison of this trend with published N:P in lake nutrient sources suggests that TN:TP reflects the source of nutrients: the ratio is high in oligotrophic lakes because they receive their N and P from natural, undisturbed watersheds which export much less P than N; mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes receive various mixtures of nutrient sources that have lower average N:P; and very eutrophic lakes have N:P that correspond very nearly to the N: P of sewage. Two inflection points were identified in the TN:TP relationship (approximately 20 and approximately 100 mug TP liter-1) the first probably reflecting the large difference between TN:TP in nutrient export from undisturbed terrestrial ecosystems and that of meso- and eutrophic sources such as urban and pasture land runoff and sewage, and the second probably reflecting increased rates of denitrification in eutrophic lakes. Analysis of published manipulation experiments shows that N limitation is not only significantly more frequent in lakes of low ambient TN:TP (TN:TP mass ratio less-than-or-equal-to 14) but is also significantly more frequent in lakes with TP $\backslash$textgreater 30 mug liter-1.},

  abstract = {The eutrophication of freshwaters is a global health concern as lakes with excess nutrients are often subject to toxic cyanobacterial blooms. Although phosphorus is considered the main element regulating cyanobacterial biomass, nitrogen (N) concentration and more specifically the availability of different N forms may influence the overall toxicity of blooms. In this study of three eutrophic lakes prone to cyanobacterial blooms, we examined the effects of nitrogen species and concentrations and other environmental factors in influencing cyanobacterial community structure, microcystin (MC) concentrations and MC congener composition. The identification of specific MC congeners was of particular interest as they vary widely in toxicity. Different nitrogen forms appeared to influence cyanobacterial community structure leading to corresponding effects on MC concentrations and composition. Total MC concentrations across the lakes were largely explained by a combination of abiotic factors: dissolved organic nitrogen, water temperature and ammonium, but Microcystis spp. biomass was overall the best predictor of MC concentrations. Environmental factors did not appear to affect MC congener composition directly but there were significant associations between specific MC congeners and particular species. Based on redundancy analyses (RDA), the relative biomass of Microcystis aeruginosa was associated with MC-RR, M. wesenbergii with MC-LA and Aphanizomenon flos-aquae with MC-YR. The latter two species are not generally considered capable of MC production. Total nitrogen, water temperature, ammonium and dissolved organic nitrogen influenced the cyanobacterial community structure, which in turn resulted in differences in the dominant MC congener and the overall toxicity.},

Increased monitoring activities that focus on all major biological compartments are needed to quantify the present condition of Earth's aquatic resources and to evaluate the effectiveness of regulations designed to rehabilitate damaged ecosystems. Algae are an ecologically important group in most aquatic ecosystems but are often ignored as indicators of aquatic ecosystem change. We attribute this situation both to an underappreciation of the utility of algal indicators among non- phycologists and to a lack of standardized methods for monitoring with algae. Because of their nutritional needs and their position at the base of aquatic foodwebs, algal indicators provide relatively unique information concerning ecosystem condition compared with commonly used animal indicators. Algae respond rapidly and predictably to a wide range of pollutants and, thus, provide potentially useful early warning signals of deteriorating conditions and the possible causes. Algal assemblages provide one of the few benchmarks for establishing historical water quality conditions and for characterizing the minimally impacted biological condition of many disturbed ecosystems. Preliminary comparisons suggest that algal indicators are a cost-effective monitoring tool as well. Based on available evidence from field studies, we recommend development of taxonomic indicators based on diatoms (Bacillariophyceae) as a standardized protocol for monitoring ecosystem change. Both population- and community-level indices have inherent strengths, and limitations and information from both levels of biological organization should be utilized in tandem. However, further information concerning species tolerances to a variety of anthropogenic stressors is needed if autecological indices are to be used routinely for monitoring purposes. While functional measures (e.g. productivity) may also prove useful as monitoring tools, further investigation is required to characterize the reliability of alternative methodologies and to assess the consistency of these indicators under varying field conditions.},

The use of 12 aggregate zooplankton assemblage variables based on taxonomic group, body size, life-history stage, and feeding guilds improved the amount of the explained cumulative variance (63.2\%) over species data (40.3\%) in the first two axes of the ordination. In a second PCA the environmental variables were constrained with respect to the zooplankton variables. This analysis identified total phosphorus, chlorophyll a, cold-water fish assemblages, number of introduced fish species, piscivore numbers, and the percentage of disturbed shoreline as dominant gradients. Small-bodied assemblages represented by small cladocerans, rotifers, ostracods, nauplii, and cyclopoid copepodites were associated with the most disturbed systems. The pattern of distribution among large- and small-bodied taxa from the PCA was used to formulate metrics which were then correlated to the gradients.},

Samples were taken at a fixed site in the Hahnofer Nebenelbe, and the main channel was surveyed four times at right stations from Hamburg to the upstream limits of the brackish-water zone. Abiotic and biotic parameters were determined and correlated with rotifer abundance to gain information about the forces that structure the rotifer community in this dynamic environment. A maximum density of 2048 ind. l(-1) was observed at the beginning of June. More than 70 rotifer species were identified during the whole period, but only a few of them appeared at significant densities. The predominant species were Keratella cochlearis, which accounted for over 32\% of the total abundance, Keratella quadrata, Brachionus calyciflorus and species of the genera Synchaeta and Polyarthra. At the end of July Synchaeta bicornis appeared at the low density of 23 ind. l(-1) at the station farthest downstream. Except for this typical brackish-water species, all rotifers encountered belonged to freshwater taxa, which decreased in abundance rather rapidly toward the river mouth. From March to the middle of June, rotifers grazed predominantly on heterotrophic components of the microbial food-web, such as planktonic and aggregate-associated bacteria, detritus and heterotrophic flagellates. Toward the end of June, the chlorophyll a concentration increased sharply, and a new rotifer community established itself, feeding mainly on autotrophic organisms in the Elbe Estuary.

  abstract = {Summary 1. To study the bottom-up linkages in arctic lakes, we treated one side of a partitioned lake with inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus for a 6-week period each summer for 6 years starting in the summer of 1985. We took a variety of weekly measurements to determine the impact of the nutrient loading on the lake and continued weekly measurements for 2-6 years after the cessation of nutrient loading to observe the recovery of the treated side. The loading rates (2.91 mmol N m-2 day-1 and 0.23 mmol P m-2 day-1) were five times the calculated loading rates for Toolik Lake, located nearby. 2. In all 6 years of nutrient addition, phytoplankton biomass and productivity were greater in the treated sector than the reference sector. In the first 4 years of nutrient addition there was no flux of phosphorus from the mineral-rich sediments. This changed in the last 2 years of nutrient addition as phosphorus was released to the lake. 3. The response of the animal community to increased plant production was mixed. One of the four macro-zooplankton species (Daphnia longiremis) increased in number by about twofold in the first 5 years. However, the copepod Cyclops scutifer showed no response during the treatment phase of the study. The benthic invertebrate response was also mixed. After a 2-year lag time the snail Lymnaea elodes increased in the treated lake sector but chironomids did not. 4. Ecosystem response to fertilisation was not controlled solely by nutrient addition because phosphorus was not recycled from the sediments until the last 2 years of nutrient addition. Phytoplankton still showed the effects of nutrient addition in the recovery period and the hypolimnion of the treated sector was still anaerobic starting at 6 m in 1996.},

  abstract = {Recent investigations have shown that processes within the planktonic microbial web are of great significance for the functioning of limnetic ecosystems. However, the general importance of protozoans and bacteria as food sources for rotifers, a major component of planktonic habitats, has seldom been evaluated. Results of feeding experiments and the analysis of the food size spectrum of rotifers suggest that larger bacteria, heterotrophic flagellates and small ciliates should be a common part of the food of most rotifer species. About 10-40 per cent of rotifers' food can consist of heterotrophic organisms of the microbial web. Field experiments have indicated that rotifer grazing should generally play a minor role in bacteria consumption compared to feeding by coexisting protozoans. However, according to recent experiments regarding food selection, rotifers should be efficient predators on protozoans. Laboratory experiments have revealed that even nanophagous rotifers can feed on ciliates. Preliminary microcosm and chemostat experiments have indicated that rotifers, due to their relatively low community grazing rates compared to the growth rates of bacteria and protozoans, should generally not be able (in contrast to some cladocerans) to suppress the microbial web via grazing, though they may structure it. Filter-feeding nanophagous rotifers (e.g. brachionids) seem to be significant feeders on the smaller organisms of the microbial web (bacteria, flagellates, small ciliates), whereas grasping species (e.g. synchaetids and asplanchnids) seem to be efficient predators on larger organisms (esp. ciliates). Another important role of rotifers is their feedback effect on the microbial web. Rotifers provide degraded algae, bacteria and protozoans to the microbial web and may promote microbial activity. Additional experimental work is necessary for a better understanding of the function of rotifers in aquatic ecosystems.},

  abstract = {1. Oligotrophic Arctic streams are likely to be sensitive to changes in hydrology and nutrient inputs predicted to occur as a consequence of future climate and land use change. To investigate the potential consequences of nutrient enrichment for low-order Arctic streams, we added ammonium-N and phosphorous to a second-order beaded, tundra stream on Alaska's north slope. We measured responses in nutrient chemistry, chlorophyll a standing crop, and in the breakdown and macroinvertebrate colonisation of leaf litter over a 38-day summer period. 2. During the addition, nutrient concentrations immediately downstream of the dripper averaged 6.4 mum ammonium-N and 0.45 muM soluble reactive P. Concentrations upstream of the dripper averaged 0.54 muM ammonium-N and 0.03 muM soluble reactive P. Uptake of both nutrients was rapid. Concentrations were reduced on average to 28 \% (ammonium-N) and 15 \% (inorganic P) of maximum values within 1500 m. Standing crops of chlorophyll a on standardised samplers were significantly higher by the end of the experiment. Breakdown rates of senescent willow (Salix sp.) and sedge (Carex sp.) litter and associated fungal biomass were also significantly increased by nutrient addition. 3. Fertilisation resulted in four- to sevenfold higher macroinvertebrate abundance and two-to fourfold higher macroinvertebrate biomass in litter bags, as well as an increase in late-summer body mass of larval Nemoura stoneflies. 4. Our results are consistent with those of similar studies of larger streams in the high-Arctic region. Based on our short-term experiment, increased inputs of nutrients into these ecosystems, whether caused by climate change or more local disturbance, are likely to have profound ecological consequences. Longer-term effects of enrichment, and their interaction with other components of future change in climate or land use, are more difficult to assess.},

We demonstrate that increased deposition of inorganic N over large areas of Europe and North America has caused elevated concentrations of inorganic N in lakes. In addition, the unproductive lakes in high N deposition areas had clearly higher PB relative to the total phosphorus (P) concentrations illustrating that the elevated inorganic N concentrations has resulted in eutrophication and increased biomass of phytoplankton. The eutrophication caused by inorganic N deposition indicates that PB yield in a majority of lakes in the northern hemisphere is (was) limited by N in their natural state. We, therefore, suggest that P limitation largely concerns lakes where the balance between N and P has been changed because of increased anthropogenic input of N.},

Survival of larval cod is shown to depend on three key biological parameters of their prey: the mean size of prey, seasonal timing and abundance. We suggest a mechanism, involving the match/mismatch hypothesis, by which variability in temperature affects larval cod survival and conclude that rising temperature since the mid-1980s has modified the plankton ecosystem in a way that reduces the survival of young cod.},

Questions concerning the pace and impacts of climate change are thus central to many ecological and biogeochemical studies, and addressing the consequences of climate change is now high on the list of priorities for funding agencies. Here, we review the interactions between climate change and plankton communities, focusing on systematic changes in plankton community structure, abundance, distribution and phenology over recent decades. We examine the potential socioeconomic impacts of these plankton changes, such as the effects of bottom-up forcing on commercially exploited fish stocks (i.e. plankton as food for fish). We also consider the crucial roles that plankton might have in dictating the future pace of climate change via feedback mechanisms responding to elevated atmospheric CO2 levels. An important message emerges from this review: ongoing plankton monitoring programmes worldwide will act as sentinels to identify future changes in marine ecosystems. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper discusses the methods currently in use and introduces the principal response curves method, which overcomes the problem of cluttered graphical results representation that is a great drawback of most conventional methods. To illustrate this, two example data sets are analysed using two ordination techniques, principal component analysis and principal response curves. Whereas PCA results in a difficult-to-interpret diagram, principal response curves related methods are able to show changes in community composition in a diagram that is easy to read. The principal response curves method is used to show trends over time with an internal reference (overall mean or reference year) or external reference (e.g. preferred water quality or reference site). Advantages and disadvantages of both methods are discussed and illustrated.},

Here we used both neo- and paleoecological approaches to develop a fossil-based inference model for lake mixing depths and thereby refine understanding of lake thermal structure change. We focused on three common planktonic diatom taxa, the distributions of which previous research suggests might be affected by mixing depth. Comparative lake surveys and growth rate experiments revealed that these species respond to lake thermal structure when nitrogen is sufficient, with species optima ranging from shallower to deeper mixing depths. The diatom-based mixing depth model was applied to sedimentary diatom profiles extending back to 1750 AD in two lakes with moderate nitrate concentrations but differing climate settings. Thermal reconstructions were consistent with expected changes, with shallower mixing depths inferred for an alpine lake where treeline has advanced, and deeper mixing depths inferred for a boreal lake where wind strength has increased. The inference model developed here provides a new tool to expand and refine understanding of climate-induced changes in lake ecosystems.},

  abstract = {The performance of individual phytoplankton species is strongly governed by the thermal stratification's impact on vertical mixing within the water column, which alters the position of phytoplankton relative to nutrients and light. The present study documents shifts in phytoplankton structure and vertical positioning that have accompanied intensified long-term stratification in a natural ecosystem. Ordination analysis is used to extract gradients in phytoplankton composition in Lake Tahoe, an extremely nutrient-poor lake, over a 23-year period of records. Community structure in the 1980s was associated most strongly with resource availability (low nitrogen to phosphorus ratios, deeper euphotic zone depth), while intensified stratification dominated the phytoplankton structure since the late 1990s. Within diatoms, small-sized cells increased with reduced mixing, suggesting that suppressed turbulence provides them with a competitive advantage over large-sized cells. Among the morphologically diverse chlorophytes, filamentous and coenobial forms were favored under intensified stratification. The selection for small-sized diatoms is accompanied by a shoaling trend in their vertical position in the water column. In contrast, the motile flagellates displayed a deeper vertical positioning in recent years, indicating that optimal growth conditions shifted likely due to reduced upwelling of nutrients. As the thermal stratification of lakes and oceans is strongly linked to climate variables, the present study confirms that climate warming will alter phytoplankton structure and dynamics largely through effects on nutrient availability and sinking velocities. Intensified stratification should favor the expansion of small-sized species and species with the capability of buoyancy regulation, which may alter primary productivity, nutrient recycling, and higher trophic productivity.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY 1. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are almost exclusively synthesized by plants. Animals can convert from one form of PUFA to another through elongation and desaturation, but very few can synthesize PUFA de novo. PUFA play an important role in regulating cell membrane properties, serve as precursors for important animal hormones and are essential for animals. 2. In aquaculture studies, highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA), a subset of PUFA, have been found to be critical for maintaining high growth, survival and reproductive rates and high food conversion efficiencies for a wide variety of marine and freshwater organisms. 3. The plankton literature suggests high food-quality algae species are rich in HUFA and low food-quality algae are poor in HUFA. Adding semi-pure emulsions of HUFA to algae monocultures can markedly increase the growth rates of zooplankton feeding on these mixtures. 4. A study measuring zooplankton biomass accrual when feeding on natural phytoplankton found a strong correlation between phytoplankton HUFA (specifically eicosapentaenoic acid) content and herbivorous zooplankton production. 5. The aquatic ecology literature suggests that planktonic foodwebs with high HUFA content phytoplankton have high zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass ratios, while systems with low HUFA phytoplankton have low zooplankton biomass. Also, the seasonal succession of plankton in many temperate lakes follows patterns tied to phytoplankton HUFA content, with intense zooplankton grazing and ‘clear-water- phases' characteristic of periods when the phytoplankton is dominated by HUFA-rich species. 6. Herbivorous zooplankton production is constrained by the zooplankton's ability to ingest and digest phytoplankton. It is becoming increasingly clear, however, that much of the phytoplankton which is assimilated may be nutritionally inadequate. HUFA may be key nutritional constituents of zooplankton diets, and may determine energetic efficiency across the plant–animal interface, secondary production and the strength of trophic coupling in aquatic pelagic foodwebs.

  abstract = {Diatoms contribute to a substantial portion of primary production in the oceans and many lakes. Owing to their relatively heavy cell walls and high nutrient requirements, planktonic diatoms are expected to decrease with climate warming because of reduced nutrient redistribution and increasing sinking velocities. Using a historical dataset, this study shows that diatoms were able to maintain their biovolume with increasing stratification in Lake Tahoe over the last decades; however, the diatom community structure changed. Increased stratification and reduced nitrogen to phosphorus ratios selected for small-celled diatoms, particularly within the Cyclotella genus. An empirical model showed that a shift in phytoplankton species composition and cell size was consistent within different depth strata, indicating that altered nutrient concentrations were not responsible for the change. The increase in small-celled species was sufficient to decrease the average diatom size and thus sinking velocity, which strongly influences energy transfer through the food web and carbon cycling. Our results show that within the diverse group of diatoms, small-sized species with a high surface area to volume ratio were able to adapt to a decrease in mixing intensity, supporting the hypotheses that abiotic drivers affect the size structure of planktonic communities and that warmer climate favours small-sized diatom cells.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition to lakes and watersheds has been increasing steadily due to various anthropogenic activities. Because such anthropogenic N is widely distributed, even lakes relatively removed from direct human disturbance are potentially impacted. However, the effects of increased atmospheric N deposition on lakes are not well documented. We examined phytoplankton biomass, the absolute and relative abundance of limiting nutrients (N and phosphorus [P]), and phytoplankton nutrient limitation in alpine lakes of the Rocky Mountains of Colorado (USA) receiving elevated ($\backslash$textgreater 6 kg N x ha(-1) x yr(-1)) or low ($\backslash$textless 2 kg N x ha(-1) x yr(-1)) levels of atmospheric N deposition. High-deposition lakes had higher NO3-N and total N concentrations and higher total N : total P ratios. Concentrations of chlorophyll and seston carbon (C) were 2-2.5 times higher in high-deposition relative to low-deposition lakes, while high-deposition lakes also had higher seston C:N and C:P (but not N:P) ratios. Short-term enrichment bioassays indicated a qualitative shift in the nature of phytoplankton nutrient limitation due to N deposition, as high-deposition lakes had an increased frequency of primary P limitation and a decreased frequency and magnitude of response to N and to combined N and P enrichment. Thus elevated atmospheric N deposition appears to have shifted nutrient supply from a relatively balanced but predominantly N-deficient regime to a more consistently P-limited regime in Colorado alpine lakes. This adds to accumulating evidence that sustained N deposition may have important effects on lake phytoplankton communities and plankton-based food webs by shifting the quantitative and qualitative nature of nutrient limitation.},

This parallels the post-19th century Arctic warming detected by examination of long-term instrumental series, historical records of ice cover and tree- ring measurements. The change was predominantly from benthos to plankton and affected the overall diatom species richness. A particularly strong relationship was found between spring temperatures and compositional structure of diatoms. The change is irrespective of the lake type and catchment characteristics, and is reflected by several other biological indicators, such as chrysophytes and zooplankton, suggesting that entire lake ecosystems have been affected. No corresponding change in the diatom-inferred lake-water pH was observed; hence, atmospheric fallout of acid substances cannot have been the driving force for the observed biological change. The mechanism behind the diatom response is unclear, but it may be related to decreased ice-cover duration, prolonged growing season and increased thermal stability. We postulate that 19th century Arctic warming, rather than acidic or other anthropogenic deposition, is responsible for the recent ecological changes in these high latitude lakes.},

However, the possibility that climate is only one dimension of these unprecedented ecological shifts remains an untested possibility, especially given that current warming may not yet exceed maximum, naturally mediated, postglacial warmth. In this paper, we assess whether increased anthropogenic nitrogen (N) deposition from distant sources is contributing to directional changes in the biogeochemistry and ecology of two remote lakes on Baffin Island in the eastern Canadian Arctic. Paleolimnological analyses, including diatom assemblages and a suite of biogeochemical proxies (total organic matter, biogenic silica, organic N and C contents, and stable isotopic ratios) reveal a complex suite of progressive changes that are coherently expressed in both lakes. Diatom assemblages began to change as early as the mid-19th century, but major inflections in the biogeochemical proxies occurred significantly later, being most pronounced after 1950. Among these changes are increases in sediment organic matter, depletions of 2‰ in sediment δ 15 N, and decoupling of δ 13 C and δ 15 N signatures. It seems likely that climate warming, subsequently coupled to anthropogenic N deposition, is synergistically driving these ecosystems towards states for which no prior natural analogs exist.},

  abstract = {The relative abundances of small centric diatoms have increased in many Arctic lakes over the past century, with these changes commonly attributed to warming. However, the specific mechanisms by which diatom community structure is changing in response to warming remain unclear. We investigated the responses of two common centric diatoms to nutrient enrichment and incubation depth, the latter used to manipulate light availability which is a key factor that changes with altered mixing depths in lakes. We conducted 2 × 2 factorial experiments, manipulating nutrients (none added or N + P addition) and incubation depth (shallow or deep), and measured changes in growth rates and cell densities of Discostella stelligera and Puncticulata radiosa. A second set of experiments was conducted on D. stelligera in a growth chamber to separate temperature and light effects associated with incubation depth. Puncticulata radiosa was always more abundant in the shallow depth incubations, regardless of nutrient conditions. In contrast, D. stelligera responded most strongly to nutrient additions, and cell densities of this species were affected by interactions between nutrients and incubation depth or light. Our research suggests that processes that alter light availability (such as water clarity and water column stability) and nutrient concentrations are likely to play a major role in controlling the growth of small centric diatoms in Arctic lakes.},

  abstract = {We used chemical data (3,907 lakes) and phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a) data (225 lakes) from Swedish lake monitoring programs to assess the effects of atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition on nutrient limitation and phytoplankton biomass in unproductive Swedish lakes. There was a clear north-south gradient of increasing lake concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen, which was related to the pattern of atmospheric N input. On the basis of positive relationships between total phosphorus (P) concentrations and phytoplankton biomass we conclude that lakes in areas of enhanced N deposition are mainly P limited during summer. This relationship was not detected in lakes in pristine areas with low N deposition, which, together with experimental evidence from the literature, suggest possible N limitation. During summer, lakes in high N-deposition areas had clearly higher phytoplankton biomass relative to the total phosphorus concentrations compared to lakes in low N-deposition areas. Thus, in Swedish unproductive lakes, high atmospheric N input is reflected by increased lake concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and, possibly, by a shift from natural N limitation of phytoplankton to P limitation. Our results also reveal that increased N input has caused a eutrophication with higher phytoplankton biomass as the result.},

We conducted a life-table study using a Daphnia-microsporidian parasite model, feeding uninfected or infected Daphnia with either P-sufficient or P-limited algae, and assessed the impact of the two stressors on life-history traits of the host. Both infection and P-limitation negatively affected some life-history traits tested. However, under P-limitation, infected animals had higher juvenile growth rate as compared with uninfected animals. All P-limited individuals died before maturation, regardless of infection. The numbers of spore clusters of the microsporidian parasite did not differ in P-limited or P-sufficient hosts. P-limitation, but not infection, decreased body phosphorus content and ingestion rates of Daphnia tested in separate experiments. As parasite spore production did not suffer even under extreme P-limitation, our results suggest that parasite was less limited by P than the host. We discuss possible interpretations concerning the stoichiometrical demands of parasite and suggest that our results are explained by parasite-driven changes in carbon (C) allocation of the hosts. We conclude that the impact of nutrient starvation and parasite infection on consumers depends not only on the stoichiometric demands of host but also those of the parasite.},

In Okeechobee, the cyanobacteria proportion increased and the diatom proportion decreased with increasing TN:TP. In Taihu, cyanobacteria decreased with increasing TN:TP, but the opposite trend observed for diatoms was marginally significant. Okeechobee cyanobacteria increased and diatoms decreased with increasing NH4+:NOx, but no significant relationships between phytoplankton and NH4+:NOx were observed in Taihu. Both lakes had significant relationships between phytoplankton community structure and total nutrients, but these relationships were the opposite of those expected. Relationships between phytoplankton community structure and water quality parameters from the previous month resulted in improved relationships, suggesting a predictive capability.

Multivariate analyses of dissimilarity in assemblages of species are limited by problems of non-independence caused by reated use of the sample-units. Where rank-order procedures are used, no comparative quantitative measurements of dissimilarity at different scales are produced. An alternative method is described that uses the sample� average assemblage (or centroid). These estimates are themselves averaged to give centroids for larger spatial scales. Dissimilarities from the centroids at each scale are then calculated using independent replicates for each scale from those in each sample. The dissimilarity measures can the be examined by analysis of variance to detect spatial scales of differences for each sample at every level of hierarchy of scales. The method is illustrated using data from mangrove forests and rochy shores, involving up to 97 taxonomic groups (species, other taxa). DIfferences among assemblages at scales of sites (tens of meters apart) or locations at shores (hundred of meters apart) were identified. Consequences of different numbers of replicates are discussed, with some potential problems (and their solutions) in application},

Some violations have little impact on the results or ecological conclusions; yet others increase type I or type II errors, potentially resulting in wrong ecological conclusions. Most of these violations can be avoided by applying better data exploration. These problems are especially troublesome in applied ecology, where management and policy decisions are often at stake. 3. Here, we provide a protocol for data exploration; discuss current tools to detect outliers, heterogeneity of variance, collinearity, dependence of observations, problems with interactions, double zeros in multivariate analysis, zero inflation in generalized linear modelling, and the correct type of relationships between dependent and independent variables; and provide advice on how to address these problems when they arise. We also address misconceptions about normality, and provide advice on data transformations. 4. Data exploration avoids type I and type II errors, among other problems, thereby reducing the chance of making wrong ecological conclusions and poor recommendations. It is therefore essential for good quality management and policy based on statistical analyses.},

  abstract = {We present a new multivariate technique for testing the significance of in- dividual terms in a multifactorial analysis-of-variance model for multispecies response variables. The technique will allow researchers to base analyses on measures of association (distance measures) that are ecologically relevant. In addition, unlike other distance-based hypothesis-testing techniques, this method allows tests of significance of interaction terms in a linear model. The technique uses the existing method of redundancy analysis (RDA) but allows the analysis to be based on Bray-Curtis or other ecologically meaningful measures through the use of principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). Steps in the procedure include: (1) calculating a matrix of distances among replicates using a distance measure of choice (e.g., Bray-Curtis); (2) determining the principal coordinates (including a correction for negative eigenvalues, if necessary), which preserve these distances; (3) creating a matrix of dummy variables corresponding to the design of the experiment (i.e., individual terms in a linear model); (4) analyzing the relationship between the principal coordinates (species data) and the dummy variables (model) using RDA; and (5) implementing a test by per- mutation for particular statistics corresponding to the particular terms in the model. This method has certain advantages not shared by other multivariate testing procedures. We demonstrate the use of this technique with experimental ecological data from intertidal assemblages and show how the presence of significant multivariate interactions can be interpreted. It is our view that distance-based RDA will be extremely useful to ecologists measuring multispecies responses to structured multifactorial experimental design.},

The bacterial composition of stream epilithic biofilms across a range of different spatial and temporal scales both within and between streams and across the profile of individual stream rocks was characterised using a community DNA-fingerprinting technique (Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis, ARISA). The differences in bacterial community structure between two different streams were found to be greater than the spatial variability within each stream site, and were larger than the weekly temporal variation measured over a 10-week study period. Greater variations in bacterial community profiles were detected on different faces of individual stream rocks than between whole rocks sampled within a 9-m stream section. Stream temperature was found to be the most important determinant of bacterial community variability using distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA) of ARISA data, which may have broad implications for riparian zone management and ecological change as a consequence of global warming. The combination of ARISA with multivariate statistical methods and ordination, such as multidimensional scaling (MDS), permutational manova and RDA, provided rapid and effective methods for quantifying and visualising variation in bacterial community structure, and to identify potential drivers of ecological change.},

  abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) are increasingly envisaged as a tool to manage coastal ecosystems and fisheries. Assessment of their performance with respect to management objectives is therefore important. A number of MPAs provided conservation benefits for fished species. Observed benefits do not apply to all species at all times, and responses to protection are also highly variable among fish taxa. Among the many empirical studies on marine reserves, only a few designs considered 'before and after data' and spatial variation. In this paper, we are interested in assessing the effect of a no-take reserve on the reef fish assemblage in a northwestern Mediterranean example. Data were obtained from a three-year survey using underwater visual censuses (UVC), before and after MPA establishment. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) and multivariate regression trees (MRT) were used to evaluate the effects of reserve protection on the reef fish assemblage, while accounting for habitat. Modelled biological responses were abundances and diversity indices calculated at different levels of the assemblage. Significant effects were found for many of these metrics. In addition to PERMANOVA, univariate models provided more insight into the magnitude and direction of effects. The most sensitive metrics were related to large species and species targeted by fishing. These results may be used to choose the metrics that are more suitable as community-based indicators of MPA impact in the perspective of monitoring programs. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {ANOSIM, PERMANOVA, and the Mantel test are all resemblance-based permutation methods widely used in ecology. Here, we report the results of the first simulation study, to our knowledge, specifically designed to examine the effects of heterogeneity of multivariate dispersions on the rejection rates of these tests and on a classical MANOVA test (Pillai's trace). Increasing differences in dispersion among groups were simulated under scenarios of changing sample sizes, correlation structures, error distributions, numbers of variables, and numbers of groups for balanced and unbalanced one-way designs. The power of these tests to detect environmental impacts or natural large-scale biogeographic gradients was also compared empirically under simulations based on parameters derived from real ecological data sets. Overall, ANOSIM and the Mantel test were very sensitive to heterogeneity in dispersions, with ANOSIM generally being more sensitive than the Mantel test. In contrast, PERMANOVA and Pillai's trace were largely unaffected by heterogeneity for balanced designs. PERMANOVA was also unaffected by differences in correlation structure, unlike Pillai's trace. For unbalanced designs, however, all of the tests were (1) too liberal when the smaller group had greater dispersion and (2) overly conservative when the larger group had greater dispersion, especially ANOSIM and the Mantel test. For simulations based on real ecological data sets, PERMANOVA was generally, but not always, more powerful than the others to detect changes in community structure, and the Mantel test was usually more powerful than ANOSIM. Both the error distributions and the resemblance measure affected results concerning power. Differences in the underlying construction of these test statistics result in important differences in the nature of the null hypothesis they are testing, their sensitivity to heterogeneity, and their power to detect important changes in ecological communities. For balanced designs, PERMANOVA and PERMDISP can be used to rigorously identify location vs. dispersion effects, respectively, in the space of the chosen resemblance measure. ANOSIM and the Mantel test can be used as more ‘‘omnibus” tests, being sensitive to differences in location, dispersion or correlation structure among groups. Unfortunately, none of the tests (PERMANOVA, Mantel, or ANOSIM) behaved reliably for unbalanced designs in the face of heterogeneity.},

  abstract = {No-take zones (NTZ) provide an effective tool for biodiversity conservation and fisheries management. Increases in abundance and biomass within NTZs, with spillover effects to adjacent areas, have been documented. However, most studies occurred at highly connected sites near regions that can replenish the NTZ. In this study we assess NTZ effects within the Mona Island marine protected area (MPA), located within the Mona Passage, a partial biogeographic barrier. We used the robust asymmetrical before-after-control-impact (BACI) design to evaluate changes in population size for fishery target species four years after designation. Data on fish abundance and size were collected within randomly placed belt transects and roving surveys. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) and similarity percentages (SIMPER) were used to detect changes in the coral reef fish assemblage and structure. Responses in abundance and biomass were calculated at different levels of the assemblage grouped by body size or ontogenetic stage. Additionally, univariate models provided insight on the magnitude and direction of NTZ effects. Results indicate significant increases in locations both open and closed to fishing, predominantly in the abundance of small-sized species and early life stages suggesting a recruitment signal. Significant distinctive performance within two locations was observed, with one showing a higher contribution of medium and large-sized species over time. Mona Island's MPA is apparently achieving its goals of fish stock restoration despite its isolation, although more time, enforcement and monitoring are essential to confirm these trends. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Closure of areas to fishing is expected to result in an increase in the abundance of targeted species; how- ever, changes to populations of species not targeted by fishermen will depend upon their role in the ecosystem and their relationship with targeted species. The effects of protection on targeted and non-targeted reef fish species at the Houtman Abrolhos Islands, Western Australia were studied using baited remote underwater stereo–video cameras. Video images were collected from shallow (8– 12 m) and deep (22–26 m) reef sites inside a Marine Protected Area (MPA) at each of three island groups and from three replicate fished locations at each of these groups that span a temperate-tropical transition area. The MPAs were established in 1994 and vary in size from 13.72 km2 at the Pelsaert group in the south to 22.29 km2 at the Easter group to 27.44 km2 at the Wallabi group in the north. The relative abundances of 137 fish species from 42 families were recorded. Large differences in fish assemblage structure existed between MPA and fished locations, and also between shallow and deep regions. Targeted fish species Plectropomus leopardus, Lethrinus miniatus, Lethrinus nebulosus, Pagrus auratus and Glaucosoma hebraicum were more abundant inside MPAs than in areas open to fishing. Their abundance inside MPAs was be- tween 1.13 and 8 times greater than their abundance at fished locations. For non-targeted fish species many were more abundant in areas open to fishing, e.g. Coris auric- ularis, Thalassoma lutescens, Thalassoma lunare, Dascyl- lus trimaculatus, however others were conversely more abundant inside MPAs, e.g. Gymnothorax spp, Kyphosus sydneyanus, Scarus microhinos, Chromis westaustralis, Chaetodon spp. This study demonstrates that the removal of abundant targeted species from an ecosystem by fishing can indirectly impact non-fished species and alter the tro- phic structure of fish assemblages.},

  abstract = {Rotifer communities were examined from the open waters of the Laurentian Great Lakes between 1983 and 2006 in the first inter-lake comparison involving all five lakes. Seventy rotifer taxa were found in summer samples, although most ($\backslash$textgreater 80\%) individuals were drawn from the following taxa: Conochilus unicornis, Polyarthra vulgaris, Keratella cochlearis, Kellicottia longispina, Keratella crassa, Synchaeta spp., Polyarthra major, Ploesoma truncatum, Keratella earlinae, and Keratella quadrata. Distributions of Filinia longiseta and several species of Brachionus and Trichocera were restricted to regions of higher trophy, notably the western basin of Lake Erie, but most taxa were widely distributed, differing in relative dominance rather than presence or absence. Rotifer community structure appeared to respond in tractable ways to differences in trophic state, with the four most common genera exhibited the following preferences, in order of decreasing trophy: Polyarthra, Keratella, Conochilus, and Kellicottia. Recent oligotrophication in Lake Huron was reflected in decreases in Keratella dominance and increased dominance of Conochilus, while in Lake Michigan oligotrophication was associated with decreases in Polyarthra and Keratella and increases in Conochilus, and Kellicottia. In Lake Ontario, the appearance of the exotic predatory Cercopagis pengoi was strongly associated with dramatic reductions in Polyarthra, while more gradual sequential increases in the dominance of Keratella, Conochilus and Kellicottia were probably the result of decreasing trophic state. Bythotrephes was identified in multivariate analyses as correlating strongly with rotifer composition, although only in Lake Michigan was a clear relationship between the predatory cladoceran and rotifer species shifts observed. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Such contrasting elemental composition between, for example, algae and herbivores, or between different herbivores, generates a suite of ecological predictions and opens up new dynamical possibilities. Here we review studies relating to the nutritional physiology of aquatic herbivores, especially freshwater pelagic species, and we relate element content to secondary production and nutrient recycling. A variety of evidence from many types of studies-physiological modelling, whole-ecosystem surveys, laboratory growth studies, etc-is assembled into an internally consistent picture of mineral limitation of aquatic herbivores. Herbivores with high nutrient demands (the best example is probably Daphnia and phosphorus) appear frequently to be limited not by the food quantity or energy available to them but by the quantity of mineral elements in their food.},

  abstract = {Metabolic and stoichiometric theories of ecology have provided broad complementary principles to understand ecosystem processes across different levels of biological organization. We tested several of their cornerstone hypotheses by measuring the nucleic acid (NA) and phosphorus (P) content of crustacean zooplankton species in 22 high mountain lakes (Sierra Nevada and the Pyrenees mountains, Spain). The P-allocation hypothesis (PAH) proposes that the genome size is smaller in cladocerans than in copepods as a result of selection for fast growth towards P-allocation from DNA to RNA under P limitation. Consistent with the PAH, the RNA:DNA ratio was $\backslash$textgreater8-fold higher in cladocerans than in copepods, although 'fast-growth' cladocerans did not always exhibit higher RNA and lower DNA contents in comparison to 'slow-growth' copepods. We also showed strong associations among growth rate, RNA, and total P content supporting the growth rate hypothesis, which predicts that fast-growing organisms have high P content because of the preferential allocation to P-rich ribosomal RNA. In addition, we found that ontogenetic variability in NA content of the copepod Mixodiaptomus laciniatus (intra- and interstage variability) was comparable to the interspecific variability across other zooplankton species. Further, according to the metabolic theory of ecology, temperature should enhance growth rate and hence RNA demands. RNA content in zooplankton was correlated with temperature, but the relationships were nutrient-dependent, with a positive correlation in nutrient-rich ecosystems and a negative one in those with scarce nutrients. Overall our results illustrate the mechanistic connections among organismal NA content, growth rate, nutrients and temperature, contributing to the conceptual unification of metabolic and stoichiometric theories.},

  abstract = {Females, males and nymphs of Piona exigua were observed during prey capture and ingestion. The encounter radius of the mite was very small, allowing the escape of some crustaceans, such as the calanoid copepod Boeckella. Cladocerans, such as Bosmina or Chydorus, with little or no pre-contact escape response were the most vulnerable to mite predation. Preference values in size-selection experiments varied widely between individual mites. Adult mites presented with two sizes of Daphnia carinata generally preferred the smaller prey. When four sizes were presented simultaneously, however, the preferences of female mites for each size were not significantly different. Patterns of prey selection varied with predator age and sex; for example, female mites preferred Daphnia to Simocephalus, Ceriodaphnia and Chydorus, while nymphs showed a strong preference for Chydorus over Ceriodaphnia. When two prey types were present in equal proportions, differences in total prey density (range 5 or 10/1 - 30 or 50/1) did not alter preferences between the prey species. The preference of female mites for a particular prey type generally increased with increasing relative abundance of the prey type in each of three experiments (Daphnia: Ceriodaphnia, Ceriodaphnia: Chydorus, and Daphnia: Simocephalus). These results imply switching behaviour in these mites. Our results indicate the value of direct observation of predatory behaviour as an adjunct to prey selection experiments. It is also apparent that predatory behaviour in the presence of more than one prey type may not be predictable from that observed in single-prey situations. Predation rates on particular prey species were sometimes reduced in the presence of another species. The relative proportions of prey eaten when two species were present could not be predicted from the number of each species eaten when they were presented separately},

Maximum speed of all species was higher in the light than in complete darkness, likely due to a different level of activity of Bythotrephes. Contrary to treatments with Bythotrephes, mean and maximum swimming speeds of all species were similar to each other and the same in light and dark in treatments without Bythotrephes.

  abstract = {Aim An intensively debated issue in macroecology is whether unicellular organ- isms show biogeographic patterns different from those of macroorganisms. One aspect of this debate addresses beta diversity, that is, do microbial organisms exhibit distance-decay patterns similar to those of macroorganisms? And if so, is the decay of community similarity caused by spatially limited dispersal or by niche-related factors? We studied the community similarity of stream diatoms, macroinverte- brates and bryophytes across the same set of sites in relation to environmental and geographic distance. Location A geographical gradient of c. 1100 km in Finland. Methods We first identified the subset of environmental variables that produced the highest correlation with community similarities for each taxonomic group. Based on these variables, we used partial Mantel tests to separate the independent influences of environmental and geographical distance for distance decay of com- munity similarity, separately for diatoms, bryophytes and macroinvertebrates. Finally,macroinvertebrates were divided into three groups based on their different dispersal categories and a partial Mantel test was used to assess whether each of these groupswere differently affected by environmental versus geographic distance, i.e. is dispersal a key factor in tests of niche versus neutral models. Results The level of environmental control was by far the strongest for diatoms; however, all groups were controlled more by environmental factors than by limited dispersal. Macroinvertebrate species with low dispersal ability were significantly related to geographic distance, while more effective dispersers showed no relation- ship to geography but were instead strongly related to environmental distance. Main conclusions Our results suggest that patterns between macro- and micro- organisms are not fundamentally different, but the level of environmental control varies according to dispersal ability. The relative importance of niche versus dis- persal processes is not simply a function of organism size but other traits (e.g. life-history type, dispersal capacity) may obscure this relationship.},

  abstract = {Changes in marine plankton communities driven by environmental variability impact the marine food web and global biogeochemical cycles of carbon and other elements. To predict and assess these community shifts and their consequences, ecologists are increasingly investigating how the functional traits of plankton determine their relative fitness along environmental and biological gradients. Laboratory, field and modelling studies are adopting this trait-based approach to map the biogeography of plankton traits that underlies variations in plankton communities. Here, we review progress towards understanding the regulatory roles of several key plankton functional traits, including cell size, N2 -fixation and mixotrophy among phytoplankton, and body size, ontogeny and feeding behaviour for zooplankton. The trait biogeographical approach sheds light on what structures plankton communities in the current ocean, as well as under climate change scenarios, and also allows for finer resolution of community function because community trait composition determines the rates of significant processes, including carbon export. Although understanding of trait biogeography is growing, uncertainties remain that stem, in part, from the paucity of observations describing plankton functional traits. Thus, in addition to recommending widespread adoption of the trait-based approach, we advocate for enhanced collection, standardisation and dissemination of plankton functional trait data.},

  abstract = {The concentration and O-18:O-16 ratio of dissolved oxygen were measured for 23 rivers and lakes of the Amazon Basin during 1988, 1990, and 1991. With only two exceptions, the rivers and lakes had dissolved oxygen concentrations that were at 20-90\% of atmospheric saturation levels. The delta(18)O of the dissolved oxygen ranged from 15 to 30\% (vs. SMOW). The delta(18)O for the lakes were the lowest at 15-23\%. delta(18)O $\backslash$textless 24.2 parts per thousand (the atmospheric equilibrium value) are the result of photosynthetic oxygen input. The delta(18)O of the rivers, in contrast, ranged from 24 to 30 parts per thousand. delta(18)O $\backslash$textgreater 24.2 parts per thousand resulted from respiration. Despite this clear difference between the delta(18)O for rivers and lakes, these water bodies had similar levels of oxygen undersaturation. The delta(18)O and dissolved oxygen concentrations are used to determine the ratio of community respiration (R) to gross photosynthesis (P) rates. R: P varied between similar to 1 and 1.5 for lakes and between 1.5 and 4 for rivers. For all rivers and lakes, the measured delta(18)O indicated the presence of photosynthetically produced oxygen, with the highest proportion occurring in lakes. The delta(18)O of dissolved oxygen is a unique tracer of photosynthetic oxygen and provides, through a determination of R : P, a means of quantifying the heterotrophic state of freshwaters.},

  doi = {10.1890/12-0378.1},
  abstract = {A central challenge in community ecology is to understand the connection between biodiversity and the functioning of ecosystems. While traditional approaches have largely focused on species-level diversity, increasing evidence indicates that there exists substantial ecological diversity among individuals within species. By far, the largest source of this intraspecific diversity stems from variation among individuals in ontogenetic stage and size. Although such ontogenetic shifts are ubiquitous in natural communities, whether and how they scale up to influence the structure and functioning of complex ecosystems is largely unknown. Here we take an experimental approach to examine the consequences of ontogenetic niche shifts for the structure of communities and ecosystem processes. In particular we experimentally manipulated the stage structure in a keystone predator, larvae of the dragonfly Anax junius, in complex experimental pond communities to test whether changes in the population stage or size structure of a keystone species scale up to alter community structure and ecosystem processes, and how functional differences scale with relative differences in size among stages. We found that the functional role of A. junius was stage-specific. Altering what stages were present in a pond led to concurrent changes in community structure, primary producer biomass (periphyton and phytoplankton), and ultimately altered ecosystem processes (respiration and net primary productivity), indicating a strong, but stage-specific, trophic cascade. Interestingly, the stage-specific effects did not simply scale with size or biomass of the predator, but instead indicated clear ontogenetic niche shifts in ecological interactions. Thus, functional differences among stages within a keystone species scaled up to alter the functioning of entire ecosystems. Therefore, our results indicate that the classical approach of assuming an average functional role of a species can be misleading because functional roles are dynamic and will change with shifts in the stage structure of the species. In general this emphasizes the importance of accounting for functional diversity below the species level to predict how natural and anthropogenic changes alter the functioning of natural ecosystems.},

Here we use over two decades of data collected by the Palmer Long Term Ecological Research program (PAL-LTER) to determine how large-scale climate and local physical forcing affect phytoplankton, zooplankton and an apex predator along the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). We show that positive anomalies in chlorophyll-a (chl-a) at Palmer Station, occurring every 4-6 years, are constrained by physical processes in the preceding winter/spring and a negative phase of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). Favorable conditions for phytoplankton included increased winter ice extent and duration, reduced spring/summer winds, and increased water column stability via enhanced salinity-driven density gradients. Years of positive chl-a anomalies are associated with the initiation of a robust krill cohort the following summer, which is evident in Adélie penguin diets, thus demonstrating tight trophic coupling. Projected climate change in this region may have a significant, negative impact on phytoplankton biomass, krill recruitment and upper trophic level predators in this coastal Antarctic ecosystem.},

We measured gross and net primary production at Palmer Station during the summer of 2012/2013 via three different techniques: incubation with H2 (18) O; incubation with (14) CO2 ; and in situ measurements of O2 /Ar and triple oxygen isotope. Additional laboratory experiments were performed with the psychrophilic diatom Fragilariopsis cylindrus. During the spring bloom, which accounted for more than half of the seasonal gross production at Palmer Station, the ratio of net-to-gross production reached a maximum greater than c. 60\%, among the highest ever reported. The use of multiple techniques showed that these high ratios resulted from low heterotrophic respiration and very low daylight autotrophic respiration. Laboratory experiments revealed a similar ratio of net-to-gross O2 production in F. cylindrus and provided the first experimental evidence for an important level of cyclic electron flow (CEF) in this organism. The low ratio of community respiration to gross primary production observed during the bloom at Palmer Station may be characteristic of high latitude coastal ecosystems and partially supported by a very active CEF in psychrophilic phytoplankton.},

  abstract = {Studies indicate that bacterial taxa utilize different fractions of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool, while others suggest functional redundancy among constituents of bacterioplankton, implying only a weak coupling between community structure and function. We examined bacterial compositional and functional [ectoenzymatic activities and growth efficiency; bacterial growth efficiency (BGE)] responses to a gradient in bioavailable DOC (bDOC). This was achieved over 10 days in DOC utilization assays containing Baltic Sea water with variable amounts of natural bDOC. Measurements of bacterial growth, O2 and DOC consumption in the assays using non-invasive sampling showed that BGE changed over time and that the bDOC utilized accounted for 4-13\% of the DOC pool. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes demonstrated minor differences at the phylum level between samples, whereas larger successional differences were discernible at lower phylogenetic levels. Our study suggests that changes in concentrations of bDOC affect bacterioplankton BGE and community structure by selecting for some taxa while the relative abundance of most taxa remained unaffected. Ectoenzymes activities suggested preferential degradation of protein-rich compounds by bacteria, switching to carbohydrate-rich DOC when proteins were depleted. Hence, there was a fairly weak linkage between bacterial community composition and DOC utilization suggesting that overall bacterioplankton community structure only to some extent has predictive power for processing of the DOC pool.},

With the growing numbers of activities also comes a plethora of methodological knowledge and expertise that should guide future developments in the field. This review summarizes the current opinions in metagenomics, and provides practical guidance and advice on sample processing, sequencing technology, assembly, binning, annotation, experimental design, statistical analysis, data storage, and data sharing. As more metagenomic datasets are generated, the availability of standardized procedures and shared data storage and analysis becomes increasingly important to ensure that output of individual projects can be assessed and compared.},

A regular phenology was repeated across years, implying that freshwater bacterial communities are more predictable in their dynamics than previously thought. Seasonal events, such as water column mixing and trends in water temperature, were most strongly related to BCC variation. Communities became progressively less similar across years between the months of May and September, when the lake was thermally stratified. Dissolved oxygen and nitrate + nitrite concentrations were highly correlated to BCC change within and across seasons. The relationship between BCC and seasonal drivers suggests that trajectories of community change observed over long time series will reflect large-scale climate variation.},

To address this gap in knowledge, metagenomes from temperate lakes were compared to selected marine metagenomes. Taxonomic analyses of rRNA genes in these freshwater metagenomes confirm the previously reported dominance of a limited subset of uncultured lineages of freshwater bacteria, whereas Archaea were rare. Diversification into marine and freshwater microbial lineages was also reflected in phylogenies of functional genes, and there were also significant differences in functional beta-diversity. The pathways and functions that accounted for these differences are involved in osmoregulation, active transport, carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. Moreover, predicted genes orthologous to active transporters and recalcitrant organic matter degradation were more common in microbial genomes from oligotrophic versus eutrophic lakes. This comparative metagenomic analysis allowed us to formulate a general hypothesis that oceanic- compared with freshwater-dwelling microorganisms, invest more in metabolism of amino acids and that strategies of carbohydrate metabolism differ significantly between marine and freshwater microbial communities.},

For this purpose, we analysed a 16S rRNA gene library obtained by gene amplification together with a sequence library of both insert ends on c. 7700 fosmids. Whatever the library used, Actinobacteria was the most abundant bacterial group, followed by Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Specific aquatic clades such as acI and acIV (Actinobacteria) or LD12 and GOBB-C201 (Alphaproteobacteria) were found in both libraries. From comparative analysis of metagenomic libraries, the metagenome of this lake was characterized by overrepresentation of genes involved in the degradation of xenobiotics mainly associated with Alphaproteobacteria. Actinobacteria were mainly related to metabolic pathways involved in nucleotide metabolism, cofactors, vitamins, energy, replication and repair. Betaproteobacteria appeared to be characterized by the presence of numerous genes implicated in environmental information processing (membrane transport and signal transduction) whereas glycan and carbohydrate metabolism pathways were overrepresented in Bacteroidetes. These results prompted us to propose hypotheses on the ecological role of these bacterial classes in lacustrine ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Despite considerable attention in recent years, the composition and dynamics of lake bacterial communities over annual time scales are poorly understood. This study used automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) to explore the patterns of change in lake bacterial communities in three temperate lakes over 2 consecutive years. The study lakes included a humic lake, an oligotrophic lake, and a eutrophic lake, and the epilimnetic bacterial communities were sampled every 2 weeks. The patterns of change in bacterial communities indicated that seasonal forces were important in structuring the behavior of the bacterial communities in each lake. All three lakes had relatively stable community composition in spring and fall, but summer changes were dramatic. Summertime variability was often characterized by recurrent drops in bacterial diversity. Specific ARISA fragments derived from these lakes were not constant among lakes or from year to year, and those fragments that did recur in lakes in different years did not exhibit the same seasonal pattern of recurrence. Nonetheless, seasonal patterns observed in 2000 were fairly successful predictors of the rate of change in bacterial communities and in the degree of autocorrelation of bacterial communities in 2001. Thus, seasonal forces may be important structuring elements of these systems as a whole even if they are uncoupled from the dynamics of the individual system components.},

  abstract = {Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is an important optically active substance that transports nutrients, heavy metals, and other pollutants from terrestrial to aquatic systems and is used as a measure of water quality. To investigate how the source and composition of CDOM changes in both space and time, we used chemical, spectroscopic, and fluorescence analyses to characterize CDOM in Lake Tianmuhu (a drinking water source) and its catchment in China. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) identified three individual fluorophore moieties that were attributed to humic-like and protein-like materials in 224 water samples collected between December 2008 and September 2009. The upstream rivers contained significantly higher concentrations of CDOM than did the lake water (a(350) of 4.27±2.51 and 2.32±0.59 m(-1), respectively), indicating that the rivers carried a substantial load of organic matter to the lake. Of the three main rivers that flow into Lake Tianmuhu, the Pingqiao River brought in the most CDOM from the catchment to the lake. CDOM absorption and the microbial and terrestrial humic-like components, but not the protein-like component, were significantly higher in the wet season than in other seasons, indicating that the frequency of rainfall and runoff could significantly impact the quantity and quality of CDOM collected from the catchment. The different relationships between the maximum fluorescence intensities of the three PARAFAC components, CDOM absorption, and chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentration in riverine and lake water indicated the difference in the composition of CDOM between Lake Tianmuhu and the rivers that feed it. This study demonstrates the utility of combining excitation-emission matrix fluorescence and PARAFAC to study CDOM dynamics in inland waters.},

The two humic-like components showed different relations in lake and riverine samples. Their vertical distribution in the lake was affected by seasonal stratification and distance from water surface, presumably reflecting the release of humic-like matter from sediments, its production via NOM transformation in the bottom layers, and its photodegradation in the upper layers. Vertical distribution of the proteinous component, indicating biological activity at upper water layers, did not correlate with that of the humic-like components. Dissolved organic carbon concentrations did not show any vertical stratification, emphasizing the power of EEM to explore NOM dynamics.},

In anticipation of this milestone, the Fellowship for Interpretation of Genomes (FIG) launched the Project to Annotate 1000 Genomes. The project is built around the principle that the key to improved accuracy in high-throughput annotation technology is to have experts annotate single subsystems over the complete collection of genomes, rather than having an annotation expert attempt to annotate all of the genes in a single genome. Using the subsystems approach, all of the genes implementing the subsystem are analyzed by an expert in that subsystem. An annotation environment was created where populated subsystems are curated and projected to new genomes. A portable notion of a populated subsystem was defined, and tools developed for exchanging and curating these objects. Tools were also developed to resolve conflicts between populated subsystems. The SEED is the first annotation environment that supports this model of annotation. Here, we describe the subsystem approach, and offer the first release of our growing library of populated subsystems. The initial release of data includes 180 177 distinct proteins with 2133 distinct functional roles. This data comes from 173 subsystems and 383 different organisms.},

  abstract = {Bacteria have been known to inhabit natural waters since the seventeenth century, but it was not until the mid to late twentieth century that our knowledge of their quantitative role in nutrient and energy cycles became apparent. This was due to the development of new techniques in microscopy and the application of radiolabeled compounds. While our knowledge has undergone a quantum leap, there are still many controversies and unknowns remaining in our understanding of bacterioplankton in aquatic systems. We know that they frequently exist in numbers of millions per milliliter, they are small (median cell volumes usually between 0.013 and 0.200 μm3), and most are metabolically inactive (around 80\% on average), but those that are active are key drivers of biogeochemical cycles. However, robust explanations of why cross-system changes in bacterioplankton biomass and production are not proportional to similar phytoplankton changes and the prevalence of net heterotrophic systems in inland waters are two major areas requiring further research. Bacterioplankton are a key link between abiotic and biotic components of aquatic ecosystems, but our understanding of how they respond to climate-induced impacts and human-made chemicals is still limited.},

  abstract = {Microbes have central roles in ocean food webs and global biogeochemical processes, yet specific ecological relationships among these taxa are largely unknown. This is in part due to the dilute, microscopic nature of the planktonic microbial community, which prevents direct observation of their interactions. Here, we use a holistic (that is, microbial system-wide) approach to investigate time-dependent variations among taxa from all three domains of life in a marine microbial community. We investigated the community composition of bacteria, archaea and protists through cultivation-independent methods, along with total bacterial and viral abundance, and physico-chemical observations. Samples and observations were collected monthly over 3 years at a well-described ocean time-series site of southern California. To find associations among these organisms, we calculated time-dependent rank correlations (that is, local similarity correlations) among relative abundances of bacteria, archaea, protists, total abundance of bacteria and viruses and physico-chemical parameters. We used a network generated from these statistical correlations to visualize and identify time-dependent associations among ecologically important taxa, for example, the SAR11 cluster, stramenopiles, alveolates, cyanobacteria and ammonia-oxidizing archaea. Negative correlations, perhaps suggesting competition or predation, were also common. The analysis revealed a progression of microbial communities through time, and also a group of unknown eukaryotes that were highly correlated with dinoflagellates, indicating possible symbioses or parasitism. Possible 'keystone' species were evident. The network has statistical features similar to previously described ecological networks, and in network parlance has non-random, small world properties (that is, highly interconnected nodes). This approach provides new insights into the natural history of microbes.},

  abstract = {Discovering why natural population densities change over time and vary with location is a central goal of ecological and evolutional disciplines. The recognition that even simple ecological systems can undergo chaotic behaviour has made chaos a topic of considerable interest among theoretical ecologists. However, there is still a lack of experimental evidence that chaotic behaviour occurs in the real world of coexisting populations in multi-species systems. Here we study the dynamics of a defined predator-prey system consisting of a bacterivorous ciliate and two bacterial prey species. The bacterial species preferred by the ciliate was the superior competitor. Experimental conditions were kept constant with continuous cultivation in a one-stage chemostat. We show that the dynamic behaviour of such a two-prey, one-predator system includes chaotic behaviour, as well as stable limit cycles and coexistence at equilibrium. Changes in the population dynamics were triggered by changes in the dilution rates of the chemostat. The observed dynamics were verified by estimating the corresponding Lyapunov exponents. Such a defined microbial food web offers a new possibility for the experimental study of deterministic chaos in real biological systems.},

  abstract = {Phytoplankton influence the composition of bacterial communities, but the taxonomic specificity of algal-bacterial interactions is unclear due to the aggregation of ecologically distinct bacterial populations by community characterization methods. Here we examine whether phytoplankton seasonal succession affects the composition of subtypes within the cosmopolitan freshwater bacterial genus Polynucleobacter. Changes in the composition of Polynucleobacter subtypes were characterized in samples collected weekly from May to August in 2003 and 2008 from three humic lakes using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting of the protein-encoding cytochrome c oxidase ccoN gene. Changes in phytoplankton population abundances explained, on average, 30\% of temporal variation in the composition of Polynucleobacter subtypes and the interaction between phytoplankton and the environment explained an additional 18\% of temporal variation. The effect of phytoplankton on specific Polynucleobacter subtypes was experimentally confirmed by changes in Polynucleobacter subtype composition following incubation with different phytoplankton assemblages or a no-phytoplankton control. Phytoplankton-associated subtypes and differentiation in substrate use among subtypes likely contribute to the effects of phytoplankton on Polynucleobacter subtype composition. Interactions between unique Polynucleobacter populations and phytoplankton highlight the ecological significance and specificity of species interactions in freshwater communities.},

  abstract = {We examined the proportions of major Betaproteobacteria subgroups within bacterial communities in diverse nonaxenic, monospecific cultures of algae or cyanobacteria: four species of cryptophyta (genera Cryptomonas and Rhodomonas), four species of chlorophyta (genera Pediastrum, Staurastrum, and Chlamydomonas), and two species of cyanobacteria (genera Dolichospermum and Aphanizomenon). In the cryptophyta cultures, Betaproteobacteria represented 48 to 71\% of total bacteria, the genus Limnohabitans represented 18 to 26\%, and the Polynucleobacter B subcluster represented 5 to 16\%. In the taxonomically diverse chlorophyta group, the genus Limnohabitans accounted for 7 to 45\% of total bacteria. In contrast, cyanobacterial cultures contained significantly lower proportions of the Limnohabitans bacteria (1 to 3\% of the total) than the cryptophyta and chlorophyta cultures. Notably, largely absent in all of the cultures was Polynucleobacter necessarius (Polynucleobacter C subcluster). Subsequently, we examined the growth of Limnohabitans strains in the presence of different algae or their extracellular products (EPP). Two strains, affiliated with Limnohabitans planktonicus and Limnohabitans parvus, were separately inoculated into axenic cultures of three algal species growing in an inorganic medium: Cryptomonas sp., Chlamydomonas noctigama, and Pediastrum boryanum. The Limnohabitans strains cocultured with these algae or inoculated into their EPP consistently showed (i) pronounced population growth compared to the control without the algae or EPP and (ii) stronger growth stimulation of L. planktonicus than of L. parvus. Overall, growth responses of the Limnohabitans strains cultured with algae were highly species specific, which suggests a pronounced niche separation between two closely related Limnohabitans species likely mediated by different abilities to utilize the substrates produced by different algal species.},

  abstract = {We examined bacterial dynamics in batch cultures of two axenic marine diatoms (Thalassiosira rotula and Skeletonema costatum). The axenic diatoms were inoculated with natural bacterial assemblages and monitored by 4,6-diamidino-2-phenolindole (DAPI) counts, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) with subsequent analysis of excised, sequenced 16S rRNA gene fragments, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with group-specific 16S rRNA oligonucleotide probes. Our results show that algal growth exhibited pronounced differences in axenic treatments and when bacteria were present. Bacterial abundance and community structure greatly depended on species, growth and physiological status of even closely related algae. Free-living and phytoplankton-associated bacteria were very different from each other and were dominated by distinct phylogenetic groups. The diatom-associated bacteria mainly belonged to the Flavobacteria-Sphingobacteria group of the Bacteroidetes phylum whereas free-living bacteria, which were rather similar in both cultures, comprised mainly of members of the Roseobacter group of alpha-Proteobacteria. Presence and disappearance of specific bacteria during algal growth indicated pronounced differences in environmental conditions over time and selection of bacteria highly adapted to the changing conditions. Tight interactions between marine bacteria and diatoms appear to be important for the decomposition of organic matter and nutrient cycling in the sea.},

Ochromonas minima and bacterial abundance were monitored for 12 days. We found significant and interacting effects of light and nutrients on Ochromonas minima growth rate and abundance. At high light intensity, nutrient enrichment resulted in increased growth rates and population sizes. In contrast, reduced growth rates and population sizes were observed for nutrient enrichment when light intensity was low. Although, Ochromonas minima was able to ingest bacteria under both high and low light conditions, it grew only when light intensity was high. At high light intensity, Ochromonas minima grew exponentially under nutrient conditions that would have been limiting for photoautotrophic microalgae. In non-enriched low light treatments, Ochromonas minima populations survived, probably by using background DOC as an energy source, indicating that this ability can be of relevance for natural systems even when DOC concentrations are relatively low. When competing with photoautotrophic microalgae, the ability to grow under severe nutrient limitation and to survive under light limitation should be advantageous for Ochromonas minima.},

  abstract = {It has been suggested that autochthonous (internally produced) organic carbon and allochthonous (externally produced) organic carbon are utilized by phylogenetically different bacterioplankton. We examined the relationship between the source of organic matter and the structure and function of lake bacterial communities. Differences and seasonal changes in bacterial community composition in two lakes differing in their source of organic matter were followed in relation to environmental variables. We also performed batch culture experiments with amendments of various organic substrates, namely fulvic acids, leachates from algae, and birch and maple leaves. Differences in bacterial community composition between the lakes, analysed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism, correlated with variables related to the relative loading of autochthonous and allochthonous carbon (water colour, dissolved organic carbon, nutrients, and pH). Seasonal changes correlated with temperature, chlorophyll and dissolved organic carbon in both lakes. The substrate amendments led to differences in both structure and function, i.e. production, respiration and growth yield, of the bacterial community. In conclusion, our results suggest that the source of organic matter influences community composition both within and among lakes and that there may be a coupling between the structure and function of the bacterial community.},

  abstract = {Water entering lakes from the surrounding watershed often delivers large amounts of terrestrial-derived dissolved organic carbon (DOC) that can contribute to aquatic bacterial production. However, research suggests that phytoplankton-derived DOC is more labile than its terrestrial counterpart, owing to microbial processing of terrestrial-derived DOC along its flow path to surface waters. The ratio of water colour (absorbance at 440 nm) to chlorophyll a has been suggested as a simple measure of the relative contribution of terrestrial and aquatic primary production to aquatic secondary production. To explore the correlation between primary DOC source and the occurrence of bacterial taxonomic groups, we conducted a survey of bacterial 16S rRNA gene composition in 15 lakes positioned along a water colour : chlorophyll a gradient. Our goal was to identify bacterial taxa occurrence patterns along the colour : chlorophyll a gradient that may indicate a competitive advantage for bacterial taxa using terrestrial or aquatic carbon. We observed a large number of bacterial taxa occurrence patterns suggestive of carbon substrate niche partitioning, especially when relatively highly resolved taxonomic groups were considered. Our survey supports the hypothesis that bacterial taxa partition along a carbon substrate source gradient and highlights carbon source-bacterial interactions that should be explored further.},

  abstract = {Bioactive polyunsaturated aldehydes (PUAs) are produced by several marine phytoplankton (mainly diatoms) and have been shown to have a detrimental effect on a wide variety of organisms, including phytoplankton and invertebrates. However, their potential impact on marine bacteria has been largely neglected. We assess here the effect of three PUAs produced by marine diatoms: 2E,4E-decadienal, 2E,4E-octadienal and 2E,4E-heptadienal, on the growth of 33 marine bacterial strains, including 16 strains isolated during a bloom of the PUA-producing diatom Skeletonema marinoi in the Northern Adriatic Sea. A concentration-dependent growth reduction was observed for 19 bacterial strains at concentrations ranging from 3 to 145 micromolL(-1). Surprisingly, Eudora adriatica strain MOLA358 (Flavobacteriaceae) and Alteromonas hispanica strain MOLA151 (Alteromonadaceae) showed growth stimulation upon exposure to PUAs at concentrations between 13 and 18 micromolL(-1). The remaining 12 strains were unaffected by even very high PUA concentrations. Strains isolated during the diatom bloom showed remarkable resistance to PUA exposures, with only two out of 16 strains showing growth inhibition at PUA concentrations below 106, 130, and 145 micromolL(-1) for 2E,4E-decadienal, 2E,4E-octadienal and 2E,4E-heptadienal, respectively. No correlation between taxonomical position and sensitivity to PUA was observed. Considering that many bacteria thrive in close vicinity of diatom cells, it is likely that these compounds may shape the structure of associated bacterial communities by representing a selection force. This is even more relevant during the final stages of blooms, when senescence and nutrient limitation increase the potential production and release of aldehydes.},

  abstract = {Phytoplankton and heterotrophic prokaryotes are major components of the microbial food web and interact continuously: heterotrophic prokaryotes utilize the dissolved organic carbon derived from phytoplankton exudation or cell lysis (DOCp), and mineralization by heterotrophic prokaryotes provides inorganic nutrients for phytoplankton. For this reason, these communities are expected to be closely linked, although the study of the interactions between them is still a major challenge. Recent studies have presented interactions between phytoplankton and heterotrophic prokaryotes based on coexistence or covariation throughout a time-series. However, a real quantification of the carbon flow within these networks (defined as the interaction strength, IS) has not been achieved yet. This is critical to understand the selectivity degree of bacteria responding to specific algal DOCp. Here we used microautoradiography to quantify the preferences of the major heterotrophic prokaryote phylogenetic groups on DOC derived from several representative phytoplankton species, and expressed these preferences as an IS value. The distribution of the ISs was not random but rather skewed towards weak interactions, in a similar way as the distributions described for stable complex non-microbial ecosystems, indicating that there are some cases of high specificity on the use of specific algal DOCp by some bacterial groups, but weak interactions are more common and may be relevant as well. The variety of IS patterns observed supports the view that the vast range of different resources (different types of organic molecules) available in the sea selects and maintains the high levels of diversity described for marine bacterioplankton.},

  abstract = {Ecologists have long studied the relationship between biotic composition and ecosystem functioning in larger organisms; however, only recently has this relationship been investigated widely in microorganisms. Recent studies are reviewed within a framework of three experimental approaches that are often used to study larger organisms: environmental treatment, common garden, and reciprocal transplant experiments. Although the composition of microorganisms cannot be easily manipulated in the field, applying these approaches to intact microbial communities can begin to tease apart the effects of microbial composition from environmental parameters on ecosystem functioning. The challenges in applying these approaches to microorganisms are highlighted and it is discussed how the experimental approach and duration affects a study's interpretation. In general, long-term environmental treatment experiments identify correlative relationships between microbial composition and ecosystem functioning, whereas short-term common garden experiments demonstrate that microbial composition influences ecosystem functioning. Finally, reciprocal transplants simultaneously test for interactive effects of the environment and composition on functioning. The studies reviewed provide evidence that, at least in some cases, microbial composition influences ecosystem functioning. It is concluded that whole-community experiments offer a way to test whether information about microbial composition will help predict ecosystem responses to global change.},

Here we explore the role that community composition plays in shaping the bacterial metabolic response to resource gradients that occur along aquatic ecotones in a complex watershed in Québec. Our results show that the response is mediated by complex shifts in community structure, and structural equation analysis confirmed two main pathways, one involving adjustments in the level of activity of existing phylotypes, and the other the replacement of the dominant phylotypes. These contrasting response pathways were not determined by the type or the intensity of the gradients involved, as we had hypothesized, but rather it would appear that some compositional configurations may be intrinsically more plastic than others. Our results suggest that community composition determines this overall level of community plasticity, but that composition itself may be driven by factors independent of the environmental gradients themselves, such that the response of bacterial communities to a given type of gradient may alternate between the adjustment and replacement pathways. We conclude that community composition influences the pathways of response in these bacterial communities, but not the metabolic outcome itself, which is driven by the environment, and which can be attained through multiple alternative configurations.},

  abstract = {Many eukaryotic communities exhibit predictable seasonality in species composition, but such phenological patterns are not well-documented in bacterial communities. This study quantified seasonal variation in the community composition of bacterioplankton in a high-elevation lake in the Sierra Nevada of California over a 3-year period of 2004-2006. Bacterioplankton exhibited consistent phenological patterns, with distinct, interannually recurring community types characteristic of the spring snowmelt, ice-off and fall-overturn periods in the lake. Thermal stratification was associated with the emergence of specific communities each summer and increased community heterogeneity throughout the water column. Two key environmental variables modulated by regional meteorologic variation, lake residence time and thermal stability, predicted the timing of occurrence of community types each year with 75\% accuracy, and each corresponded with different aspects of variation in community composition (orthogonal ordination axes). Seasonal variation in dissolved organic matter source was characterized fluorometrically in 2005 and was highly correlated with overall variation in bacterial community structure (r(Mantel)=0.75, P$\backslash$textless0.001) and with the relative contributions of specific phylotypes within the Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria and beta-Proteobacteria. The seasonal dynamics of bacterial clades (tracked through coupling of randomized clone sequence libraries to restriction fragment length polymorphism fingerprints) matched previous results from alpine lakes and were variously related to solute inputs, thermal stability and temperature. Taken together, these results describe a phenology of high-elevation bacterioplankton communities linked to climate-driven physical and chemical lake characteristics already known to regulate eukaryotic plankton community structure.},

Emerald Lake, a high-elevation lake with DOM dominated by terrestrial sources in the spring with increasing phytoplankton-derived inputs throughout the ice-free season, provided a natural experiment with which to investigate the importance of resource-mediated drivers. Glycolate-utilizing bacteria, a subset of the bacterial community able to use algal exudates, were characterized using DNA analysis of glycolate oxidase subunit D (glcD) genes from Emerald Lake samples collected approximately biweekly from ice-cover (June) through fall turnover (September). glcD genes were not detected in early-season samples when the lake was ice-covered and phytoplankton-derived resources were scarce. Following this period, glcD gene composition exhibited significant changes through time, which were strongly correlated with the combination of fluorescence index, an indicator of the proportion of lake vs. terrestrially derived DOM, and dissolved inorganic nitrate + nitrite. These results suggest that seasonal shifts in DOM source and environmental variables that affect the composition of algal-derived dissolved resources drive changes in the relative abundance and composition of putative glycolate-utilizing bacteria. These findings strengthen the evidence for shifts in DOM structuring bacterial communities.},

  abstract = {Influence of distribution and abundance of bacterial taxa on ecosystem function are poorly understood for natural microbial communities. We related 16S rRNA-based terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism to bacterial production and arginine uptake kinetics to test if functional features of bacterioplankton in four lakes could be predicted from community composition. Maximum arginine uptake rate (arginine V(max)) ranged from 10\% to 100\% of bacterial production. Owing to high growth efficiencies on arginine (63-77\%), the bacterial community could potentially saturate its carbon demand using this single organic substrate, for example, during sudden surges of free amino acids. However, due to low in situ concentrations of arginine in these lakes ($\backslash$textless0.9 microg l(-1)), actual uptake rates at ambient concentrations rarely exceeded 10\% of V(max). Bacterial production and arginine V(max) could be predicted from a subset of bacterial ribotypes, tentatively affiliated with several bacterial divisions (Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria). Multivariate statistical analysis indicates that there were both highly important and less important ribotypes for the prediction of bacterial production and arginine V(max). These populations were either negatively or positively related to the respective functional feature, indicating contrasting ecological roles. Our study provides a statistically robust demonstration that, apart from environmental conditions, patterns in bacterial community composition can also be used to predict lake ecosystem function.},

Extrinsic forces operating over broad spatial scales can impart synchronous behavior to separate populations, while internal, system-specific drivers often lead to idiosyncratic behavior. Here, we demonstrate synchrony in community-level dynamics among phytoplankton and bacteria in six north temperate humic lakes. The influence of regional meteorological factors explained much of the temporal variability in the phytoplankton community, and resulted in synchronous patterns of community change among lakes. Bacterial dynamics, in contrast, were driven by system-specific interactions with phytoplankton. Despite the importance of intrinsic factors for determining bacterial community composition and dynamics, we demonstrated that biological interactions transmitted the signal of the regional extrinsic drivers to the bacterial communities, ultimately resulting in synchronous community phenologies for bacterioplankton communities as well. This demonstrates how linkages between the components of a complex biological system can work to simplify the dynamics of the system and implies that it may be possible to predict the behavior of microbial communities responsible for important biogeochemical services in the landscape.},

The approach uses a moving window weighting technique, where localised models are found at target locations. Outputs are mapped to provide a useful exploratory tool into the nature of the data spatial heterogeneity. GWmodel includes: GW summary statistics, GW principal components analysis, GW regression, GW regression with a local ridge compensation, and GW regression for prediction; some of which are provided in basic and robust forms.},

However, it remains controversial whether these reductions in diversity will affect energy flow and nutrient cycling. Diversity has two components: species richness, or the number of plant species in a given area, and species evenness, or how well distributed abundance or biomass is among species within a community. We experimentally varied species evenness and the identity of the dominant plant species in an old field of Quebec to test whether plant productivity would increase with increasing levels of evenness, and whether relationships would be invariant with respect to species identity. Total and belowground biomass increased linearly with increasing levels of evenness after one growing season. These relationships did not depend on the identity of the dominant species. Relationships between aboveground biomass and evenness varied and depended on the identity of...},

The second underpins the niche hypothesis, in which early successional species are able to persist, even with unlimited colonization by late successional dominants, because they specialize on the resource-rich conditions typical of recently disturbed sites. We modify the widely studied competition-colonization model so that it also includes the mechanism behind the niche hypothesis. Analysis of this model suggests simple experiments that determine whether the successional diversity of a field system is maintained primarily by the competition-colonization mechanism, primarily by the niche mechanism, by neither, or by both. We develop quantitative metrics of the relative importance of the two mechanisms. We also discuss the implications for the management of biodiversity in communities structured by the two mechanisms.},

  volume = {88},
  issn = {0012-9658},
  abstract = {Over the past decade an increasing number of studies have experimentally manipulated the number of species in a community and examined how this alters the aggregate production of species biomass. Many of these studies have shown that the effects of richness on biomass change through time, but we have limited understanding of the mechanisms that produce these dynamic trends. Here we report the results of an experiment in which we manipulated the richness of freshwater algae in laboratory microcosms. We used two experimental designs (additive and substitutive) that make different assumptions about how patches are initially colonized, and then tracked the development of community biomass from the point of initial colonization through a period of 6-12 generations of the focal species. We found that the effect of initial species richness on biomass production qualitatively shifted twice over the course of the experiment. The first shift occurred as species transitioned from density-independent to dependent phases of population growth. At this time, intraspecific competition caused monocultures to approach their respective carrying capacities more slowly than polycultures. As a consequence, species tended to over-yield for a brief time, generating a positive, but transient effect of diversity on community biomass. The second shift occurred as communities approached carrying capacity. At this time, strong interspecific interactions caused biomass to be dominated by the competitively superior species in polycultures. As this species had the lowest carrying capacity, a negative effect of diversity on biomass resulted in late succession. Although these two shifts produced dynamics that appeared complex, we show that the patterns can be fit to a simple Lotka-Volterra model of competition. Our results suggest that the effects of algal diversity on primary production change in a predictable sequence through successional time.},

  abstract = {1. Long-term records of air temperature and ice phenology (ice duration), and phyto- and zooplankton time series (1979-1997) were used to study the effects of ice duration on the successional pattern within plankton communities during spring in a shallow polymictic lake. 2. Water temperature in March was significantly lower after cold winters when compared to average or mild winters. Mean water temperature in April was not significantly different after mild, average or cold winters, but showed an overall significant negative correlation with ice duration. 3. Ice duration affected the timing and the magnitude of the peak abundance of diatoms, rotifers and daphnids during spring, but had no direct effects on the timing and maximum of chlorophytes, cryptophytes, cyanobacteria, bosminids and cyclopoid copepods. 4. Plankton groups which appeared first in the seasonal succession (i.e. diatoms, rotifers and daphnids) reached maximum abundance earlier after mild and average winters. The peak abundance of diatoms was negatively correlated with ice duration, whereas that of rotifers and daphnids was independent of the conditions during the preceding winter. 5. Temperature alone was generally a poor predictor of the timing and magnitude of both phyto- and zooplankton maxima. Turbulence may be important in the timing and the magnitude of peaks in diatoms, while total algal biomass was the most important determinant for the timing of the rotifer maximum. The magnitude of the daphnid maxima were significantly influenced by water temperature in March and April, and by rotifer abundance. The magnitude of the bosminid maximum was correlated with food availability and predation, whereas the timing of the maximum was more closely related to water temperature in May. 6. We conclude that, as a result of the low heat storage capacity of shallow lakes, the effects of winter on planktonic communities are short lived, and soon overtaken by the prevailing weather and by biotic interactions.},

We studied the relationship between aboveground tree biomass dynamics (Δbiomass) and multiple dimensions of biodiversity over 8-16 years in eight successional rainforests. We tested whether successional changes in diversity-Δbiomass correlations reflect predictions of niche theories. Diversity-Δbiomass correlations were positive early but weak later in succession, suggesting saturation of niche space with increasing diversity. Early in succession, phylogenetic diversity and functional diversity in two leaf traits exhibited the strongest positive correlations with Δbiomass, indicating complementarity or positive selection effects. In mid-successional stands, high biodiversity was associated with greater mortality-driven biomass loss, i.e. negative selection effects, suggesting successional niche trade-offs and loss of fast-growing pioneer species. Our results demonstrate that BEF relationships are dynamic across succession, thus successional context is essential to understanding BEF in a given system.},

  abstract = {Protecting biodiversity involves preserving the maximum number and abundance of species while giving special attention to species with unique genetic or morphological characteristics. In balancing different priorities, conservation policymakers may consider quantitative measures that compare diversity across ecological communities. To serve this purpose, a measure should increase or decrease with changes in community composition in a way that reflects what is valued, including species richness, evenness, and distinctness. However, counterintuitively, studies have shown that established indices, including those that emphasize average interspecies phylogenetic distance, may increase with the elimination of species. We introduce a new diversity index, the phylogenetic entropy, which generalizes in a natural way the Shannon index to incorporate species relatedness. Phylogenetic entropy favors communities in which highly distinct species are more abundant, but it does not advocate decreasing any species proportion below a community structure-dependent threshold. We contrast the behavior of multiple indices on a community of phyllostomid bats in the Selva Lacandona. The optimal genus distribution for phylogenetic entropy populates all genera in a linear relationship to their total phylogenetic distance to other genera. Two other indices favor eliminating 12 out of the 23 genera.},

However, these experiments often conclude that there is a higher probability of including complementary species combinations in assemblages with more species and lack a priori prediction about which species combinations maximize function. Here, I report the results of an experiment manipulating the evolutionary relatedness of constituent plant species across a richness gradient. I show that assemblages with distantly related species contributed most to the higher biomass production in multispecies assemblages, through species complementarity. Species produced more biomass than predicted from their monocultures when they were in plots with distantly related species and produced the amount of biomass predicted from monoculture when sown with close relatives. This finding suggests that in the absence of any other information, combining distantly related species in restored or managed landscapes may serve to maximize biomass production and carbon sequestration, thus merging calls to conserve evolutionary history and maximize ecosystem function.},

However, commonly used metrics of phylogenetic diversity (PD) do not incorporate information on the relative abundances of individuals within a community. In this study, we develop three indices of PD that explicitly consider species abundances. First, we present a metric of phylogenetic-abundance evenness that evaluates the relationship between the abundance and the distribution of terminal branch lengths. Second, we calculate an index of hierarchical imbalance of abundances at the clade level encapsulating the distribution of individuals across the nodes in the phylogeny. Third, we develop an index of abundance-weighted evolutionary distinctiveness and generate an entropic index of phylogenetic diversity that captures both information on evolutionary distances and phylogenetic tree topology, and also serves as a basis to evaluate species conservation value. These metrics offer measures of phylogenetic diversity incorporating different community attributes. We compare these new metrics to existing ones, and use them to explore diversity patterns in a typical California annual grassland plant community at the Jasper Ridge biological preserve.},

These metrics can be used in conjunction with permutation procedures to test for phylogenetic community structure. As an illustration, we analyzed data on the composition of 58 lake fish communities in Wisconsin. The fish communities showed phylogenetic underdispersion, with communities more likely to contain closely related species. Using information about differences in environmental characteristics among lakes, we demonstrated that phylogenetic underdispersion in fish communities was associated with environmental factors. For example, lakes with low pH were more likely to contain species in the same clade of acid-tolerant species. Our metrics differ from existing metrics used to calculate phylogenetic community structure, such as net relatedness index and Faith's phylogenetic diversity. Our metrics have the advantage of providing an integrated and easy-to-understand package of phylogenetic measures of species variability, richness, and evenness with well-defined statistical properties. Furthermore, they allow the easy evaluation of contributions of individual species to different aspects of the phylogenetic organization of communities. Therefore, these metrics should aid with the incorporation of phylogenetic information into strategies for understanding biodiversity and its conservation.},

A phylogenetic framework should partially solve this problem, as trait similarity is generally correlated with species relatedness, closely related species should have similar sensitivities to disturbance. Disturbance should thus result in community assemblages of closely related species. We tested this hypothesis with 18 disturbed and 16 reference whole-lake, long-term zooplankton data sets. Regardless of disturbance type, communities generally contained more closely related species when disturbed. This effect was independent of species richness, evenness, and abundance. Communities already under stress (i.e., those in acidic lakes) changed most when disturbed. Species sensitivities to specific disturbances were phylogenetically conserved, were independent of body size, and could be predicted by the sensitivities of close relatives within the same community. Phylogenetic relatedness can effectively act as a proxy for missing trait information when predicting community and species responses to disturbance.},

Some predictions can be transferred directly from the existing theory of predator-prey graphs to plant-herbivore systems, while others need to be modified. The stability of grazing systems depends on animal density and plant biomass either continuously, or discontinuously, depending on the properties of the vegetation and the herbivore. Evidence from real pasture and range systems suggests that at least some of them are discontinuously stable, with significant implications for their management.},

  abstract = {The number of cells within tumor colonies has not been determined accurately in prior reports because, in all but small clusters, cells grow too closely and stacked to allow direct counting of cells by inverted microscopy. Therefore, we stained colonies formed in agar from 38 tumor cell samples of diverse histological origin, removed them with a micropipet, and directly counted the number of cells. The number of cells within colonies increased geometrically with colony diameter and inversely with the size of the cells within the colonies. The relationship can be described using linear regression: [In(no. of cells/colony) = 0.87 - 2.80 In (colony cell diameter) + 2.38 In (colony diameter)] which gave an R2 of 0.92. Measurements of colonies in agar showed that they grew as oblate spheroids rather than spheroids. In an average sample, 60-micron-diameter colonies contained eight to 10 cells; the range for the 38 samples was 1.2 to 48.5. These results precisely define colonies in terms of cell number. They allow calculation of the total number of cells formed from clonogenic cells, a more complete estimate of proliferation than conventional cloning efficiencies which only measure initial proliferation. Furthermore, because of the dependence on the size of the colony cells, if colonies are defined only by a specific diameter then they do not contain similar numbers of cells. Calculations which assume spherical colonies, rather than the oblate spheroid shape we found, greatly overestimate the number of cells within colonies. Our data can increase the accuracy of quantitation in the clonogenic system and thus improve the interpretation of the proliferation of clonogenic tumor cells.},

Likely explanations include resource complementarity effects among phytoplankton species as food entities, as well as niche complementarity effects among Daphnia species as competitors.

  abstract = {The accelerating rate of change in biodiversity patterns, mediated by ever increasing human pressures and global warming, demands a better understanding of the relationship between the structure of biological communities and ecosystem functioning (BEF). Recent investigations suggest that the functional structure of communities, i.e. the composition and diversity of functional traits, is the main driver of ecological processes. However, the predictive power of BEF research is still low, the integration of all components of functional community structure as predictors is still lacking, and the multifunctionality of ecosystems (i.e. rates of multiple processes) must be considered. Here, using a multiple-processes framework from grassland biodiversity experiments, we show that functional identity of species and functional divergence among species, rather than species diversity per se, together promote the level of ecosystem multifunctionality with a predictive power of 80\%. Our results suggest that primary productivity and decomposition rates, two key ecosystem processes upon which the global carbon cycle depends, are primarily sustained by specialist species, i.e. those that hold specialized combinations of traits and perform particular functions. Contrary to studies focusing on single ecosystem functions and considering species richness as the sole measure of biodiversity, we found a linear and non-saturating effect of the functional structure of communities on ecosystem multifunctionality. Thus, sustaining multiple ecological processes would require focusing on trait dominance and on the degree of community specialization, even in species-rich assemblages.},

  abstract = {The concentrations of terrestrially derived dissolved organic carbon have been increasing throughout northern aquatic ecosystems in recent decades, but whether these shifts have an impact on aquatic carbon emissions at the continental scale depends on the potential for this terrestrial carbon to be converted into carbon dioxide. Here, via the analysis of hundreds of boreal lakes, rivers and wetlands in Canada, we show that, contrary to conventional assumptions, the proportion of biologically degradable dissolved organic carbon remains constant and the photochemical degradability increases with terrestrial influence. Thus, degradation potential increases with increasing amounts of terrestrial carbon. Our results provide empirical evidence of a strong causal link between dissolved organic carbon concentrations and aquatic fluxes of carbon dioxide, mediated by the degradation of land-derived organic carbon in aquatic ecosystems. Future shifts in the patterns of terrestrial dissolved organic carbon in inland waters thus have the potential to significantly increase aquatic carbon emissions across northern landscapes.},

Underwater light was found to be the best descriptor of the cover and biomass of submerged plants. Conversely, emergent macrophytes are most strongly affected by lake morphometry, and in particular by its average slope. The predictability of the abundance of emergent and submerged macrophytes from these environmental factors stresses the predominant role that they play in macrophyte ecology and confirms the existence of strong patterns in the abundance of aquatic plants worldwide.},

  volume = {92},
  issn = {0012-9658},
  abstract = {. Despite the increased complexity of experimental and theoretical studies on the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (B-EF) relationship, a major challenge is to demonstrate whether the observed importance of biodiversity in controlled experimental systems also persists in nature. Due to their structural simplicity and their low levels of human impacts, extreme species-poor ecosystems may provide new insights into B-EF relationships in natural systems. We address this issue using shredder invertebrate communities and organic matter decomposition rates in 24 high-altitude (3200-3900 m) Neotropical streams as a study model. We first assessed the effects of stream characteristics and shredder diversity and abundance on organic matter decomposition rates in coarse- and fine-mesh bags. We found the interaction term shredder richness x shredder abundance had the most significant impact on decomposition rates in the field, although water discharge may also play a role locally. We also examined the relative contribution of the three most abundant shredders on decomposition rates by manipulating shredder richness and community composition in a field experiment. Transgressive overyielding was detected among the three shredder species, indicating complementary resource use and/or facilitation. By integrating survey and experimental data in surface response analyses we found that observed B-EF patterns fit those predicted by a linear model that described litter decomposition rates as a function of increasing shredder richness and the relative abundance of the most efficient shredders. Finally, the validity of our approach was tested in a broader context by using two independent but comparable data sets from 49 French and Swedish streams showing more complex shredder community structure. Results revealed that richness and identity effects on decomposition rates were lost with increasing shredder community complexity. Our approach of combining experimental and empirical data with modeling in species-poor ecosystems may serve as an impetus for new B-EF studies. If theory can explain B-EF in low-diversity ecosystems, it may also have credibility in more complex ones.},

  abstract = {1. Numerous studies have revealed (usually positive) relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (B-EF), but the underpinning drivers are rarely addressed explicitly, hindering the development of a more predictive understanding. 2. We developed a suite of statistical models (where we combined existing models with novel ones) to test for richness and evenness effects on detrital processing in freshwater microcosms. Instead of using consumer species as biodiversity units, we used two size classes within three species (six types). This allowed us to test for diversity effects and also to focus on the role of body size and biomass. 3. Our statistical models tested for (i) whether performance in polyculture was more than the sum of its parts (non-additive effects), (ii) the effects of specific type combinations (assemblage identity effects) and (iii) whether types behaved differently when their absolute or relative abundances were altered (e.g. because type abundance in polyculture was lower compared with monoculture). The latter point meant we did not need additional density treatments. 4. Process rates were independent of richness and evenness and all types performed in an additive fashion. The performance of a type was mainly driven by the consumers' metabolic requirements (connected to body size). On an assemblage level, biomass explained a large proportion of detrital processing rates. 5. We conclude that B-EF studies would benefit from widening their statistical approaches. Further, they need to consider biomass of species assemblages and whether biomass is comprised of small or large individuals, because even if all species are present in the same biomass, small species (or individuals) will perform better.},

  doi = {10.1007/s00442-002-1148-5},
  abstract = {Little is known about the mechanisms behind positive effects of species richness on ecosystem functioning. In a previous study that showed a positive effect of aquatic detritivore species richness on leaf litter breakdown (process) rates, we proposed that facilitation and release from intra-specific interference were the two most likely mechanisms. To test the interference hypothesis, we performed an experiment using three densities of each of three detritivore species and found varying effects on leaf breakdown rates across species: one species showed no effect, one a positive, marginally insignificant, effect, and a third species showed a significant, positive effect of decreasing density. The density (interference) effect thus partly explained the results from our previous study. The facilitation hypothesis was tested by sequentially introducing and removing two species. We predicted that, if this hypothesis were true, facilitation would be expressed in higher process rates than when replacing with individuals of the same species. We found that process rate per unit biomass did increase when one species was introduced after the other species, while the opposite sequence did not show any increase. Hence, this result was also confirmative of our previous results. Therefore, we conclude that both intra-specific interference and inter-specific facilitation may explain the positive effect of species richness observed in our system. Since many species exhibit intra-specific interference that inhibits foraging efficiency, this may be a general mechanism generating effects of species richness per se. If facilitation is unidirectional, or if it involves few species, it is more likely to be species specific with species identities being more important than species richness per se. We conclude that species loss may be expected to have negative consequences on ecosystem functioning if anyspecies is lost, with additional effects in the event of losing "facilitator" species.},

  abstract = {1.Detailed knowledge of a species' functional niche is crucial for the study of ecological communities and processes. The extent of niche overlap, functional redundancy and functional complementarity are of particular importance if we are to understand ecosystem processes and their vulnerability to disturbances. 2.Coral reefs are among the most threatened marine systems, and anthropogenic activity is changing the functional composition of reefs. The loss of herbivorous fishes is particularly concerning as the removal of algae is crucial for the growth and survival of corals. Yet, the foraging patterns of the various herbivorous fish species are poorly understood. 3.Using a multidimensional framework, we present novel individual-based analyses of species' realized functional niches, which we apply to a herbivorous coral reef fish community. In calculating niche volumes for 21 species, based on their microhabitat utilization patterns during foraging, and computing functional overlaps, we provide a measurement of functional redundancy or complementarity. Complementarity is the inverse of redundancy and is defined as less than 50\% overlap in niche volumes. 4.The analyses reveal extensive complementarity with an average functional overlap of just 15.2\%. Furthermore, the analyses divide herbivorous reef fishes into two broad groups. The first group (predominantly surgeonfishes and parrotfishes) comprises species feeding on exposed surfaces and predominantly open reef matrix or sandy substrata, resulting in small niche volumes and extensive complementarity. In contrast, the second group consists of species (predominantly rabbitfishes) that feed over a wider range of microhabitats, penetrating the reef matrix to exploit concealed surfaces of various substratum types. These species show high variation among individuals, leading to large niche volumes, more overlap and less complementarity. 5.These results may have crucial consequences for our understanding of herbivorous processes on coral reefs, as algal removal appears to depend strongly on species-specific microhabitat utilization patterns of herbivores. Furthermore, the results emphasize the capacity of the individual-based analyses to reveal variation in the functional niches of species, even in high diversity systems such as coral reefs, demonstrating its potential applicability to other high-diversity ecosystems.

Here we present evidence that climate warming is diminishing productivity in Lake Tanganyika, East Africa. This lake has historically supported a highly productive pelagic fishery that currently provides 25-40\% of the animal protein supply for the populations of the surrounding countries. In parallel with regional warming patterns since the beginning of the twentieth century, a rise in surface-water temperature has increased the stability of the water column. A regional decrease in wind velocity has contributed to reduced mixing, decreasing deep-water nutrient upwelling and entrainment into surface waters. Carbon isotope records in sediment cores suggest that primary productivity may have decreased by about 20\%, implying a roughly 30\% decrease in fish yields. Our study provides evidence that the impact of regional effects of global climate change on aquatic ecosystem functions and services can be larger than that of local anthropogenic activity or overfishing.},

The size structure of marine phytoplankton communities strongly affects food web structure and organic carbon export into the ocean interior, yet macroevolutionary patterns in the size structure of phytoplankton communities have not been previously investigated. We constructed a database of the size of the silica frustule of the dominant fossilized marine planktonic diatom species over the Cenozoic. We found that the minimum and maximum sizes of the diatom frustule have expanded in concert with increasing species diversity. In contrast, the mean area of the diatom frustule is highly correlated with oceanic temperature gradients inferred from the delta18O of foraminiferal calcite, consistent with the hypothesis that climatically induced changes in oceanic mixing have altered nutrient availability in the euphotic zone and driven macroevolutionary shifts in the size of marine pelagic diatoms through the Cenozoic.},

Using long-term surveys, experimental data and published results, we show a significant increase in the proportion of small-sized species and young age classes and a decrease in size-at-age. These results are in accordance with the ecological rules dealing with the temperature-size relationships (i.e., Bergmann's rule, James' rule and Temperature-Size Rule). Our study provides evidence that reduced body size is the third universal ecological response to global warming in aquatic systems besides the shift of species ranges toward higher altitudes and latitudes and the seasonal shifts in life cycle events.},

  abstract = {Contributing roughly half of the biosphere's net primary production (NPP), photosynthesis by oceanic phytoplankton is a vital link in the cycling of carbon between living and inorganic stocks. Each day, more than a hundred million tons of carbon in the form of CO2 are fixed into organic material by these ubiquitous, microscopic plants of the upper ocean, and each day a similar amount of organic carbon is transferred into marine ecosystems by sinking and grazing. The distribution of phytoplankton biomass and NPP is defined by the availability of light and nutrients (nitrogen, phosphate, iron). These growth-limiting factors are in turn regulated by physical processes of ocean circulation, mixed-layer dynamics, upwelling, atmospheric dust deposition, and the solar cycle. Satellite measurements of ocean colour provide a means of quantifying ocean productivity on a global scale and linking its variability to environmental factors. Here we describe global ocean NPP changes detected from space over the past decade. The period is dominated by an initial increase in NPP of 1,930 teragrams of carbon a year (Tg C yr(-1)), followed by a prolonged decrease averaging 190 Tg C yr(-1). These trends are driven by changes occurring in the expansive stratified low-latitude oceans and are tightly coupled to coincident climate variability. This link between the physical environment and ocean biology functions through changes in upper-ocean temperature and stratification, which influence the availability of nutrients for phytoplankton growth. The observed reductions in ocean productivity during the recent post-1999 warming period provide insight on how future climate change can alter marine food webs.},

  abstract = {Ecosystem respiration is the biotic conversion of organic carbon to carbon dioxide by all of the organisms in an ecosystem, including both consumers and primary producers. Respiration exhibits an exponential temperature dependence at the subcellular and individual levels, but at the ecosystem level respiration can be modified by many variables including community abundance and biomass, which vary substantially among ecosystems. Despite its importance for predicting the responses of the biosphere to climate change, it is as yet unknown whether the temperature dependence of ecosystem respiration varies systematically between aquatic and terrestrial environments. Here we use the largest database of respiratory measurements yet compiled to show that the sensitivity of ecosystem respiration to seasonal changes in temperature is remarkably similar for diverse environments encompassing lakes, rivers, estuaries, the open ocean and forested and non-forested terrestrial ecosystems, with an average activation energy similar to that of the respiratory complex (approximately 0.65 electronvolts (eV)). By contrast, annual ecosystem respiration shows a substantially greater temperature dependence across aquatic (approximately 0.65 eV) versus terrestrial ecosystems (approximately 0.32 eV) that span broad geographic gradients in temperature. Using a model derived from metabolic theory, these findings can be reconciled by similarities in the biochemical kinetics of metabolism at the subcellular level, and fundamental differences in the importance of other variables besides temperature—such as primary productivity and allochthonous carbon inputs—on the structure of aquatic and terrestrial biota at the community level.},

Here, we show for that species within large communities from a variety of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems are on average two links apart, with $\backslash$textgreater95\% of species typically within three links of each other. Species are drawn even closer as network complexity and, more unexpectedly, species richness increase. Our findings are based on seven of the largest and most complex food webs available as well as a food-web model that extends the generality of the empirical results. These results indicate that the dynamics of species within ecosystems may be more highly interconnected and that biodiversity loss and species invasions may affect more species than previously thought.},

  abstract = {If natural communities are assembled according to deterministic rules, coexisting species will represent a nonrandom subset of the potential species pool. We tested for signatures of assembly rules in the distribution of species' traits in Pacific rockfish (Sebastes spp.) assemblages. We used morphology, dietary niche (estimated with stable nitrogen isotopes), and distribution data to identify traits that relate to local-scale resource use (the alpha-niche) and to environmental gradients (the beta-niche). We showed that gill raker morphology was related to trophic position (an alpha-niche axis), while relative eye size was associated with depth habitat (a beta-niche axis). We therefore hypothesized that, within assemblages of coexisting rockfish species, the gill raker trait would be overdispersed (evenly spaced) due to limiting similarity, while relative eye size would be clustered due to environmental filtering. We examined the evolutionary relatedness of coexisting species to ask whether phylogenetic community structure and trait distributions gave similar indications about the roles of assembly processes. We tested the trait distributions and phylogenetic structure of 30 published rockfish assemblages against a null model of random community assembly. As predicted, the gill raker trait tended to be more evenly spaced than expected by chance, as did overall body size, while relative eye size was more clustered than expected. Phylogenetic community structure appeared to reflect historical dispersal and speciation and did not provide consistent support for assembly rules. Our results indicate that rockfish community assembly is nonrandom with regard to species' traits and show how distinguishing traits related to the alpha- and beta-niches and incorporating functional morphology can provide for powerful tests of assembly rules.},

  abstract = {Bacterioplankton respiration (BR) may represent the largest single sink of organic carbon in the biosphere and constitutes an important driver of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions from freshwaters. Complete understanding of BR is precluded by the fact that most studies need to assume a respiratory quotient (RQ; mole of CO(2) produced per mole of O(2) consumed) to calculate rates of BR. Many studies have, without clear support, assumed a fixed RQ around 1. Here we present 72 direct measurements of bacterioplankton RQ that we carried out in epilimnetic samples of 52 freshwater sites in Québec (Canada), using O(2) and CO(2) optic sensors. The RQs tended to converge around 1.2, but showed large variability (s.d.=0.45) and significant correlations with major gradients of ecosystem-level, substrate-level and bacterial community-level characteristics. Experiments with natural bacterioplankton using different single substrates suggested that RQ is intimately linked to the elemental composition of the respired compounds. RQs were on average low in net autotrophic systems, where bacteria likely were utilizing mainly reduced substrates, whereas we found evidence that the dominance of highly oxidized substrates, for example, organic acids formed by photo-chemical processes, led to high RQ in the more heterotrophic systems. Further, we suggest that BR contributes to a substantially larger share of freshwater CO(2) emissions than presently believed based on the assumption that RQ is ∼1. Our study demonstrates that bacterioplankton RQ is not only a practical aspect of BR determination, but also a major ecosystem state variable that provides unique information about aquatic ecosystem functioning.},

  abstract = {There is a long tradition in ecology of evaluating the relative contribution of the regional species pool and local interactions on the structure of local communities. Similarly, a growing number of studies assess the phylogenetic structure of communities, relative to that in the regional species pool, to examine the interplay between broad-scale evolutionary and fine-scale ecological processes. Finally, a renewed interest in the influence of species source pools on communities has shown that the definition of the source pool influences interpretations of patterns of community structure. We use a continent-wide dataset of local ant communities and implement ecologically explicit source pool definitions to examine the relative importance of regional species pools and local interactions for shaping community structure. Then we assess which factors underlie systematic variation in the structure of communities along climatic gradients. We find that the average phylogenetic relatedness of species in ant communities decreases from tropical to temperate regions, but the strength of this relationship depends on the level of ecological realism in the definition of source pools. We conclude that the evolution of climatic niches influences the phylogenetic structure of regional source pools and that the influence of regional source pools on local community structure is strong.},

  abstract = {Measuring the phylogenetic diversity of communities has become a key issue for biogeography and conservation. However, most diversity indices that rely on interspecies phylogenetic distances may increase with species loss and thus violate the principle of weak monotonicity. Moreover, most published phylogenetic diversity indices ignore the abundance distribution along phylogenetic trees, even though lineage abundances are crucial components of biodiversity. The recently introduced concept of phylogenetic entropy overcomes these limitations, but has not been decomposed across scales, i.e. into α, β and γ components. A full understanding of mechanisms sustaining biological diversity within and between communities needs such decomposition. Here, we propose an additive decomposition framework for estimating α, β and γ components of phylogenetic entropy. Based on simulated trees, we demonstrate its robustness to phylogenetic tree shape and species richness. Our decomposition fulfils the requirements of both independence between components and weak monotonicity. Finally, our decomposition can also be adapted to the partitioning of functional diversity across different scales with the same desirable properties.},

Traditionally, ecologists have explored linkages between the severity and type of disturbance and the taxonomic structure of communities. Recent advances in the application of species traits, to assess the functional structure of communities, have provided an alternative approach that responds rapidly and consistently across taxa and ecosystems to multiple disturbances. Importantly, trait-based metrics may provide advanced warning of disturbance to ecosystems because they do not need species loss to be reactive. Here, we synthesize empirical evidence and present a theoretical framework, based on species positions in a functional space, as a tool to reveal the complex nature of change in disturbed ecosystems.},

  volume = {89},
  issn = {0012-9658},
  abstract = {Functional ecology aims at determining the relationships between species traits and environmental variables in order to better understand biological processes in ecosystems. From a methodological point of view, this biological objective calls for a method linking three data matrix tables: a table L with abundance or presence-absence values for species at a series of sites, a table R with variables describing the environmental conditions of the sites, and a table Q containing traits (e.g., morphological or behavioral attributes) of the species. Ten years ago, the fourth-corner method was proposed to measure and test the relationships between species traits and environmental variables using tables R, L, and Q simultaneously. In practice, this method is rarely used. The major reasons for this lack of interest are the restriction of the original method and program to presence-absence data in L and to the analysis of a single trait and a single environmental variable at a time. Moreover, ecologists often have problems in choosing a permutation model among the four originally proposed. In this paper, we revisit the fourth-corner method and propose improvements to the original approach. First, we present an extension to measure the link between species traits and environmental variables when the ecological community is described by abundance data. A new multivariate fourth-corner statistic is also proposed. Then, using numerical simulations, we discuss and evaluate the existing testing procedures. A new two-step testing procedure is presented. We hope that these elements will help ecologists use the best possible methodology to analyze this type of ecological problem.},

  abstract = {A period of prolonged warmer, drier-than-normal weather in northwestern Ontario during the 1970s and 1980s resulted in severe forest fires that caused dramatic changes to lake and stream catchments. The changed interactions of weather with catchments and hydrological processes caused unexpected changes in physical, chemical, and biological processes in lakes and streams. Permanent first-order streams became ephemeral. Flows at spring melt were lower, and chemical exports from catchments were reduced. Although catchments burned by forest fire had slightly higher flows and chemical exports than unburned basins in the years following fires, chemical exports generally declined due to lower streamflow. Decreased exports of silica indicated lower rates of weathering. Base cation exports also decreased, as did the ratio of base cations to strong acid anions in streams. Changes in lakes included warmer temperatures, clearer waters, deeper thermoclines and euphotic zones, higher alkalinities, and higher concentrations of base cations and nitrogen, but lower concentrations of dissolved organic C, silica, and P. The increase in alkalinity, was caused by increases in the ratio of base cations to strong acid anions, resulting from the interaction of increased water retention, microbial sulfate reduction, and exchanges of cations between water and sediments. Declines in chlorophyll and increases in phytoplankton biomass were observed, but there was no detectable effect on areal phytoplankton production. Summer subthermocline habitats for cold stenotherms were reduced slightly in extent as the results of thermocline deepening and lower hypolimnetic oxygen. There is considerable potential for interaction between climatic change and other human perturbations affecting boreal lakes, including acidification, increased incident UV radiation, eutrophication, and overharvesting.},

However, comparisons of local ecological processes among regions require a synthetic understanding of how the species pool of potential community members influences the structure of ecological communities. Here, we outline an integrative approach for quantifying local ecological processes while explicitly accounting for species pool influences. Specifically, we highlight the utility of combining geographically replicated local studies, null models of community structure, and ecologically explicit definitions of the species pool as a means to compare predominant ecological processes among regions. By uniting concepts and tools from community ecology and macroecology, this approach might facilitate synthesis and resolve many perceived ecological contingencies.},

  abstract = {It is widely believed that the diversity of plants influences the diversity of animals, and this should be particularly true of herbivores. We examine this supposition at a moderate spatial extent by comparing the richness patterns of the 217 butterfly species resident in California to those of plants, including all 5,902 vascular plant species and the 552 species known to be fed on by caterpillars. We also examine the relationships between plant/butterfly richness and 20 environmental variables. We found that although plant and butterfly diversities are positively correlated, multiple regression, path models, and spatial analysis indicate that once primary productivity (estimated by a water-energy variable, actual evapotranspiration) and topographical variability are incorporated into models, neither measure of plant richness has any relationship with butterfly richness. To examine whether butterflies with the most specialized diets follow the pattern found across all butterflies, we repeated the analyses for 37 species of strict monophages and their food plants and found that plant and butterfly richness were similarly weakly associated after incorporating the environmental variables. We condude that plant diversity does not directly influence butterfly diversity but that both are probably responding to similar environmental factors.},

  volume = {88},

  abstract = {Interactions between trophic levels during food web assembly can drive positive correlations in diversity between producers, consumers, and decomposers. However, the contribution of trophic interactions relative to local environmental factors in promoting species diversity is poorly understood, with many studies only considering two trophic levels. Here we examine correlations in diversity among zooplankton, phytoplankton, and bacteria in the pelagic zone of 31 lakes in British Columbia, Canada. We sampled species diversity of zooplankton and phytoplankton through morphological identification, and bacterial genetic diversity was estimated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rDNA polymorphisms. We looked for correlations in diversity that were independent of the abiotic environment by statistically controlling for 18 limnological variables. No significant correlations were found between the diversity of zooplankton, phytoplankton, and bacteria. In addition, the physical factors that were associated with species composition in one trophic level were independent of those that were important for another. Our results provide no support for the importance of direct feedbacks between producers, consumers, and decomposers in maintaining diversity. Zooplankton, phytoplankton, and bacterial diversity and composition are regulated independently from one another and respond to different environmental variables. These results suggest that species of lake plankton show loose trophic associations with one another due to broad diets in consumers and decomposers.},

Here, we review empirical approaches to metacommunities, both observational and experimental, pertaining to how well they relate to and test theoretical metacommunity paradigms and how well they capture the realities of natural ecosystems. First, we show that the species-sorting and mass-effects paradigms are the most commonly tested and supported paradigms. Second, the dynamics observed can often be ascribed to two or more of the four non-exclusive paradigms. Third, empirical approaches relate only weakly to the concise assumptions and predictions made by the paradigms. Consequently, we suggest major avenues of improvement for empirical metacommunity approaches, including the integration across theoretical approaches and the incorporation of evolutionary and meta-ecosystem dynamics. We hope for metacommunity ecology to thereby bridge existing gaps between empirical and theoretical work, thus becoming a more powerful framework to understand dynamics across ecosystems.},

  abstract = {There is increasing evidence that species extinctions jeopardize the functioning of ecosystems. Overfishing and other human influences are reducing the diversity and abundance of fish worldwide, but the ecosystem-level consequences of these changes have not been assessed quantitatively. Recycling of nutrients is one important ecosystem process that is directly influenced by fish. Fish species vary widely in the rates at which they excrete nitrogen and phosphorus; thus, altering fish communities could affect nutrient recycling. Here, we use extensive field data on nutrient recycling rates and population sizes of fish species in a Neotropical river and Lake Tanganyika, Africa, to evaluate the effects of simulated extinctions on nutrient recycling. In both of these species-rich ecosystems, recycling was dominated by relatively few species, but contributions of individual species differed between nitrogen and phosphorus. Alternative extinction scenarios produced widely divergent patterns. Loss of the species targeted by fishermen led to faster declines in nutrient recycling than extinctions in order of rarity, body size, or trophic position. However, when surviving species were allowed to increase after extinctions, these compensatory responses had strong moderating effects even after losing many species. Our results underscore the complexity of predicting the consequences of extinctions from species-rich animal communities. Nevertheless, the importance of exploited species in nutrient recycling suggests that overfishing could have particularly detrimental effects on ecosystem functioning.},

Here we extend allometric theory-how attributes of organisms change with variation in their size-and test its predictions against worldwide data sets for forest communities by quantifying the relationships among tree size-frequency distributions, standing biomass, species number and number of individuals per unit area. As predicted, except for the highest latitudes, the number of individuals scales as the -2 power of basal stem diameter or as the -3/4 power of above-ground biomass. Also as predicted, this scaling relationship varies little with species diversity, total standing biomass, latitude and geographic sampling area. A simulation model in which individuals allocate biomass to leaf, stem and reproduction, and compete for space and light obtains features identical to those of a community. In tandem with allometric theory, our results indicate that many macroecological features of communities may emerge from a few allometric principles operating at the level of the individual.},

Here we approach this problem by focusing on body size, which is an easily measured species trait that has a pervasive influence on multiple aspects of community structure and ecosystem functioning. We test the predictions of a model derived from metabolic theory using data on ecosystem metabolism and community size structure. These data were collected as part of an aquatic mesocosm experiment that was designed to simulate future environmental warming. Our analyses demonstrate significant linkages between community size structure and ecosystem functioning, and the effects of warming on these links. Specifically, we show that carbon fluxes were significantly influenced by seasonal variation in temperature, and yielded activation energies remarkably similar to those predicted based on the temperature dependencies of individual-level photosynthesis and respiration. We also show that community size structure significantly influenced fluxes of ecosystem respiration and gross primary production, particularly at the annual time-scale. Assessing size structure and the factors that control it, both empirically and theoretically, therefore promises to aid in understanding links between individual organisms and biogeochemical cycles, and in predicting the responses of key ecosystem functions to future environmental change.},

Power laws describe empirical scaling relationships that are emergent quantitative features of biodiversity. These features are patterns of structure or dynamics that are self-similar or fractal-like over many orders of magnitude. Power laws allow extrapolation and prediction over a wide range of scales. Some appear to be universal, occurring in virtually all taxa of organisms and types of environments. They offer clues to underlying mechanisms that powerfully constrain biodiversity. We describe recent progress and future prospects for understanding the mechanisms that generate these power laws, and for explaining the diversity of species and complexity of ecosystems in terms of fundamental principles of physical and biological science.},

  abstract = {Global warming can affect all levels of biological complexity, though we currently understand least about its potential impact on communities and ecosystems. At the ecosystem level, warming has the capacity to alter the structure of communities and the rates of key ecosystem processes they mediate. Here we assessed the effects of a 4°C rise in temperature on the size structure and taxonomic composition of benthic communities in aquatic mesocosms, and the rates of detrital decomposition they mediated. Warming had no effect on biodiversity, but altered community size structure in two ways. In spring, warmer systems exhibited steeper size spectra driven by declines in total community biomass and the proportion of large organisms. By contrast, in autumn, warmer systems had shallower size spectra driven by elevated total community biomass and a greater proportion of large organisms. Community-level shifts were mirrored by changes in decomposition rates. Temperature-corrected microbial and macrofaunal decomposition rates reflected the shifts in community structure and were strongly correlated with biomass across mesocosms. Our study demonstrates that the 4°C rise in temperature expected by the end of the century has the potential to alter the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems profoundly, as well as the intimate linkages between these levels of ecological organization.},

While heuristic arguments have identified processes that create community phylogenetic patterns, further progress hinges on a more comprehensive understanding of the interactions between underlying ecological and evolutionary processes. We created a simulation framework to model trait evolution, assemble communities (via competition, habitat filtering, or neutral assembly), and test the phylogenetic pattern of the resulting communities. We found that phylogenetic community structure is greatest when traits are highly conserved and when multiple traits influence species membership in communities. Habitat filtering produces stronger phylogenetic structure when taxa with derived (as opposed to ancestral) traits are favored in the community. Nearest-relative tests have greater power to detect patterns due to competition, while total community relatedness tests perform better with habitat filtering. The size of the local community relative to the regional pool strongly influences statistical power; in general, power increases with larger pool sizes for communities created by filtering but decreases for communities created by competition. Our results deepen our understanding of processes that contribute to phylogenetic community structure and provide guidance for the design and interpretation of empirical research.},

The choice of transformation and dissimilarity measure has important consequences for interpreting results. For kelp holdfast assemblages from New Zealand, variation in species composition was greater in smaller holdfasts, while variation in relative abundances was greater in larger holdasts. Variation in community structure of Norwegian continental shelf macrobenthic fauna increased with increases in environmental heterogeneity, regardless of the measure used. We propose a new dissimilarity measure which allows the relative weight placed on changes in composition vs. abundance to be specified explicitly.},

  abstract = {Techniques to evaluate elements of metacommunity structure (EMS; coherence, species turnover and range boundary clumping) have been available for several years. Such approaches are capable of determining which idealized pattern of species distribution best describes distributions in a metacommunity. Nonetheless, this approach rarely is employed and such aspects of metacommunity structure remain poorly understood. We expanded an extant method to better investigate metacommunity structure for systems that respond to multiple environmental gradients. We used data obtained from 26 sites throughout Paraguay as a model system to demonstrate application of this methodology. Using presence-absence data for bats, we evaluated coherence, species turnover and boundary clumping to distinguish among six idealized patterns of species distribution. Analyses were conducted for all bats as well as for each of three feeding ensembles (aerial insectivores, frugivores and molossid insectivores). For each group of bats, analyses were conducted separately for primary and secondary axes of ordination as defined by reciprocal averaging. The Paraguayan bat metacommunity evinced Clementsian distributions for primary and secondary ordination axes. Patterns of species distribution for aerial insectivores were dependent on ordination axis, showing Gleasonian distributions when ordinated according to the primary axis and Clementsian distributions when ordinated according to the secondary axis. Distribution patterns for frugivores and molossid insectivores were best described as random. Analysis of metacommunities using multiple ordination axes can provide a more complete picture of environmental variables that mold patterns of species distribution. Moreover, analysis of EMS along defined gradients (e.g., latitude, elevation and depth) or based on alternative ordination techniques may complement insights based on reciprocal averaging because the fundamental questions addressed in analyses are contingent on the ordination technique that is employed.},

  abstract = {Ecological communities show great variation in species richness, composition and food web structure across similar and diverse ecosystems. Knowledge of how this biodiversity relates to ecosystem functioning is important for understanding the maintenance of diversity and the potential effects of species losses and gains on ecosystems. While research often focuses on how variation in species richness influences ecosystem processes, assessing species richness in a food web context can provide further insight into the relationship between diversity and ecosystem functioning and elucidate potential mechanisms underpinning this relationship. Here, we assessed how species richness and trophic diversity affect decomposition rates in a complete aquatic food web: the five trophic level web that occurs within water-filled leaves of the northern pitcher plant, Sarracenia purpurea. We identified a trophic cascade in which top-predators–larvae of the pitcher-plant mosquito–indirectly increased bacterial decomposition by preying on bactivorous protozoa. Our data also revealed a facultative relationship in which larvae of the pitcher-plant midge increased bacterial decomposition by shredding detritus. These important interactions occur only in food webs with high trophic diversity, which in turn only occur in food webs with high species richness. We show that species richness and trophic diversity underlie strong linkages between food web structure and dynamics that influence ecosystem functioning. The importance of trophic diversity and species interactions in determining how biodiversity relates to ecosystem functioning suggests that simply focusing on species richness does not give a complete picture as to how ecosystems may change with the loss or gain of species.},

  abstract = {Global patterns of species richness and their structuring forces have fascinated biologists since Darwin and provide critical context for contemporary studies in ecology, evolution and conservation. Anthropogenic impacts and the need for systematic conservation planning have further motivated the analysis of diversity patterns and processes at regional to global scales. Whereas land diversity patterns and their predictors are known for numerous taxa, our understanding of global marine diversity has been more limited, with recent findings revealing some striking contrasts to widely held terrestrial paradigms. Here we examine global patterns and predictors of species richness across 13 major species groups ranging from zooplankton to marine mammals. Two major patterns emerged: coastal species showed maximum diversity in the Western Pacific, whereas oceanic groups consistently peaked across broad mid-latitudinal bands in all oceans. Spatial regression analyses revealed sea surface temperature as the only environmental predictor highly related to diversity across all 13 taxa. Habitat availability and historical factors were also important for coastal species, whereas other predictors had less significance. Areas of high species richness were disproportionately concentrated in regions with medium or higher human impacts. Our findings indicate a fundamental role of temperature or kinetic energy in structuring cross-taxon marine biodiversity, and indicate that changes in ocean temperature, in conjunction with other human impacts, may ultimately rearrange the global distribution of life in the ocean.},

  abstract = {Global circulation models predict and numerous observations confirm that anthropogenic climate change has altered high-frequency climate variability. However, it is not yet well understood how changing patterns of environmental variation will affect wildlife population dynamics and other ecological processes. Theory predicts that a population's long-run growth rate is diminished and the chance of population extinction is increased as environmental variation increases. This results from the fact that population growth is a multiplicative process and that long-run population growth rate is the geometric mean of growth rates over time, which is always less than the arithmetic mean. However, when population growth rates for unstructured populations are related nonlinearly to environmental drivers, increasing environmental variation can increase a population's long-run growth rate. This suggests that patterns of environmental variation associated with different aspects of climate change may affect population dynamics in different ways. Specifically, increasing variation in rainfall might result in diminished long-run growth rates for many animal species while increasing variation in temperature might result in increased long-run growth rates. While the effect of rainfall is theoretically well understood and supported by data, the hypothesized effect of temperature is not. Here, I analyse two datasets to study the effect of fluctuating temperatures on growth rates of zooplankton. Results are consistent with the prediction that fluctuating temperatures should increase long-run growth rates and the frequency of extreme demographic events.},

Fluctuating conditions are a double edged sword for diversity, either promoting coexistence through temporal niche partitioning or excluding species by stochastic extinctions. The net effect of environmental variation on diversity is largely unknown. We examined the association between zooplankton species richness in lakes and environmental variability on interannual, seasonal and shorter time scales, as well as long-term average conditions. We analyzed data on physical, chemical and biological limnology in 53 temperate zone lakes in North America and Europe sampled over a combined 1042 years. Large fluctuations in pH, phosphorus and dissolved organic carbon concentration on different time scales were associated with reduced zooplankton species richness. More species were found in lakes that showed greater temperature variation on all time scales. Environmental variability on different time scales showed similar or, in some cases, stronger associations with zooplankton species richness compared with long-term average conditions. Our results suggest that temporal fluctuations in the chemical environment tend to exclude zooplankton species while temperature variability promotes greater richness. The results indicate that anthropogenic increases in temporal variability of future climates may have profound effects on biodiversity.},

The present work provides a study of the phylogenetic dissimilarity of 96 tree communities in India. The work compares and contrasts eight metrics of phylogenetic dissimilarity, considers the role of phylogenetic signal in trait data and shows that environmental distance rather than spatial distance is the best correlate of phylogenetic dissimilarity in the study system.$\backslash$textless/p$\backslash$textgreater},

Mechanistic hypotheses range from niche-based deterministic to dispersal-based stochastic models. Strong tests of these hypotheses require detailed information regarding the functional strategies of species. A few tropical studies to date have examined trait dispersion within individual forest plots using species trait means in order to ask whether coexisting species tend to be more or less functionally similar than expected given a null model. The present work takes an alternative approach by: (i) explicitly incorporating population-level trait variability; and (ii) quantifying the functional beta diversity in a series of 15 tropical forest plots arrayed along an elevational gradient. The results show a strong pattern of decay in community functional similarity with elevation. These observed patterns of functional beta diversity are shown to be highly non-random and support a deterministic model of tropical tree community assembly and turnover.},

Recently, there has been a new emphasis on intraspecific variability. Indeed, recent developments in trait-based community ecology have underlined the need to integrate variation at both the intraspecific as well as interspecific level. We introduce new T-statistics ('T' for trait), based on the comparison of intraspecific and interspecific variances of functional traits across organizational levels, to operationally incorporate intraspecific variability into community ecology theory. We show that a focus on the distribution of traits at local and regional scales combined with original analytical tools can provide unique insights into the primary forces structuring communities.},

  abstract = {Pelagic crustacean zooplankton were collected from 336 Norwegian lakes covering a wide range of latitude, altitude, lake area, mean depth, production (as chlorophyll a), and fish community structure. Mean zooplankton species richness during the ice-free season was generally low at high latitudes and altitudes. Further, lower species richness was recorded in western lakes, possibly reflecting constraints on migration and dispersal. However, despite obvious spatial limitations, geographic boundaries were only weak predictors of mean zooplankton richness. Similarly, lake surface area did not contribute positively to mean richness such as seen in other ecosystem surveys. Rather, intrinsic factors such as primary production and fish community (planktivore) structure were identified by regression analysis as the major predictors of zooplankton diversity, while a positive correlation was observed between species richness and total zooplankton biomass. However, in spite of a large number of variables included in this study, the predictive power of multiple regression models was modest ($\backslash$textless50\% variance explained), pointing to a major role for within-lake properties, as yet unidentified intrinsic forces, stochasticity, or dispersal as constraints on zooplankton diversity in these lakes.},

  abstract = {Recent research has highlighted that positive biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships hold for all groups of organisms, including microbes. Yet, we still lack understanding regarding the drivers of microbial diversity, in particular, whether diversity of microbial communities is a matter of local factors, or whether metacommunities are of similar importance to what is known from higher organisms. Here, we explore the driving forces behind spatial variability in lake phytoplankton diversity in Fennoscandia. While phytoplankton biovolume is best predicted by local phosphorus concentrations, phytoplankton diversity (measured as genus richness, G) only showed weak correlations with local concentrations of total phosphorus. By estimating spatial averages of total phosphorus concentrations on various scales from an independent, spatially representative lake survey, we found that close to 70 per cent of the variability in local phytoplankton diversity can be explained by regionally averaged phosphorus concentrations on a scale between 100 and 400 km. Thus, the data strongly indicate the existence of metacommunities on this scale. Furthermore, we show a strong dependency between lake productivity and spatial community turnover. Thus, regional productivity affects beta-diversity by controlling spatial community turnover, resulting in scale-dependent productivity-diversity relationships. As an illustration of the interaction between local and regional processes in shaping microbial diversity, our results offer both empirical support and a plausible mechanism for the existence of common scaling rules in both the macrobial and the microbial worlds. We argue that awareness of regional species pools in phytoplankton and other unicellular organisms may critically improve our understanding of ecosystems and their susceptibility to anthropogenic stressors.},

  doi = {10.1007/s00442-004-1749-2},
  abstract = {In the past years, a number of studies have used experimental plant communities to test if biodiversity influences ecosystem functioning such as productivity. It has been argued, however, that the results achieved in experimental studies may have little predictive value for species loss in natural ecosystems. Studies in natural ecosystems have been equivocal, mainly because in natural ecosystems differences in diversity are often confounded with differences in land use history or abiotic parameters. In this study, we investigated the effect of plant diversity on ecosystem functioning in semi-natural grasslands. In an area of 10x20 km, we selected 78 sites and tested the effects of various measures of diversity and plant community composition on productivity. We separated the effects of plant diversity on ecosystem functioning from potentially confounding effects of community composition, management or environmental parameters, using multivariate statistical analyses. In the investigated grasslands, simple measures of biodiversity were insignificant predictors of productivity. However, plant community composition explained productivity very well (R2=0.31) and was a better predictor than environmental variables (soil and site characteristics) or management regime. Thus, complex measures such as community composition and structure are important drivers for ecosystem functions in semi-natural grasslands. Furthermore, our data show that it is difficult to extrapolate results from experimental studies to semi-natural ecosystems, although there is a need to investigate natural ecosystems to fully understand the relationship of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.},

It remains unclear whether this process has important effects in mature natural ecosystems where competitive feedbacks and complex environmental influences affect diversity-productivity relationships. In this study, we evaluated diversity-productivity relationships while statistically controlling for environmental influences in 12 natural grassland ecosystems. Because diversity-productivity relationships are conspicuously nonlinear, we developed a nonlinear structural equation modeling (SEM) methodology to separate the effects of diversity on productivity from the effects of productivity on diversity. Meta-analysis was used to summarize the SEM findings across studies. While competitive effects were readily detected, enhancement of production by diversity was not. These results suggest that the influence of small-scale diversity on productivity in mature natural systems is a weak force, both in absolute terms and relative to the effects of other controls on productivity.},

  abstract = {Understanding how biodiversity affects functioning of ecosystems requires integrating diversity within trophic levels (horizontal diversity) and across trophic levels (vertical diversity, including food chain length and omnivory). We review theoretical and experimental progress toward this goal. Generally, experiments show that biomass and resource use increase similarly with horizontal diversity of either producers or consumers. Among prey, higher diversity often increases resistance to predation, due to increased probability of including inedible species and reduced efficiency of specialist predators confronted with diverse prey. Among predators, changing diversity can cascade to affect plant biomass, but the strength and sign of this effect depend on the degree of omnivory and prey behaviour. Horizontal and vertical diversity also interact: adding a trophic level can qualitatively change diversity effects at adjacent levels. Multitrophic interactions produce a richer variety of diversity-functioning relationships than the monotonic changes predicted for single trophic levels. This complexity depends on the degree of consumer dietary generalism, trade-offs between competitive ability and resistance to predation, intraguild predation and openness to migration. Although complementarity and selection effects occur in both animals and plants, few studies have conclusively documented the mechanisms mediating diversity effects. Understanding how biodiversity affects functioning of complex ecosystems will benefit from integrating theory and experiments with simulations and network-based approaches.},

  abstract = {Human-dominated marine ecosystems are experiencing accelerating loss of populations and species, with largely unknown consequences. We analyzed local experiments, long-term regional time series, and global fisheries data to test how biodiversity loss affects marine ecosystem services across temporal and spatial scales. Overall, rates of resource collapse increased and recovery potential, stability, and water quality decreased exponentially with declining diversity. Restoration of biodiversity, in contrast, increased productivity fourfold and decreased variability by 21\%, on average. We conclude that marine biodiversity loss is increasingly impairing the ocean's capacity to provide food, maintain water quality, and recover from perturbations. Yet available data suggest that at this point, these trends are still reversible.},

  abstract = {Concern is growing about the consequences of biodiversity loss for ecosystem functioning, for the provision of ecosystem services, and for human well being. Experimental evidence for a relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem process rates is compelling, but the issue remains contentious. Here, we present the first rigorous quantitative assessment of this relationship through meta-analysis of experimental work spanning 50 years to June 2004. We analysed 446 measures of biodiversity effects (252 in grasslands), 319 of which involved primary producer manipulations or measurements. Our analyses show that: biodiversity effects are weaker if biodiversity manipulations are less well controlled; effects of biodiversity change on processes are weaker at the ecosystem compared with the community level and are negative at the population level; productivity-related effects decline with increasing number of trophic links between those elements manipulated and those measured; biodiversity effects on stability measures ('insurance' effects) are not stronger than biodiversity effects on performance measures. For those ecosystem services which could be assessed here, there is clear evidence that biodiversity has positive effects on most. Whilst such patterns should be further confirmed, a precautionary approach to biodiversity management would seem prudent in the meantime.},

  abstract = {In stream food-web analysis, the contributions of carbon from periphyton (an autochthonous source) and terrestrial litter (an allochthonous source) are estimated by isotopic difference. We hypothesised that periphyton δ13C varies among stream habitats, whereas Δ14C does not because Δ14C is corrected with δ13C, by definition. To test this hypothesis, we compared the variability of δ13C and Δ14C of periphyton and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in four habitats (open v. shaded, riffle v. pool) within a limestone-based upland stream in Japan. Periphyton δ13C values (from –31.9‰ to –16.3‰) were significantly different among the habitats whereas the Δ14C values (from –379‰ to –141‰) were not. Periphyton δ13C values depended on both algal photosynthetic activity and δ13C of the DIC, whereas periphyton Δ14C depended only on DIC Δ14C. The δ13C and Δ14C values of litter were constant. Thus, the difference between the periphyton and litter δ13C values (Δδ13C) varied among habitats, but their Δ14C differences (ΔΔ14C) did not. Our results indicate that Δ14C is spatially stable among stream habitats and that Δ14C measurements can be used to precisely determine carbon sources for stream food-web analysis within individual reaches.},

  abstract = {Dormancy is a bet-hedging strategy used by a variety of organisms to overcome unfavorable environmental conditions. By entering a reversible state of low metabolic activity, dormant individuals become members of a seed bank, which can determine community dynamics in future generations. Although microbiologists have documented dormancy in both clinical and natural settings, the importance of seed banks for the diversity and functioning of microbial communities remains untested. Here, we develop a theoretical model demonstrating that microbial communities are structured by environmental cues that trigger dormancy. A molecular survey of lake ecosystems revealed that dormancy plays a more important role in shaping bacterial communities than eukaryotic microbial communities. The proportion of dormant bacteria was relatively low in productive ecosystems but accounted for up to 40\% of taxon richness in nutrient-poor systems. Our simulations and empirical data suggest that regional environmental cues and dormancy synchronize the composition of active communities across the landscape while decoupling active microbes from the total community at local scales. Furthermore, we observed that rare bacterial taxa were disproportionately active relative to common bacterial taxa, suggesting that microbial rank-abundance curves are more dynamic than previously considered. We propose that repeated transitions to and from the seed bank may help maintain the high levels of microbial biodiversity that are observed in nearly all ecosystems.},

In the case of consumers competing for similar resources, the diversity of those resources is thought to provide some degree of niche diversification in which a diverse set of consumer species can coexist. If, however, the diverse resources are not sufficiently distinct from one another, from the standpoint of the consumer species, such niche diversification will not exist. We experimentally show that a diverse array of twigs attracted 80\% more species of twig-nesting ants than a monospecific collection of twigs. The specific tree species from which the twigs were derived did not explain the pattern. It appears that diversity per se at one level (twigs) creates conditions that promote diversity at another level (nesting ants).},

  abstract = {An unappreciated facet of biodiversity is that rich communities and high abundance may foster parasitism. For parasites that sequentially use different host species throughout complex life cycles, parasite diversity and abundance in ‘downstream' hosts should logically increase with the diversity and abundance of ‘upstream' hosts (which carry the preceding stages of parasites). Surprisingly, this logical assumption has little empirical support, especially regarding metazoan parasites. Few studies have attempted direct tests of this idea and most have lacked the appropriate scale of investigation. In two different studies, we used time-lapse videography to quantify birds at fine spatial scales, and then related bird communities to larval trematode communities in snail populations sampled at the same small spatial scales. Species richness, species heterogeneity and abundance of final host birds were positively correlated with species richness, species heterogeneity and abundance of trematodes in host snails. Such community-level interactions have rarely been demonstrated and have implications for community theory, epidemiological theory and ecosystem management.},

  abstract = {The search for a common cause of species richness gradients has spawned more than 100 explanatory hypotheses in just the past two decades. Despite recent conceptual advances, further refinement of the most plausible models has been stifled by the difficulty of compiling high-resolution databases at continental scales. We used a database of the geographic ranges of 2,869 species of birds breeding in South America (nearly a third of the world's living avian species) to explore the influence of climate, quadrat area, ecosystem diversity, and topography on species richness gradients at 10 spatial scales (quadrat area, ≈12,300 to ≈1,225,000 km2). Topography, precipitation, topography × latitude, ecosystem diversity, and cloud cover emerged as the most important predictors of regional variability of species richness in regression models incorporating 16 independent variables, although ranking of variables depended on spatial scale. Direct measures of ambient energy such as mean and maximum temperature were of ancillary importance. Species richness values for 1° × 1° latitude-longitude quadrats in the Andes (peaking at 845 species) were ≈30–250\% greater than those recorded at equivalent latitudes in the central Amazon basin. These findings reflect the extraordinary abundance of species associated with humid montane regions at equatorial latitudes and the importance of orography in avian speciation. In a broader context, our data reinforce the hypothesis that terrestrial species richness from the equator to the poles is ultimately governed by a synergism between climate and coarse-scale topographic heterogeneity.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:Plant-feeding insects make up a large part of earth's total biodiversity. While it has been shown that herbivory has repeatedly led to increased diversification rates in insects, there has been no compelling explanation for how plant-feeding has promoted speciation rates. There is a growing awareness that ecological factors can lead to rapid diversification and, as one of the most prominent features of most insect-plant interactions, specialization onto a diverse resource has often been assumed to be the main process behind this diversification. However, specialization is mainly a pruning process, and is not able to actually generate diversity by itself. Here we investigate the role of host colonizations in generating insect diversity, by testing if insect speciation rate is correlated with resource diversity.RESULTS:By applying a variant of independent contrast analysis, specially tailored for use on questions of species richness (MacroCAIC), we show that species richness is strongly correlated with diversity of host use in the butterfly family Nymphalidae. Furthermore, by comparing the results from reciprocal sister group selection, where sister groups were selected either on the basis of diversity of host use or species richness, we find that it is likely that diversity of host use is driving species richness, rather than vice versa.CONCLUSION:We conclude that resource diversity is correlated with species richness in the Nymphalidae and suggest a scenario based on recurring oscillations between host expansions - the incorporation of new plants into the repertoire - and specialization, as an important driving force behind the diversification of plant-feeding insects.},

We use taxonomic presence-absence and abundance data for bacteria, phytoplankton, zooplankton, and fish from 18 lakes in southern Quebec, Canada. The question of interest was whether communities composed of organisms with more limited dispersal abilities, because of size and life history (zooplankton and fish) would show a different effect of lake distribution than communities composed of good dispersers (bacteria and phytoplankton). We examine the variation in structure attributable to local environmental (i.e., lake chemical and physical variables) vs. dispersal predictors (i.e., overland and watercourse distances between lakes) using variation partitioning techniques. Overall, we show that less motile species (crustacean zooplankton and fish) are better predicted by spatial factors than by local environmental ones. Furthermore, we show that for zooplankton abundances, both overland and watercourse dispersal pathways are equally strong, though they may select for different components of the community, while for fish, only watercourses are relevant dispersal pathways. These results suggest that crustacean zooplankton and fish are more constrained by dispersal and therefore more likely to operate as a metacommunity than are bacteria and phytoplankton within this studied landscape.},

We examine how concepts pertaining to the assembly of plant communities can be used to strengthen resistance to invasion in restored communities. Community ecology theory predicts that an invasive species will be unlikely to establish if there is a species with similar traits present in the resident community or if available niches are filled. Therefore, successful restoration efforts should select native species with traits similar to likely invaders and include a diversity of functional traits. The success of trait-based approaches to restoration will depend largely on the diversity of invaders, on the strength of environmental factors and on dispersal dynamics of invasive and native species.},

  abstract = {The idea that productivity regulates species diversity is deeply ingrained in the field of ecology. Yet, over the past few decades, an increasing number of experiments have shown that species diversity controls, rather than simply responds to, biomass production. These contrasting perspectives have led to a seeming paradox: Is diversity the cause or the consequence of biological production? Here we present empirical evidence for the multivariate productivity-diversity (MPD) hypothesis, which argues that differing perspectives on productivity-diversity relationships can be resolved by recognizing that historical research has focused on how resource supply regulates both the productivity and richness of local competitors, whereas more recent studies have focused on how the richness of a colonist pool regulates the efficiency by which resources are captured and converted into new tissue. The MPD hypothesis predicts that three pathways operate concurrently to generate productivity diversity relationships in nature: (1) resource supply directly limits the standing biomass and/or rate of new production by primary producers, (2) producer biomass is directly influenced by the richness of species that locally compete for resources, and (3) resource supply rate indirectly affects producer biomass by influencing the fraction of species from a colonist pool that locally coexist. To examine whether this set of pathways explains covariation between productivity and diversity in natural streams, we used nutrient-diffusing agar "patches" to manipulate resource supply rates in 20 streams throughout the Sierra Nevada mountain range, California, USA. We then measured the fraction of periphyton species from the stream colonist pool co-occurring on each nutrient patch, as well as the standing biomass and rates of primary production. Natural patterns of covariation agreed with predictions of the MPD hypothesis. Algal biomass was an increasing function of nutrient supply, and an increasing function of local richness. The fraction of species from the colonist pool found co-occurring on a patch was a concave-down function of nutrient supply, causing nutrients to indirectly affect biomass via control over local richness. These results suggest that the MPD hypothesis is a viable explanation of patterns of diversity and productivity in natural stream ecosystems, and that it has potential to merge the historical view that productivity drives diversity with a parallel view that diversity drives productivity.},

This fundamental ecosystem attribute has long been recognized but the influence of this property on community regulation has not been investigated. We propose that this environmental attribute may explain variation in the strength of trophic cascades among ecosystems. Simply because of gravity, we should predict that systems with convex profiles receive low amounts of subsidies whereas systems with concave profiles act as spatial attractors, and receive high amounts of subsidies. The subsidy hypothesis states that ecosystems with high amounts of allochthonous inputs will experience the strongest trophic cascades. To test this hypothesis, we derive ecosystem models and investigate the effect of location and magnitude of subsidies on the strength of trophic cascades. Predictions from our models support the subsidy hypothesis and highlight the need to consider ecosystems as open to allochthonous flows.},

Specific rates of growth and grazing mortality were generally similar for both lakes. However, the abundance of bacteria was consistently 2–3 times higher in the water of the humic lake, suggesting that the total production and consumption of bacterial cells were also higher than in the dearwater lake. The ratio of bacterial secondary production to primary production was higher in the humic lake than in the clearwater lake, indicating that the bacterioplankton of the humic lake utilize allochthonous substrates, in addition to substrates originating from autochthonous primary production. Most of the bacterial loss in both lakes could be attributed to small protozoan grazers. This implies that allochthonous and autochthonous organic carbon fixed by bacterioplankton is less important in terms of carbon flow to higher trophic levels than would be expected if macrozooplankton were the dominant bacterivores, providing a more direct and efficient transfer of carbon to larger organisms.},

  abstract = {Natural populations consist of phenotypically diverse individuals that exhibit variation in their demographic parameters and intra- and inter-specific interactions. Recent experimental work indicates that such variation can have significant ecological effects. However, ecological models typically disregard this variation and focus instead on trait means and total population density. Under what situations is this simplification appropriate? Why might intraspecific variation alter ecological dynamics? In this review we synthesize recent theory and identify six general mechanisms by which trait variation changes the outcome of ecological interactions. These mechanisms include several direct effects of trait variation per se and indirect effects arising from the role of genetic variation in trait evolution.},

As a result, we have a poor understanding of how the ecological and evolutionary processes that create, maintain, and change biological diversity affect the flux of energy and materials in global biogeochemical cycles. The goal of this article was to review several research fields at the interfaces between ecosystem science, community ecology and evolutionary biology, and suggest new ways to integrate evolutionary biology and ecosystem science. In particular, we focus on how phenotypic evolution by natural selection can influence ecosystem functions by affecting processes at the environmental, population and community scale of ecosystem organization. We develop an eco-evolutionary model to illustrate linkages between evolutionary change (e.g. phenotypic evolution of producer), ecological interactions (e.g. consumer grazing) and ecosystem processes (e.g. nutrient cycling). We conclude by proposing experiments to test the ecosystem consequences of evolutionary changes.},

  abstract = {Heterozygosity has been associated with components of fitness in numerous studies across a wide range of taxa. Because heterozygosity is associated with individual performance it is also expected to be associated with population dynamics. However, investigations into the association between heterozygosity and population dynamics have been rare because of difficulties in linking evolutionary and ecological processes. The choice of heterozygosity measure is a further issue confounding such studies as it can be biased by individual differences in the frequencies of the alleles studied, the number of alleles at each locus as well as the total number of loci typed. In this study, we first examine the differences between the principal metrics used to calculate heterozygosity using long-term data from a marked population of Soay sheep (Ovis aries). Next, by means of statistical transformation of the homozygosity weighted by loci index, we determine how heterozygosity contributes to population growth in Soay sheep by modelling individual contributions to population growth (p(t(i))) as a function of several covariates, including sex, weight and faecal egg count - a surrogate of parasitic nematode burden in the gut. We demonstrate that although heterozygosity is associated with some components of fitness, most notably adult male reproductive success, in general it is only weakly associated with population growth.},

  abstract = {Fluxes of organic matter across habitat boundaries are common in food webs. These fluxes may strongly influence community dynamics, depending on the extent to which they are used by consumers. Yet understanding of basal resource use by consumers is limited, because describing trophic pathways in complex food webs is difficult. We quantified resource use for zooplankton, zoobenthos, and fishes in four low-productivity lakes, using a Bayesian mixing model and measurements of hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen stable isotope ratios. Multiple sources of uncertainty were explicitly incorporated into the model. As a result, posterior estimates of resource use were often broad distributions; nevertheless, clear patterns were evident. Zooplankton relied on terrestrial and pelagic primary production, while zoobenthos and fishes relied on terrestrial and benthic primary production. Across all consumer groups terrestrial reliance tended to be higher, and benthic reliance lower, in lakes where light penetration was low due to inputs of terrestrial dissolved organic carbon. These results support and refine an emerging consensus that terrestrial and benthic support of lake food webs can be substantial, and they imply that changes in the relative availability of basal resources drive the strength of cross-habitat trophic connections.},

Although cross-ecosystem subsidies between terrestrial and aquatic systems have been well recognized for benthic organisms in streams, rivers, and the littoral zones of lakes, terrestrial subsidies to pelagic consumers are more difficult to demonstrate and remain controversial. Here, we adopt a unique approach by using stable isotopes of H, C, and N to estimate terrestrial support to zooplankton in two contrasting lakes. Zooplankton (Holopedium, Daphnia, and Leptodiaptomus) are comprised of ≈ 20-40\% of organic material of terrestrial origin. These estimates are as high as, or higher than, prior measures obtained by experimentally manipulating the inorganic (13)C content of these lakes to augment the small, natural contrast in (13)C between terrestrial and algal photosynthesis. Our study gives credence to a growing literature, which we review here, suggesting that significant terrestrial support of pelagic crustaceans (zooplankton) is widespread.},

  abstract = {Estimating the production of marine copepods depends on measuring two key variables: biomass and growth rate. The major difficulty in estimating production of marine copepods and other zooplankton has been the inability to obtain precise, rapid measurements. In practice the variability in measurement of biomass greatly exceeds that in growth rate. It is shown here that individual growth rates of copepods can be accurately estimated from data on generation times and the weights of eggs and adults. Analysis of 181 separately published estimates of generation time for 33 species of copepods at environmental temperatures ranging from -1.7 degrees to 30.7 degrees C shows that temperature alone explains more than 90\% of the variance in growth rate. Temperature dependence of growth rate transcends species differences. Weight-specific growth rate appears to be independent of body size. We hypothesize that food may not be limiting to growth in nature; the impression that food is limiting may be due to sampling at the wrong scales. Another possible cause of the apparent maximum growth rates of copepods in nature is predation mortality, which could selectively remove slower-growing individuals from the population. The temperature-dependent model developed here predicts the phenomenon of decreasing body size with increasing environmental temperature, often observed for single species of copepods. A method is suggested for making more accurate estimates of secondary production by using modern instrumentation to make quasi-synoptic measurements of biomass and temperature and using the temperature-dependent model to estimate individual growth rates.},

  abstract = {Stable isotopes are increasingly being used as tracers in environmental studies. One application is to use isotopic ratios to quantitatively determine the proportional contribution of several sources to a mixture, such as the proportion of various pollution sources in a waste stream. In general, the proportional contributions of n+1 different sources can be uniquely determined by the use of n different isotope system tracers (e.g., delta13C, delta15N, delta18O) with linear mixing models based on mass balance equations. Often, however, the number of potential sources exceeds n+1, which prevents finding a unique solution of source proportions. What can be done in these situations? While no definitive solution exists, we propose a method that is informative in determining bounds for the contributions of each source. In this method, all possible combinations of each source contribution (0-100\%) are examined in small increments (e.g., 1\%). Combinations that sum to the observed mixture isotopic signatures within a small tolerance (e.g., +/-0.1 per thousand ) are considered to be feasible solutions, from which the frequency and range of potential source contributions can be determined. To avoid misrepresenting the results, users of this procedure should report the distribution of feasible solutions rather than focusing on a single value such as the mean. We applied this method to a variety of environmental studies in which stable isotope tracers were used to quantify the relative magnitude of multiple sources, including (1) plant water use, (2) geochemistry, (3) air pollution, and (4) dietary analysis. This method gives the range of isotopically determined source contributions; additional non-isotopic constraints specific to each study may be used to further restrict this range. The breadth of the isotopically determined ranges depends on the geometry of the mixing space and the similarity of source and mixture isotopic signatures. A sensitivity analysis indicated that the estimated ranges vary only modestly with different choices of source increment and mass balance tolerance parameter values. A computer program (IsoSource) to perform these calculations for user-specified data is available at http://www.epa.gov/wed/pages/models.htm.},

We develop a method that aims to evaluate the interaction between phylogenetic structure, historical biogeographic events and environmental filtering in driving species distributions in a large-scale metacommunity. Using freshwater zooplankton as a case study, we contrast the phylogenetic metacommunity structure of calanoid copepods and an ecologically similar but more vagile group, daphniids, in the northeastern US. We find that legacies of historical biogeographical events have strongly constrained calanoid distributions within this area, but that adaptation to different water chemistry and lake morphology drives the metacommunity structure of daphniids. Our findings show that biogeographic history and metacommunity processes jointly regulate community structure in these lakes and suggest that this also depends on factors that affect the colonization rate of different types of organisms.},

  volume = {89},
  issn = {0012-9658},
  abstract = {Functional diversity is increasingly identified as an important driver of ecosystem functioning. Various indices have been proposed to measure the functional diversity of a community, but there is still no consensus on which are most suitable. Indeed, none of the existing indices meets all the criteria required for general use. The main criteria are that they must be designed to deal with several traits, take into account abundances, and measure all the facets of functional diversity. Here we propose three indices to quantify each facet of functional diversity for a community with species distributed in a multidimensional functional space: functional richness (volume of the functional space occupied by the community), functional evenness (regularity of the distribution of abundance in this volume), and functional divergence (divergence in the distribution of abundance in this volume). Functional richness is estimated using the existing convex hull volume index. The new functional evenness index is based on the minimum spanning tree which links all the species in the multidimensional functional space. Then this new index quantifies the regularity with which species abundances are distributed along the spanning tree. Functional divergence is measured using a novel index which quantifies how species diverge in their distances (weighted by their abundance) from the center of gravity in the functional space. We show that none of the indices meets all the criteria required for a functional diversity index, but instead we show that the set of three complementary indices meets these criteria. Through simulations of artificial data sets, we demonstrate that functional divergence and functional evenness are independent of species richness and that the three functional diversity indices are independent of each other. Overall, our study suggests that decomposition of functional diversity into its three primary components provides a meaningful framework for its quantification and for the classification of existing functional diversity indices. This decomposition has the potential to shed light on the role of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning and on the influence of biotic and abiotic filters on the structure of species communities. Finally, we propose a general framework for applying these three functional diversity indices.},

  doi = {10.1111/j.1469-185X.2010.00171.x},
  abstract = {One of the oldest challenges in ecology is to understand the processes that underpin the composition of communities. Historically, an obvious way in which to describe community compositions has been diversity in terms of the number and abundances of species. However, the failure to reject contradictory models has led to communities now being characterized by trait and phylogenetic diversities. Our objective here is to demonstrate how species, trait and phylogenetic diversity can be combined together from large to local spatial scales to reveal the historical, deterministic and stochastic processes that impact the compositions of local communities. Research in this area has recently been advanced by the development of mathematical measures that incorporate trait dissimilarities and phylogenetic relatedness between species. However, measures of trait diversity have been developed independently of phylogenetic measures and conversely most of the phylogenetic diversity measures have been developed independently of trait diversity measures. This has led to semantic confusions particularly when classical ecological and evolutionary approaches are integrated so closely together. Consequently, we propose a unified semantic framework and demonstrate the importance of the links among species, phylogenetic and trait diversity indices. Furthermore, species, trait and phylogenetic diversity indices differ in the ways they can be used across different spatial scales. The connections between large-scale, regional and local processes allow the consideration of historical factors in addition to local ecological deterministic or stochastic processes. Phylogenetic and trait diversity have been used in large-scale analyses to determine how historical and/or environmental factors affect both the formation of species assemblages and patterns in species richness across latitude or elevation gradients. Both phylogenetic and trait diversity have been used at different spatial scales to identify the relative impacts of ecological deterministic processes such as environmental filtering and limiting similarity from alternative processes such as random speciation and extinction, random dispersal and ecological drift. Measures of phylogenetic diversity combine phenotypic and genetic diversity and have the potential to reveal both the ecological and historical factors that impact local communities. Consequently, we demonstrate that, when used in a comparative way, species, trait and phylogenetic structures have the potential to reveal essential details that might act simultaneously in the assembly of species communities. We highlight potential directions for future research. These might include how variation in trait and phylogenetic diversity alters with spatial distances, the role of trait and phylogenetic diversity in global-scale gradients, the connections between traits and phylogeny, the importance of trait rarity and independent evolutionary history in community assembly, the loss of trait and phylogenetic diversity due to human impacts, and the mathematical developments of biodiversity indices including within-species variations.},

  issn = {0012-9658},
  abstract = {Linking species and ecosystems often relies on approaches that consider how the traits exhibited by species affect ecosystem processes. One method is to estimate functional diversity (FD) based on the dispersion of species in functional trait space. Individuals within a species also differ, however, and an unresolved challenge is how to include such intraspecific variability in a measure of functional diversity. Our solution is to extend an existing measure to variation among individuals within species. Here, simulations demonstrate how the new measure behaves relative to one that does not include individual variation. Individual-level FD was less well associated with species richness than species-level FD in a single trait dimension, because species differed in their intraspecific variation. However, in multiple trait dimensions, there was a strong association between individual- and species-level FD and richness, because many traits result in a tight relationship between functional diversity and species richness. The correlation between the two FD measures weakened as the amount of intraspecific variability increased. Analyzing natural plant communities we found no relationship between species richness and functional diversity. In these analyses, we did not have to specify the source of intraspecific variation. In fact, the variation was only among individuals. The measure can, however, include differences in the amount of intraspecific variation at different sites, as we demonstrate. Including intraspecific variation should allow a more complete understanding of the processes that link individuals and ecosystems and provide better predictions about the consequences of extinctions for ecosystem processes.},

From a study of rockfish hotspot diversity from the Southern California Bight, the analysis of PD revealed a recent decrease in the amount of fish caught from six evolutionary deep lineages, with implications for the community structure of this speciose group.

Patterns of diversity, for example, represent the regional buildup of species through immigration and diversification, their loss through extinction, and the sorting of species ecologically within the region. Colonization-extinction dynamics on islands can be inferred from lineage accumulation through time. Lineage branching within clades can be used to estimate rates of speciation and extinction. However, simulations of these processes show potential ambiguities in the interpretation of data. Clade size is unrelated to age in many studies, suggesting that speciation and extinction might be in long-term equilibrium and raising questions about unobserved past diversity. Among passerine birds and other groups, the size of similar-aged clades is positively related to the size of the region within which they have diversified, and it is greater in tropical than in temperate regions. There is no consensus on the causes of these patterns. Finally, the ecological interactions between populations within regions brings the timescale of species sorting and species production close to each other and emphasizes the important interaction of ecological and evolutionary processes in shaping ecological systems.},

  abstract = {Functional diversity is a component of biodiversity that generally concerns the range of things that organisms do in communities and ecosystems. Here, we review how functional diversity can explain and predict the impact of organisms on ecosystems and thereby provide a mechanistic link between the two. Critical points in developing predictive measures of functional diversity are the choice of functional traits with which organisms are distinguished, how the diversity of that trait information is summarized into a measure of functional diversity, and that the measures of functional diversity are validated through quantitative analyses and experimental tests. There is a vast amount of trait information available for plant species and a substantial amount for animals. Choosing which traits to include in a particular measure of functional diversity will depend on the specific aims of a particular study. Quantitative methods for choosing traits and for assigning weighting to traits are being developed, but need much more work before we can be confident about trait choice. The number of ways of measuring functional diversity is growing rapidly. We divide them into four main groups. The first, the number of functional groups or types, has significant problems and researchers are more frequently using measures that do not require species to be grouped. Of these, some measure diversity by summarizing distances between species in trait space, some by estimating the size of the dendrogram required to describe the difference, and some include information about species' abundances. We show some new and important differences between these, as well as what they indicate about the responses of assemblages to loss of individuals. There is good experimental and analytical evidence that functional diversity can provide a link between organisms and ecosystems but greater validation of measures is required. We suggest that non-significant results have a range of alternate explanations that do not necessarily contradict positive effects of functional diversity. Finally, we suggest areas for development of techniques used to measure functional diversity, highlight some exciting questions that are being addressed using ideas about functional diversity, and suggest some directions for novel research.},

Classical approaches to studying ecosystem responses to nutrient enrichment have considered linear food chains. To what extent ecosystem structure, that is, the network of species interactions, affects such responses is currently unknown. This severely limits our ability to predict which species or functional groups will benefit or suffer from nutrient enrichment and to understand the underlying mechanisms. Here our approach takes ecosystem complexity into account by considering functional diversity at each trophic level. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to test the effects of nutrient enrichment in a lake ecosystem. We developed a model of intermediate complexity, which separates trophic levels into functional groups according to size and diet. This model successfully predicted the experimental results, whereas linear food-chain models did not.

  abstract = {Humans are altering the composition of biological communities through a variety of activities that increase rates of species invasions and species extinctions, at all scales, from local to global. These changes in components of the Earth's biodiversity cause concern for ethical and aesthetic reasons, but they also have a strong potential to alter ecosystem properties and the goods and services they provide to humanity. Ecological experiments, observations, and theoretical developments show that ecosystem properties depend greatly on biodiversity in terms of the functional characteristics of organisms present in the ecosystem and the distribution and abundance of those organisms over space and time. Species effects act in concert with the effects of climate, resource availability, and disturbance regimes in influencing ecosystem properties. Human activities can modify all of the above factors; here we focus on modification of these biotic controls. The scientific community has come to a broad consensus on many aspects of the re- lationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, including many points relevant to management of ecosystems. Further progress will require integration of knowledge about biotic and abiotic controls on ecosystem properties, how ecological communities are struc- tured, and the forces driving species extinctions and invasions. To strengthen links to policy and management, we also need to integrate our ecological knowledge with understanding of the social and economic constraints of potential management practices. Understanding this complexity, while taking strong steps to minimize current losses of species, is necessary for responsible management of Earth's ecosystems and the diverse biota they contain.},

  abstract = {Rapid contemporary evolution due to natural selection is common in the wild, but it remains uncertain whether its effects are an essential component of community and ecosystem structure and function. Previously we showed how to partition change in a population, community or ecosystem property into contributions from environmental and trait change, when trait change is entirely caused by evolution (Hairston et al. 2005). However, when substantial non-heritable trait change occurs (e.g. due to phenotypic plasticity or change in population structure) that approach can mis-estimate both contributions. Here, we demonstrate how to disentangle ecological impacts of evolution vs. non-heritable trait change by combining our previous approach with the Price Equation. This yields a three-way partitioning into effects of evolution, non-heritable phenotypic change and environment. We extend the approach to cases where ecological consequences of trait change are mediated through interspecific interactions. We analyse empirical examples involving fish, birds and zooplankton, finding that the proportional contribution of rapid evolution varies widely (even among different ecological properties affected by the same trait), and that rapid evolution can be important when it acts to oppose and mitigate phenotypic effects of environmental change. Paradoxically, rapid evolution may be most important when it is least evident.},

  abstract = {Community ecology is often perceived as a "mess, "given the seemingly vast number of processes that can underlie the many patterns of interest, and the apparent uniqueness of each study system. However, at the most general level, patterns in the composition and diversity of species–the subject matter of community ecology–are influenced by only four classes of process: selection, drift, speciation, and dispersal. Selection represents deterministic fitness differences among species, drift represents stochastic changes in species abundance, speciation creates new species, and dispersal is the movement of organisms across space. All theoretical and conceptual models in community ecology can be understood with respect to their emphasis on these four processes. Empirical evidence exists for all of these processes and many of their interactions, with a predominance of studies on selection. Organizing the material of community ecology according to this framework can clarify the essential similarities and differences among the many conceptual and theoretical approaches to the discipline, and it can also allow for the articulation of a very general theory of community dynamics: species are added to communities via speciation and dispersal, and the relative abundances of these species are then shaped by drift and selection, as well as ongoing dispersal to drive community dynamics.},

We explore what this concept of equivalence means in ecological communities, how such species may arise evolutionarily, and how the possibility of ecological equivalents relates to previous ideas about niche differentiation. We also show that the co-occurrence of ecologically similar or equivalent species is not incompatible with niche theory as has been supposed, because niche relations can sometimes favor coexistence of similar species. We argue that both evolutionary and ecological processes operate to promote the introduction and to sustain the persistence of ecologically similar and in many cases nearly equivalent species embedded in highly structured food webs. Future work should focus on synthesizing niche and neutral perspectives rather than dichotomously debating whether neutral or niche models provide better explanations for community structure and biodiversity.},

Various indices have been proposed to measure relevant aspects of community trait composition from different viewpoints and perspectives. Among these, the 'community-weighted mean trait value' (CWM) and the Rao coefficient have been widely used in ecological research for summarizing different facets of functional composition and diversity. Analyzing changes in functional diversity of bee communities along a post-fire successional gradient in southern Switzerland we show that these two measures may be used to describe two complementary aspects of community structure, such as the mean and the dispersion of functional traits within a given species assemblage. While CWM can be adequately used to summarize shifts in mean trait values within communities due to environmental selection for certain functional traits, the Rao coefficient can be effectively applied to analyze patterns of trait convergence or divergence compared to a random expectation.},

  abstract = {The struggle for existence occurs through the vital rates of population growth. This basic fact demonstrates the tight connection between ecology and evolution that defines the emerging field of eco-evolutionary dynamics. An effective synthesis of the interdependencies between ecology and evolution is grounded in six principles. The mechanics of evolution specifies the origin and rules governing traits and evolutionary strategies. Traits and evolutionary strategies achieve their selective value through their functional relationships with fitness. Function depends on the underlying structure of variation and the temporal, spatial and organizational scales of evolution. An understanding of how changes in traits and strategies occur requires conjoining ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Adaptation merges these five pillars to achieve a comprehensive understanding of ecological and evolutionary change. I demonstrate the value of this world-view with reference to the theory and practice of habitat selection. The theory allows us to assess evolutionarily stable strategies and states of habitat selection, and to draw the adaptive landscapes for habitat-selecting species. The landscapes can then be used to forecast future evolution under a variety of climate change and other scenarios.},

  abstract = {A new framework for measuring functional diversity (FD) from multiple traits has recently been proposed. This framework was mostly limited to quantitative traits without missing values and to situations in which there are more species than traits, although the authors had suggested a way to extend their framework to other trait types. The main purpose of this note is to further develop this suggestion. We describe a highly flexible distance-based framework to measure different facets of FD in multidimensional trait space from any distance or dissimilarity measure, any number of traits, and from different trait types (i.e., quantitative, semi-quantitative, and qualitative). This new approach allows for missing trait values and the weighting of individual traits. We also present a new multidimensional FD index, called functional dispersion (FDis), which is closely related to Rao's quadratic entropy. FDis is the multivariate analogue of the weighted mean absolute deviation (MAD), in which the weights are species relative abundances. For unweighted presence-absence data, FDis can be used for a formal statistical test of differences in FD. We provide the "FD" R language package to easily implement our distance-based FD framework.},

Three kinds of dynamic models were used to estimate allochthony: a process-rich, dual-isotope flow model based on mass balances of two carbon isotopes in 12 carbon pools; simple univariate time-series models driven by observed time courses of δ13CO2; and multivariate autoregression models that combined information from time series of δ13CO2 in several interacting carbon pools. All three models gave similar estimates of allochthony. In the three experiments without nutrient enrichment, flows of terrestrial carbon to dissolved and particulate organic carbon, zooplankton, Chaoborus, and fishes were substantial. For example, terrestrial sources accounted for more than half the carbon flow to juvenile and adult largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, golden shiners, brook sticklebacks, and fathead minnows in the unenriched experiments. Allochthony was highest in the dystrophic lake and lowest in the nutrientenriched lake. Nutrient enrichment of Peter Lake decreased allochthony of Zooplankton from 0.34-0.48 to 0-0.12, and of fishes from 0.51-0.80 to 0.25-0.55. These experiments show that lake ecosystem carbon cycles, including carbon flows to consumers, are heavily subsidized by organic carbon from the surrounding landscape.},

  abstract = {Trying to show the importance of biodiversity for ecosystem functioning, ecologists are repeatedly looking for a possible connection between species diversity and intensity of various ecosystem processes. However it appears that simple "proof" of such a connection cannot easily be demonstrated and involves a lot of contingencies. The different meanings of "ecosystem functioning" may be crucial for attempts to show the importance of biodiversity and to assess possible redundancy. If "ecosystem functioning" means only total production organic matter or consumption of CO2 then some degree of redundancy in species diversity of autotrophs will be obvious in most cases. However if "ecosystem functioning" includes the synthesis of all compounds that plants, animals and other organisms of a given community contain in their bodies or release in the environment, then any decrease in species diversity will be meaningful and any redundancy will be impossible by definition. In accordance with such a definition biodiversity obviously cannot be diminished without some loss of ecosystem functioning. I emphasize that attempts to conserve biodiversity do not need special justification in possible relationships between diversity and ecosystem services. If biodiversity has intrinsic value it means that it could in principle be "useless" for human needs or for "ecosystem functioning".},

  abstract = {Functional characters have the potential to act as indicators of species turnover between local communities. Null models provide a powerful statistical approach to test for patterns using functional character information. A combined null model/functional character approach provides the ability to distinguish between the effect of competition and environmental filtering on species turnover. We measured 13 functional characters relating directly to resource use for the fish species found in French lakes. We combined this functional character data with a null model approach to test whether co-occurring species overlapped more or less than expected at random for four primary niche axes. We used an environmentally constrained null model approach to determine if the same mechanisms were responsible for species turnover at different sections of the altitudinal gradient. Functional diversity indices were used to examine the variation in functional character diversity with altitude, as a test of the hypothesis that competitive intensity decreases with increasing environmental adversity. The unconstrained null model showed that environmental filtering was the dominant influence on species turnover between lakes. In the constrained null model, there was much less evidence for environmental filtering, emphasising the strong effect of altitude on turnover in functional character values between local communities. Different results were obtained for low-altitude and high-altitude lake subsets, with more evidence for the effect of environmental filtering being found in the high-altitude lakes. This demonstrates that different processes may influence species turnover throughout an environmental gradient. Functional diversity values showed a slight decrease with altitude, indicating that there was only weak evidence that competitive intensity decreased with increasing altitude. Variation resource availability and environmental stress probably cause the observed turnover in functional characters along the altitudinal gradient, though the effects of dispersal limitation and species introductions in high-altitude lakes cannot be ruled out.},

  abstract = {Seasonal shifts in bacterioplankton community composition in Toolik Lake, a tundra lake on the North Slope of Alaska, were related to shifts in the source (terrestrial versus phytoplankton) and lability of dissolved organic matter (DOM). A shift in community composition, measured by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rRNA genes, occurred at 4\{degrees\}C in near-surface waters beneath seasonal ice and snow cover in spring. This shift was associated with an annual peak in bacterial productivity ([14C]leucine incorporation) driven by the large influx of labile terrestrial DOM associated with snow meltwater. A second shift occurred after the flux of terrestrial DOM had ended in early summer as ice left the lake and as the phytoplankton community developed. Bacterioplankton communities were composed of persistent populations present throughout the year and transient populations that appeared and disappeared. Most of the transient populations could be divided into those that were advected into the lake with terrestrial DOM in spring and those that grew up from low concentrations during the development of the phytoplankton community in early summer. Sequencing of DNA in DGGE bands demonstrated that most bands represented single ribotypes and that matching bands from different samples represented identical ribotypes. Bacteria were identified as members of globally distributed freshwater phylogenetic clusters within the \{alpha\}- and \{beta\}-Proteobacteria, the Cytophaga-Flavobacteria-Bacteroides group, and the Actinobacteria.},

This study identified a ranking of the importance of drivers of change, a ranking of the biomes with respect to expected changes, and the major sources of uncertainties. For terrestrial ecosystems, land-use change probably will have the largest effect, followed by climate change, nitrogen deposition, biotic exchange, and elevated carbon dioxide concentration. For freshwater ecosystems, biotic exchange is much more important. Mediterranean climate and grassland ecosystems likely will experience the greatest proportional change in biodiversity because of the substantial influence of all drivers of biodiversity change. Northern temperate ecosystems are estimated to experience the least biodiversity change because major land-use change has already occurred. Plausible changes in biodiversity in other biomes depend on interactions among the causes of biodiversity change. These interactions represent one of the largest uncertainties in projections of future biodiversity change.},

We discuss statistical and biological issues that may arise in applications of Lande and Arnold's (1983) multiple-regression approach to measuring selection. We review assumptions involved in estimation and hypothesis testing in regression problems, and we note difficulties that frequently arise as a result of violation of these assumptions. In particular, multicollinearity (extreme intercorrelation of characters) and extrinsic, unmeasured factors affecting fitness may seriously complicate inference regarding selection. Further, violation of the assumption that residuals are normally distributed vitiates tests of significance. For this situation, we suggest applications of recently developed jackknife tests of significance. While fitness regression permits direct assessment of selection in a form suitable for predicting selection response, we suggest that the aim of inferring causal relationships about the effects of phenotypic characters on fitness is greatly facilitated by manipulative experiments. Finally, we discuss alternative definitions of stabilizing and disruptive selection.},

We tested the importance of allochthonous carbon to consumers in a relatively large ($\backslash$textlesstex-math$\backslash$textgreater\$258,000 m\^2\$$\backslash$textless/tex-math$\backslash$textgreater) clear-water lake by adding $\backslash$textlesstex-math$\backslash$textgreater\$H\^\{13\}CO\_3\$$\backslash$textless/tex-math$\backslash$textgreater daily for 56 d. Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) was substantially enriched in $\backslash$textlesssup$\backslash$textgreater13$\backslash$textless/sup$\backslash$textgreaterC by the addition, but it was also variable over diel cycles because of exchange with the atmosphere and photosynthesis.

Autochthonous carbon was the dominant source (88-100\%) for POC, gram-positive bacteria, a copepod, zooplankton biomass, and Chaoborus spp. Autochthonous carbon provided a lower fraction ($\backslash$textless70\%) of carbon to DOC, gram-negative bacteria, and cladoceran zooplankton. In comparison to smaller and more humic lakes, terrestrially derived allochthonous C was less significant to the pelagic food web in this larger, clear-water lake. Among lakes, the relative importance of autochthonous versus allochthonous carbon to planktonic consumers is positively correlated to the ratio of color (absorbance of light at 440 nm, an indicator of terrestrially derived organic carbon) to chlorophyll.},

To obtain bacterial carbon isotopes, bacteria were regrown in vitro in particle-free lake water and in situ in dialysis tubes; little difference was found between the two methods. The contribution of autochthonous versus allochthonous carbon to the bacterial biomass was estimated by applying a two-member mixing model using a $\backslash$textlesssup$\backslash$textgreater13$\backslash$textless/sup$\backslash$textgreaterC of -28‰ as the allochthonous end member. The autochthonous end member, which varied over time, was estimated indirectly by several approaches. The bacterial biomass consisted of 35-70\% allochthonous carbon. This result confirms the often-stated hypothesis that autochthonous carbon alone does not support bacterial production. On the other hand, autochthonous DOC was preferentially utilized relative to terrestrial DOC. On the basis of $\backslash$textlesssup$\backslash$textgreater13$\backslash$textless/sup$\backslash$textgreaterC measurements, only 13\% of the DOC standing stock was of recent autochthonous origin, but it supported 30-65\% of bacterial production.},

  abstract = {The effects on phytoplankton and limnetics of two different types of suspended sediments and their interactions with P loading were tested in a small North Carolina piedmont lake. Limnocorrals were used in a complete, triplicated six-treatment, blocked design. Treatments were loaded with P, kaolinitic clay (K), K+P, montmorillonitic clay (M), and M+P. M caused more turbidity and stayed in suspension longer than K. Consequently, the light-dependent parameters, net community productivity (NCP), chlorophyll concentration, and algal density were lowest in the M and highest in the P treatment. Combined P and clay loading promoted clearing for both sediments and mitigated their effects on algal densities and NCP. Flagellated algae and nonfilamentous cyanophytes dominated the control community. The P treatment had blooms of Anabaena. Without fertilization, both clays resulted in sparse, flagellate-dominated communities. The M+P community, like that of the P treatment, was dominated by Anabaena, but total algal densities were suppressed. In contrast, the K+P community lacked Anabaena and was similar to the control in algal quantity and composition.},

  abstract = {Three Daphnia species of different body sizes were grown on a single food resource in steady-state conditions. They differed in food threshold concentrations necessary for body growth and reproduction. The largest species, D. pulicaria, had the lowest thresholds and the smallest, D. cucullata, had the highest thresholds, while D. hyalina was intermediate. This implies competitive superiority of the largest species and inferiority of the smallest one. The sequence, however, was reversed in the presence of blue-green algal filaments, when the thresholds became lowest for D. cucullata and highest for D. pulicaria. Thus the inhibitory effect of filaments is body-size dependent. High densities of filaments that mechanically interfere in food collection may cause shifts in competitive ability among congeneric cladocerans. This may be the reason why, in Europe, D. pulicaria is most successful in ultraoligotrophic lakes while D. cucullata is most successful in eutrophic lakes.},

  abstract = {Terrestrial organic matter inputs have long been thought to play an important role in aquatic food web dynamics. Results from recent whole lake 13C addition experiments suggest terrestrial particulate organic carbon (t-POC) inputs account for a disproportionate portion of zooplankton production. For example, several studies concluded that although t-POC only represented ≈20\% of the flux of particulate carbon available to herbivorous zooplankton, this food source accounted for ≈50\% of the C incorporated by zooplankton. We tested the direct dietary impact of t-POC (from the leaves of riparian vegetation) and various phytoplankton on Daphnia magna somatic growth, reproduction, growth efficiency, and lipid composition. By itself, t-POC was a very poor quality resource compared to cryptophytes, diatoms, and chlorophytes, but t-POC had similar food quality compared to cyanobacteria. Small additions of high quality Cryptomonas ozolinii to t-POC-dominated diets greatly increased Daphnia growth and reproduction. When offered alone, t-POC resulted in a Daphnia growth efficiency of 5 ± 1\%, whereas 100\% Cryptomonas and Scenedesmus obliquus diets resulted in growth efficiencies of 46 ± 8\% (± SD) and 36 ± 3\%, respectively. When offered in a 50:50 mixed diet with Cryptomonas or Scenedesmus, the t-POC fraction resulted in a partial growth efficiency of 22 ± 9\% and 15 ± 6\%, respectively. Daphnia that obtained 80\% of their available food from t-POC assimilated 84\% of their fatty acids from the phytoplankton component of their diet. Overall, our results suggest Daphnia selectively allocate phytoplankton-derived POC and lipids to enhance somatic growth and reproduction, while t-POC makes a minor contribution to zooplankton production.},

  abstract = {We describe the relationships between summer average total phosphorus (TP) and the biomass of six major phytoplankton taxonomic groups from 91 north temperate lakes. Both regression and locally weighted smoothing (LOWESS) analyses show that all groups increase with TP but over different nutrient ranges. At nutrient extremes, i.e. very low and high levels of TP, the few taxonomic groups that dominate total biomass are generally dissmilar. In oligotrophic and eutrophic lakes, most group biomass curves show corresponding increases or decreases, but different rates of changes. The curves converge at intermediate TP levels \$($\backslash$backslashsim10-30 $\backslash$backslashmug lite\^-1)\$ where there is increased equitability amongalgal groups. In highly eutrophic lakes, the slope of the total biomass curve decreases, as do all the relative abundances of all groups except blue-greens and diatoms. We conclude that the curvilinearity of the TP-total biomass curve is not attributable to a single taxonomic groups, because all groups show some nonlinearity in relation to TP. We suggest that morphological diversity, differential herbivory, and, in particular, mixing regime may explain some of the observed patterns.},

Using these methods, the variation in occupancy and abundance of the clouded apollo butterfly (Parnassius mnemosyne L.) was decomposed into independent and joint effects of larval and adult food resources, microclimate and habitat quantity. The independent effect of habitat quantity variables (habitat area and connectivity) captured the largest fraction of the variation in the clouded apollo patterns, but habitat connectivity had a major contribution only for occupancy data. The independent effects of resources and microclimate were higher on butterfly abundance than on occupancy. However, a considerable amount of variation in the butterfly patterns was accounted for by the joint effects of predictors and may thus be causally related to two or all three groups of variables. Abundance of the butterfly in the surroundings of the focal grid cell had a significant effect in all analyses, independently of the effects of other predictors. Our results encourage wider applications of partitioning methods in biodiversity studies.},

  abstract = {The direct and indirect effect of suspended clay on the population dynamics of several species of planktonic rotifers and cladocerans were investigated using long-term laboratory experiments. Life table and population growth experiments showed that high, but naturally occuring, concentrations (50-100 mg/L) of coarse, suspended clay ($\backslash$textless2-@mm particle size) caused large reductions in the population growth rates (r"m) of four cladoceran species (Bosmina longirostris, Ceriodaphnia dubia, Daphnia ambigua, and D. pulex). Juveniles were more susceptible than adult to suspended clay. Low concentrations (10 mg/L) of coarse clay, and high concentrations of fine clay ($\backslash$textless1 @mm), did not decrease, and sometimes increased, cladoceran population growth rates. Both the inhibitory effects of high concentrations of coarse clay and the stimulatory effects of low concentrations of clay were greater at limiting food (Cryptomonas) concentrations. The population growth rates of four rotifer species (Brachionus calyciflorus, Keratella cochlearis, Polyarthra vulgaris, and Synchaeta pectinata) were not affected by high concentrations of coarse or fine clay, even at very low food levels. The population growth rates of the rotifer K. crassa was decreased by coarse clay. The threshold food concentration (the food concentration, measured as dry mass, at which population growth rate equals zero) of the cladoceran D. ambigua was increased from 0.15 to 0.40 @mg/mL in the presence of 50 mg/L coarse clay, indicating a reduced ability to compete in exploitative contests. The threshold food concentration of the rotifer K. cochlearis (0.05 @mg/mL) was unaffected by suspended clay. Suspended clay reversed the outcome of two rotifer-cladoceran competition experiments, between K. cochlearis and D. ambigua, and between K. cochlearis and C. dubia. In the absence of clay, the cladocerans dominated; in the presence of clay, the rotifer dominated. The presence of suspended sediments in natural ecosystems, such as turbid lakes and reservoirs, should favor rotifers over cladocerans and thus influence the structure of zooplankton communities.},

  abstract = {A long-term research programme, conducted mainly in northern England, has involved field surveys (1965-77), laboratory screening (1974-96), monitoring of permanent plots (1958 to date) and manipulative experiments (1987 to date). The so-called C-S-R classification of plant functional types developed from all this activity. Patterns of covariation among the traits used in the classification have recently been validated in this journal. The C-S-R classification appears to be applicable to vegetation in general. It thus has considerable potential for interpreting and predicting vegetation and ecosystem properties on a world-wide scale. However, to realize this potential we need to develop simplified procedures to extrapolate the C-S-R system to the many species which have not been the subject of previous ecological investigation. Here we describe a rapid method for attribution of C-S-R type and we test its accuracy in Britain by comparing it with an independent classification based upon more laborious procedures. The new method allocates a functional type to an unknown herbaceous subject using few, simple predictor variables. We have developed spreadsheets to perform all of the necessary calculations.

  abstract = {To characterize the major carbon pathways in a humic lake, we determined carbon pool sizes and main pathways by long-term tracer studies in enclosures. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was by far the largest pool and constituted 80-85\% of total carbon. In the water column particulate organic carbon was partitioned between detritus, zooplankton, bacteria, and phytoplankton at ratios of 22:4:3:1. Phytoplankton and bacterioplankton production averaged 24 and 32 \$$\backslash$backslashmu g C liter\^-1d\^-1\$, while crustacean zooplankton production was very low \$($\backslash$textless5$\backslash$backslashmu g C liter\^-1 d\^-1)\$ during the experiment. Total pelagic community respiration was high, giving a net \$CO\_2\$ flux to the atmosphere of \$44$\backslash$backslashmu g C liter\^-1 d\^-1\$, while losses by sedimentation were negligible. Most of the particulate carbon available for zooplankton was highly recycled detritus of low nutritional value. The loop of ingestion and defecation of detrital particles was a major carbon pathway, giving detrital particles a turnover rate of \$0.39 d\^-1\$. Detritus was found to support 46-82\% of body carbon in the surveyed species, with Acanthodiaptomus as the upper extreme. Bacterial carbon accounted for 11-42\% of body carbon and phytoplankton for 6-19\% in the surveyed species.},

  abstract = {During the past 20 yr, aquatic microbiologists have reported 2 strong patterns which initially appear contradictory. In pelagic systems, bacterial growth and biomass is well correlated with the growth and biomass of primary producers. However, bacterial respiration often exceeds net primary production, which suggests that bacteria are subsidized by external inputs of organic matter. We hypothesize that bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) varies systematically between autochthonous and allochthonous carbon (C) sources and that this variation resolves the above conundrum. To test these ideas, we examined the ecological regulation of bacterial secondary production (BP), bacterial respiration (BR) and BGE in a series of lakes dominated by terrestrial (allochthonous) C inputs. BP was correlated with autochthonous C sources (chlorophyll a) even though the lakes were net heterotrophic (i.e. heterotrophic respiration consistently exceeded primary production). The results were simulated by a simple steady-state model of bacterial utilization of autochthonous and allochthonous dissolved organic C. A higher preference and greater growth efficiency of bacteria on autochthonous C may explain why BP is coupled to autochthonous production also in net heterotrophic ecosystems where the use of allochthonous C by bacteria is high. These results suggest that little of the allochthonous C assimilated by bacteria is likely to reach higher consumers.},

Inferences about the transformation and about the parameters of the linear model are made by computing the likelihood function and the relevant posterior distribution. The contributions of normality, homoscedasticity and additivity to the transformation are separated. The relation of the present methods to earlier procedures for finding transformations is discussed. The methods are illustrated with examples.},

Diversity is also functionally important, both because it increases the probability of including species that have strong ecosystem effects and because it can increase the efficiency of resource use. Differences in environmental sensitivity among functionally similar species give stability to ecosystem processes, whereas differences in sensitivity among functionally different species make ecosystems more vulnerable to change. Current global environmental changes that affect species composition and diversity are therefore profoundly altering the functioning of the biosphere.},

Yet, in Lake Mitchell, Vermont, two genera of cladocerans (Bosmina and Daphnia) coexist under nearly equilibrium conditions that involve an intriguing conflict. Daphnia can depress Bosmina, but apparently cannot exclude it, even though both share substantial portions of available resources. This coexistence appears mediated by the specialized foraging mode of Bosmina, which deviates markedly from filter feeding in a way that permits efficiency removal of highly edible flagellates, particularly when these items occur at low density. Evaluation of the flagellate-Bosmina association and its relationship to Bosmina-Daphnia interactions involved: (1) analysis of population responses in large-scale enclosures, (2) in situ grazing experiments with natural and introduced resources resources, and (3) laboratory preference tests.},

  volume = {43},
  abstract = {We compiled 414 studies from the literature to test if general relationships exist between chlorophyll concentration, light attenuation, and gross photosynthesis across phytoplankton communities, macrophyte stands, and attached microalgal mats. We also evaluated the upper limit to photosynthesis in the various communities. Along with increasing chlorophyll concentration, the photic zone diminishes from \$$\backslash$textgreater100\$ m in sparse phytoplankton communities to centimeters-meters in macrophyte stands to \$$\backslash$textless1\$ mm in dense microalgal mats. This compression of the photic zone is paralleled by a marked increase in volumetric photosynthesis (mmol O2 m-3 h-1). In contrast, integral photosynthesis (mmol O2 m-2 h-1) remains relatively constant, depending on both the photic zone and volumetric photosynthesis. A similar upper limitation \$($\backslash$backslashthicksim 60 mmol O\_2 m\^-2 h\^-1)\$ is attained in dense macrophyte and phytoplankton communities when most of the irradiance is captured by plants. Integral photosynthesis, however, is often far below this upper limit because backgroud light attenuation by particles and dissolved organic matter restrict photosynthesis in many aquatic plant communities. Moreover, limitation of CO2 and O2 exchange may constrain integral photosynthesis in dense plant communities, which are often subject to severe CO2 depletion and O2 supersaturation.},

Exclusion of leaf litter had a strong bottom-up effect that was propagated through detritivores to predators. Most invertebrate taxa in the predominant habitat declined in either abundance, biomass, or both, compared with taxa in a nearby reference stream. However, fauna in moss habitats changed little, indicating that different food webs exist in habitats of different geomorphology. Thus, the ecosystem-level consequences of excluding detrital inputs to an ecosystem were demonstrated.

  abstract = {The natural abundance of stable isotopes (δ13C and δ1315N) was determined for components of the pelagic food web in Loch Ness, a deep oligotrophic lake in northern Scotland, and compared with values from the inflow rivers and the catchment vegetation. Phytoplankton δ13C was low compared to values reported from other lakes, possibly reflecting a high use of 13C-depleted carbon dioxide from respired organic matter before further isotopic fractionation during photosynthesis. Phytoplankton δ13C was appreciably lower than that of dissolved and particulate organic matter (DOM and POM) in the loch. The DOM and POM were evidently overwhelmingly of allochthonous origin and ultimately derived from terrestrial plant detritus. The distinctive δ13C values for phytoplankton and detritus in the loch allowed the use of food sources by grazing crustacean zooplankton to be assessed, and the contributions of phytoplankton carbon and detrital carbon to zooplankton total body carbon appeared to be about equal. Comparison of δ13C and δ15N values for zooplankton and fish allowed assessment of trophic structure in the loch. The very high dependence of the pelagic food web in Loch Ness on allochthonous organic matter inputs from the catchment may be exceptional in a large lake, but has important implications for our understanding of lake ecosystem processes as well as for lake management.},

This is in contrast to clear lakes in which total pelagic production is based mainly on phytoplankton photosynthesis. The energy economy in humic lakes may be less efficient than in clear lakes, because it is likely that one more link is included in the food chain. Lake data from Scandinavia and North America demonstrate that shifts between food chains based on heterotrophic production and food chains based on primary production can take place at moderate increases or decreases in the concentration of dissolved organic carbon from allochthonous sources. Large variations in the loading of allochthonous organic carbon (e.g., due to climatic variations) may have considerable effects on the biostructure and productivity of lakes.},

We found considerable variation in BP, BGE, and BNUE along the tested DOC/Pi gradient. BGE varied between 0.87 and 0.24, with the highest values at low DOC/Pi ratios. BNUE varied between 40 and 9 g C g P⁻¹, with high values at high DOC/Pi ratios. More DOC was thus allocated to growth when bacteria tended to be C-limited, and to respiration when bacteria were P-limited. Specific respiration was positively correlated with bacterial growth rate throughout the gradient. It is therefore possible that respiration was used to support growth in P-limited bacteria. The results indicated that BP can be limited by Pi when BNUE is at its maximum, by organic C when BGE is at its maximum, and by dual organic C and Pi limitation when BNUE and BGE have suboptimal values.},

  abstract = {Measurements of plankton δ13 C from 28 temperate lakes show that zooplankton are depleted in 13 C relative to smaller planktonic size fractions. A broad literature survey indicates that this is a general pattern in lakes but not in marine and estuarine plankton communities, where zooplankton are generally enriched in 13 C relative to particulate organic matter (POM) or microplankton. Marine plankton thus conform to the assumptions that pelagic food webs are essentially driven by phytoplankton and that POM or small planktonic size classes largely reflect algal carbon, which is transferred to zooplankton with a slight enrichment in 13 C. The plankton of lakes and possibly of estuaries, however, do not conform to this expectation. We show that there is a continuum in the δ13 C differences between POM and zooplankton from open ocean to coastal areas and estuaries and that a similar pattern occurs from unproductive to highly productive lakes. These differences probably reflect both the degree in POM dilution by nonalgal sources of organic carbon and depth-related changes in the signature of phytoplankton in lakes and suggest systematic differences in organic carbon flow pathways among aquatic ecosystems.},

Ratios of filtering and ingestion rate to respiration rate were used as a measure of energy input per unit of energy expended. passive filtering and subsequent rejection of inedble algae by Daphnia result in higher ratios than those shown by Diaptomus in high quality foods, suggesting a competitive advantage in oligotrophic or mesotrophic lakes. Diaptomus selective feeding, on the other hand, results in higher ratios in the low quality food characteristic of eutrophic conditions.

  abstract = {Landscape-lake interactions, including anthropogenic effects in modern human-dominated landscapes, are essential elements of our understanding of aquatic community ecology. This study links land use (six categories) to the aquatic environment (30 water chemistry, lake morphology, and vegetation variables) and to zooplankton community richness (32 common taxa) and composition in 73 small and shallow lakes of southeastern Wisconsin, USA. The sites differed most according to two environmental variables (principal components analysis [PCA] ordination): the presence/absence of riparian vegetation and the water source (whether ground or atmospheric). Shallow lakes in different land use categories (reference, urban, and agricultural) differed significantly in terms of the two major environmental variables, especially presence of riparian and aquatic vegetation. Reference sites were characterized by the most vegetation and the highest zooplankton richness. Agricultural sites with wide riparian vegetative buffer strips ($\backslash$textgreater30 m) had significantly more zooplankton taxa than agricultural lakes with narrow buffer strips. A nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordination of zooplankton community composition suggested a single community among land use categories, with some variation related to vegetation and the water source. The first NMS axis was correlated with PCA1 axis (vegetation) and with zooplankton taxon richness, and the second axis was correlated with PCA2 (water source). The third axis was not strongly correlated with any of the measured environmental factors, suggesting that an unmeasured factor related to disturbance was also important in determining taxon composition. Our analysis supports the hypothesis that zooplankton community structure (taxon richness and composition) is indirectly associated with land use, via the effect of land use on vegetation and the hydrological continuum.},

  abstract = {In many small aquatic ecosystems, watershed loading of organic C exceeds autochthonous primary production. Although this allochthonous organic C has long been thought of as refractory, multiple lines of evidence indicate that substantial portions are respired in the receiving aquatic ecosystem. To what extent does this terrestrial C support secondary production of invertebrates and fish? Do current models adequately trace the pathways of allochthonous and autochthonous C through the food web? We evaluated the roles of allochthonous and autochthonous organic C by manipulating 13C content of dissolved inorganic C in a small, softwater, humic lake, thereby labeling autochthonous primary production for about 20 d. To ensure rapid and sufficient uptake of inorganic 13C, we enriched the lake with modest amounts of N and P. We constructed a carbon flow model based on the ambient and manipulated levels of 13C in C compartments in the lake, along with information on key rate processes. Despite the short nature of this experiment, several results emerged. (1) Fractionation of photosynthetically assimilated 13C-CO2 by phytoplankton (ϵ) is lower \$($\backslash$backslashsim 6$\backslash$backslashperthousand)\$ than physiologic models would estimate \$($\backslash$backslashsim 20$\backslash$backslashperthousand)\$. (2) Bacteria respire, but do not assimilate, a large amount of terrestrially derived dissolved organic C (DOC) and pass little of this C to higher trophic levels. (3) The oxidation of terrestrial DOC is the major source of dissolved inorganic C in the lake. (4) Zooplankton production, a major food of young-of-year fishes, is predominantly derived from current autochthonous carbon sources under the conditions of this experiment.},

  issn = {0012-9658},
  abstract = {While empirical studies linking biodiversity to local environmental gradients have emphasized the importance of lake trophic status (related to primary productivity), theoretical studies have implicated resource spatial heterogeneity and resource relative ratios as mechanisms behind these biodiversity patterns. To test the feasibility of these mechanisms in natural aquatic systems, the biodiversity of crustacean zooplankton communities along gradients of total phosphorus (TP) as well as the vertical heterogeneity and relative abundance of their phytoplankton resources were assessed in 18 lakes in Quebec, Canada. Zooplankton community richness was regressed against TP, the spatial distribution of phytoplankton spectral groups, and the relative biomass of spectral groups. Since species richness does not adequately capture ecological function and life history of different taxa, features which are important for mechanistic theories, relationships between zooplankton functional diversity (FD) and resource conditions were examined. Zooplankton species richness showed the previously established tendency to a unimodal relationship with TP, but functional diversity declined linearly over the same gradient. Changes in zooplankton functional diversity could be attributed to changes in both the spatial distribution and type of phytoplankton resource. In the studied lakes, spatial heterogeneity of phytoplankton groups declined with TP, even while biomass of all groups increased. Zooplankton functional diversity was positively related to increased heterogeneity in cyanobacteria spatial distribution. However, a smaller amount of variation in functional diversity was also positively related to the ratio of biomass in diatoms/chrysophytes to cyanobacteria. In all observed relationships, a greater variation of functional diversity than species richness measures was explained by measured factors, suggesting that functional measures of zooplankton communities will benefit ecological research attempting to identify mechanisms behind environmental gradients affecting diversity.},

To achieve this goal, transformations are proposed for species data tables. They allow ecologists to use ordination methods such as PCA and RDA, which are Euclidean-based, for the analysis of community data, while circumventing the problems associated with the Euclidean distance, and avoiding CA and CCA which present problems of their own in some cases. This allows the use of the original (transformed) species data in RDA carried out to test for relationships with explanatory variables (i.e. environmental variables, or factors of a multifactorial analysis-of-variance model); ecologists can then draw biplots displaying the relationships of the species to the explanatory variables. Another application allows the use of species data in other methods of multivariate data analysis which optimize a least-squares loss function; an example is K-means partitioning.},

Weekly sampling included inorganic nutrients, oxygen, pH, and transparency as well as biomass of phytoplankton, bacteria, heterotrophic flagellates, rotifers, and macrozooplankton. In fishless enclosures, concentrations of inorganic nutrients and transparency were higher than in enclosures with fish, whereas oxygen, pH, and biomasses of phytoplankton, picoplankton and rotifers were lower. As an average for the entire period, Chl a was 14 µg liter−1 in the enclosures without fish and 46 µg liter−1 in enclosures with fish. Macrozooplankton biomass was significantly lower in enclosures with fish than in enclosures without fish. Averaged over the entire period macrozooplankton biomass was 625 µg C liter−1 in enclosures with fish and 1,149 µg C liter−1 in those without fish. Cladocerans dominated the macrozooplankton community in fishless enclosures and controlled the biomass of bacteria and heterotrophic flagellates. The rotifer community was depressed in enclosures without fish, which probably was a combined effect of mechanical interference with Daphnia and food competition. The initial buildup of a high macrozooplankton biomass and the dominance of cladocerans in the enclosures without fish, prevented cyanobacteria from forming large colonies. In contrast, cyanobacteria (Microcystis, Aphanizomenon, and Anabaena) bloomed in the enclosures with fish. The observed changes in the plankton communities support the theory of cascading trophic interactions.},

The primary objective of this study was to investigate the interactive effects of temperature (7–10°C or 11–15°C), light (high or low) and nutrients (control or nitrogen plus phosphorus) on cell densities of various Cyclotella sensu lato taxa. We observed varying interactive effects of temperature, light and nutrients on Lindavia bodanica, Lindavia comensis, Lindavia ocellata and Discostella stelligera. For example, when nutrients were provided, Lindavia radiosa was more abundant under high light conditions, whereas L. ocellata was more abundant under low light conditions. The secondary objective was to determine whether different phytoplankton communities (one dominated by diatoms and the other by a mixed assemblage) altered the response of D. stelligera to abiotic factors. High temperature, light and nutrients only increased cell densities of D. stelligera when this species occurred in the diatom-dominated community. This study provides further ecological insight on Cyclotella species that serve as important indicators of environmental change.},

  abstract = {In many lakes across the Northern Hemisphere, paleolimnological records have revealed that the relative abundances of the small centric diatom, Discostella stelligera, changed over the past century, with these widespread shifts attributed to climate change. Specifically, small-scale experiments and current spatial distribution patterns suggested that this species is more abundant when lake mixing depths are shallower, but a direct test of this hypothesis at the whole-lake scale was lacking. We conducted a whole-lake mixing manipulation in a remote arctic lake that normally has relatively shallow thermal stratification and abundant D. stelligera populations during the summer. We employed a “Before-After-Control-Impact” design using an experimental lake and a control lake. Lake thermal structure and diatom populations were monitored in both lakes in summer 2013 without manipulating either lake, and again in summer 2014 when the experimental lake was manipulated to achieve deeper mixing depths. The abundance of D. stelligera declined during the manipulated period of deeper mixing in 2014, while it increased during the same time frame in the control lake. The same pattern was not observed for the four other diatom taxa found in both lakes in both years. Our results confirm the use of D. stelligera as an indicator of changing lake thermal structure, and suggest that the broader application of this tool to lake sediment records will yield greater insight into longer-term variability in the response of lake ecosystems to climate.},

  abstract = {We present the first evidence of biological change in all of the pelagic Laurentian Great Lakes associated with recent climatic warming. We hypothesized that measured changes in lake temperature, and the resulting physical changes to water columns, were affecting diatom communities in the Great Lakes. A paleolimnological analysis of 10 sediment cores collected from deep locations throughout the Great Lakes basin indicates a recent (30–50 yr) reorganization of the diatom community to one characterized by elevated abundances of several species from the group Cyclotella sensu lato, coinciding with rising atmospheric and water temperatures. These Cyclotella increases are a probable mechanistic result of new physical regimes such as changing stratification depths and longer ice-free periods, and possibly water quality shifts. Efforts to understand the mechanisms of these changes are ongoing, but this compositional reorganization in primary producers could have important implications to Great Lakes food webs.},

  abstract = {The US EPA BEACH Act requires beach managers to issue swimming advisories when water quality standards are exceeded. While a number of methods/models have been proposed to meet the BEACH Act requirement, no systematic comparisons of different methods against the same data series are available in terms of relative performance of existing methods. This study presents and compares three models for nowcasting and forecasting enterococci levels at Gulf Coast beaches in Louisiana, USA. One was developed using the artificial neural network (ANN) in MATLAB Toolbox and the other two were based on the US EPA Virtual Beach (VB) Program. A total of 944 sets of environmental and bacteriological data were utilized. The data were collected and analyzed weekly during the swimming season (May–October) at six sites of the Holly Beach by Louisiana Beach Monitoring Program in the six year period of May 2005–October 2010. The ANN model includes 15 readily available environmental variables such as salinity, water temperature, wind speed and direction, tide level and type, weather type, and various combinations of antecedent rainfalls. The ANN model was trained, validated, and tested using 308, 103, and 103 data sets (collected in 2007, 2008, and 2009) with an average linear correlation coefficient (LCC) of 0.857 and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.336. The two VB models, including a linear transformation-based model and a nonlinear transformation-based model, were constructed using the same data sets. The linear VB model with 6 input variables achieved an LCC of 0.230 and an RMSE of 1.302 while the nonlinear VB model with 5 input variables produced an LCC of 0.337 and an RMSE of 1.205. In order to assess the predictive performance of the ANN and VB models, hindcasting was conducted using a total of 430 sets of independent environmental and bacteriological data collected at six Holly Beach sites in 2005, 2006, and 2010. The hindcasting results show that the ANN model is capable of predicting enterococci levels at the Holly Beach sites with an adjusted RMSE of 0.803 and LCC of 0.320 while the adjusted RMSE and LCC values are 1.815 and 0.354 for the linear VB model and 1.961and 0.521 for the nonlinear VB model. The results indicate that the ANN model with 15 parameters performs better than the VB models with 6 or 5 parameters in terms of RMSE while VB models perform better than the ANN model in terms of LCC. The predictive models (especially the ANN and the nonlinear VB models) developed in this study in combination with readily available real-time environmental and weather forecast data can be utilized to nowcast and forecast beach water quality, greatly reducing the potential risk of contaminated beach waters to human health and improving beach management. While the models were developed specifically for the Holly Beach, Louisiana, the methods used in this paper are generally applicable to other coastal beaches.},

  abstract = {In this study, data from bacterial source tracking (BST) analysis using antibiotic resistance profiles were examined using two statistical techniques, Random Forests (RF) and discriminant analysis (DA) to determine sources of fecal contamination of a Texas water body. Cow Trap and Cedar Lakes are potential oyster harvesting waters located in Brazoria County, Texas, that have been listed as impaired for bacteria on the 2004 Texas 303(d) list. Unknown source Escherichia coli were isolated from water samples collected in the study area during two sampling events. Isolates were confirmed as E. coli using carbon source utilization profiles and then analyzed via ARA, following the Kirby–Bauer disk diffusion method. Zone diameters from ARA profiles were analyzed with both DA and RF. Using a two-way classification (human vs nonhuman), both DA and RF categorized over 90\% of the 299 unknown source isolates as a nonhuman source. The average rates of correct classification (ARCCs) for the library of 1172 isolates using DA and RF were 74.6\% and 82.3\%, respectively. ARCCs from RF ranged from 7.7 to 12.0\% higher than those from DA. Rates of correct classification (RCCs) for individual sources classified with RF ranged from 23.2 to 0.2\% higher than those of DA, with a mean difference of 9.0\%. Additional evidence for the outperformance of DA by RF was found in the comparison of training and test set ARCCs and examination of specific disputed isolates; RF produced higher ARCCs (ranging from 8 to 13\% higher) than DA for all 1000 trials (excluding the two-way classification, in which RF outperformed DA 999 out of 1000 times). This is of practical significance for analysis of bacterial source tracking data. Overall, based on both DA and RF results, migratory birds were found to be the source of the largest portion of the unknown E. coli isolates. This study is the first known published application of Random Forests in the field of BST.},

  abstract = {Body size exerts multiple effects on plankton food-web interactions. However, the influence of size structure on trophic transfer remains poorly quantified in the field. Here, we examine how the size diversity of prey (nano-microplankton) and predators (mesozooplankton) influence trophic transfer efficiency (using biomass ratio as a proxy) in natural marine ecosystems. Our results support previous studies on single trophic levels: transfer efficiency decreases with increasing prey size diversity and is enhanced with greater predator size diversity. We further show that communities with low nano-microplankton size diversity and high mesozooplankton size diversity tend to occur in warmer environments with low nutrient concentrations, thus promoting trophic transfer to higher trophic levels in those conditions. Moreover, we reveal an interactive effect of predator and prey size diversities: the positive effect of predator size diversity becomes influential when prey size diversity is high. Mechanistically, the negative effect of prey size diversity on trophic transfer may be explained by unicellular size-based metabolic constraints as well as trade-offs between growth and predation avoidance with size, whereas increasing predator size diversity may enhance diet niche partitioning and thus promote trophic transfer. These findings provide insights into size-based theories of ecosystem functioning, with implications for ecosystem predictive models.},

Although the need to address the environmental crisis, central to conservation science, generated greener versions of the growth paradigm, we need fundamental shifts in values that ensure transition from a growth-centered society to one acknowledging biophysical limits and centered on human well-being and biodiversity conservation. We discuss the role conservation science can play in this transformation, which poses ethical challenges and obstacles. We analyze how conservation and economics can achieve better consonance, the extent to which technology should be part of the solution, and difficulties the “new conservation science” has generated. An expanded ambition for conservation science should reconcile day-to-day action within the current context with uncompromising, explicit advocacy for radical transitions in core attitudes and processes that govern our interactions with the biosphere. A widening of its focus to understand better the interconnectedness between human well-being and acknowledgment of the limits of an ecologically functional and diverse planet will need to integrate ecological and social sciences better. Although ecology can highlight limits to growth and consequences of ignoring them, social sciences are necessary to diagnose societal mechanisms at work, how to correct them, and potential drivers of social change.},

  abstract = {During the 1980s, the North Sea plankton community underwent a well-documented ecosystem regime shift, including both spatial changes (northward species range shifts) and temporal changes (increases in the total abundances of warmer water species). This regime shift has been attributed to climate change. Plankton provide a link between climate and higher trophic-level organisms, which can forage on large spatial and temporal scales. It is therefore important to understand not only whether climate change affects purely spatial or temporal aspects of plankton dynamics, but also whether it affects spatiotemporal aspects such as metapopulation synchrony. If plankton synchrony is altered, higher trophic-level feeding patterns may be modified. A second motivation for investigating changes in synchrony is that the possibility of such alterations has been examined for few organisms, in spite of the fact that synchrony is ubiquitous and of major importance in ecology. This study uses correlation coefficients and spectral analysis to investigate whether synchrony changed between the periods 1959–1980 and 1989–2010. Twenty-three plankton taxa, sea surface temperature (SST), and wind speed were examined. Results revealed that synchrony in SST and plankton was altered. Changes were idiosyncratic, and were not explained by changes in abundance. Changes in the synchrony of Calanus helgolandicus and Para-pseudocalanus spp appeared to be driven by changes in SST synchrony. This study is one of few to document alterations of synchrony and climate-change impacts on synchrony. We discuss why climate-change impacts on synchrony may well be more common and consequential than previously recognized.},

  abstract = {The sustainability of hydrologic ecosystem services (freshwater benefits to people generated by terrestrial ecosystems) is challenged by human modification of landscapes. However, the role of landscape heterogeneity in sustaining hydrologic services at scales relevant to landscape management decisions is poorly understood. In particular, the relative importance of landscape composition (type and proportion of land cover) and configuration (spatial arrangement of cover types) is unclear. We analyzed indicators of production of three hydrologic services (freshwater supply, surface and ground water quality) in 100 subwatersheds in an urbanizing agricultural landscape (Yahara Watershed, Wisconsin, USA) and asked: (1) How do landscape composition and configuration affect supply of hydrologic services (i.e., does spatial pattern matter)? (2) Are there opportunities for small changes in landscape pattern to produce large gains in hydrologic services? Landscape composition and configuration both affected supply of hydrologic services, but composition was consistently more important than configuration for all three services. Together landscape composition and configuration explained more variation in indicators of surface-water quality than in freshwater supply or groundwater quality (Nagelkerke/adjusted R2: 86\%, 64\%, and 39\%, respectively). Surface-water quality was negatively correlated with percent cropland and positively correlated with percent forest, grassland and wetland. In addition, surface-water quality was greater in subwatersheds with higher wetland patch density, disaggregated forest patches and lower contagion. Surface-water quality responded nonlinearly to percent cropland and wetland, with greater water quality where cropland covered below 60\% and/or wetland above 6\% of the subwatershed. Freshwater supply was negatively correlated with percent wetland and urban cover, and positively correlated with urban edge density. Groundwater quality was negatively correlated with percent cropland and grassland, and configuration variables were unimportant. Collectively, our study suggests that altering spatial arrangement of land cover will not be sufficient to enhance hydrologic services in an agricultural landscape. Rather, the relative abundance of land cover may need to change to improve hydrologic services. Targeting subwatersheds near the cropland or wetland thresholds may offer local opportunities to enhance surface-water quality with minimal land-cover change.},

However, few simple models have been developed that relate the amount of catchment land use to downstream freshwater nutrients. Nor are existing models applicable to large numbers of freshwaters across broad spatial extents such as regions or continents. This research aims to increase model performance by exploring three factors that affect the relationship between land use and downstream nutrients in freshwater: the spatial extent for measuring land use, hydrologic connectivity, and the regional differences in both the amount of nutrients and effects of land use on them. We quantified the effects of these three factors that relate land use to lake total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) in 346 north temperate lakes in 7 regions in Michigan, USA. We used a linear mixed modeling framework to examine the importance of spatial extent, lake hydrologic class, and region on models with individual lake nutrients as the response variable, and individual land use types as the predictor variables. Our modeling approach was chosen to avoid problems of multi-collinearity among predictor variables and a lack of independence of lakes within regions, both of which are common problems in broad-scale analyses of freshwaters. We found that all three factors influence land use-lake nutrient relationships. The strongest evidence was for the effect of lake hydrologic connectivity, followed by region, and finally, the spatial extent of land use measurements. Incorporating these three factors into relatively simple models of land use effects on lake nutrients should help to improve predictions and understanding of land use-lake nutrient interactions at broad scales.},

Climate change conceptual models generally consider lakes and reservoirs together despite the possibility that these systems respond differently to climate-related drivers. Here, we synthesize differences between lake and reservoir characteristics that are likely important for predicting waterbody response to climate change. To better articulate these differences, we revised the energy mass flux framework, a conceptual model for the effects of climate change on lentic ecosystems, to explicitly consider the differential responses of lake versus reservoir ecosystems. The model predicts that catchment and management characteristics will be more important mediators of climate effects in reservoirs than in natural lakes. Given the increased reliance on reservoirs globally, we highlight current gaps in our understanding of these systems and suggest research directions to further characterize regional and continental differences among lakes and reservoirs.},

Here, we demonstrate the utility of hypothesis testing within the landscape limnology framework using a random forest algorithm on a national-scale, spatially explicit data set, the United States Environmental Protection Agency's 2007 National Lakes Assessment. For 1026 lakes, we tested the relative importance of water quality drivers across spatial scales, the importance of hydrologic connectivity in mediating water quality drivers, and how the importance of both spatial scale and connectivity differ across response variables for five important in-lake water quality metrics (total phosphorus, total nitrogen, dissolved organic carbon, turbidity, and conductivity). By modeling the effect of water quality predictors at different spatial scales, we found that lake-specific characteristics (e.g., depth, sediment area-to-volume ratio) were important for explaining water quality (54–60\% variance explained), and that regionalization schemes were much less effective than lake specific metrics (28–39\% variance explained). Basin-scale land use and land cover explained between 45–62\% of variance, and forest cover and agricultural land uses were among the most important basin-scale predictors. Water quality drivers did not operate independently; in some cases, hydrologic connectivity (the presence of upstream surface water features) mediated the effect of regional-scale drivers. For example, for water quality in lakes with upstream lakes, regional classification schemes were much less effective predictors than lake-specific variables, in contrast to lakes with no upstream lakes or with no surface inflows. At the scale of the continental United States, conductivity was explained by drivers operating at larger spatial scales than for other water quality responses. The current regulatory practice of using regionalization schemes to guide water quality criteria could be improved by consideration of lake-specific characteristics, which were the most important predictors of water quality at the scale of the continental United States. The spatial extent and high quality of contextual data available for this analysis makes this work an unprecedented application of landscape limnology theory to water quality data. Further, the demonstrated importance of lake morphology over other controls on water quality is relevant to both aquatic scientists and managers.},

We argue that biophysical assessment and economic valuation should be conducted jointly to account for the different values of ecosystem services (ecologic, social and economic) and to strengthen the recognition of human dependency on nature.

  abstract = {Aim

Scientists, governments and non-governmental organizations are increasingly moving towards the collection of large, open-access data. In aquatic sciences, this effort is expanding the scope of questions and analyses that can be performed to further our knowledge of the global drivers of water quality. Cyanotoxin concentration is one variable that has received considerable attention, and although strong local-scale models have been described in the literature, modelling cyanotoxin concentrations across broader spatial scales has been more difficult. Commonly used statistical frameworks have not fully captured the complex response of toxic algal blooms to global change, limiting our ability to predict and mitigate the impairment of freshwaters by toxic algae. Here, we advance our understanding of emergent drivers of cyanotoxins across a structured landscape by applying a hierarchical “hurdle” model.

Location

Lakes and reservoirs in the conterminous United States [n = 1127].

Methods

We studied cyanobacteria and their toxins [microcystins] during the 2007 summer period. We applied a hierarchical zero-altered model to test the importance of multi-scale interactions among environmental features in driving microcystin concentrations above the limit of detection. We then used boosted regression trees [BRTs] to identify environmental thresholds associated with severe impairment by microcystins.

Results

Accounting for numerous non-detections, spatial heterogeneity and cross-scale interactions substantially improved continental-scale predictions of bloom toxicity. Our model accounted for 55\% of the variance in the probability of detecting microcystins across the United States, and 26\% of the variability in microcystin concentrations once detected. BRTs further showed that although both local and regional drivers were associated with microcystin concentrations at low to intermediate provisional guidelines, only local drivers came into play when predicting higher limits.

Main conclusions

Identifying the interaction between local and regional processes is key to understanding the heterogeneous responses of microcystins to environmental change. Our framework could increase the effectiveness of continental-scale analyses for many different water variables.},

  abstract = {Aim

As global air temperatures continue to rise in response to climate change, environmental conditions for many freshwater fish species will change. Warming air temperatures may lead to warming lake temperatures, and subsequently, the availability of suitable thermal habitat space. Our objectives are to identify the responses of three fish species from three thermal guilds to climate change in Ontario and consequently, the potential for novel competitive interactions between two top predators. We focus on lakes in Ontario because it is a dynamic region that encapsulates the northern and southern range extents of warm and cold-water fish species.

Location

Ontario, Canada.

Methods

Using lake morphology, water chemistry, climate and fish occurrence data for smallmouth bass (warmwater predator), walleye (coolwater predator) and cisco (cold-water forage fish), we modelled the occurrence rates of three fish in 2050 and 2070 under 126 scenarios of climate change. We also calculated the percentage change in co-occurrence of walleye and smallmouth bass in 2050 and 2070.

Results

Smallmouth bass occurrence rates were predicted to increase by \textasciitilde{}306\% (ranging between 55 and 422\%) by 2070 relative to their current distributions. Walleye were projected to decline by 22\% (−42 to a +6\% change) and cisco by 26\% (−7 to −47\%) by 2070. By 2070, walleye–smallmouth bass co-occurrence was predicted to increase by 11\%, with walleye in central and northern Ontario at greatest vulnerability due to increased competition with smallmouth bass.

Main conclusions

These results highlight three unique responses to climate change: range expansion, northward range shift, and range contraction for warmwater, coolwater and cold-water fish species, respectively. Alterations in distributions of these three ecologically important fish species may lead to shifts in fish community structure and novel species interactions in Ontario lakes, exacerbating the vulnerability of native coolwater predators to climate change.},

Cladoceran zooplankton remains and diatom edibility were analyzed in sediment cores from Moon Lake and Coldwater Lake (North Dakota, USA) to assess changes in potential grazing pressure on algae and influence on diatom-inferred salinity (DIS) reconstructions. Sedimentary zooplankton in Moon Lake were dominated by littoral Cladocera, whereas Coldwater Lake assemblages were primarily small-bodied pelagic and littoral species. Relationships between cladocerans and environmental parameters over the past century varied by site and by species, with Chydorus
brevilabris related most closely to drought at Moon and Bosmina sp. related to drought at Coldwater. A higher percentage of inedible diatoms occurred in the sediments of Moon Lake as compared to Coldwater Lake. DIS correlations with drought records improved in Moon Lake when only inedible diatom taxa were used to build a transfer function, but no improvement was seen for Coldwater Lake with this approach.

Given the grave nature of this issue, rapid advances in understanding are needed to mitigate further impacts. In this Opinion paper, we argue that palaeolimnological studies have important contributions to make to biodiversity science. 2. Given that long-term community data are sparse in their geographic coverage and tend to span no more than 5~years, greater insight into biodiversity dynamics can be obtained from palaeoecological analyses. One such approach is palaeolimnology, which is a field that can provide long-term data on changes in both physico-chemical and biological components of lake ecosystems. 3. To date, a handful of quantitative palaeolimnological studies have addressed biodiversity questions, focussing primarily on defining the drivers of change in species richness or identifying functional traits that best capture ecosystem processes. Several studies have also quantified the role of spatial variables in determining assemblage structure, a necessary first step in addressing how metacommunity interactions influence biodiversity–ecosystem processes. Overall, these early studies show that palaeolimnological approaches can address both similar and novel questions compared with contemporary ecological studies. However, palaeolimnology allows for a great expansion of the temporal scale of investigation, the quantification of rates of change to stressors and the possibility of conducting experiments by applying resurrection techniques. 4. As an emerging field, there are numerous exciting applications of palaeolimnology to biodiversity science. It is an opportune time to create synergy between contemporary aquatic ecologists and palaeolimnologists.},

  abstract = {Monitoring beaches for recreational water quality is becoming more common, but few sampling designs or policy approaches have evaluated the efficacy of monitoring programs. The authors intensively sampled water for E. coli (N=1770) at 63rd Street Beach, Chicago for 6 months in 2000 in order to (1) characterize spatial-temporal trends, (2) determine between and within transect variation, and (3) estimate sample size requirements and determine sampling reliability. E. coli counts were highly variable within and between sampling sites but spatially and diurnally autocorrelated. Variation in counts decreased with water depth and time of day. Required number of samples was high for 70\% precision around the critical closure level (i.e., 6 within or 24 between transect replicates). Since spatial replication may be cost prohibitive, composite sampling is an alternative once sources of error have been well defined. The results suggest that beach monitoring programs may be requiring too few samples to fulfill management objectives desired. As the recreational water quality national database is developed, it is important that sampling strategies are empirically derived from a thorough understanding of the sources of variation and the reliability of collected data. Greater monitoring efficacy will yield better policy decisions, risk assessments, programmatic goals, and future usefulness of the information.},

The horizontal distribution and temporal variation of bacterial indicators (total coliforms (TC), fecal coliforms (FC), enterococcus (EC) and Escherichia coli (E. coli)) were investigated to identify the proper bacterial indicators for a marine bathing beach in China. Two different sampling efforts were conducted during dry weather and two large rain events at Xinghai Bathing Beach in Dalian, China. Samples were collected from three different water depths and analyzed for the four indicator bacteria. The results indicated that all four bacterial indicators exceeded the single sample standards at different levels. Specifically, the water quality exceeded the standard for TC, FC, EC and E. coli in 7\%, 28\%, 38\% and 10\% of the samples, respectively. Comparison of the rate of the indicators before and after rainfall revealed a significant increasing post-rainfall. The concentrations of bacteria differed significantly with distance from the shoreline, with knee-depth near the shore exceeding the standard most frequently. This was primarily due to contamination by excessive sewage discharge and rainfall. Based upon the concentration of indicators and exceedance rates, as well as the correlation between indicators, both EC and FC should be evaluated at the same time as fecal pollution bacterial indicators in marine bathing beaches in China.},

Many monitoring protocols that use one or very few samples are inadequate and introduce a very large margin of error. An intensive sampling program needs to be conducted to characterize the Escherichia coli concentrations of a source water stream prior to establishing a monitoring program so that the sample frequency can be determined statistically, based on an acceptable margin of error. Developing meaningful monitoring programs for managing bacterial water quality is dependant on scientific data that determine the bacterial sources. In this study, three streams from drinking water watersheds were sampled every 15 min over a 24 h period on three different days to determine the concentrations of E. coli and to identify their sources, using ribosomal RNA finger printing (ribotyping). The concentrations of E. coli varied throughout the day in each of the three streams.

  abstract = {Many natural streams are net heterotrophic, so I propose that trophic state be divided into autotrophic and heterotrophic state. This division allows consideration of the influence of external carbon sources as well as nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. Empirical results suggest that phosphorus and nitrogen are the most important nutrients regulating autotrophic state in flowing waters and that benthic algal biomass is positively correlated to gross primary production in streams. Reference (minimally influenced by human activities) nutrient concentrations and correlations of nutrients with algal biomass are used to characterize reference distributions of stream autotrophic state. Only when reference nutrient concentrations are in the upper one third of those expected in the United States, is maximum benthic chlorophyll projected to exceed 100 mg m−2 (a concentration commonly used to indicate nuisance levels) $>$30\% of the time. Average reference nutrient concentrations lead to sestonic chlorophyll concentrations above those considered typical of eutrophic lakes ($>$8 mg m−3) less than half the time. Preliminary analysis suggests that autotrophic state is variable in small pristine streams because it is influenced by canopy cover (light), but heterotrophic state is less variable because it can be based on allochthonous or autochthonous production. Nitrogen and phosphorus enrichment can influence both heterotrophic and autotrophic state, and these effects could cascade to animal communities. Stoichiometry should be considered because carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus are all involved in trophic state. The proposed definition of trophic state offers a starting conceptual framework for such considerations.},

  abstract = {* Increasing demand for benefits provided by riverine ecosystems threatens their sustainable provision. The ecosystem service concept is a promising avenue to inform riverine ecosystem management, but several challenges have prevented the application of this concept.

* We quantitatively assess the field of riverine ecosystem services’ progress in meeting these challenges. We highlight conceptual and methodological gaps, which have impeded integration of the ecosystem service concept into management.

* Across 89 relevant studies, 33 unique riverine ecosystem services were evaluated, for a total of 404 ecosystem service quantifications. Studies quantified between 1 and 23 ecosystem services, although the majority (55\%) evaluated three or less. Among studies that quantified more than one service, 58\% assessed interactions between services. Most studies (71\%) did not include stakeholders in their quantification protocols, and 34\% developed future scenarios of ecosystem service provision. Almost half (45\%) conducted monetary valuation, using 16 methods. Only 9\% did not quantify or discuss uncertainties associated with service quantification. The indicators and methods used to quantify the same type of ecosystem service varied. Only 3\% of services used indicators of capacity, flow and demand in concert.

* Our results suggest indicators, data sources and methods for quantifying riverine ecosystem services should be more clearly defined and accurately represent the service they intend to quantify. Furthermore, more assessments of multiple services across diverse spatial extents and of riverine service interactions are needed, with better inclusion of stakeholders. Addressing these challenges will help riverine ecosystem service science inform river management.

* Synthesis and applications. The ecosystem service concept has great potential to inform riverine ecosystem management and decision-making processes. However, this review of riverine ecosystem service quantification uncovers several remaining research gaps, impeding effective use of this tool to manage riverine ecosystems. We highlight these gaps and point to studies showcasing methods that can be used to address them.},

  abstract = {The separated and combined effects of land-cover scenarios and future climate on the provision of hydrological services were evaluated in Vez watershed, northern Portugal. Soil and Water Assessment Tool was calibrated against daily discharge, sediments and nitrates, with good agreements between model predictions and field observations. Four hypothetical land-cover scenarios were applied under current climate conditions (eucalyptus/pine, oak, agriculture/vine and low vegetation). A statistical downscaling of four General Circulation Models, bias-corrected with ground observations, was carried out for 2021–2040 and 2041–2060, using representative concentration pathway 4.5 scenario. Also, the combined effects of future climate conditions were evaluated under eucalyptus/pine and agriculture/vine scenario. Results for land cover revealed that eucalyptus/pine scenario reduced by 7\% the annual water quantity and up to 17\% in the summer period. Although climate change has only a modest effect on the reduction of the total annual discharge (−7\%), the effect on the water levels during summer was more pronounced, between −15\% and −38\%. This study shows that climate change can affect the provision of hydrological services by reducing dry season flows and by increasing flood risks during the wet months. Regarding the combined effects, future climate may reduce the low flows, which can be aggravated with eucalyptus/pine scenario. In turn, peak flows and soil erosion can be offset. Future climate may increase soil erosion and nitrate concentration, which can be aggravated with agriculture scenario. Results moreover emphasize the need to consider both climate and land-cover impacts in adaptation and land management options at the watershed scale. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This review is significant given that Canada’s approach to drinking water governance is: (i) highly decentralized and (ii) discretionary. Canada is (along with Australia) only one of two Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) member states that does not comply with the World Health Organization’s (WHO) recommendation that all countries have national, legally binding drinking water quality standards. Our review identifies key differences in the regulatory approaches to drinking water quality across Canada’s 13 jurisdictions. Only 16 of the 94 CDWQG are consistently applied across all 13 jurisdictions; five jurisdictions use voluntary guidelines, whereas eight use mandatory standards. The analysis explores three questions of central importance for water managers and public health officials: (i) should standards be uniform or variable; (ii) should compliance be voluntary or legally binding; and (iii) should regulation and oversight be harmonized or delegated? We conclude with recommendations for further research, with particular reference to the relevance of our findings given the high degree of variability in drinking water management and oversight capacity between urban and rural areas in Canada.},

  abstract = {The distributions of freshwater mussels are controlled by landscape factors operating at multiple spatial scales. Changes in land use/land cover (LULC) have been implicated in severe population declines and range contractions of freshwater mussels across North America. Despite widespread recognition of multiscale influences few studies have addressed these issues when developing distribution models. Furthermore, most studies have disregarded the role of landscape pattern in regulating aquatic species distributions, focusing only on landscape composition. In this study, the distribution of Rabbitsfoot (Quadrula cylindrica) in the upper Green River system (Ohio River drainage) is modeled with environmental variables from multiple scales: subcatchment, riparian buffer, and reach buffer. Four types of landscape environment metrics are used, including: LULC pattern, LULC composition, soil composition, and geology composition. The study shows that LULC pattern metrics are very useful in modeling the distribution of Rabbitsfoot. Together with LULC compositional metrics, pattern metrics permit a more detailed analysis of functional linkages between aquatic species distributions and landscape structure. Moreover, the inclusion of multiple spatial scales is necessary to accurately model the hierarchical processes in stream systems. Geomorphic features play important roles in regulating species distributions at intermediate and large scales while LULC variables appear more influential at proximal scales.},

In this study, we conduct spatial analysis on empirical land use and land cover data in the Qinghai Lake region for 1990, 2000, and 2010 and simulate land cover patterns for 2020. We then evaluate the impacts of LULCC on ecosystem service value (ESV), and analyze the sensitivity of ESV to LULCC to identify the ecologically sensitive area. Our results indicate that, from 1990 to 2010, the area of forest and grassland increased while the area of unused land decreased. Simulation results suggest that the area of grassland and forest will continue to increase and the area of cropland and unused land will decrease for 2010-2020. The ESV in the study area increased from 694.50 billion Yuan in 1990 to 714.28 billion Yuan in 2000, and to 696.72 billion Yuan in 2020. Hydrology regulation and waste treatment are the top two ecosystem services in this region. The towns surrounding the Qinghai Lake have high ESVs, especially in the north of the Qinghai Lake. The towns with high ESV sensitivity to LULCC are located in the northwest, while the towns in the north of the Qinghai Lake experienced substantial increase in sensitivity index from 2000-2010 to 2010-2020, especially for three regulation services and aesthetic landscape provision services.},

  abstract = {I addressed the question how lake and catchment morphometry influences water chemistry and water quality over a large scale of European lakes, and developed the regression equations between most closely related morphometric and water quality indices. I analysed the data of 1,337 lakes included in the European Environment Agency (EEA) database, carrying out separate analyses for three basic lake types: large lakes (area ≥100 km2, 138 lakes), shallow lakes (mean depth ≤3 m, 153 lakes) and large and shallow lakes (area ≥100 km2 and mean depth ≤8 m, 35 lakes). The study revealed that in Europe, the lakes towards North are larger but shallower and have smaller catchment areas than the southern lakes; lakes at higher altitudes are deeper and smaller and have smaller catchment areas than the lowland lakes. Larger lakes have generally larger catchment areas and bigger volumes, and they are deeper than smaller lakes, but the relative depth decreases with increasing surface area. The lakes at higher latitudes have lower alkalinity, pH and conductivity, and also lower concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus while the concentration of organic matter is higher. In the lakes at higher altitudes, the concentration of organic matter and nutrient contents are lower and water is more transparent than in lowland lakes. In larger lakes with larger catchment area, the alkalinity, pH, conductivity and the concentrations of nutrients and organic matter are generally higher than in smaller lakes with smaller catchments. If the lake is deep and/or its residence time is long, the water is more transparent and the concentrations of chlorophyll a, organic matter and nutrients are lower than in shallower lakes with shorter residence times. The larger the catchment area is with respect to lake depth, area and volume, the lower is the water transparency and the higher are the concentrations of the nutrients, organic matter and chlorophyll as well as pH, alkalinity and conductivity. The links between lake water quality and morphometry become stronger towards large and shallow lakes. Along the decreasing gradients of latitude, altitude and relative depth, the present phosphorus concentration and its deviation from the reference concentration increases.},

  abstract = {The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) introduced a new framework for analyzing social–ecological systems that has had wide influence in the policy and scientific communities. Studies after the MA are taking up new challenges in the basic science needed to assess, project, and manage flows of ecosystem services and effects on human well-being. Yet, our ability to draw general conclusions remains limited by focus on discipline-bound sectors of the full social–ecological system. At the same time, some polices and practices intended to improve ecosystem services and human well-being are based on untested assumptions and sparse information. The people who are affected and those who provide resources are increasingly asking for evidence that interventions improve ecosystem services and human well-being. New research is needed that considers the full ensemble of processes and feedbacks, for a range of biophysical and social systems, to better understand and manage the dynamics of the relationship between humans and the ecosystems on which they rely. Such research will expand the capacity to address fundamental questions about complex social–ecological systems while evaluating assumptions of policies and practices intended to advance human well-being through improved ecosystem services.},

  abstract = {Comparison is made between general circulation model (GCM) cases with and without the inclusion of idealized Great Lakes, in the form of four rectangular bodies of water, each occupying a single grid cell of the GCM at R30 resolution. The presence of idealized Great Lakes, as opposed to land, results in a phase shift in the annual cycle of latent and sensible heat flux. Very high upward sensible heat flux occurs over these idealized Great Lakes during the early winter. On the average over a region encompassing these idealized Great Lakes, evaporation and precipitation increase during the autumn and winter and decrease during the late spring and summer due to the lakes. Annual average water vapor flux convergence increases. The Great Lakes also alter the meridional air temperature gradient. During the autumn and winter, the meridional temperature gradient is intensified to the north of the Great Lakes and diminished to the south. This intensifies the mean jet stream core and displaces it toward the north. This effect is reduced during the winter compared to the autumn because air temperature changes due to the lakes are unable to penetrate as deeply into the strongly stably stratified winter atmosphere. The increase in jet stream speed seems to increase synoptic wave activity to the northeast of the Great Lakes. As an additional experimental case, a swamp surface (saturated surface with no thermal capacity) is used to represent the Great Lakes. In this case there is little effect on the thermal state of the surface and atmosphere and on the fluxes between them. However, there is increased evaporation during the late summer and early autumn and increased precipitation throughout the summer and autumn. Annual water vapor flux convergence in this experimental case is greater than in the case with no lakes.},

  abstract = {River water quality is highly variable by nature due to environmental conditions such as basin lithology, vegetation and climate. In small watersheds spatial variations extend over orders of magnitude for most major elements and nutrients, while this variability is an order of magnitude lower for major basins. A standard river water for use as reference is therefore not applicable. As a consequence natural waters can possibly be unfit for various human uses, even including drinking. The Water Quality (WQ) concept has greatly evolved since the beginning of the century in accordance with expanding water uses and analytical developments. Even in well developed countries the dissolved heavy metal measurements in rivers are not very reliable while dissolved organic micro-pollutants are even rarely analysed routinely. Major WQ problems have been identified according to river basin size, including organic pollution, salinity, total suspended solids, heavy metals, eutrophication, nitrate, organic micro-pollutants, acidification. They generally occurred in this order over a period of about 100 years in the industrialized countries. Historical records of WQ are rare but can be established indirectly through studies of lake sediments. When proper control action is taken at an early stage, numerous examples of WQ recovery have been found in rivers for most of the common pollution problems. Future WQ problems will mostly derive from mine tailings and toxic waste disposal in both developed and developing countries, industrial accidents and organic micropollutants which emerge faster than our analytical capacities. The newly industrializing countries will face all the above-mentioned problems within a very short time period without having the means to cope with them one at a time. River studies point out the global alteration of the biogeochemical cycles of many major elements and nutrients (S, Na, K, N, P). For heavy metals such as lead, present estimates of global river loads emphasize the role of interim storage on land, thus delaying downstream pollution problems.},

  abstract = {This paper shows how to construct, within the mathematical framework of counting process theory, a Linear Extension of the Yule Process (LEYP) to model the recurrent failures of pressure pipes in water supply networks. The choice of the counting process framework is motivated by an analysis of the advantages and shortcomings of the modelling approaches proposed in the literature over the last thirty years. The parametric nature of the LEYP model enables the prediction of future failures, accounting for the effect of previous failures, pipe ageing, and explanatory factors, assuming proportional hazards. The counting process is Markovian by definition and shown to follow a negative binomial distribution. This property leads to a useful and simple formula for computing conditional predictions given past observed failures. The likelihood of the parameters with respect to a sequence of observed failures is derived using product-integration. Maximum likelihood estimates of the model parameters can be calculated with left-truncated data, i.e. failure observations restricted to a time interval that possibly starts long after pipe commissioning. Procedures for testing the significance of the model parameters, for assessing the model goodness of fit, and for validating the model predictions are presented. The predictive performance of the LEYP model is finally illustrated with extensive failure data provided by a French water utility.},

Their efforts are discussed in many literatures and articles but are not summarised by one document. In this report, more than 50 articles were reviewed from the last decade and are presented based on the type of methodology utilised. Nine utilities across the world with significant undertakings of water pipe infrastructure management are also presented which underline the current practice. In summary, both the literature and current practice are summarised to identify the gap between the models found in literature and water utility asset management practices.},

  abstract = {This data compilation synthesizes 8609 individual observations and ranges of 13 traits from 201 freshwater and 191 marine crustacean taxa belonging to either Copepoda or Cladocera, two important zooplankton groups across all major aquatic habitats. Most data were gathered from the literature, with the balance being provided by zooplankton ecologists. With the aim of more fully assessing zooplankton effects on elemental processes such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and carbon (C) stocks and fluxes in aquatic ecosystems, this data set provides information on the following traits: body size (length and mass), trophic group, elemental and biochemical corporal composition (N, P, C, lipid and protein content), respiration rates, N- and P-excretion rates, as well as stoichiometric ratios. Although relationships for zooplankton metabolism as a function of body mass or requirements have been explored in the past three decades, data have not been systematically compiled nor examined from an integrative and large-scale perspective across crustacean taxa and habitat types. While this contribution likely represents the most comprehensive such assembly of traits for both marine and freshwater species, this data set is not exhaustive either. As a result, this compilation also identifies knowledge gaps; a fact that should encourage researchers to disclose information they may have to help complete such databases. This trait matrix is made available for the first time in this data paper; prior to its release, the data set has been analyzed in a meta-analysis published as a companion paper (Hébert et al. in press). These data should prove extremely valuable for aquatic ecologists for trait-based characterization of plankton community structure as well as biogeochemical modeling. These data are also well-suited for deriving shortcut relationships that predict more difficult to measure trait values, most of which can be directly related to ecosystem properties (i.e., effect traits), from simpler traits (e.g., body size), and for exploring patterns of trait variation within and amongst taxonomic units or ecosystem types. Overall, this data set is likely to provide new insights into the functional structure of zooplankton communities and increase our mechanistic understanding of the influence of these pivotal organisms on aquatic ecosystems.

The two disciplines were not always so different, and are recently converging again at regional spatial scales and broad temporal scales. In order to avoid confusion and to hasten progress at the converging margins of each discipline, the following papers were presented at a symposium in the International Biogeography Society's 2011 meeting, and are now published in this issue of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B. In a novel approach, groups of authors were paired to represent biogeographic and ecological perspectives on each of four topics: niche, comparative ecology and macroecology, community assembly, and diversity. Collectively, this compilation identifies points of agreement and disagreement between the two views on these central topics, and points to future research directions that may build on agreements and reconcile differences. We conclude this compilation with an overview on the integration of biogeography and ecology.},

  abstract = {Although ecology and biogeography had common origins in the natural history of the nineteenth century, they diverged substantially during the early twentieth century as ecology became increasingly hypothesis-driven and experimental. This mechanistic focus narrowed ecology's purview to local scales of time and space, and mostly excluded large-scale phenomena and historical explanations. In parallel, biogeography became more analytical with the acceptance of plate tectonics and the development of phylogenetic systematics, and began to pay more attention to ecological factors that influence large-scale distributions. This trend towards unification exposed problems with terms such as ‘community’ and ‘niche,’ in part because ecologists began to view ecological communities as open systems within the contexts of history and geography. The papers in this issue represent biogeographic and ecological perspectives and address the general themes of (i) the niche, (ii) comparative ecology and macroecology, (iii) community assembly, and (iv) diversity. The integration of ecology and biogeography clearly is a natural undertaking that is based on evolutionary biology, has developed its own momentum, and which promises novel, synthetic approaches to investigating ecological systems and their variation over the surface of the Earth. We offer suggestions on future research directions at the intersection of biogeography and ecology.},

  abstract = {Goal, Scope and BackgroundHumans now strongly influence almost every major aquatic ecosystem, and their activities have dramatically altered the fluxes of growth-limiting nutrients from the landscape to receiving waters. Unfortunately, these nutrient inputs have had profound negative effects upon the quality of surface waters worldwide. This review examines how eutrophication influences the biomass and species composition of algae in both freshwater and costal marine systems.Main FeaturesAn overview of recent advances in algae-related eutrophication research is presented. In freshwater systems, a summary is presented for lakes and reservoirs; streams and rivers; and wetlands. A brief summary is also presented for estuarine and coastal marine ecosystems.ResultsEutrophication causes predictable increases in the biomass of algae in lakes and reservoirs; streams and rivers; wetlands; and coastal marine ecosystems. As in lakes, the response of suspended algae in large rivers to changes in nutrient loading may be hysteretic in some cases. The inhibitory effects of high concentrations of inorganic suspended solids on algal growth, which can be very evident in many reservoirs receiving high inputs of suspended soils, also potentially may occur in turbid rivers. Consistent and predictable eutrophication-caused increases in cyanobacterial dominance of phytoplankton have been reported worldwide for natural lakes, and similar trends are reported here both for phytoplankton in turbid reservoirs, and for suspended algae in a large river.ConclusionsA remarkable unity is evident in the global response of algal biomass to nitrogen and phosphorus availability in lakes and reservoirs; wetlands; streams and rivers; and coastal marine waters. The species composition of algal communities inhabiting the water column appears to respond similarly to nutrient loading, whether in lakes, reservoirs, or rivers. As is true of freshwater ecosystems, the recent literature suggests that coastal marine ecosystems will respond positively to nutrient loading control efforts.Recommendations and OutlookOur understanding of freshwater eutrophication and its effects on algal-related water quality is strong and is advancing rapidly. However, our understanding of the effects of eutrophication on estuarine and coastal marine ecosystems is much more limited, and this gap represents an important future research need. Although coastal systems can be hydrologically complex, the biomass of marine phytoplankton nonetheless appears to respond sensitively and predictably to changes in the external supplies of nitrogen and phosphorus. These responses suggest that efforts to manage nutrient inputs to the seas will result in significant improvements in coastal zone water quality. Additional new efforts should be made to develop models that quantitatively link ecosystem-level responses to nutrient loading in both freshwater and marine systems.},

  abstract = {The first special volume of Limnology and Oceanography, published in 1972, focused on whether phosphorus (P) or carbon (C) is the major agent causing eutrophication in aquatic ecosystems. Only slight mention was made that estuaries may behave differently from lakes and that nitrogen (N) may cause eutrophication in estuaries. In the following decade, an understanding of eutrophication in estuaries proceeded in relative isolation from the community of scientists studying lakes. National water quality policy in the United States was directed almost solely toward P control for both lakes and estuaries, and similarly, European nations tended to focus on P control in lakes. Although bioassay data indicated N control of eutrophication in estuaries as early as the 1970s, this body of knowledge was treated with skepticism by many freshwater scientists and water-quality managers, because bioassay data in lakes often did not properly indicate the importance of P relative to C in those ecosystems. Hence, the bioassay data in estuaries had little influence on water-quality management. Over the past two decades, a strong consensus has evolved among the scientific community that N is the primary cause of eutrophication in many coastal ecosystems. The development of this consensus was based in part on data from whole-ecosystem studies and on a growing body of evidence that presented convincing mechanistic reasons why the controls of eutrophication in lakes and coastal marine ecosystems may differ. Even though N is probably the major cause of eutrophication in most coastal systems in the temperate zone, optimal management of coastal eutrophication suggests controlling both N and P, in part because P can limit primary production in some systems. In addition, excess P in estuaries can interact with the availability of N and silica (Si) to adversely affect ecological structure. Reduction of P to upstream freshwater ecosystems can also benefit coastal marine ecosystems through mechanisms such as increased Si fluxes.},
